Incredible gains this year from unlikely companies. Let's dive in to find out right now on Motley Fool Money. I'm Rick Munarriz, and today I'm joined by fellow analyst Alicia Alfiere and Jason Hall with a look at what's eating at restaurant stocks this summer. We'll also look at some of the more surprising companies that have more than doubled this year. But first, it's still earning season. A lot of familiar names are stepping up with fresh financials this week. A lot of obscure ones, too, of course. I want to go around the room to see if there's a company that has your eye, if not your heart, reporting quarterly results this week. Let's start with you, Jason.\nJason Hall: TJX companies, it's definitely got my eye, a little bit of my heart, but none of my wallet yet because of valuation, but TJX companies, the parent company of TJ Max, Marshalls, HomeGoods, other clothing and home furnishing retailers, reports Wednesday morning, and I'll be honest with you, Rick. I think besides Costco, TJX may be the best retailer in the US. It is exceptional at two really important things. The one that doesn't get enough credit from the average person or investor is how good of a buyer it is. It's like the release valve for excess inventory, for manufacturers, other retailers, and distributors, it's really good at getting great deals on the cost side of buying that. But here's the thing. The actual hardest part is getting that merchandise in the right stores and the right markets to move it quickly and then turn it into more cash than it paid for it. It's exceptional if that part of its business model is the treasure hunt experience. They cater both to people that have plenty of extra disposable income that are looking for that great deal, but also just to regular people that are looking for value for name brand products at extremely low cost. That combined expertise is a savvy buyer and extremely efficient retail operator results in great margins. It keeps customers coming in across economic environments. If you look last quarter, comps were up 3%. As customers are spending more money, you look at most of the competition in discount retail, you see the other thing, comps are shrinking, people are coming in less and spending less. I'm really interested to see if TJX can continue in operating so well in what's really a challenging environment for discount retail.\nAlicia Alfiere: Well, so I have a question for you, Jason, on TJX. With the economic uncertainty looming, do you think we're going to see more value shoppers going to TJX to look to find these deals, or do you think these value shoppers are going to be staying home?\nJason Hall: I think it's going to do well. I think what we'll see is what we've seen from it in the past, and that is people whose personal finance situation is still fine are going to continue to go there more instead of maybe shopping upstream. They're going to come downstream, whether they have to or not, they're going to choose to because of sentiment. That's probably going to offset some of the other customers that are just truly having to pull back. Its strength as a buyer is going to be a really good situation for it. Particularly if we see tariffs do weird things with inventory levels, they're not going to mess around. They're going to take advantage of that opportunity. I think even if maybe they don't grow as fast, they're definitely going to prove how resilient their business model is.\nRick Munarriz: Alicia, what you got?\nAlicia Alfiere: Well, so this week, I'm excited to see what is going on with Viking Holdings. It's a company that's close to my heart because my dad, who just turned 70, has wanted to do a European river cruise for a really long time. Viking is smaller than other cruise companies. But it's the top dog in the North American outbound River Cruise market. It's got a strong brand that ranks highly among the affluent 55 older crowd, which Viking believes has been mostly underserved in the cruise industry with the exception of them. By the end of their first quarter, Viking already had 92% of their 2025 capacity booked, so I'm excited to see what comes next for them.\nRick Munarriz: I'm a fan of Viking, too. Probably like your dad. I've looked at these cruises. They are not cheap. River Cruises are not your basically carnival big chip with a lot of people and a lot of low prices. Are they susceptible to an economic downturn?\nAlicia Alfiere: That's a good question. I think because their focus is so much on this retiree community of 55 and older, Grant, it'd be wonderful to retire at 55. But people that tend to be affluent and retired, I think they have less of a risk, but as with anything that's discretionary, they can potentially take a hit with economic uncertainty.\nRick Munarriz: Yeah, thanks. I'm going to go with Baidu. B-A-I-D-U, the company behind China's leading search engine, is going through some growing pains. Revenue has declined in half of the last six years, and Baidu delivered double-digit top-line growth just one of those years. Expectations are low heading into this week's results. Analysts see a 3% year-over-year decline in revenue on a sharp slide in profitability. It's not a good look, but Baidu has come through with double-digit percentage beats on the bottom line and back-to-back quarters. It's also been toiling away in AI, cloud computing, and autonomous driving long before those areas were cool. Those are bets that will pay off over time. In the meantime, you can buy a cash-rich Baidu for less than ten times next year's targets. Baidu.\nJason Hall: Thinking about those next bet things, Rick, do you think Baidu is one of the companies that's going to be able to continue to innovate, even as the Chinese market continues to be challenged with access to the best chips for AI?\nRick Munarriz: Obviously, the whole AI revolution in China has this whole thing happening right now, caught in the tariff war. I do think that whether they go out on their own or they find ways to do it. Baidu has offices, even in the US. They have places they have intel all over the world. It's not just purely Chinese company. I think they will figure it out. And right now, it's just a very competitive environment, which is why so many companies are Baidu struggling because so many other companies are also struggling to stand out in this environment. Baidu and TJX report on Wednesday morning. Viking disembarks on Tuesday morning. Companies keep earning, we keep learning. Coming up next, Hamburger Helper, what's going on with restaurant stocks? Hungry for more OrderUp.\nIt's been a challenging summer for restaurant stocks, particularly rule-breaker chains. Cava took a 17% hit on a single trading day last week after posting disappointing comparable restaurant sales. We saw Wingstop, SweetGreen, and even Chipotle deliver negative comps. What's burning in the kitchen? Let's dig in. Alicia.\nAlicia Alfiere: Well, so it looks like the economy is taking a bite out of consumers' desire to dine out, or at the very least, it's making them a lot more price aware. If we look at Chipotle, which is an old school Rule Breaker, in its last quarter, comparable sales fell 4% year over year, and that's a big difference from last year when comparable sales grew 11% year over year. Chipotle talked about how much their traffic has been tracking along with consumer sentiment, and management believes that some consumers are making eating decisions based on price right now. They also mentioned some of their competitors have $5 meals, and they believe that's where a lot of the consumers are heading. Speaking of $5 meals, let's talk about McDonald's. Unlike Chipotle and some other restaurant chains that saw same-store sales declines, McDonald's saw its global comparable sales grow 3.8%, and that's a big improvement from last year when the company's comparable sales fell 1%. By the way, McDonald's saw sales growth in all of their world regions, and McDonald's knows that its affordability was a major driver for its performance and says that the $5 meal deal continues to be a hit, and the company also realizes that the 299 price point, they sell snack wraps for that looks to be attractive to consumers as well. But even with their performance this quarter, McDonald's is still cautious about upcoming quarters and the US consumer. But even they commented that visits from lower-income consumers who tend to eat at McDonald's more than other groups have declined, and the company believes that it'll be really important for them to reengage with these customers. One of the things that they talked about is working with their US franchisees to look at the core menu pricing, but they do have to be careful here. Too many cuts, and McDonald's will be buying their revenue by potentially sacrificing profitability.\nRick Munarriz: Just a couple of days ago, I spent $16 on a McDonald Land adult kids meal. It's basically this thing comes with, like, a grimace shake. It comes with a Tin collectible with a little toy with a card game. It seems like McDonalds playing both the low end and the high end. Does that Barbell pricing? Does that sound like it's a good strategy for you, or is that a problem?\nAlicia Alfiere: Well, I do think that it's smart to try to hit multiple sides of the consumer continuum, as opposed to really just targeting one group. I think that can help make their revenues less lumpy when we go into different parts of the economic cycle.\nRick Munarriz: Ba da, da, da, da, I'm loving it. So, Jason, your thoughts?\nJason Hall: $16 when I was a kid, that'd feed a family of four at McDonald's, and everybody would get soft serve ice cream. It's remarkable how that's changed. I'll say this. I think the interesting thing to me, like, the observation as an investor, it's across the sector. It's a lot of what we're seeing a specialty and discount retail, too. It's a clear consumer trend. Consumers are starting to pull back in some areas. And as an investor, honestly, that makes me a little bit more interested and less concerned about individual companies because it means we're less likely to have a company that's struggling in a good market. The market is down and it's weak, and I start looking more closely when negative sentiment like that is happening, especially if it drives stock prices down because it could create some opportunities for investors to buy some really great quality businesses that have strong track records over the long term, and then just hold while the market collapse and we return back to a healthy market at some point in future quarters or even future years, that's one of the ways that long term investors can juice their portfolios and really win over the long term.\nRick Munarriz: Basically, the business models aren't broken, just the consumer sentiment is what needs to temporarily come back in some capacity.\nJason Hall: That's exactly what it looks like to me.\nRick Munarriz: Perfect. When we get back from the break, we'll have fun with some of this year's hottest stocks. Stay with us. We ordered a cake.\nFinally, there have been some very surprising stocks that have more than doubled this year. I'm going to play a little game with you guys called beat or defeat. I want you guys to tell me beat, if you think they can continue to beat the market for the rest of the year, the next 4.5 months or so, or defeat, if you think that they're going to actually return back to their norms to improve modals. Don't overthink it. We're going to go over three stocks. The first one, Rule Breaker, Roblox. It's up 117% through Thursday's close, move lower on Friday. But right now, Jason, beat or defeat.\nJason Hall: Going to say defeat. Now, in the news right now, there's some things with Louisiana is suing Roblox over some concerns about things with child safety. We won't get into that. But I think looking beyond that, what I see with Roblox right now it was a great business with some really good growth right now, but it just seems like the valuation metrics don't necessarily support a continued run 19 times sales. They lost about $500 million over the trading 12 months, and $500 million of that was stock-based compensation. It's just going to be hard to continue that run at this valuation. I think we're more likely to sell some profit taking before the end of the year that maybe undermines a little bit of that great results that we've had.\nRick Munarriz: Alicia?\nAlicia Alfiere: I think this one is tricky. I think the Louisiana Attorney General suing Roblox alleging the platform doesn't do enough to protect minors. I think if that's true, that's a big problem. But if Roblox can solve this issue, I think it's actually a good candidate to beat. We've got really impressive metrics happening here, average daily users up 41% year over year, hours of engagement up 58% year over year.\nJason Hall: The bookings numbers are incredible.\nRick Munarriz: So let's look at Palantir, up 139% this year. Jason, start us off.\nJason Hall: Are you sure you want me to start here? I've bought Puts. I'm actually shorting Palantir via puts. They're very long-term, like multiple years out. I'm going to say that now. I'm making a multiple-year bet that the stock is going to decline. Between now and the end of the year, I think that we could start to see some of that happen. Let me say this. I think it is an extraordinary business. But the valuation, I said, Rule Breakers is expensive. Palantir makes Rule Breakers look like a jalapeño. It is incredibly expensive, and the expectations, I think it becomes so dislodged from what the business can realistically do an incredible business can do that I think it's going to struggle, and I think it's going to be defeated by the market.\nRick Munarriz: Alicia,\nAlicia Alfiere: I agree with Jason here. Last quarter was impressive. Revenues up 48%, cash generating business, management raised guidance. But, wow, it's valuation. Price to sales above 100?\nRick Munarriz: Price to salespeople price to sales.\nAlicia Alfiere: Right, price to sales. We're not even talking price-to-earnings or anything like that. Priced beyond perfection, defeat.\nRick Munarriz: Finally, let's close with former Rule Breaker Celsius up 150%. Alicia, I'll start with you.\nAlicia Alfiere: It's acquisition of Alani Nu seems to be helping Celsius, and the top line really accelerated this last quarter. Again, partially due to that acquisition. It has momentum, so I'm thinking it'll be, but anyone who has been watching this stock over the last little bit knows it's been a roller coaster, and it could just as easily fall into that defeat category.\nJason Hall: Even as much as the stock has come up, I think the market is still has really low expectations for the business. The Pepsi distribution deal was great until it wasn't. That's a challenge. The core Celsius brands have been pretty flattish. International market is really wide open. Alani Nu expands them and really gives them a lot of control over that cohort of the market where they're really dominant. I think of these three, this is the one that's most likely to beat, so I'm going to say I think it'll be.\nRick Munarriz: Alright, great.

Including the $2.2 billion CHIPS Act grant Intel has already received, the deal puts the government's investment in Intel at $11.1 billion.\nTrump's post on Monday comes about an hour after Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, that the administration will continue to look to make similar investments across industries.\nIn an interview on CNBC, Hassett said, \"the president has made it clear all the way back to the campaign, he thinks that in the end, it would be great if the US could start to build up a sovereign wealth fund.\n\"So I’m sure that at some point there’ll be more transactions, if not in this industry then other industries.\nOn Friday, Intel stock rose 5% on reports the government was preparing to take a 10% stake in the chipmaker, which has fallen behind its peers during the AI boom.

She went to a temp agency for a receptionist job. She did well on the test, so the agency sent her to its best client, a national mortgage lender.\n“I was only supposed to be there for three months,” she said. She stayed for 13 years.\nEarly on, one of Woulf’s colleagues sat her down. “They knew I was just a single mom and trying to work hard,” she said. The mentor told her about the company’s 401(k) program.\n“They said, ‘One day you might have a million dollars.’ And I said, ‘A million dollars?’ And it seemed impossible.”\nWoulf opened a retirement savings account in 1990. Thirty-five years later, she has a million dollars.\nBefore her retirement in 2021, Woulf joined the growing ranks of 401(k) millionaires, Americans who attain a seven-figure balance in a workplace retirement plan, an Individual Retirement Account, or some combination of the two.\nRoughly 2% of retirement savers have million-dollar balances, according to Fidelity, which reported 512,000 401(k) millionaires as of early 2025. The figure covers only Fidelity account holders.\nSaving $1million in a 401(k) sounds easy. It isn’t.\nBased on the stories of six 401(k) millionaires profiled below, saving $1 million for retirement sounds easy. If everyone opened a 401(k) account at age 22, set aside 10% of their pre-tax income and saved continuously until retirement, we might be a nation of 401(k) millionaires.\nBut life is seldom so simple. Lots of us don’t start saving for retirement until midlife, when retirement is breathing down our necks. Millions of Americans step out of the workforce to raise children and put retirement savings on hold. Others change jobs and lose track of their retirement accounts. Financial crises compel many people to raid their retirement plans.\nAnd many retirement savers don’t save enough.\nUSA TODAY compiled this report from interviews and correspondence with dozens of retirement savers contacted through the Reddit community r\/retirement.\nWhen Woulf opened her retirement savings account, she was saving only 3% of her pre-tax salary, because her employer matched that amount dollar for dollar, and it was all the salary she could spare. She was earning $8 an hour.\n“I was living paycheck to paycheck, but I did it, because I thought I was investing in my future and my son’s future,” she said. “I had to forego things like cable TV. I would take my son camping instead of taking trips.”\nAs time passed, Woulf stopped noticing the deductions from her paychecks. She earned a series of promotions: first to customer service representative, then to credit risk analyst. As her salary rose, Woulf increased her contributions.\nOver the years, Woulf changed employers. At age 50, she raised her retirement contribution to the maximum allowed by law.\nBy the time Woulf retired, she was a 401(k) millionaire. She is 58 now and living in Simi Valley, California. Woulf had married at age 42, and her husband was also a good saver. Her financial adviser said she had plenty of money and could afford to stop working.\n“We’re living off the interest and not even cutting into the principal at this point,” she said.\nHere’s how much to save in a 401(k)\nRetirement planners generally recommend two savings goals with 401(k) plans.\nAt a minimum, they say, you should try to save as much as your employer is willing to match.\nIn a typical model, the employer matches half of every dollar a worker contributes, up to a maximum of 6% of the worker’s pay. If you contribute 6%, the match boosts it to 9%. If the employer matches that salary dollar for dollar, 6% becomes 12%.\nIdeally, retirement savers should aim to save at least 10% of their pre-tax salary. With a generous employer match, 10% can easily become 15%. That figure, 15%, is the ultimate 401(k) savings goal.\nWhen Joy El-Amin went to work for the Apple computer company in the 1980s, at age 22, she opened a 401(k). She had heard the goal was to save 15% of your salary, so she did.\nBut El-Amin had misread the retirement savings rule. The 15% goal includes the matching funds your employer offers. She thought you had to invest 15% of your own salary.\nThat misapprehension served her well. After Apple’s employer match, El-Amin was setting aside 21% of her pre-tax salary. She didn’t realize she was exceeding the savings goal until three years ago.\nToday, at age 60, the Atlanta resident has $1.45 million in retirement savings from more than three decades of work. The total is all the more impressive considering El-Amin took eight years off to raise her children. Even then, she made regular contributions to an IRA from a part-time real estate business.\nAs a younger member of the baby boom, born in the mid-60s, El-Amin said she knew she was part of the “big 401(k) experiment: Can people save for their own retirement?”\nAs workplace pensions faded in the 1980s and 1990s, retirement savings pivoted to 401(k) and IRAs, and employees were expected to create their own post-employment financial cushions.\n“It’s all on you,” she said. “There’s no one coming to save you.”\nThe ultimate retirement goal: Max out your 401(k)\nThe ultimate goal in retirement savings, for those who can afford it, is to push your contributions to the legal limit. The maximum allowable contribution to a 401(k) account is $23,500 in 2025 for most employees. If you’re willing to part with that much salary, you can save a lot of money in a very short time.\nBut if you spend two or three decades continuously saving for retirement, even with smaller contributions, your odds of becoming a 401(k) millionaire improve dramatically.\nThe reason is the stock market, which has delivered average annual returns over 10% in the past several decades. In an example provided by Investopedia, $100 invested in 1957 would be worth $82,000 in 2025.\nAs a young engineer in Silicon Valley, Richard Eckman saw an ad for Fidelity Investments. It showed a woman biting into a big slice of pizza. In 35 years, the ad said, this pizza will be worth $14,800.\nHe decided, then and there, to get serious about his 401(k).\nEckman, from Rockford, Illinois, had finished college in 1984. He was a mechanical engineer, and the only jobs were on the West Coast. He drove to Mountain View, California, with $200 borrowed from his dad, and he took a job working on semiconductors.\nHis starting salary was $34,000, which was good for the time. He opened a 401(k). When he saw the pizza ad, he raised his contribution rate to 15% of his income. The employer matched the first 3%.\n“I think I inherited this idea from my father that saving money was just another bill that had to be paid, but you were paying yourself,” he said. “And sometimes there would not be food in the fridge, because I was so obsessed with saving, but I never backed off.”\nEckman changed employers over the years and progressed into sales engineering, a job that combines technical knowledge and sales skills. But he never missed a year of retirement saving.\nTwo pieces of “dumb luck,” he said, helped push him into the ranks of 401(k) millionaires. The first came in 2008: He was changing brokers, so he moved all of his retirement savings into cash. Before he had reinvested it, the market crashed. He reinvested when the stock market was down 40% from its peak, effectively avoiding the Great Recession.\nThe second episode wasn’t just luck. In 2013, Eckman was standing in line at Costco, fuming about how long it was.\n“So, I went home and I bought 100 shares of Costco,” he said. “The next month, the lines were longer, and I bought 100 more shares.”\nCostco became Eckman’s first 10x stock − multiplying tenfold in value.\nAnd Eckman avoided some of the financial calamities that befall many other retirement savers, like spending a long time out of the job market or plundering his account to cover an emergency.\n“There was no devastating divorce,” he said. “There were no disasters. No medical problems. No relatives in dire straits. So, I guess some of the good luck is there.”\nEckman retired a month before his 59th birthday, after training his replacement. Now 62 and living in San Jose, he’s building a modest second home in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada and making wine, 800 bottles a year for friends and family.\n“I realized I can make more money, and it wouldn’t matter,” he said. “But I can’t make more time.”\nNot all 401(k) millionaires have six-figure salaries\nMary Woulf, Joy El-Amin and Richard Eckman all became 401(k) millionaires without doctor or lawyer salaries.\nElisa Brown, 49, of Amarillo, Texas, became a 401(k) millionaire without ever earning six figures.\nBrown started her career in 2000 as a flight attendant with Southwest Airlines, “a naive 24-year-old that basically just wanted to fly for free,” she said.\nAn old college friend asked if the airline offered a 401(k). Yes, she replied, but not until she had worked there for a year. OK, he told her: When you become eligible, open an account and contribute as much of your salary as the company would match.\nSouthwest Airlines offered a dollar-for-dollar match on 401(k) contributions up to 7.3% of Brown’s salary. After a year, she opened an account. She thinks she started at 8% of her pre-tax pay. Later on, she raised her contributions to 10%.\n“Out of sight, out of mind,” she said. “I never saw it. It just continued to grow.”\nTwenty-five years later, the balance has flown past $1 million.\nBrown’s starting salary at Southwest was less than $20,000. She has never earned more than $100,000.\nShe became a 401(k) millionaire because of three things: Her employer’s generous match, which amplified the value of her contributions; stock market index funds, which track the performance of the market as a whole; and a quarter-century of continuous contributions.\nAnd this: Brown never touched her retirement account.\n“Doing nothing is doing something,” she said.\nBrown eventually married the old college friend. Today, he is also a 401(k) millionaire. Together, they’re worth twice that much.\n“We don’t keep up with the Joneses,” Brown said, summarizing their approach to money. She says she grew up poor, and she knows how to economize.\n“Our net worth is over $2 million, and I went to the thrift store today.”\nTo make $1m in a 401(k), it helps to stay put\nIf you want to become a 401(k) millionaire, it helps to spend your whole career at the same company, as Brown did.\nMore than $1.7 trillion sits in lost or forgotten 401(k) accounts, often because a worker left a job and forgot to take the savings with them.\nIt also helps if your company offers a retirement savings program in the first place. Nearly half of private-sector employees work for companies that do not offer retirement savings, according to AARP.\nBruce Scott of Covina, California, was fortunate enough to spend his entire career at a large company with a solid 401(k) plan.\nWhen Scott went to work for Pacific Bell in 1991, the employee union told him about the company’s workplace retirement plan.\nScott opened a 401(k) account, but he didn’t feel he could spare even 5% of his paycheck, which the phone company would have matched. Scott was earning $37,000 a year.\n“I was married, had two small children,” he said. “At that point in my life, I had just gotten out of the Army, was looking to establish myself.”\nInstead, Scott made himself a promise: Every time he got a pay raise, he’d divert some of it to his 401(k).\nThe pay raises came, and each time, Scott boosted his contribution rate by 1% or 2%. Eventually, he was contributing 16% of his salary. With the company match, his total savings rate was 22%.\nThirty-one years later, when Scott retired from Pacific Bell, his 401(k) was worth $550,000. He cashed out his pension, which was worth another $545,000, and – voilà – he was a 401(k) millionaire.\nHe credits his union, which staged regular expert presentations on retirement saving for Pac Bell employees.\n“The earlier you start planning, the more education you get, the less scary it is, and the more control you’re gonna feel over the decision when it comes,” he said of his retirement. “Starting early is the biggest thing.”\nThink of a 401(k) as money for your future self\nOne reason why so few Americans become 401(k) millionaires is the temptation to raid a retirement account for an emergency, or for an everyday expense.\nThe share of Vanguard retirement savers who make “hardship” withdrawals has nearly tripled in four years, from 1.7% in 2020 to 4.8% in 2024, the company reports.\nIf you want to avoid that urge, retirement planners say, it helps to think of the money as belonging to someone else: Not you, but the future you.\nJackie Borja of Los Angeles opened an IRA when she was 22. The inspiration came from her mom, who told her she should be putting money away.\nBorja’s mother was a billing clerk, her father an industrial tools salesman. They kept cars for 20 years and never, ever bought a new TV. They opened savings accounts for their children. Jackie would marvel as her savings grew every year from birthday money.\nAt 26, Borja got a job as a high school counselor, which gave her access to a 403(b), the public-employee version of a 401(k). Now, she had two retirement accounts. She maxed them out, contributing as much as she was allowed.\n“The amount started growing over time,” Borja said. “But my mindset was that it was not my money.”\nBy maxing out her contributions to two retirement accounts, Borja was able to amass $1 million in retirement savings in about 20 years, all on a high school counselor’s salary.\n“You need to start early,” she said.\nBorja retired last year, at 55. Now 56, she has retirement money to burn. She will draw a school system pension at 62. She’ll also get full Social Security, when the time comes, thanks to a recent law change.\nAt some point, she may even start thinking of the money as hers.\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: These 6 Americans are 401(k) millionaires.

That includes standard expenses, including:\n- Basic service: $2,495\n- Transfer of remains: $395\n- Metal casket: $2,500\n- Embalming: $845\n- Body preparation: $295\n- Facility use for viewing and ceremony: $1,025\n- Hearse usage: $375\n- Service car\/van: $175\n- Printing packages: $195\nThe NFDA's pricing doesn't include cemetery fees, however, as some states don't allow funeral homes to own or operate a cemetery. These charges include:\n- Cemetery plot: $1,000 to $4,500\n- Headstone: $1,000 to $3,000\n- Burial vault: $1,000\n- Opening and closing the grave: $1,000 to $2,500\nMany cemeteries also charge an ongoing maintenance fee to ensure the upkeep of the grounds and the individual plot. The cost of this \"perpetual care\" or \"endowment care\" varies greatly, but is usually a percentage of the plot price or a flat annual fee.\nHow much is a funeral with cremation?\nWhile it includes some of the same expenses, cremation is a more affordable option than burial.

Its all-access plan includes a digital storage vault through Everplans.\n$109 to $219, ($39 per year to make changes after the first year)\nFactors that can impact the cost of a funeral\nThe average cost of a funeral is just that, an average, said funeral director Jimmy Olson, who has owned Olson Funeral Home and Cremation Service in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, for 25 years.\n\"Every funeral is about that individual,\" Olson added. \"We want to personalize and make that funeral as personal as possible.\"\nA headstone can run anywhere from $1,000 to $3,000, but the size, material and engraving will affect the final price.\nCasket selection is another major factor, according to Jack Mitchell, a third-generation funeral director at Mitchell-Wiedefeld Funeral Home in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\"There's great variation,\" Mitchell said. \"Our prices range from just under $2,000 to over $7,000, but there are caskets out there for over $10,000.\"\nThat may seem steep, but Mitchell added, \"to many people, the casket has great [importance] and that's what they want to do for their loved one.\"\nA cremation urn is less expensive, but still a very personal matter. Olson recalled one family requesting that the departed, a creamery owner, be deposited in an ice cream carton.\n\"If that's what they want, that's what we're going to do,\" he said. \"Just recently, I put someone in his cowboy boots.\"\nSome funeral expenses aren't negotiable, though, including transporting the body, reserving the facility and booking the service. These can add up to nearly $4,000, which might give people sticker shock.\nBut, Olson says, a lot of work goes on behind the scenes.\n\"I pay someone to be on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week,\" he said. \"People don't just magically get transferred from their house or the hospital. We go get them. We'll go out at two o'clock in the morning. We go to accident scenes, to trauma scenes, to the home or the hospice facility.\"\nBeyond handling the body, his team has to be ready to provide comfort and answer questions.\n\"We don't wait until office hours at 9 a.m.,\" Olson said, \"Families are sitting there, wanting to talk to us.\"\nA funeral home also takes care of the death certificate, writes the obituary, organizes clothing and makeup for the deceased and manages everything else that happens between death and interment.\nThe importance of planning ahead\nA majority of funeral homes allow you to prepay for selected services. You'll sit down with the funeral director, make your selections and put money into a trust for when the day comes.\nMany people think their life insurance policy will cover the costs of a funeral. In fact, final expense insurance is designed for that very purpose.\nBut it could be some time before those funds become available.\n\"If you have a life insurance policy, the average time till you're paid is four to six to eight weeks,\" Olson said. \"You've got the funeral home charges, the cemetery plot, the minister, the organist, the newspaper notices and the death certificate. These all have to be paid before the funeral.\"\nOlsen and Mitchell agree that preplanning is the best way to make a funeral more manageable, both financially and emotionally. You'll have the chance to compare prices and lock in prices. You'll also decide what's important, taking a huge burden off grieving loved ones.\nPreplanning is also a time to inform everyone about any arrangements made in advance.\n\"Maybe your grandpa bought 12 graves 50 years ago and you've got a family plot,\" Olson said. \"So you'll just have to pay the opening and closing costs. Or, maybe those costs are prepaid, too.\nPerhaps, most importantly, preplanning helps you digest the situation calmly and make a more rational decision.\n\"Every day I hear, 'Just put me in a coffee can,' or, 'Throw me in an old pine box,'\" Olson said. \"Then I show them the pine box and they're like, 'That's not what we want.\"\n\"People joke about it because they're uncomfortable,\" he added, \"but it's a conversation that has to happen.\"\nFuneral FAQs\nHow much does the average funeral cost?\nAccording to the National Funeral Directors Association's 2023 price list, the median cost of a funeral with burial and viewing was $8,300 in 2023, up from $7,848 in 2021, an increase of 5.8%.\nCan I use life insurance to pay for a funeral?\nLife insurance pays a lump sum to beneficiaries named in the policy. This money can be used any way they see fit, including paying for a funeral. In fact, there are burial insurance policies specifically for this purpose that pay out. between $5,000 and $25,000.\nHowever, a policy can take weeks to be processed, and many funeral expenses need to be paid up front. So, you'll have to have enough funds on hand to cover expenses while you wait for the death benefit to pay out.\nIs $10,000 enough for a funeral?\nThe median price for a funeral with burial in 2023 was $8,300, not including the plot, vault and opening and closing the grave, which can add another $3,000 or more. Depending on where the funeral is taking place, $10,000 may not be sufficient.\nThe median price for a cremation is a little less than $6,300, however. So $10,000 would likely cover the cost.\nMoney matters — so make the most of it. Get expert tips, strategies, news and everything else you need to maximize your money, right to your inbox.

But the game has now changed, according to some of the industry’s most prominent executives at the SALT conference in Jackson Hole earlier this week.\nThe rise of exchange-traded funds, surging demand for power, and the prospect of artificial intelligence (AI) reshaping infrastructure needs mean that miners must find ways to diversify or risk being left behind.\n“We used to come here and talk about hash rate,” said Matt Schultz, CEO of Cleanspark. “Now we’re talking about how to monetize megawatts.”\nFor years, mining companies—which derived their main source of revenue solely from mining bitcoin—lived and died by the four-year bitcoin halving cycle. Every cycle, rewards were slashed in half, and miners scrambled to cut costs or scale up to survive. But that rhythm, according to these executives, no longer defines the business.\n“The four-year cycle is effectively broken with the maturation of bitcoin as a strategic asset, with the ETF and now the strategic treasury and whatnot,” Schultz said. “The adoption is driving demand. If you read anything about the most recent ETF, they've consumed infinitely more bitcoin than have been generated so far this year.”\nCleanspark, which now operates 800 megawatts of energy infrastructure and has another 1.2 gigawatts in development, has begun turning its attention beyond proof-of-work. “Our speed to market with the electricity has created opportunities such that now we can look at ways to monetize power beyond just bitcoin mining,” he said. “With 33 locations, we now have a great deal more flexibility than we ever did before.”\nSchultz is not alone in calling the industry's monumental shift in business model.\nPatrick Fleury, CFO of Terawulf, echoed the sentiment and didn’t try to sugarcoat the profit squeeze the miners are now feeling.\n“Bitcoin mining is an incredibly difficult business,” he said. He broke down the economics of bitcoin mining in straightforward terms: with electricity priced at five cents per kilowatt hour, it currently costs around $60,000 to mine a single bitcoin. At a bitcoin price of $115,000, that means half the revenue is consumed by power alone. Once corporate expenses and other operating costs are factored in, the margins tighten quickly. In his view, profitability in mining hinges almost entirely on securing ultra-low-cost power.\nFor Fleury, the deeper problem isn’t just power costs — it’s the relentless expansion of the network itself, driven by hardware manufacturers with little incentive to slow down.\nHe pointed to Bitmain, which continues to produce mining rigs regardless of market demand, thanks to its direct pipeline to chipmakers like TSMC. Even when miners aren’t buying, the company can deploy the machines itself in regions with ultra-cheap electricity — from the U.S. to Pakistan — flooding the network with hash power and driving up mining difficulty. That global footprint, coupled with low production costs, allows Bitmain to remain profitable while squeezing margins for everyone else.\nStill, Terawulf is pivoting aggressively. Last week, it signed a $6.7 billion lease-backed deal with Google to convert hundreds of megawatts of mining infrastructure into data center space.\n“These things, as everyone can attest to up here, like electrical infrastructure, don’t move quickly,” Fleury said. “Tech is used to moving quickly and breaking things, but these deals take an extremely long time to come together. It took us four to five months of very intense due diligence.”\n“What I take the most pride in in that transaction was really working collectively with those partners to come up with a new mousetrap that I hope now becomes something that the industry can duplicate at other companies,” he said. “Google is providing $3.2 billion of backstop lease obligation support to Terawulf, which effectively allows me to go out and secure financing at a really efficient cost of capital.”\nKent Draper, chief commercial officer at IREN, took a quieter but confident stance. His company mines bitcoin profitably — even today, he said. Still, he pointed to one common denominator: power.\n“Being a low-cost producer is fundamentally important, and that's how we've always focused our business — having control of our sites, having operational control, being in areas that are low-cost power jurisdictions,” Draper said.\nIren, according to him, is currently operating at 50 exahash, which translates to a billion-dollar annual revenue run rate under current bitcoin market conditions. He noted that the company’s gross margins — revenue minus electricity costs — stand at 75%, and even after accounting for corporate overhead and SG&A expenses, IREN maintains a 65% EBITDA margin, or roughly $650 million in annualized earnings.\nStill, even IREN is pausing its expansion in mining. “That’s really dictated just by the opportunity set that we see on the AI side today and the potential to really diversify the revenue streams within our business, rather than a fundamental view that bitcoin mining is no longer attractive,” Draper said.\nOn the AI side, IREN is pursuing both co-location and cloud. “Capital intensity is very different,” Draper said. “If you're owning the GPUs on top of the data center infrastructure, that’s 3x the investment. On the cloud side, the payback periods tend to be a lot faster—typically around two years on the GPU investment alone.”\nFor Marathon Digital (MARA) CFO Salman Khan, survival is about agility. With decades in the oil industry, Khan sees a familiar pattern: boom, bust, consolidation, and the constant race to stay efficient.\n“This reminds me of those trends in commodity-exposed cycle industries,” Khan said. “There are some very wealthy families in the oil sector who made billions, and then there are others who have filed bankruptcies. You have to have a strong balance sheet to survive these cycles.”\nMarathon holds bitcoin on its balance sheet — something Khan said paid off. “We're not a treasury company, we're not Strategy, but we like to have that hedge if bitcoin price escalates.”\nMore recently, Marathon announced a majority stake in Exaion. “The angle that we have on the AI front is compute on the edge,” Khan said. “We like sovereign compute, which allows people to control their data better at a closer location to them. We like the aspect of recurring revenues that come with that. We also like that there's a software aspect to it, and also the platform aspect to it.”\nDespite the different points of view and strategies, it all comes down to one common factor: power. Whether it was being used to mine bitcoin, power AI, or balance electrical grids, energy — not hash rate — was the currency of the conversation.\n“We curtail our energy consumption for 120 hours a year,” CleanSpark's Schultz said. “We can avoid about a third of our total energy costs. So being that flexible load matters.”\nCleanspark, he added, has spent the past year quietly locking up megawatts around the country. “You mentioned Georgia,” Schultz said. “We have 100 megawatts surrounding the Atlanta airport. That’s a prime example. We’ve been focused on being the valuable partner for some of these rural utilities to monetize stranded megawatts.”\nDespite the growing focus on AI, the panelists made it clear that bitcoin remains central to their businesses — for now. When asked why mining companies still deserve investor attention, the answers pointed to scale, cost efficiency, and the ability to weather volatility.\nFleury emphasized that Terawulf’s contracted power capacity could generate substantial cash flow, comparing the economics to established data center operators. Khan pointed out a disconnect between Marathon’s bitcoin holdings and its market valuation, suggesting that the core mining business is being overlooked. Draper underscored IREN’s operational efficiency and low-cost footprint, citing recent performance metrics that placed the company ahead of other public miners.\nAnd while the future may include cloud infrastructure and edge compute, Schultz argued that bitcoin itself could still evolve into something larger — a foundational layer for energy systems. As he put it, the next phase may not be about speculation, but about bitcoin's role in helping balance power networks.\nRead more: Bitcoin Mining Costs Soar as Hashrate Hits Records: TheMinerMag","content_hash":"9d0b3b7d9f919eadfc4a82b2cb836564","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":8443,"method_rank":0}

The fact is, however, it's much easier to muster the guts you need to step into a \"forever\" holding when you know you can get out of it at the first sign of trouble. If you truly have to commit to a multi-decade holding period, you might be considerably pickier.\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three stocks you can feel good about buying with the intent of leaving then-bigger stakes in them to your children -- or even your grandchildren -- in the future.\n1. Coca-Cola\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) is such a commonly suggested stock pick that it's almost become cliché. The thing about clichés is, they become clichés for good reason. It's a testament to their truth or accuracy.\nNo, you'll never score a massive gain with a stake in Coca-Cola. It's just not that kind of company, or business. Last year's 6% year-over-year revenue growth on a 2% improvement in total volume is pretty typical. What the beverage giant lacks in raw firepower, however, it more than makes up for in reliability and consistency.\nCredit the nature of the beverage industry, mostly. It's not like the automobile business or highly cyclical real estate. Consumer staples are always in demand, and usually reasonably priced. Purchasing them doesn't require any planning or a minimum degree of income.\nAnd the company casts a rather wide net. In addition to its namesake soda, Coca-Cola is also parent to Dasani water, Powerade sports drink, Sprite, Gold Peak tea, and Minute Maid juice, just to name a few. It's got something to meet every consumer's ever-changing preference.\nThe kicker: Coca-Cola's business model is brilliant, and persistently profitable. See, it doesn't actually do much of its own bottling these days, where expenses can be volatile. Coca-Cola's business is selling flavor concentrates to third-party bottling partners and letting them figure out how to make production and distribution affordable. This allows the company to focus even more on what it does best: marketing.\nOf course, it's got some of the best-known brand names to work with. That makes its marketing work much easier.\nAll that being said, just know that most of your net gains here are likely to be driven by this stock's ever-growing dividend, and your reinvestment of these payouts in more shares. In this vein, Coca-Cola has now raised its annual per-share dividend payments for 63 consecutive years. It's unlikely to break the streak now.\n2. Amazon\nThere's no denying Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has been a fantastic investment since its IPO back in 1997. Indeed, the stock's up nearly 300,000% from that point. Wow!\nThat's obviously a tough act to follow. It's unlikely shares will repeat the feat, in fact. The growth opportunity between then and now -- the advent of e-commerce -- was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing, and Amazon brilliantly capitalized on it in just the right way. This kind of opportunity won't surface again for the company anytime soon, if ever.\nNevertheless, Amazon remains a great multigenerational investment for one simple but easily overlooked reason: It's not an e-commerce company. It's an enterprise that happens to be in the online-shopping business right now because that's the one that made the most sense to start with and stick with. Since then, it's added cloud computing, but just as important, it's evolved its e-commerce operation with the addition of advertising and a streaming platform that funnels consumers to its online shopping platform.\nThis is no trivial detail, either. It's become part of the company's corporate ethos to experiment aggressively, keeping whatever works, and discarding whatever doesn't. Founder Jeff Bezos described it as being willing to \"fail fast, fail often.\" Current CEO Andy Jassy agrees with the idea, though, recently suggesting that the 30-year-old company still aims to operate like \"the world's largest start-up.\"\nThe thing is, it works. While plenty of enterprises would struggle to function with this sort of corporate culture, Amazon's lean corporate structure and ultra-picky hiring means the right people can do clever things the best way possible. You can reasonably count on this organization continuing to evolve as needed for generations to come.\n3. Berkshire Hathaway\nFinally, add Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) to your list of stocks that could create generational wealth.\nOK, it's not a stock in the traditional sense. It's not a mutual fund, either, even though one-third of its current values reflects the total value of all of its stock holdings. It's technically a conglomerate, by virtue of holding dozens of privately owned businesses like flooring company Shaw, Dairy Queen, Duracell batteries, railroad BNSF, Geico insurance, and several others.\nEven then, however, the description doesn't quite do the company justice. Berkshire Hathaway is mostly whatever CEO Warren Buffett and his lieutenants want it to be. Not unlike Amazon, they'll invest in whatever makes the most sense at any given time (including just sitting on a pile of cash), and they'll do it in a way that makes the most sense.\nWhile it's focused on stock-picking for the past few years, for instance, it's not been afraid to outright acquire and privatize the right enterprises, as it did with Lubrizol, the aforementioned Shaw, and industrial metalworks company Precision Castparts back in 2016, just to name a few.\nBut Buffett's stepping down as CEO and chief stock-picking guru at the end of this year? That's true. And it will certainly dial back the magic factor that his presence seems to bring to the table. It already seems to have done so just a bit, in fact.\nAfter 60 years at the helm though, as is the case with Bezos and Amazon, Buffett's patience and value-minded spirit should live on with Berkshire Hathaway for decades to come.\nYou'll want your family to hold on to this multigenerational investment as long as it possibly can, in fact, since time seems to be its best performance-driving friend. Over the course of the past 30 years, despite the occasional bout of weakness, Berkshire Hathaway stock's performance is about 50% better than the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), even after adding the index's reinvested dividends into the mix. Don't be surprised to see this sort of leadership continue well into the distant future, either.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

I have over $250,000 in an IRA (100% no risk, based on interest rates). But as interest rates go down, so does the money it makes. Is there a better solution that is 100% safe?\n– Ed\nI take your use of \"safe\" to mean confidence that your account balance won't decline. That's typically what people mean when they talk about safety with savings and investments. In that sense, interest-bearing investments are the safest option. The tradeoff, of course, is that your returns are tied to prevailing interest rates. So in that regard, there isn't really a better alternative.\nHowever, I'll give you some thoughts on that tradeoff and some minor tips for how to approach it. I also want to take a moment to discuss risk in broader terms as well. I think that additional perspective might help you consider other approaches that could provide you with a better outcome.\nSafety vs. Growth\nFirst, let's make sure that we have the right framework for thinking about your question. When you invest, there's a tradeoff between the amount of risk you take and the rate at which you can expect your money to grow.\nYou should generally expect a higher rate of return from more risky investments over the long term. Of course, the risk aspect means there may be periods when your return lags or turns negative.\nSafer investments grow more slowly, but with less volatility. If you invest very conservatively, your account value may hardly fluctuate at all, but over time you'll likely end up with less than if you had invested more aggressively.\nWhat you're observing is the tradeoff of choosing the safest assets: lower returns. As you noted, these returns are tied to prevailing interest rates. Rates declined in 2024 and could fall further, which would reduce the yield you earn as well.\n(And if you need additional help assessing the potential risk and return of investments, consider working with a financial advisor.)\nResponding to Falling Interest Rates\nSmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\nIf maintaining complete safety of principal is your priority, you really have two choices. First, you can accept lower interest when rates decline. This is an outcome that understandably feels unsatisfying, since that's the concern you're raising. Alternatively, you can invest in longer-term instruments, which typically offer higher yields but require locking in your money for a longer period.\nI'm not sure exactly what you have now, but I'm guessing it's CDs or something similar. For illustrative purposes let's assume you typically invest in three-year CDs. When these mature, you're left with reinvesting that money into new CDs at whatever the interest rate happens to be at the time.\nBuying a CD with a longer term, such as 10 years, allows you to lock in a given interest rate for longer. This provides some protection from the chance that rates fall over the CD term. Of course, there's also a chance that interest rates rise and you miss out. Again, there's always a tradeoff.\n(A financial advisor can help you respond to interest rate fluctuations and the impact they have on markets.)\nWhat About Other Risks?\nPrincipal fluctuation isn't the only risk investors face. In some cases, it may not even be the most significant, particularly if it's managed with a diversified portfolio and an asset allocation aligned with your risk tolerance.\nSome of those other risks that specifically affect interest-bearing investments include:\nReinvestment risk: As we just discussed, if rates fall you'll have to invest into lower yielding securities.\nInflation: Over time, inflation erodes purchasing power. Your investments need to keep up with inflation or the real value of your money will fall, even if the nominal value increases. For example, if you invested $1,000 in a CD paying 4% you would have $1,040 a year later. If inflation was 5% over that same period, you'd have to spend $1,050 in order to buy what the $1,000 would have bought the previous year. You lost $10 of purchasing power even though your money grew.\nThese risks and others are present even if you invest in “safe” instruments.\nI point this out because these risks can sometimes do more damage than the volatility you might face in a slightly more aggressive, diversified portfolio. Many retirees would struggle to sustain income through retirement if they invested only in assets with no risk. If you haven't yet assessed whether your plan can support that approach, making this evaluation should be your next step.\nAm I telling you to go out and buy a bunch of stocks? Absolutely not. I don't know you, your situation, goals, timeline, risk tolerance or any other information I would need to make that recommendation. But I do think it would be worthwhile to explore how you could reframe your approach to investing to get a better outcome. Even a small nudge to a slightly more aggressive (but still very conservative) asset allocation could make a big difference.\n(And for a more in-depth analysis of your investment portfolio and overall financial situation, speak with a fiduciary advisor.)\nBottom Line\nI’m assuming that you are a very conservative and risk-averse investor. If so, that's perfectly fine. It's better to be honest with yourself and invest in a way that fits your personal preferences rather than taking on more risk than you're comfortable with. The tradeoff, however, is that your returns will depend heavily on the interest rates available at the time. If you can accept a bit of volatility, a conservative but diversified mix of investments may offer stronger long-term results\nTips for Investing\nA financial advisor can help you invest according to your goals, including retirement. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be hard. SmartAsset's free tool matches you with vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If you're ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\nMarkets rise and fall, sometimes sharply, but letting fear or excitement drive investment decisions often leads to selling low and buying high. Staying disciplined means following a long-term plan even during volatility. Many investors find it helpful to set rules, including only rebalancing at scheduled intervals, so they aren't tempted to react impulsively. Patience and consistency generally work better than chasing short-term gains or fleeing after losses.\nBrandon Renfro, CFP®, is a SmartAsset financial planning columnist and answers reader questions on personal finance and tax topics.

While the market has experienced some big swings this year in response to macroeconomic developments, geopolitical concerns, and shifting developments around the valuation outlook for artificial intelligence (AI) companies, growth stocks have generally been enjoying strong bullish momentum. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index is up roughly 10% year to date as of this writing.\nBroad catalysts could still rattle the market in the near term, but there are also category-leading companies that look primed to deliver big wins for long-term shareholders. Two that a pair of Motley Fool contributing analysts view as top stocks to load up on before August falls off the calendar are Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Shopify(NASDAQ: SHOP).\n1. Amazon looks poised to be one of AI's biggest winners\nKeith Noonan (Amazon): While excitement surrounding artificial intelligence has powered big share price gains for many players in the space this year, Amazon stock has significantly underperformed the broader market. On the heels of recent sell-offs, the tech giant is up just 2% across 2025's trading. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index has delivered a total return of roughly 10% across that stretch.\nAmazon reported its second-quarter results at the end of July, delivering sales and earnings that topped Wall Street analysts' consensus targets. Despite that, its stock sank following the report. While the company's share price has regained some ground since then, general market concerns that valuations for AI stocks could be in a bubble on the verge of bursting have been putting pressure on the tech leader's valuation. So have negative indicators on the inflation and tariff fronts.\nWhile many AI stocks may be overvalued at the moment, I actually think that Amazon's strengths in artificial intelligence have been (and continue to be) significantly underappreciated by the broader market. Many companies with strong positions in AI have seen their valuations skyrocket over the last five years, but Amazon's share price is up by just 37% over the period. For comparison, the S&P 500 has posted a total return of 104% over the same period.\nThrough its Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment, Amazon continues to command a leading position in the cloud data-center market that is central to the development, launch, and scaling of AI applications and models. AWS should continue to deliver healthy and heavily profitable growth over the long term, and it's likely that positive performance catalysts connected to artificial intelligence are still in the early stages of unfolding for the business.\nAs exciting as AI growth drivers for AWS are, it's the impact that AI will likely have on Amazon's e-commerce business that the market really seems to be missing. While online retail continues to account for the majority of the company's revenues, it accounts for a relatively small portion of the tech leader's operating profits.\nAmazon has built the world's largest e-commerce business and focused on continuing to expand its infrastructure and sales footprints, but the high costs of its warehouse and delivery operations have meant that, despite some gradual improvements, the segment's margins continue to be relatively low. Greater automation of those operations powered by AI and robotics has the potential to dramatically change that picture. These emerging technologies look poised to drive long-term margin improvements that could unlock huge earnings growth and deliver huge wins for shareholders.\n2. Shopify is more than just e-commerce\nJennifer Saibil (Shopify): Shopify has been impressing the market with its robust performance, but investors are buying the stock today for its future opportunities. It has demonstrated that it can maintain its dominance as a service provider as e-commerce keeps growing, and that it can pick itself up after a fall. Those are the kinds of attributes that one sees in a stock with long-term potential.\nIts second quarter was a blowout, with a 31% increase in revenue and a 21% increase in operating income. Free cash flow rose by 27%, and it delivered a 16% margin.\nAccording to data from the Census Bureau, Shopify's clients have a combined 12% share of the U.S. e-commerce market, and that's expected to increase. Greater e-commerce penetration will offer it organic growth opportunities, but there's so much more. I appreciated this statement from company President Harley Finkelstein: \"No matter how good the numbers look, there's always a new frontier in commerce,\" he said, \"and we'll continue to lead the way.\"\nTo start, management continues to add services across the business, and Shopify has become a total commerce platform rather than just an e-commerce platform that provides small merchants with an online presence. It offers complete payment processing services for physical stores and a unified platform for omnichannel merchants, including services like order management and data analytics. Some of its newer services include Shop Pay, a one-page checkout for merchants, and a deal with Amazon to offer a checkout option for Prime members and merchants through Shopify stores.\nIt's also moving upmarket, capturing market share in the medium and large business segments. Today, it calls companies like Allbirds and Crate & Barrel clients, and that's a result of its offering individual components that meet large customers' needs. This continues to be a strong growth driver; Shopify added well-known brands like Canada Goose, Miele, and Starbucks to its client roster in the second quarter.\nIt also has plenty of market share to capture globally, and European gross merchandise volume increased 42% year over year in the second quarter.\nThere's a lot to be excited about as Shopify conquers new frontiers. The company should continue to create shareholder value for many years.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

I still am kind of excited, like, universal basic income, where you just give everybody money,” he said.\nUniversal extreme wealth?\nUniversal basic income is a policy idea that gives every citizen a regular cash payment, regardless of employment status or income. But Altman argued that traditional UBI would leave people feeling passive. Instead, he believes individuals need a sense of agency — a stake in the future shaped by AI.\n“What I would want is, like, an ownership share in whatever the AI creates — that I feel like I'm participating in this thing that's going to compound and get more valuable over time,” he said.\nThat, he added, would amount to “universal basic wealth — better than universal basic income. And I think I don't like basic either. I want, like, universal extreme wealth for everybody”\nAltman floated what he called a “crazy idea”: measuring the world’s AI output in tokens and distributing part of it globally. For example, if AI produced 20 quintillion tokens a year, 12 would go to the traditional capitalist system while eight would be shared equally among the planet’s 8 billion people. That would amount to 1 billion tokens per person (Altman said 1 trillion, but the math works out to 1 billion). Individuals could then use, sell, or pool their tokens, creating what he described as a form of “universal basic wealth” powered by AI.\nThe concept of UBI — in all its forms — has long been a lightning rod for debate.\nSupporters see it as essential in an age of automation. Martin Ford, author of “Rise of the Robots,” argues that UBI would ensure income is “adequately distributed throughout the population,” helping maintain social stability and a “decent standard of living.”\nCritics, however, warn of downsides. Some say it could discourage work or fuel inflation (though AI-driven productivity gains might offset that). Others highlight the enormous costs and political hurdles.\n“I’m not a UBI guy,” Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman said. “Trouble with UBI is that either it’s going to cost an amount that’s beyond what I expect to be politically possible in the next several decades, or it’s going to be way inadequate.”\nWhile Altman’s vision of “universal extreme wealth” remains speculative, the appeal of income without labor is obvious. And in today’s economy, every extra dollar counts.\nSo here’s a look at two simple ways to generate your own passive income — no futuristic technology required.\nEarn rental income without being a landlord\nReal estate has been one of the most popular ways to generate recurring income. When you own rental property and tenants pay rent, you earn a steady monthly cash flow.\nIt’s also a popular hedge against inflation, as property values and rental income tend to rise alongside the cost of living.\nHowever, while real estate investing has clear benefits, being a landlord comes with challenges. Managing a property involves finding and screening tenants, collecting rent and handling maintenance and repair requests (out of your own pocket) — and that’s assuming you can save enough for a downpayment and get a mortgage to buy the property in the first place.\nThe good news? These days, you don’t need to buy a property outright to reap the benefits of real estate investing. Crowdfunding platforms like Arrived offer an easier way to get exposure to this income-generating asset class.\nThe process is simple: browse a curated selection of homes that have been vetted for their appreciation and income potential. Once you find a property you like, select the number of shares you’d like to purchase and then sit back as you start receiving any positive rental income distributions from your investment.\nAnother option is First National Realty Partners (FNRP), which allows accredited investors to diversify their portfolio through grocery-anchored commercial properties without taking on the responsibilities of being a landlord.\nWith a minimum investment of $50,000, investors can own a share of properties leased by national brands like Whole Foods, Kroger and Walmart, which provide essential goods to their communities. Thanks to Triple Net (NNN) leases, accredited investors are able to invest in these properties without worrying about tenant costs cutting into their potential returns.\nSimply answer a few questions — including how much you would like to invest — to start browsing their full list of available properties.\nDividends — or as Rockefeller put it, ‘the only thing that gives me pleasure’\nDividends are payments companies make to shareholders out of their profits, typically on a quarterly basis.\nInvesting in dividend-paying companies allows you to generate passive income without selling your shares — and it can be surprisingly satisfying. As John D. Rockefeller, one of the richest Americans in history, once said, “Do you know the only thing that gives me pleasure? It’s to see my dividends coming in.”\nWhile stock prices can rise and fall, companies with a strong track record of paying — and growing — dividends offer investors a steady cash flow. Over time, those increases can compound into a powerful income stream.\nNot sure where to start? That’s where platforms like Moby can come in. Their team of former hedge fund analysts does the heavy lifting — breaking down the market, flagging quality stocks and making the research easy to digest.\nIn fact, across nearly 400 stock picks over the past four years, Moby’s recommendations have beaten the S&P 500 by almost 12% on average. Their research keeps you up-to-the-minute on market shifts and takes the guesswork out of choosing investments.","content_hash":"ea427077a0744f0b84045466801fc979","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6909,"method_rank":0}

Now, the automaker will primarily focus on recording videos of workers performing tasks to teach the robot how to do things like pick up an object or fold a t-shirt.\nThe company said moving away from motion capture suits and teleoperation would allow the team to scale data collection more quickly, according to the insiders.\nThe change marks a significant shift in Tesla's robotics strategy, aligning Optimus with CEO Elon Musk's long-standing belief that AI can master complex tasks using cameras. The automaker has long used a similar approach to train its autonomous driving software.\nThe change occurred shortly after Milan Kovac, the director of the Optimus program, stepped down. AI director Ashok Elluswamy has since taken charge of the program, the insiders said.\nTeleoperation and motion capture are standard industry practices to train robots. Leading robotics company Boston Dynamics, for example, has used teleoperation to train its Atlas robot. During the training process, motion capture suits are worn by workers who perform various tasks; the data is then fed to the robot. Motion capture suits can also be worn to remotely control the robot.\nIt's unclear whether Tesla will prioritize motion capture suits and teleoperation again in the future, or whether it will use the video data to build on the previously collected information.\nRobert Griffin, a senior research scientist at the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, told Business Insider that a large set of teleoperation data allows the robot to learn by physically interacting with its environment. It can be difficult to teach the robot to translate video data to the real world, he said.\n\"If you're just using video data, you don't have that directly,\" he said.\nIn May, Tesla posted a video that appeared to show Optimus performing tasks based on video recordings.\nKonstantinos Laskaris, a director working on Optimus hardware, appeared to acknowledge the new strategy in a May LinkedIn post. \"It seems unbelievable, but our robot is learning new tasks directly from human videos!\" Laskaris wrote.\nMusk also said in May that the robot will eventually be able to learn how to perform tasks by watching YouTube videos.\nThe company briefly paused hiring for the Optimus team amid the transition, insiders with knowledge of the issue said. As of late August, Tesla's careers page listed more than 50 Optimus-related roles.\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\nLast year, the company was hiring for \"data collection operators.\" The roles have involved performing and recording basic household tasks. The job postings said the operators would be required to wear motion capture suits and virtual reality headsets for extended periods of time.\nUp until late June, the project involved teleoperating Optimus and training the robot via the motion capture suits. Workers spent time troubleshooting issues with the suit and with Optimus, which limited the amount of data the team was able to collect, sources said.\nSince the training shift, workers have focused on recording their own movements using a set of five cameras made in-house, insiders said. The cameras are attached to a helmet and a heavy backpack worn by the worker. The cameras point in all directions, giving the AI model data that orients it precisely in its environment, the insiders said.\nChristian Hubicki, the director of the robotics lab for FAMU-FSU's engineering school, said the various camera angles likely allow Tesla to collect more minute details, \"like the location of joints and fingers,\" and properly place the robot in space. The videos could also be a way of augmenting the previous data they collected using teleoperation, he said.\nWorkers receive specific instructions on how to perform the tasks for training, particularly when it comes to hand movement and ensuring the movements look as human as possible. They can spend months performing the same simple task, one person said.\nJonathan Aitken, a robotics expert with the University of Sheffield, told Business Insider that Tesla will likely need to figure out how to teach Optimus using actions that could apply to a variety of tasks.\n\"Working at this scale, they must have a generalized set of actions or else it would take forever to do all of them,\" Aitken said.\nHe added that Tesla could employ a similar strategy to Physical Intelligence, a company that feeds robots vast amounts of demonstration data so they can learn transferable skills and apply them flexibly, rather than just memorizing how to perform a single task.\n'A very Tesla way of doing robotics'\nThe new strategy is in line with Tesla's training process for its self-driving software.\nWhile other autonomous vehicle companies use LiDAR and radar sensors to teach their software, Tesla primarily relies on a collection of cameras.\nThe company uses data collected from millions of Tesla owners, whose vehicles are equipped with between eight and nine cameras. Musk has said Tesla released its driver-assist software in China after training its AI system with publicly available videos of streets in Asia.\nMusk acknowledged during an earnings call in January that \"the training needs for Optimus humanoid robot, are probably at least ultimately 10x of what is needed for the car.\"\n\"It's a very Tesla way of doing robotics. No one else is trying to do this at the same scale,\" Aitken said. \"They'll need as much data as they've used to train their cars,\" he added.\nAlan Fern, an AI and robotics expert at Oregon State University, said training Optimus will be an even more daunting project for Tesla than developing an autonomous vehicle.\n\"Driving is just one task,\" he said. Learning primarily from videos \"would require the robot to understand what's going on in the video, and then have the skills to accomplish it,\" he said. \"There are some things it can learn by watching and others it will need to physically practice, whether in a simulator or the real world.\"","content_hash":"8415b38cac7958ec49f9a0c996dce4de","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6679,"method_rank":0}

Sean's going to talk about why the Jackson Hole speech could be a major catalyst for this trend to continue. We'll give you all the recent high-level List data and then I'm going to show you some charts, including O'Reilly Automotive, Synchrony Financial, The Hartford Insurance Group and Allstate. Buckle up. Sector Leaderboard As of Aug. 25, there are 191 names on The Best Stocks in the Market list. Top Sector Ranking: Top Industries: Top 5 Best Stocks by Relative Strength: Sector spotlight: Sean — As you can see in the dashboard above, growth stocks have been leading while value has been lagging. Materials, real estate and energy are the bottom 3 sector exposures on our list — stocks in those sectors have been left behind. However, there's been some newfound life within our unloved value stocks. Value stocks tend to benefit when interest rates are cut because lower borrowing costs improve profitability for capital-intensive and cyclical businesses, which make up the lion's share of the value universe. Rate cuts also reduce the discount rate used in valuing future cash flows, which helps companies with steady but slower-growing earnings streams. In addition, lower yields on bonds make dividend-paying value stocks more attractive to income-oriented investors. On Friday, Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell confirmed to the market that rate cuts are coming. He noted that the job market was no longer solid, while still acknowledging the inflationary pressures going on. There is currently an 85% chance of a cut and a 15% chance of no cut for the Fed meeting in September, according to fed funds futures contracts. Value stocks responded accordingly on Friday. Small cap value was up 4%, homebuilders were up 5%, and transports were up 3%. On our list, some of the more value-oriented names started to heat up. The cheapest 2 (non-financial) stocks on our list on a P\/E basis are O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) and General Motors (GM) , trading at a trailing 4x and 9x earnings. Look at these two stocks over the past month vs the S & P 500: Looking at our entire list, the cheapest 10% of stocks on the list returned an average of 5% the past month, while the 10% most expensive stocks on the list returned an average of 2% the past month. Jackson Hole could be the catalyst these beaten-down names need to catch up with everyone else. One month of the cheapest decile of names on our list outperforming the priciest decile by 300 basis points is nothing if you zoom out, but it could be a meaningful short-term rotation (1 basis point equals 0.01%). If the Fed delivers, momentum could extend this nascent rotation into value. Risk management Josh — Here are a few of the cheapest, most value-oriented names from our Best Stocks in the Market list to key off this important point Sean is making about the rotation. O'Reilly Automotive has one of the best long-term stock charts I have ever seen. It's a giant in the car care and auto parts space and is referred to as a \"cannibal company\" thanks to a monster share buyback program that makes it look as though the company is literally eating itself. In the latest quarter the company repurchased 6.8 million shares at an average price of $90 in the open market for a cost of $617 million. ORLY told shareholders they've bought back a total of $1.46 billion shares since their buyback program began in 2011 at an average price of $18. That's a $27 billion investment in shrinking the shares outstanding, which has substantially boosted the earnings per share and, by extension, the share price. Below is a five year chart with the 50– and 200-week moving averages in orange and blue respectively. I'd use the 50-week, now as $86, as a risk management tool. A violation of that without a quick recovery means something may have materially changed. Above it, I think you can ride the stock. Below is a one-year chart of Synchrony Financial (SYF) , a player in the credit card space, with an ultra-low PE ratio of 8.5x earnings. Watch for a low-volume pullback to around $70, which is where the stock broke out from. If it can hold on, I'd remain long. This is The Hartford Insurance Group (HIG) , which has clearly broken out above the prior resistance level of $130. Another value stock selling at 11.5x earnings in a tape where cheapness is being rewarded. You want to own it above that $130 level as it seeks to achieve a new range higher. Last one for today — this is Allstate (ALL) selling at 9.6x earnings. What I want you to pay attention to is that repeated failure of the stock to get above the $215 area since November. There are very few triple tops in this business, eventually I think it breaks through and stays there. But it's still early, I would wait for it to happen. Putting this one on your radar as a potential breakout. Remember your ABCs - Always Be Cool. No rush. Will the value rotation persist into fall? Hard to say for sure but we now have dozens of cheap stocks on the list that have either broken out or are on the verge. We'll keep you updated.

At least, not as standalone investment options on plan menus. It’s a roughly $12 trillion market that is off limits, with a couple of exceptions: Some defined-contribution plans have brokerage windows that few investors use; and some plans include asset-allocation products that have exposure to ETFs. For a lot of asset managers, it’s not really a problem, as they provide strategies in a range of vehicles, including mutual funds, ETFs and collective investment trusts. But for companies whose focus is on ETFs, it’s a missed opportunity.\nPowered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above.\n“ETFs are really made for the retail market,” said Greg Ungerman, head of defined contribution research and consulting at Callan. “There are a lot of tax advantages vis-à-vis a mutual fund.”\nETFs’ tax benefits don’t matter within tax-deferred plans like 401(k)s. And while ETFs offer low costs, the institutional-level pricing of mutual fund shares and CITs in defined-contribution plans is extremely hard to compete with. For example, Ungerman said, the bargain-price 9 basis-point fee for the $650 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) has nothing on the comparable index funds available to defined-contribution plans for 1 basis point or less.\nSome of the other hindrances include:\nRetirement plan record keepers’ systems aren’t designed to handle the intraday trading capacities of ETFs, and the industry has virtually no incentive to change that.\nIntraday trading is a big advantage for ETFs in the retail market, but retirement plan sponsors largely discourage participants from daytrading within their 401(k) accounts.\nExtra Value Menu\nIt wasn’t always this way. There was some excitement about the potential for ETFs in 401(k)s as much as 20 years ago, just before the Pension Protection Act of 2006 changed everything. Unlike many mutual funds at the time, ETFs, still far less common than they are today, had “clean” fee structures, meaning that they didn’t include revenue sharing or 12b-1 fees. ETF providers pushed 401(k) recordkeepers to make their systems compatible, to no avail, said Fred Barstein, founder of The Retirement Advisor University. “There was no demand. There was very little difference [plan fiduciaries] could tell at the time between an index fund and an ETF,” he said.\nA major issue comes from the 2006 Pension Protection Act, which allowed for automatic enrollment and helped buoy target-date funds as the default investment options in defined-contribution plans. Thanks to automatic enrollment (and the fact that workers interact little with their accounts), about 70% of the new money contributed to 401(k) accounts goes into target-date funds, Barstein noted. While ETFs are included in some target-date products, there’s otherwise “zero talk of ETFs in 401(k)s,” he said. And while some target-date fund providers use outside managers’ ETFs within their products, most of the big ones invest with in-house ETFs — meaning that opportunity in that avenue is limited.\nInvest in Yourself\nOf 156 target-date series that Sway Research tracks, 10 include allocations to ETFs and mutual funds, while seven hold ETFs exclusively, said Chris Brown, principal of that firm. Less than 3% of target-date CITs hold ETFs, while mutual fund series are much more likely to include ETFs, he said. All of the seven series that hold ETFs exclusively use asset managers’ own funds, and only a few of those that use a mix of mutual funds and ETFs use outside products. ETFs “really haven’t penetrated the target-date market much at all,” Brown said. “It’s kind of surprising.”\nWhere they have found a niche, though, is in active-passive hybrid series, where managers add third-party index-based ETFs to diversify and lower costs, he noted. Some of the series that significantly use ETFs, per Sway:\nPutnam Sustainable Retirement, BlackRock LifePath ESG Index, Schwab Target Index and SP Funds focus only on ETFs.\nJohn Hancock Lifetime Blend and Voya Target Retirement include significant exposure to third-party ETFs.\nA New Hope\nOne ETF shop is trying something different. F\/m Investments is among dozens of asset managers waiting for permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission to add dual share classes, something the regulator is expected to grant this year. Most companies are seeking to add ETF share classes of existing mutual fund strategies, but F\/m is doing the opposite, with the intention of landing spots for some of its products on defined-contribution plan menus. “Loads of DC buyers have said, ‘Why can’t we buy your products?’” F\/m’s CEO Alex Morris said. But the company has refused to launch separate mutual fund versions of its ETFs because the performances of the two vehicles might diverge significantly due to the differences in trading, he said.\nThe company is planning to start with mutual fund share classes of two of its ETFs and one ETF share class of an existing mutual fund. “Everyone is thinking it’s going to be this deluge, day one,” Morris said. “It’s actually kind of hard” to add a share class that’s a different investment vehicle, and “there’s a lot behind it that most issuers haven’t thought about.” At F\/m, that has meant working with fund administration and accounting to keep track of capital gains, update baskets in real time and figure out what to put on the firm’s website, he said.\nFooting T-Bill. The first mutual fund shares the firm plans to roll out are for its F\/m US Treasury 3-Month Bill ETF (TBIL) and Ultrashort Treasury Inflation-Protected Security ETF (RBIL). “ETFs have this super power,” Morris said. “In a mutual fund executing a T-Bill strategy, I need to put all the dealers I know in competition with each other … Here, every market maker is bidding on that ETF everyday,” he added. “You’re going to get a better price experience from that. You get to choose the price you pay.”\nThis post first appeared on The Daily Upside.

The barrage of headlines — both positive and negative — is creating an intimidating backdrop. The good news? The way to value stocks stays the same, no matter the market. It's a critical part of the investment process. Even though stocks move fast these days, and it can be hard to keep up, investors need to remember the old adage: Price is what you pay, value is what you get. If you want to be sure you aren't paying too high a price for a given stock, you had better know how to value it. Only then can you determine whether a stock is overvalued, meaning you're paying too much; fairly valued, meaning you're paying a fair price, so outperformance might be hard to come by; or undervalued, meaning you're getting a good deal and a solid chance at outperformance. The most popular and most often cited way Wall Street goes about determining which valuation bucket — over, fair, or under — a stock falls in is a multiples-based approach. And, for the Club, that metric is the forward price to earnings (P\/E) ratio. The \"P\" in the equation is the company's current stock price, and the \"E\" is the analysts' estimated earnings per share (EPS) for the next four quarters. The multiple is often referred to as the P\/E, but the same naming convention applies if other metrics are being used, such as price-to-sales. We like the forward P\/E because we like to see companies make actual money and grow profitability, rather than relying on just sales and the promise of earnings growth to come. For example, let's say there's a hypothetical company that is projected to earn $10 per share over the next 12 months. If you determine that you're comfortable paying 20 times those estimated earnings, that translates to a $200 stock. Now you look at your screen and see that it's currently trading at only $145 or 14.5 times earnings — to you, that stock looks undervalued and could be worth a buy if other parts of your research process check out. With the next 12 months (NTM) earnings estimate in hand, which can be obtained through data services and on CNBC's stock quote pages, how do you decide on the right P\/E multiple to put on the stock. Things to consider include the growth rate of earnings — typically, a company that is growing earnings faster than a direct competitor will see its stock trade at a higher multiple. The average investor is willing to pay a premium for growth. Hence, why faster-growing Eli Lilly , a Club name riding the obesity drug boom, has commanded a significant valuation premium of roughly 58 times on average over the past 5 years, compared to the slower-growing Pfizer at around 28 times on average over the past 5 years. It's also best to compare multiples of companies within the same industry because important business attributes that can influence valuation vary wildly across different types of firms and sectors. A company like Club name Salesforce , which sells subscription-based software that customers rarely cancel, is much different than an industrial-focused company such as portfolio holding DuPont , which sees demand for its products fluctuate based on economic and industry spending cycles. The historical valuation of a stock can also help you determine the right multiple to pay now. Consider an industrial company that grew earnings 10% a year over the past five years and its stock traded at an average of 18 times forward earnings in that stretch. If it's likely to grow earnings at a slower clip in the next year because the economy is slowing down, paying 18 times earnings might not be the right move — for now, at least. But if the historical earnings growth is likely to continue and the stock is trading below an 18 multiple, it may be a buying opportunity, all else being equal. Interest rates and the general perception of risk matter a great deal in the multiples approach. If rates are higher — meaning an investor could now park their money in a safer bond fund and generate an annualized return of 4.5% versus 3% a year ago — they may not be willing to assign the same multiple to future earnings that they were before. They're demanding a higher rate of return on the stock — and, therefore, will want to pay a lower price-to-earnings multiple. Put another way, investors are not going to pay as much per dollar of earnings then they were before. The inverse is true if rates are falling. Similar dynamics are at play if it's considered to be a riskier environment, which could lead to less confidence in future earnings projections and so-called multiple compression as a result. Conversely, if investors are gaining confidence — or \"visibility,\" in Wall Street parlance — into future earnings, they may be willing to pay a loftier multiple. Bottom line No matter the kind of market we find ourselves in, the forward P\/E approach can be used to hunt for opportunities as part of a larger research process into a company. Of course, a valuation model is only as good as its inputs — so, the quality of the assumptions matters. But learning how to value a stock so you can identify when the market is getting it wrong can lead to major rewards. What investors are focused on may change from time to time — but in the end, it all comes down to how much a company will earn in the future.

These events were portrayed in the movie The Big Short in which Oscar-winner Christian Bale portrayed Burry in the critically acclaimed film directed by Adam McKay.\nNeedless to say, Burry, who runs Scion Asset Management, turned heads again earlier this year when filings showed that the fund sold nearly its entire portfolio in the first quarter of the year. Burry also bought put options on large tech and artificial intelligence (AI) stocks like Nvidia. Those moves proved to be prescient because the stock market got absolutely crushed in early April due to President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day,\" although it has since rebounded.\nScion's second quarter 13F filing showed that Burry was a big buyer of stocks in Q2 and seems to have turned bullish. Notably, Burry went long on two stocks that investors have seemingly left for dead and that were down at least 40% this year.\nUnitedHealth: Hedge funds to the rescue\nUnitedHealth(NYSE: UNH), the largest healthcare insurer in the U.S., has had a tough year. Even after a strong recovery recently, the stock is still down close to 41% this year (as of Aug. 20). Sectorwide trends, including higher utilization, high prescription costs, and an older population, resulted in management severely underestimating the company's medical costs in 2025, which are now projected to come in $6.5 billion higher than expected.\nThis has crippled expected adjusted earnings this year, with management now guiding for $16 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) in 2025, down from an initial guide of $29.50 to $30 at the beginning of the year . Additionally, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is investigating United for its billing practices associated with Medicare Advantage, the private healthcare program that is reimbursed by the government.\nWith the stock crushed, hedge funds including Scion swooped in to scoop up shares in Q2. Burry added about 20,000 shares and also purchased 350,000 shares through long call options, which are essentially bets that a stock will rise to or above a certain price by a certain date. Other notable billionaires who bought the dip include Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett and Appaloosa Management's David Tepper.\nWhile United certainly has its work cut out, being the largest healthcare insurer in the U.S. still gives the company significant pricing power. Financially speaking, UnitedHealth is still doing OK. The company is generating enough earnings from operations to handle its debt payments and still had a free-cash-flow yield over 9% in the past 12 months. The company also has a dividend yield close to 3% to compensate investors for their time. Burry and others are betting United can navigate the choppy waters in the near term and then get back to their strong performance long term.\nLuLulemon: Struggling with multiple headwinds\nThe luxury exercise and apparel brand Lululemon(NASDAQ: LULU) has seen its stock get absolutely crushed this year and is down close to 47%. Lululemon has been dealing with numerous headwinds, including rising competition, tariffs, a more cautious consumer less willing to shell out for luxury clothes, and a bit of a slowdown in the exercise space as tailwinds from the COVID-19 pandemic have died down.\nBut that didn't stop Burry and Scion from purchasing 50,000 shares of the stock in Q2 and 400,000 total shares through long call options. Lulu's performance hasn't necessarily been bad. In the company's first fiscal quarter of 2025 ending May 4, the company reported EPS and revenue both ahead of Wall Street estimates and up on a year-over-year basis.\nHowever, management also lowered its full-year EPS guidance to a range of $14.58 to $14.78, down from a range of $14.95 to $15.15 and below what analysts had expected, citing a \"dynamic macroenvironment.\" Lulu's CEO Calvin McDonald also said the company \"intends to leverage our strong financial position and competitive advantages to play offense, while we continue to invest in the growth opportunities in front of us.\"\nThe company has $1.3 billion of cash and equivalents and no debt on its balance sheet, and is also planning some modest price increases to mitigate some of the impacts of tariffs. With the stock now trading around 13.5 times forward earnings, Burry is probably thinking that most of the challenges are priced into the stock, and that the firm's strong balance sheet and brand can weather near-term challenges, with a good long-term opportunity ahead.\nShould you buy stock in UnitedHealth Group right now?\nBefore you buy stock in UnitedHealth Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and UnitedHealth Group wasn’t one of them.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\"The higher Hibor rate will definitely have a negative impact on the investment market and property trading,\" said independent analyst Jasper Lo.\nHong Kong's currency has been pegged to the US dollar since 1983 at a fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 per US dollar. In 2005, the HKMA established a narrow trading band, allowing the Hong Kong dollar to fluctuate between HK$7.75 and HK$7.85. When the local currency's exchange rate nears either end of that range, the HKMA buys or sells currency to alter the supply-demand equation and reel it back in.\nThe HKMA's 12 recent interventions reduced the aggregate balance, a measure of banking-sector liquidity, by 69 per cent to HK$53.72 billion as of August 14 from a recent peak of HK$174 billion in May.\nAs a result, the overnight Hibor hit 2.7678 per cent on Friday, compared with 0.1770 per cent on August 13. The one-month Hibor, which is used to price mortgage loans, rose to 2.7706 per cent from 0.9103 per cent during the same period, while the three-month Hibor used for corporate loans rose to 2.8373 per cent from 1.6063 per cent.\nThe immediate impact of the higher Hibor is narrowing the interest-rate gap between the US and Hong Kong to about 1.56 percentage points on Friday, compared with more than 4 percentage points from May to mid-August.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority logo is seen in IFC Two in Central. Photo: Jonathan Wong alt=The Hong Kong Monetary Authority logo is seen in IFC Two in Central. Photo: Jonathan Wong>\nThe wide gap from May triggered carry trades, where investors borrow in low-interest currencies to invest in higher-yielding assets, which pushed the Hong Kong dollar to the weak end of its peg and triggered the HKMA interventions.\n\"The room for carry trade is now trimming,\" said Samuel Tse, a senior economist and strategist at DBS Bank in Hong Kong.\nThe Hong Kong dollar strengthened to HK$7.7936 on Tuesday, the highest since mid-May. It was trading at HK$7.8172 on Friday.\nWith the higher Hibor, homeowners with loans pegged to that rate will feel the most pain: HK$4,418 (US$566) more per month as the monthly payment increases to HK$22,452 on a HK$5 million, 30-year mortgage priced at Hibor plus 1.3 per cent, according to local mortgage broker mReferral.\nThat figure represents a jump of nearly 25 per cent in monthly payment, based on Friday's mortgage rate of 3.5 per cent and a repayment of HK$18,034 on June 17, when the rate was 1.82 per cent.\nProperty developers and owners selling lived-in flats benefited as borrowers enjoyed three months of relatively low mortgage costs from May, when the Hibor hovered near a three-year low of 0.5 per cent, according to Eric Tso Tak-ming, chief vice-president of mReferral.\n\"Now the low-rate honeymoon period is over,\" he said. \"With the rising Hibor rates, prospective homebuyers may choose to monitor market trends and interest-rate movements before making a purchase decision.\"\nTso said the higher Hibor would increase funding costs for the capital and property markets, but the impact could be manageable as the US may cut interest rates soon.\nThe overnight and one-month Hibor rates were likely to stay at around 3 per cent to 4 per cent in the near future, which would deter carry traders, Lo said.\nThe city's strong stock market and many popular initial public offerings recently had led to strong demand for the Hong Kong dollar, which would keep the Hibor between 2 per cent and 3 per cent, said Tommy Ong, managing director of T.O. & Associates Consultancy.\nIf the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates, the Hibor would decline and local commercial banks would soon lower their prime lending rates, Lo said.\nHowever, Bank of East Asia (BEA) co-CEO Adrian Li Man-kiu said commercial banks could choose not to reduce their prime rates, even though BEA expected the US to cut its key rate by 50 basis points by the end of this year.\n\"The saving rate is very low at the moment, so it is hard to get much lower, and hence it would be hard to cut the prime rate lower,\" Li said at the bank's results briefing on Thursday.\nHong Kong's commercial banks trimmed their prime rate three times from September to December by a combined 62.5 basis points to 5.25 per cent or 5.5 per cent, while cutting their savings rate by the same margin to 0.25 per cent.\nRyan Lam Chun-wang, head of research for Hong Kong at Shanghai Commercial Bank, said the US would have two 25-basis-point cuts this year, accompanied by two 12.5-basis-point cuts in the Hong Kong dollar prime rate. The Hibor would stay above 2 per cent, he added.\nIf Hong Kong lenders were to cut the prime rate by 12.5 basis points twice, the rate would drop to a historic low of 5 per cent, and the savings rate would drop to zero.","content_hash":"b4cd62dba979d1ceaff1f6d0ad910091","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5725,"method_rank":0}

But what about the specifics? How much does someone who’s actually made it to 75 spend each month? I asked ChatGPT to break down the monthly expenses of upper-middle-class retirees at age 75, and the AI’s detailed response offers a realistic picture of what comfortable retirement actually costs.\n“The monthly spending of an upper middle class retiree at age 75 can vary based on lifestyle, location and health,” ChatGPT explained, “but we can estimate a typical range based on reliable financial data sources like the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), EBRI (Employee Benefit Research Institute) and retirement studies.”\nBefore diving into the numbers, ChatGPT defined what “upper middle class retiree” actually means. According to the AI’s analysis, these retirees typically have:\nRetirement savings of $500,000 to $2 million or more\nThis isn’t Warren Buffett money, but it’s also not scraping by on Social Security alone. These are people who saved consistently throughout their careers and can afford some discretionary spending without constantly worrying about running out of money.\nChatGPT provided a detailed category-by-category breakdown of where the money goes each month:\nHousing: $1,200-$2,000 Monthly\nThis includes property taxes, maintenance, insurance and utilities. “Many 75-year-olds own their home,” ChatGPT wrote, which is why this number is lower than you might expect. No mortgage payment makes a huge difference in housing costs.\nEven so, housing remains the largest expense category. Property taxes don’t disappear with the mortgage, and maintenance costs can actually increase as both the house and homeowner age.\nHealthcare: $800-$1,200 Monthly\n“Healthcare becomes a larger portion of spending at this age,” the AI observed. This category includes Medicare premiums, supplemental insurance, prescription drugs and out-of-pocket medical expenses.\nAt 75, healthcare isn’t just about annual checkups anymore. Regular specialist visits, prescription medications and potential long-term care needs all contribute to making this the second-largest expense category.\nFood and Dining: $600-$900 Monthly\nThis covers both groceries and eating out. Interestingly, this amount might actually be lower than what working-age people spend, since retirees often have more time to cook at home and may eat smaller portions.\nTransportation: $400-$700 Monthly\nCar payments (if any), gas, insurance, maintenance and registration fees fall into this category. Many 75-year-olds are driving less than they used to, which helps keep these costs manageable.\nEntertainment and Travel: $500-$1,000 Monthly\n“Travel and entertainment spending might decline compared to early retirement,” ChatGPT wrote. At 75, the big international adventures might be winding down, but there’s still budget for hobbies and visiting family.\nEverything Else: $600-$1,100 Monthly\nThis includes utilities, communication costs and miscellaneous personal expenses. Phone bills, internet, clothing, personal care and all the other small expenses that add up.\nThe Total Picture: $4,100-$6,900 Monthly\nWhen you add it all up, ChatGPT calculated that upper-middle-class retirees at age 75 spend between $4,100 and $6,900 monthly. That’s roughly $49,000 to $83,000 annually.\nFor context, that’s a pretty comfortable lifestyle without being lavish. It’s enough to maintain a nice home, handle healthcare needs, travel occasionally and enjoy hobbies without constantly checking the bank balance.\nHow Do They Afford It?\nChatGPT explained that these retirees typically “draw ~3-4% annually from retirement assets to supplement Social Security and pensions.” This follows the traditional retirement withdrawal rule that says you can safely withdraw about 4% of your retirement savings each year.\nSo, if you’ve got $1 million saved, that’s about $40,000 annually or roughly $3,300 monthly from your retirement accounts. Add Social Security (which averages around $1,900 monthly for higher earners) and possibly a pension, and you can see how the math works out.\nWhat the Numbers Really Mean\nThe spending ranges ChatGPT provided reflect the reality that retirement costs vary significantly based on where you live and what kind of lifestyle you want. Someone in rural Arkansas will spend far less on housing than someone in suburban California, even within the same economic class.\nHealth is another major variable. “Healthcare becomes a larger portion of spending at this age,” the AI wrote, but that could mean anything from routine maintenance to managing chronic conditions or dealing with serious illness. It can also vary based on your doctors, what insurance you carry and any health issues you’re dealing with.\nPlanning Implications\nChatGPT’s breakdown suggests that if you want to maintain an upper-middle-class lifestyle at 75, you’re looking at needing roughly $50,000-$80,000 in annual income. With Social Security covering maybe half of that for higher earners, you need your savings and other income sources to provide $25,000-$40,000 annually.\nUsing the 4% withdrawal rule, that means having $625,000 to $1 million in retirement savings — right in line with ChatGPT’s definition of upper-middle-class retirement assets.\nUnderstanding these numbers now, while you’re still working and saving, gives you a clear target for retirement planning. Because according to ChatGPT’s breakdown, comfortable retirement at 75 is achievable but it definitely doesn’t happen by accident.","content_hash":"fbcc2a49343920a5325e5896e59a67f7","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5551,"method_rank":0}

P&G said in a statement that it has introduced bumbum as part of its broader strategy to offer superior products, and that the diaper complements its Pampers and Luvs brands.\nP&G, which makes household basics spanning from Dawn dish soap to Tide laundry detergent, did not respond to questions about the diaper's manufacturing in China or the effects of tariffs. Target did not respond to a request for comment.\nP&G shares held steady in premarket trading on Monday, after falling by over 5% this year so far.\nP&G’s shift to ship diapers from China shows how imports have been more attractive because of the costs of U.S.-made goods, and that the consumer products maker is searching for a way to grow sales in its top categories like baby care.\nAt Target, P&G's top-of-the-line Pampers Pure diapers cost about 37 cents per each size 2 diaper, fitting an infant weighing up to 18 pounds, while another Chinese-made luxury brand, Millie Moon, are 28 cents. Bumbum diapers are a penny less than Millie Moon.\nP&G is increasing prices partly due to tariffs, executives said last month, even as its sales falter due to shoppers spending less because of worries about the economy. The levies have already led to price hikes on other essential baby products including car seats and strollers, which are largely made in China.\nP&G executives have said on earnings calls over the last 18 months that sales in their baby business are down, and that they are working on enhancements to their brands.\nPampers, which still leads the $5.4 billion U.S. disposable baby diaper market, saw its share of it slip to 32.3% in 2024 from 32.5% in 2022, while budget brand Luvs saw a drop to 6.9% last year from 9% in 2019, according to Euromonitor.\nPricie Hanna, founding partner of Price Hanna Consultants, which focuses on diapers and other absorbent products like pads, said P&G may be testing bumbum in Target to later incorporate some of the features in U.S.-made Pampers.\nThe new diapers are advertised as being aloe-enriched with \"cloud-like\" softness, echoing rival Millie Moon's claim of \"cloud touch\" softness.\nCompetitor Kimberly-Clark last year introduced a value-priced Snug & Dry diaper - which it advertises as \"cloud soft\" - using Chinese research and development and supply chain teams.\nThe U.S. diaper market is cut-throat as fewer babies are born, pushing manufacturers to come up with improvements they can charge more for and market to attract new customers.\nChinese-made diapers, which may have once been rejected by new parents, have grown in popularity. Imports by weight of diapers made in China more than tripled in the two years ended April 23, according to import data provider ImportYeti.\nThe quality of Chinese-made diapers has significantly increased and there is no discernible difference between those made in China and the United States, industry experts said. The Chinese government also heavily subsidizes factories making diapers and their components, and laborers earn significantly less, allowing the products to undercut U.S.-made ones, the experts said.\nPrice hikes reflecting tariffs have yet to fully hit store shelves, with more expected in the fall as retailers sell older inventory. The increases could lead to consumers searching for even cheaper brands.\nHowever, if tariffs lead to further price hikes on Chinese-made diapers, consumers could switch out of them, Hanna said.\nBRANDS GROW SHARE\nOther China-made brands include Parasol which is available at Target and Amazon.com Parasol is a premium product, priced at roughly 42 cents each, less than other high-end European-made and Canadian-made brands such as Coterie and HealthyBaby. Some store-brand diapers are also made in China, industry experts said.\n\"The thing is that the diapers from China are so cheap from the get-go,\" said Shazi Visram, the founder of HealthyBaby.\nHong Kong-based Zuru Edge's Rascals and Millie Moon brands have been winning over new parents with cut-rate prices, soft material and social media campaigns. The Rascals brand sells for about 21 cents a diaper at Walmart.\nRascals and Millie Moon have had triple-digit compounded annual growth rates since 2020 and 2021, respectively, according to Bain Consulting, citing Nielsen data.\nTheir market share, totaling 3.5% last year, according to Bain, is still tiny compared to Pampers. The consulting firm said the figure does not cover all of the brands' sales, such as e-commerce, and \"only depicts a portion of their growth story.\"\nZuru Edge did not immediately return a request for comment.\nParasol founder Jessica Hung said that so far she has been looking to cut costs rather than pass price hikes along to shoppers. For example, she is now packing the diapers in a plain brown box rather than one with colorful prints.\n\"It wouldn't kill the market to pass on the price, but we would definitely lose some customers,\" she said.\n(Reporting by Jessica DiNapoli in New York; Editing by Anna Driver)","content_hash":"d688d30ef466734f21bc014c6e7a5cc7","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5537,"method_rank":0}

The big picture is that Realty Income is a great choice for long-term income investors who are trying to set themselves up with reliable streams of dividends. Here's a deeper dive into this attractive high-yield investment opportunity.\nWhat does Realty Income do?\nRealty Income is a net lease REIT. That means that it owns single-tenant properties, but rents them out under contracts that make the tenants responsible for most property-level operating costs. That may seem weird. Why would tenants want to take on property-level costs? Because it gives them effective control of the property.\nUsually, a net lease is signed when a company sells a property to a REIT and then instantly leases it back. These are often long-term leases with regular rent increases built into them. The property in question is likely to be important to the business, but if the seller wants to free up cash so it can do other things, like invest for growth, a deal like this is a solid way to do that. Net lease real estate investment trusts like Realty Income are happy to buy properties in what are, effectively, financing transactions. The results of those deals give them reliable tenants and low-maintenance assets.\nRealty Income is the largest player in the space, with a $53 billion market cap -- that's nearly four times larger than its next closest peer. It owns 15,600 properties. Around 75% of its rents come from properties occupied by retailers. Those sites are generally pretty similar to each other, so they are easy to buy, sell, and re-lease as needed. The balance of the portfolio is made up of a mix of industrial properties and \"other\" assets such as data centers and casinos.\nOn top of its property type diversification, Realty Income has geographic diversification. Unlike many of its net lease REIT peers, it has exposure to both the North American market and to countries across Europe. Moreover, given the company's size, management has been looking into other avenues for growth, including offering services to institutional investors and providing debt financing to tenants. Realty Income is a well-rounded business.\nThe pros and cons of Realty Income's size\nBeing so large is not all good. Notably, it takes a lot of investments in new properties to meaningfully grow the top and bottom lines on its income statement. That's why Realty Income has increasingly been investing in Europe, a region where the net lease approach is fairly new. It is also why management has been reaching into asset management services and looking at debt financing. It's trying to increase the number of levers it can pull to support its long-term growth. Overall, Realty Income is likely to be a slow and steady tortoise.\nThat said, being large also has benefits. Realty Income has greater access to capital markets, and its investment-grade-rated balance sheet gives it an edge on financing costs. Its size also means that it likely sees every material deal that comes to market, and it can take on transactions that smaller peers couldn't handle alone.\nAll this background is what supports a dividend that management has increased annually for three decades and counting. But there's more to this dividend story. Realty Income distributes its payouts monthly, which makes the dividend as close to a paycheck replacement as investors can get. And within that 30-year annual streak of hikes is a quarterly streak that is now 111 quarters long. So these \"paychecks\" don't just come with annual raises -- they come with quarterly pay bumps.\nNow add in Realty Income's well-above-market 5.4% dividend yield, and you'll see why income-focused investors looking to set themselves up with a lifetime of dividends would want to buy this net lease REIT giant.\nRealty Income: A strong foundation in more ways than one\nRealty Income's dividend rests upon a strong foundation. That's the key takeaway here, and why it can set you up for life on the income front. But think about the foundation that it can create for your portfolio. With that lofty yield locked in, you can balance that by buying some stocks that have lower yields now, but that are likely to provide faster dividend growth. Even if you don't go down that route, slow and steady income from a high-yielding industry leader like Realty Income is hard to complain about.\nShould you buy stock in Realty Income right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Realty Income wasn’t one of them.

If the stock market is any indication, the U.S. economy is absolutely booming.\nEconomic data from Aug. 14, however, has investors wringing their hands. These days, everyone is talking about inflation. While consumer prices seemed to be getting back under control, inflation is heating up for producers.\nThe Producer Price Index increased 0.9% in July from the previous month. That might sound trivial, but it was the biggest increase in three years.\nWhen there's inflation for producers, it means their costs are going up. Some economists believe this is happening because of tariffs put in place by the Trump administration. The rising inflation for producers could soon trickle down to inflation for consumers as companies increase prices to offset the higher costs.\nConsidering the stock market is soaring and inflation is rising, is it only a matter of time before stocks crash back down to earth?\nHow inflation can hurt stocks\nPerhaps it's best to take a step back and consider why stocks go up in the first place. Generally speaking, long-term growth in profits leads to long-term stock price appreciation. Let's use Amazon stock as an example. Over the last decade, its operating profit has skyrocketed, leading to a nearly 800% gain for the stock.\nHerein lies the problem with inflation for producers: When their costs go up, their profits go down. To get their profits back, they either have to figure out ways to bring costs down or they must raise their end prices to consumers.\nHowever, raising prices can be tricky as well. Consumers don't have unlimited budgets. As prices increase, consumers get more picky when it comes to discretionary spending.\nMoreover, ongoing inflation encourages the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, which slows the economy down as well.\nOn the surface, it would seem like the Producer Price Index is a canary in the coal mine: July inflation heated up, which could send ripples through the economy and sink stocks.\nLet's tap the brakes\nPerhaps it sounds like I've outlined a reasonable argument for investors to panic. Again, it makes sense to take a step back and this time, get some perspective from some of the greatest investors of all time.\nIt would seem that a market crash is imminent, perhaps even before the end of 2025. But investing great Warren Buffett had this to say in his 1992 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders:\nWe've long felt that the only value of stock forecasters is to make fortune tellers look good. Even now, Charlie and I continue to believe that short-term market forecasts are poison and should be kept locked up in a safe place, away from children and also from grown-ups who behave in the market like children.\nBuffett's right-hand man Charlie Munger agreed with this sentiment and said many years later, \"Sometimes we had a tailwind from the economy and sometimes we had a headwind. Either way, we just kept swimming.\"\nIn his book Beating the Street, Peter Lynch said: \"I can't recall ever once having seen the name of a market timer on Forbes' list of the richest people in the world. If it were truly possible to predict corrections, you'd think somebody would have made billions by doing it.\"\nPerhaps one can predict a stock market crash will happen within the next 12 months. Perhaps inflation for producers is pointing to a crash sooner rather than later. But Buffett, Munger, and Lynch are three of the best to ever invest -- even doing half as well as this trio would make you a very successful investor. And yet, all three agree that trying to predict the timing of a market crash is futile.\nFor this reason, I wouldn't personally sell my stocks in anticipation of a downturn from inflation or any other headwind -- a winning investment approach keeps you mostly invested through thick and thin.\nThat said, there is a way to prepare. Crashes do frequently occur on the stock market, and irrational fear can lead to some incredible bargains. Knowing that pullbacks are normal can help mitigate this fear, while having some cash on the sidelines ready to invest can allow prepared investors to take advantage of opportunities as they come up.\nThe jump in producer prices could eventually lead to some pain in stocks, and new tariffs could exacerbate the problem. In the meantime, consider taking the advice from Munger and just keep swimming.\nShould you buy stock in S&P 500 Index right now?\nBefore you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and S&P 500 Index wasn’t one of them.

But having certainty about it happening someday is very different from having clarity about the chances of it happening sometime soon.\nRight now, the balance of evidence suggests the market is more likely to wobble before resuming its upward march than it is to crater. Here's what's going on and why fears of a crash are a bit overblown at the moment.\nWhat would actually crack the market\nCrashes rarely happen without a catalyst. The simplest catalyst for a crash would be a sharp macro shock that sucks liquidity out of risk assets, like cryptocurrencies.\nCentral banks are generally not tightening their policy rates today. The European Central Bank (ECB) cut its interest rate in June and is signaling patience, not a fresh squeeze, which reduces one common crash trigger. The U.S. Federal Reserve may still be debating its next step, but many are anticipating that it will lean toward cuts later this year, which is not crash fuel either. And, for the record, if for some reason the Fed decides to hike interest rates in the name of controlling inflation rather than leaving them alone or delivering the cuts that the market is expecting, it might cause a painful downturn in crypto, but even then it probably wouldn't spark an outright crash.\nAnother route to a crash would be a policy reversal, for which there is no evidence of presently.\nIn the U.S., regulators in the new Trump administration have backed broader access and clearer rulebooks, and they have also repudiated the idea of crackdowns as being the preferred approach to regulating the crypto industry. Even where the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has tapped the brakes, as it has recently with the approval of certain exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the story is more about timing and getting enough breathing room to craft sensible policies, not a return to outright prohibition.\nStill, investors should watch for pockets of froth that can amplify routine pullbacks or potentially provide the kernel of instability that could lead to a crash in the future.\nIn particular, the wave of Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC) and other cryptocurrency treasury companies is a concern. Because some of those businesses effectively use financial leverage in the form of debt to finance their purchases of cryptocurrencies, they could eventually become insolvent if prices of their chosen assets decline significantly. But they'd probably become forced sellers well in advance of that, which, given their substantial holdings, could easily add fuel to a downtrend that might culminate in a crash.\nWhy this backdrop is an opportunity to buy\nVolatility is a fixture of the crypto markets. That means when prices are bouncing around on a weekly or monthly basis, you should not be dissuaded from investing. Put differently, now is one of those times when it might feel nauseating to buy crypto, but if you trust your gut, it's more likely that you'll end up sidelined during a bull run than safe during a crash.\nIn terms of factors supporting the crypto market, the ongoing bid from financial institutions is broadening, which tends to cushion dips. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs and the newer Ethereum(CRYPTO: ETH) ETFs have created consistent demand from pensions, advisors, institutional investors, and other wealth platforms. Even after choppy days, the cumulative flows and steadily rising assets under management (AUM) tell the more important story.\nOther than ETFs, corporate balance sheets are buying major crypto assets. And government policy is also far friendlier than before.\nThe White House published a fact sheet in March describing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) built from forfeited assets, signaling a preference to hold rather than auction. Congress, for its part, just got stablecoin legislation signed into law via the Genius Act, clarifying a critical segment that underpins much of crypto's plumbing. Furthermore, the total value of stablecoins themselves as an asset class are growing again, which is typically a sign of healthier liquidity on-chain.\nOf course, none of this immunizes crypto from drawdowns. It merely lowers the odds of a crash without a clear catalyst.\nTherefore, the highest-probability path for long-term investors is the most boring one. Keep dollar-cost averaging (DCAing) into your chosen coins on a schedule, keep some cash ready to buy dips, and keep your investment thesis grounded in quantitative evidence, not adrenaline.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

The Chinese government appeared to make this decision in response to statements made by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick regarding China's use of American technology.\nIndeed, Nvidia and most other American companies have wanted to capitalize on China's growth, given the country's population of 1.4 billion. However, investors seem to have remained bullish on the stock, and the news might not be as negative for the artificial intelligence (AI) stock as some might assume. Here's why.\nWhat prompted China to \"ban\" Nvidia H20 chips\nChina's animosity toward Nvidia started when Lutnick made some controversial statements about China.\nSpeaking with CNBC, Lutnick stated that Chinese companies would only get Nvidia's \"fourth best\" chip. He further noted, \"you want to sell the Chinese enough that they get addicted to the American technology stack.\"\nChinese authorities called the statement \"insulting.\" Although China has worked to transition away from American technology for some time, the country now seems determined to hasten these efforts. Thus, its government asked its regulators to find ways to move Chinese companies away from Nvidia's H20 chips.\nDespite this news, Nvidia stock rose in Friday trading. Admittedly, that is likely because the Nasdaq Composite index rose nearly 1.9% during the trading day, as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell strongly indicated that the Fed will cut interest rates beginning at its September meeting next month.\nNvidia stock modestly trailed this performance with a 1.7% gain, but the lack of an adverse reaction indicates investors took this news in stride.\nWhy it is likely not a negative for Nvidia stock\nThe muted reaction likely happened because Nvidia's investors are not heavily focused on the H20.\nThe H20 is based on Nvidia's old architecture. Competitors such as AMD and other chip design companies have either matched or surpassed the older technology. Thus, the company's competitive advantage no longer lies with this chip, and it does not command premium prices.\nInstead, Nvidia's investors are more focused on its latest release, the Blackwell architecture GPU, and the upcoming Vera Rubin, which it will likely release next year. Such products are what drive premium pricing and, by extension, the company's fast-growing revenue and profit levels.\nThe U.S. government has long forbidden Nvidia from selling its latest technology to China. While this might be a negative under some circumstances, the struggles to meet current demand have overshadowed this concern.\nIn Nvidia's first quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended April 27), revenue of $44 billion rose 69% from year-ago levels. Around 89% of that revenue, or $39 billion, came from its data center segment, which designs its AI chips. That segment grew revenue by 73% compared to year-ago levels.\nMoreover, the company forecast $45 billion in revenue for fiscal Q2, a 50% increase if it meets that estimate. However, investors should also note that the forecast from three months ago included an $8 billion loss in H20 revenue from export restrictions. While Nvidia may not have foreseen the latest H20 restrictions at the time, the company has a history of adapting to such limitations.\nAlso, since fiscal Q2 ended July 27, its results will not factor in these restrictions. Still, investors will likely await further details on this crackdown when Nvidia reports for this quarter on Aug. 27, and it remains unclear how investors will react to such news.\nNvidia and the China restrictions\nUltimately, the restrictions on H20 sales in China are unlikely to change the buy thesis on Nvidia stock.\nAdmittedly, this change is not a positive for the company, and losing business in such a large market, particularly for political reasons, could have more negative implications.\nNonetheless, the H20 chip does not command the premium pricing like Nvidia's latest releases, and it faces more competition in the lower ends of the market. Additionally, restrictions on the H20 are nothing new for the company, and it has already factored at least some of the lost sales from this chip into its estimates.\nConsidering this does not affect the company's latest technology, Nvidia bulls should not change their outlook on the stock.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

That was good news for the Hibor-linked borrowers, who made up 94.7 per cent of the new loans taken out in June, according to data compiled by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). Prime rate-based loans made up 1.7 per cent, while fixed-rate loans made up 0.1 per cent, the HKMA said.\nStill, the 4 percentage points gap between the Hibor and US interest rates created room for the so-called carry trade, enabling currency arbitrageurs to borrow at low rates (Hong Kong) to invest at high rates (the US), hence weakening the local currency.\nTo defend the local currency, the HKMA intervened in the currency market 12 times over the past two months to maintain the dollar's peg. That caused the one-month Hibor - used for pricing mortgages - to jump to 2.7272 per cent on Monday, compared with 0.9520 per cent two weeks ago, according to the Hong Kong Association of Banks. This resulted in the effective Hibor-linked mortgage rate doubling to 3.5 per cent last week, compared to 1.82 per cent in June.","content_hash":"3af7b984098ec3044e2f19bd9cfb8922","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5334,"method_rank":0}

(AP Photo\/Andy Wong)\nBANGKOK (AP) — Shares in China Evergrande were removed from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Monday, marking another step in the retreat of the giant real estate developer whose downfall contributed to a prolonged crisis in China's property market.\nEvergrande's creditors are still working to wind up debts that amounted to more than $340 billion. Once China's second-largest developer, it ran into trouble when Chinese regulators cracked down several years ago on what they deemed to be excess borrowing by developers.\nThat caused dozens of property companies to default on their debts, triggering a downturn in the property market that is still dragging on the world's second-largest economy.\nHere's what to know about Evergrande:\nThe delisting of a one-time leader in China's property market\nThe Hong Kong Exchange said Monday that Evergrande's shares were delisted as of Monday morning, as expected. The shares were last traded on January 29, 2024, and then suspended after a court in Hong Kong ordered liquidation of the company when it failed to provide a viable debt restructuring plan.\nRules of the exchange stipulate that a company's share listing may be canceled if trading in its securities is suspended for 18 straight months.\nEvergrande's role in China's property crisis\nAfter years of warnings that led to global rating agencies cutting the Chinese government’s credit rating in 2017, the ruling communist party cracked down on real estate debt in 2020. It imposed controls known as “three red lines” that prohibited heavily indebted developers like Evergrande from borrowing more to pay off bonds and bank loans as they matured.\nFears of a possible Evergrande default in 2021 rattled global markets, but they eased after the Chinese central bank said its problems were contained and Beijing would keep credit markets functioning. Evergrande was one of the biggest of many developers that failed to repay their creditors.\nChinese home buyers often pay up front for apartments before they're even built. The credit crunch for Evergrande and other developers led them to suspend construction, leaving many projects in limbo. The slowing of home purchases and building rippled throughout the economy, hitting demand for construction materials, appliances and even vehicles at a time when China was also contending with disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSince most Chinese families have their wealth tied up in property, the anemic housing market has been a major factor crimping consumer spending.\nThe property downturn grinds on\nThere has been some recovery in the housing sector, but home prices and investment have continued to fall.\nBefore the crackdown on borrowing, real estate accounted for some 20% of China’s economy. When spending on steel and copper for construction, furniture and other related purchases was added in, estimates of its share of the economy rose to about a third.\nChina’s leaders have sought to get developers to finish projects and deliver apartments that already were paid for, providing billions in lending and subsidies. They’ve encouraged local governments to buy up excess apartments to serve as affordable housing, and relaxed down payment and mortgage requirements.\nThey've also lifted many restrictions on purchases of homes for investment purposes in major cities, a move that analysts at HSBC Global Investment Research described as “surprising” as they came earlier than expected.\nSales and home prices were expected to fall further in August, they said in a recent report.\n“We think it’s a positive change showing government’s enhanced proactiveness in rolling out measures, which will help strengthen market confidence and address the concern on stimulus being too late,” it said.\nEvergrande's status\nEvergrande, headquartered in southern China's Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, was founded by entrepreneur Hui Ka Yan, who is also known as Xu Jiayin, in 1996. Its ascent and decline have mirrored the boom and bust in China's property market after housing reforms allotted apartments built by state-owned industries to employees, creating a nation of home owners.\nThe company's shares were listed in Hong Kong in 2009.\nEvergrande filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in New York City in 2023, but that case was later withdrawn. Although a Hong Kong court ordered a winding up of the company's debts, more than 90 percent of its assets are on the Chinese mainland, making it difficult to enforce repayment to its creditors.\nIts liquidators said in a recent progress report that they had received debt claims totaling $45 billion as of Jul. 31, much higher than the some $27.5 billion of liabilities disclosed in December 2022, and that the new figure was not final. They also had taken control of more then 100 companies within the group with collective assets valued at $3.5 billion as of Jan. 29, 2024.\nSo far, about $255 million worth of assets have been sold, the liquidators said, calling the realization “modest.”","content_hash":"5a107c8e12f8539be1cdcf31e826bfe7","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5298,"method_rank":0}

That is a tall order, but it has been done before, with Tesla showing that it is indeed possible.\nBut it is also possible that Rivian could fall short of its goal, as many upstart electric vehicle (EV) companies have also done. So, the big question is: Is the stock worth buying now?\nWhat is Rivian trying to do?\nAt its core, Rivian is an industrial business built around manufacturing highly complex and expensive products. Creating such a business from the ground up is very time-consuming and very expensive, which helps to explain why Rivian is bleeding red ink today. And it is highly likely to keep posting losses for years to come. If you are a conservative investor, you will probably want to avoid Rivian stock.\nHowever, there's an interesting twist here. Tesla basically created the EV space, proving to the established automakers that there was a real business in what had previously been considered just an enthusiast's niche. Tesla brought in new technology that disrupted the old way of doing things. Rivian is trying to ride on Tesla's coattails to break into the auto industry, too.\nLike Tesla, Rivian has started out with a high-end model. And like Tesla, it is now working on bringing out a lower-priced option for the mass market. The company has switched from focusing on increasing volume to a focus on turning a profit. And it has made strong progress, having hit its target of generating a modest gross profit in the final quarter of 2024. It repeated the feat in the first quarter of 2025 but fell short in the second quarter of the year.\nThere are some near-term headwinds to consider\nA gross profit is not the same as producing positive earnings. A gross profit just means that Rivian sold each car for more than the car cost to produce. There are other costs further down the income statement that will continue to keep it from getting into the black.\nThe company is a start-up, so that's to be expected. What's important is that it hits its internal goals and, so far, it has done a good job of that. And this success has allowed Rivian to partner with industry-leading companies like Volkswagen and Amazon and attract ample growth capital.\nBut the change in administrations in Washington has shifted the playing field. The once-generous government support for EVs has become less so. And Rivian has updated its full-year forecast for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) in a downward direction. That's not good, but it is the kind of thing that happens from time to time.\nThe company continues to focus on what it can control, which right now is execution. The next big goal is bringing out a lower-priced model, likely in 2026, that will help it reach mass-market customers.\nBasically, Rivian has plenty of cash on its balance sheet (over $7 billion) to support its business and is making steady progress as it builds out that business. It is not a low-risk investment, but for more-aggressive investors, it might still be worth a closer look. If Rivian can achieve even half the success that Tesla has, the future could be very bright for the stock.\nGo in understanding the risks\nAlthough some of Rivian's upstart EV peers have fallen by the wayside, it continues to move forward. The company's execution has been very good, and that suggests that a positive outcome looks increasingly possible.\nBut it is still a money-losing start-up, so there is always the risk that it, too, falls by the wayside -- which is why only aggressive long-term investors should be looking at it. The upside could be huge, but you need to understand the risks you are taking if you buy a company that is still in the early stages of its development.\nShould you buy stock in Rivian Automotive right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Rivian Automotive wasn’t one of them.

Stocks were mostly lower and shorter-maturing Treasury yields, which are more sensitive to Fed action, moved higher.\n\"I'm on the slower side more than the faster side if the Fed, does go,\" said Jason Granet, chief investment officer at BNY. \"He definitely moved the door ajar, as opposed to kicked it wide open for September.\"\nTraders on Monday were pricing in a near-certainty of a September quarter percentage point reduction from the Fed's current target rate, currently around 4.3%. The implied probability of 82% was only slightly higher than a week ago but well above the 62% odds of a month ago, according to the CME Group's FedWatch measure of futures prices.\nHowever, there is less certainty from there.\nPotential slow pace ahead\nThe implied probability for another cut in October was just 42%. That second cut is about fully priced in for December, but there's just a 33% expectation for three total moves this year.\n\"I think there's more to play for in the data between now and the September meeting,\" Granet said. \"So then the question will start to center around pace.\"\nSkeptics of a faster easing pace center their arguments around ongoing concerns about tariff-induced inflation and an economy that is holding up despite signs that the labor market is slowing.\n\"Although we are aware of the extreme political pressures on the Fed to ease, and we acknowledge cracks emerging in some labor market data, from our perch ... the case for cuts looks modest,\" Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley, said in a note. \"And we can't help but ask — what problem, exactly, does the Fed feel an urgency to solve?\"\nDespite the market pricing, Morgan Stanley sees just a 50% probability for a September reduction. The firm also cited uncertainty about inflation as well as the Fed's commitment to independence amid the heat from President Donald Trump and White House officials to lower rates.\nShalett also cautioned clients about putting too much faith in Fed easing for the next leg up in stocks as \"we question the impact of rate cuts in any case, given the reality that absent recession, an easing cycle is apt to be shallow while the interest rate sensitivity of the biggest economic agents has meaningfully declined.\"\nWorries over a repeat of 2024\nIndeed, there are ongoing questions about the impact of Fed rates in the current climate.\nAt this time a year ago, the central bank entered an easing mode that ended up having unintended consequences — an inverse move in Treasury yields and mortgage rates pushed by worries that the Fed might be taking its foot off the brake too soon along with expectations for stronger economic growth.\nThat's the kind of consideration that has market veteran Ed Yardeni wondering about the wisdom of another round of cuts as he worries that Powell might be wrong about the temporary impulse of inflation from Trump's tariffs.\n\"The Fed won't listen to me. Of course, they'll do what they're going to do,\" the head of Yardeni Research said Monday on CNBC. \"The cautious tale is what happened last year when the Fed lowered by 100 basis points and the bond yield went up 100 basis points.\"\nShould that happen again, it would thwart the White House's hopes for lower financing costs on the national debt and a boost for the housing market through lower mortgage rates.\nOn the bright side, though, Yardeni thinks the equity market rally will get a boost from rate cuts, and he is maintaining his bullish view on stocks even in the face of a potential policy mistake. Yardeni thinks the S&P 500 could add another 2% from here to close the year around 6,600, then climb another 14% in 2026 to close at 7,500.\n\"I think we're going to have a continuation of the bull market, but I think it's going to be earnings led,\" he said. \"If the Fed does go ahead and lower rates on Sept. 17, I think my targets may be too conservative right now.\"","content_hash":"02158aac9f7349338d5db8bfda2c14ef","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4682,"method_rank":0}

After getting a taste of remote or hybrid work during the pandemic, many workers are pushing back against strict schedules and return-to-office mandates.\n\"I think we are collectively just super tired of being told what to do as humans,\" Fike says.\nCompanies 'don't feel like figuring it out'\nThere are several reasons that companies may be reluctant to relax their hours and location requirements, Fike says.\nIn Fike's view, recouping office space costs is a significant factor in RTO mandates: \"Lots of people who own real estate want to make money. That's why it's a big push, 100%.\"\nRTO mandates can also be a \"control mechanism\" for bosses who don't know how to effectively manage their teams without seeing them in-person, she says.\n\"I think managers and leaders get lazy,\" Fike says. \"They can get creative with a lot of these things; they just don't want to. You hear 'it's hard' a lot, or 'that wouldn't work for us.' What that means to me is 'I just don't feel like figuring it out.'\"\nLack of flexibility is a major motivation for employees seek other jobs or leave the workplace altogether in favor of freelance or contract work, Fike says.\n\"They're really just fed up with someone telling them where and when they can work, and where and when they can have lunch,\" she says. \"We're adults. Do we really want to be told this?\"\nThe future of work is flexible\nThe key to a successful workplace is \"asking people what they need,\" Fike says.\nMany Gen Z employees prioritize coming into the office so that they can learn from their peers. On the other hand, there are plenty of workers \"who never want to go to an office again – and that's OK, too,\" she says.\nNot everyone feels most productive between the hours of 9 and 5, Fike says.\n\"There's so many different ways that our brains work, and yet we want to pigeonhole every single human being that's nuanced and complicated into the exact same way of working — and then we wonder why it doesn't work.\"\nFike says that she didn't figure out her prime productivity hours until she stopped working in a corporate setting.\n\"If we could actually help people discover those things in their early 20s, as opposed to their late 30s or early 40s, which is where most people actually discover that, imagine what we could do in productivity in that time,\" she says.\nOne successful strategy that she's seen companies implement is setting 'core hours': employees are largely allowed to make their own schedules, but they are asked to be reasonably available during a certain time frame every day.\n\"I always encourage businesses to just talk to people, set up various ways of working, and try things in in the workplace,\" Fike says.\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

Nvidia is expected to post a 48% rise in earnings per share on revenue of $45.9 billion for its second fiscal quarter, according to data firm LSEG. However, investors will be watching for the company's outlook to see how tariffs, China and artificial intelligence investments are panning out.\n\"Saying this is the most important stock in the world is an understatement,\" said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. \"The stock's average move after an earnings release is plus or minus 7.4%, so just an average move will make an impact on the entire market.\" Nvidia has a heavy weighting in major stock indexes, especially the Nasdaq and S&P 500.\n\"As Nvidia goes, so go most of the semiconductor stocks and AI plays,\" he said. \"They are the dominant player in the space and positive forward guidance combined with continued strong demand will likely lift the sector. Any surprising slowdown and the negative impact could be dramatic.\"\nAt the end of the week, investors will also see the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the July personal consumption expenditure price index. Core PCE, minus volatile food and energy prices, are expected to rise 2.9% on a year-over-year basis, compared to a 2.8% increase in June, according to economists polled by FactSet.\n\"It is still premature to dismiss tariff impacts on consumer prices at this stage, even if PCE is well behaved,\" wrote RBC’s Chief Economist Frances Donald and U.S. Economist Carrie Freestone. \"There will be a lag between tariff-driven producer prices and consumer prices, and we don’t expect consumer prices to show more serious evidence of tariffs until late\" in the third quarter.\nThe blue-chip Dow slid 0.77%, or 349.27 points, to 45,282.47; the broad S&P 500 fell 0.43%, or 27.59 points, to 6,439.32 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 0.22%, or 47.243 points, to 21,449.292. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose to 4.281%.\nDespite an expected uptick in inflation, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell suggested last week he might be ready to support a rate cut soon. Stocks rallied on those comments, with the Dow closing at a record high.\nLower rates drop the cost of borrowing, which should spur business investments and consumer spending to lift the economy.\nCorporate news\n-\nKeurig Dr Pepper will buy European coffee company JDE Peet’s for roughly $18 billion.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also added 0.44% to end the day at 21,544.27. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 135.60 points, or 0.30%, to finish at 45,418.07.\nLong-term Treasury yields rose after the Trump move, while short-term yields declined as investors steepened the yield curve on the notion rates may go lower in the short-term, but eventually go higher as a politicized Fed becomes less attentive to inflation. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was last down 0.2%.\nCook plans to file a lawsuit challenging her removal by the president, her attorney said. The Fed said it \"will abide by any court decision\" on the matter.\n\"President Trump has no authority to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook,\" lawyer Abbe Lowell said in a statement. \"His attempt to fire her, based solely on a referral letter, lacks any factual or legal basis.\"\nTrump's unprecedented move adds to the pressure the president has been putting on the central bank's independence. By law, a president may only remove a Fed governor \"for cause.\"\nThere are currently six members on the Fed's board, with one seat vacant after the resignation of Adriana Kugler earlier this month. Removing Cook would leave five members, with non-Trump appointees still holding a majority. However, if Stephen Miran is cleared for the Kugler vacancy and the president is successful in removing Cook, it would give Trump a 4-3 majority.\nIf Fed Chair Jerome Powell leaves his seat voluntarily after his term expires in May, it would give the president a fifth vote.\nInvestors already appeared hopeful about the prospect of lower interest rates coming in September, as hinted at by Powell last week in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. They're additionally looking ahead to Nvidia's earnings report on Wednesday, which could bolster the megacap tech trade following its recent slide. The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks rallied Friday, but only after five straight days of losses.\n\"In the immediate term, markets will probably get over the Cook news fairly quickly (assuming this is a discrete event and Trump doesn't attempt to fire Powell), turning its attention back to Nvidia, the PCE, and jobs, but the Fed's independence is undeniably being undermined, a process with negative long-term consequences,\" said Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge.\nAlso weighing on sentiment, Trump said Monday that he plans to impose \"substantial\" new tariffs as well as export restrictions on chips for countries that do not remove digital taxes.\nSentiment was kept in check, however, by anticipation of Nvidia's earnings report scheduled for after market close Wednesday. Ameriprise Chief Market Strategist Anthony Saglimbene expects the results will be \"good.\"\n\"It all comes down to execution,\" Saglimbene said to CNBC. \"How is Nvidia going to deliver and execute on what I think are pretty elevated expectations right now? Do they guide higher? Do they guide more than what the market expects? Those are things that I think are going to influence how the market reacts.\"\nShares of the artificial intelligence chip darling were about 1% higher Tuesday, extending their meaningful gains seen in the prior two sessions.","content_hash":"e3a2994367379c15fd576591760777b8","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3504,"method_rank":0}

Eventually the kids returned with a set of grandparents in tow.\nAll in, our summer trip took seven separate bookings to pull off — a twisted mix of one-way tickets and return trips — sometimes among people on the same flight.\nBut the flexibility needed to avoid this booking ordeal, which took half a day to execute, is not only possible — it exists today, said Alex Mans, CEO of the travel tech company Flyr.\nHis company aims to transform airlines from reservation system operators to modern digital retailers that function more like Amazon and Spotify, he told \"Squawk Box Asia\" Friday.\nA key feature of this change is a familiar one, he said: the shopping cart.\n\"We are used to a shopping cart in almost every retailing experience we know — physical and digital — yet airlines are still following this very traditional linear flow when you book and manage your flights,\" he said.\nShopping carts allow flyers to buy different flights at the same time, and passengers within the same booking to choose different seat classes, luggage allowances and preferences like priority boarding, he said.\nHe referenced a CNBC Travel article about the number of business travelers who are, often quietly, taking their family and friends with them on work trips.\n\"You might be able to fly in the business cabin because your company's paying, but your family might fly in premium economy,\" he said. \"You couldn't do that today on a traditional reservation system. You'd have to make two bookings.\"\nMore than flight bookings\nNext-generation booking systems, being developed by Flyr as well as other industry players such as Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport, are helping to move airlines beyond legacy PSS, or \"passenger service system\" technology, to \"offer and order management\" systems.\nThe promise is a more personalized and flexible booking process, where passengers can easily change and refund purchases by themselves, with the option of buying more than just flights.\n\"We are helping airlines natively, so in their own website, sell hotels, car rentals, activities, insurance, even e-sims, if you go abroad, for example,\" he said. \"This allows an airline to compete much more with the travel agents, especially the online travel agents.\"\nA major test of this new system is set to occur later this year with the launch of Riyadh Air. The Saudi Arabia-based carrier, through a partnership with Flyr, will be launched without PPS technology, making it the first \"digitally native\" airline in the world, Mans said.\n\"Riyadh Air will be the world's first airline to actually get rid, or not even launch with, this legacy technology,\" he said, in a direct challenge to the long-held industry view that such tech is necessary to support travel agent distribution and connectivity to other airlines.\nOffer and order management systems are a key part of the airline industry's push for new distribution capability to personalize booking offers and increase airline revenue.\nBy next year, around 30% of sales are expected to come from new distribution capabilities, according to an Amadeus Insights Travel Technology Investment Trends report.\nIn that report, more than one in five airlines said that transitioning to becoming a retailer is one of the top three biggest priorities in airline technology today.","content_hash":"7149a6156e3d157f6089249db493c909","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3488,"method_rank":0}

Consensus estimates point to more than 50% year-over-year earnings growth thanks to artificial intelligence demand. Despite 11%-12% adjusted EPS growth over the next year, the stock is trading at just 23x forward 12-month earnings, well below the average over the past two years. The secular backdrop for Marvell would seem to be extremely strong, as the expected capex by the hyperscalers and performance of Nvidia suggest. Why then is Marvell trading at a discounted multiple? A clue might be the stock's post-earnings performance in recent years. The stock averages a 3.3% decline following the release of earnings. The stock has fallen in six of the last eight earnings releases (although fiscal Q3 2025 did see a remarkable 23% bounce). One thing is certain: while some of the AI trade dynamics affect demand for Marvell products, the company has not demonstrated that it has the kind of pricing power that Nvidia enjoys. Net income margins turned positive three quarters ago and grew to just over 12% last quarter. Respectable for sure, but fairly pedestrian when compared to the greater than 50% net income margins of Nvidia. Marvell, which closed Friday at $73 a share, is trading about 42% below the all-time highs of January, and ~48% above the lows of late April. An examination of the company's post-earnings price volatility suggests low probabilities that Marvell will trade above $85 per share, or below $60 per share by September \"regular way\" expiration on the 19th. A trader seeking to collect some options premium might then consider selling the September 85\/60 strangle. Selling the Sep $85 calls for ~$1.58 and the Sep $60 puts for $1.12 would yield $2.70 in options premium, or 3.7% of the current stock price in less than 4 weeks. That represents a \"standstill yield\" of more than 50% annualized. The only problem with that trade though is that, on a couple instances, Marvell has indeed significantly surprised the Street to the upside as it did when they reported fiscal Q3 25 earnings in November and fiscal Q1 24 back in May of 2023 when the stock rallied by more than 32% in a single day. The trade To mitigate the risk associated with these rare but substantial moves, one could cover the upside risk by purchasing the Sepember 90 calls for 88 cents. This would reduce the premium collected to $1.82, and therefore reduce the standstill yield to about 2.5%, but it would cover the max upside risk in the event the company delivers extraordinary results.

All eyes on Nvidia The $4.3 trillion chipmaker reports earnings on Wednesday . Options imply Nvidia could move as much as 6% on the report — or, put another way, roughly $265 billion in market cap is at stake. Nvidia is on track for its fifth straight positive month — matching the 5-month streak that ended in April 2024. The stock has surged more than 60% since President Donald Trump announced his tariffs in April — outpacing the other \"Magnificant Seven\" names. Meantime, the Jefferies' Semis, IT Hardware & Communication Tech Summit kicks off on Tuesday. Off the rails Warren Buffett told CNBC's Becky Quick that Berkshire Hathaway isn't looking to buy a train company . As a result, CSX posted its worst day since early April 3. The stock fell 5.1%. Union Pacific dropped 2% and Norfolk Southern fell 3%. CSX YTD mountain CSX shares year to date. Earnings to watch The following names are reporting results after the bell on Tuesday: PVH , Box , MongoDB and Okta . Only Okta is positive for the year.

JDE Peet's will, meanwhile, pay out a previously declared dividend of euro cents per share prior to the deal closing.\nThe takeover is expected to generate $400 million in cost synergies over three years.\nKeurig Dr Pepper, which owns brands such as Dr Pepper, 7Up, Snapple and Green Mountain Coffee, has seen shrinking sales at its U.S. coffee division, down 0.2% to $900 million in the second quarter due to a decline in the shipments of its single-serve coffee pods and Keurig coffee makers.\nKeurig Dr Pepper has been looking to raise its appeal with thrifty shoppers who prefer to drink their coffee at home, while also venturing into cold coffee offerings in a bid to attract the Starbucks and Dunkin' clientele.\nIn addition to their coffee businesses, Keurig Dr Pepper and JDE Peet's also have a shared history with JAB Holding, the investment arm of the Reimann family that at one time owned both companies. These days, JAB owns just 4.4% of KDP and no longer has any seats on its board, although it is still the majority owner of JDE Peet's.\nFollowing the JDE Peet's acquisition, which is expected to occur in the first half of 2026, Keurig Dr Pepper intends to split up its beverage and coffee units as two separate, U.S.-listed companies at the earliest opportunity. Such a step would effectively unwind the 2018 merger between Keurig and Dr Pepper Snapple, which at the time created the third-largest beverage company in North America with roughly $11 billion in annual revenue.\n\"Frankly the surprise to us was the decision back in 2018 when Keurig Green Mountain acquired the Dr Pepper Snapple Group in an $18.7 billion deal to create Keurig Dr Pepper in the first place,\" Barclays analysts Patrick Folan and Lauren Lieberman wrote in a note to clients on Monday. \"At the time, it was seen as both odd and a very left field deal with the questionable logic of combining coffee and [carbonated soft drinks].\"\nAfter the division, the resulting coffee company is anticipated to turn $16 billion in combined annual net sales and will be led by current Keurig Dr Pepper Chief Financial Officer Sudhanshu Priyadarshi.\nThe beverages firm is, meanwhile, expected to have $11 billion in annual net sales and will be helmed, upon separation, by incumbent Keurig Dr Pepper CEO Tim Cofer.\nJDE Peet's CEO, Rafael Oliveira, will stay in his post to helm the Dutch coffee company until the acquisition closes.\nFaced with fierce competition and volatile commodity prices, Keurig Dr Pepper isn't the only the company looking to spin off its coffee business. Sky News reported on Saturday that Coca-Cola is exploring a sale of Costa Coffee, which it bought in 2018 for $5.1 billion.\n— CNBC's Victor Loh contributed to this report.","content_hash":"6e9548c9003ca96a0db6e072f929725e","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3344,"method_rank":0}

Now, he is detailing a litany of grievances in the lawsuit — filed by xAI and another of his corporate entities, X Corp. — in an attempt to win monetary damages and a court order prohibiting the alleged illegal tactics.\nThe double-barreled legal attack weaves together several recently unfolding narratives to recast a year-old partnership between Apple and OpenAI as a veiled conspiracy to stifle competition during a technological shift that could prove as revolutionary as the 2007 release of the iPhone.\n“This is a tale of two monopolists joining forces to ensure their continued dominance in a world rapidly driven by the most powerful technology humanity has ever created: artificial intelligence,” the lawsuit asserts.\nThe complaint portrays Apple as a company that views AI as an “existential threat” to its future success, prompting it to collude with OpenAI in an attempt to protect the iPhone franchise that has long been its biggest moneymaker.\nSome of the allegations accusing Apple of trying to shield the iPhone from do-everything “super apps,” such as the one Musk has long been trying to create with X, echo an antitrust lawsuit filed against Apple last year by the U.S. Department of Justice.\nThe complaint casts OpenAI as a threat to humanity bent on putting profits before public safety as it tries to build on its phenomenal growth since the late 2022 release of ChatGPT. The depiction mirrors one already being drawn in another federal lawsuit that Musk filed last year, alleging OpenAI had betrayed its founding mission to serve as a nonprofit research lab for the public good.\nOpenAI has countered with a lawsuit against Musk accusing him of harassment — an allegation that the company cited in its response to Monday's antitrust lawsuit. “This latest filing is consistent with Mr. Musk’s ongoing pattern of harassment,” OpenAI said in a statement.\nApple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe crux of the lawsuit revolves around Apple's decision to use ChatGPT as an AI-powered “answer engine” on the iPhone when the built-in technology on its device couldn't satisfy user needs. The partnership announced last year was part of Apple's late entry into the AI race that was supposed to be powered mostly by its own on-device technology, but the company still hasn't been able to deliver on all its promises.","content_hash":"7ac046e2e9a85fa201ce49f1def044e2","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2889,"method_rank":0}

See today's video update from Mike above.) Stocks regroup after Friday's broad and emphatic \"risk-on\" rally, responding to the increased likelihood that the Federal Reserve will resume cutting interest rates next month into a still-steady economy with equity indexes near record highs. Indexes seeing a modest reversal of Friday's trends: Small-cap Russell 2000 and the Dow Industrials – big winners in Friday's move from large to small and growth to value – are lagging the S & P 500 and Nasdaq today. Also seeing Treasury yields and the U.S. Dollar Index leak a bit higher, retracing small portions of Friday's declines. Among the notable aspects of Friday's rally was that 90% of NYSE volume was to the upside, a relatively rare display of lopsided buying demand, all the more unusual for occurring with the major indexes at or barely below a record high. The forward implications of this kind of all-in surge are generally quite positive looking out several months or more. Still, the majority of such \"90% up days\" have occurred when the market is bursting out of a correction or bear market, not after a skimpy 1.8% dip from an all-time high, which is what the S & P 500 did in the days prior to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's Friday speech at Jackson Hole. Does this make such a signal less reliable than usual? Or does it speak to the \"everybody wins\" moment Wall Street is in, when a resumption of rate cuts with inflation above target and unemployment still low and earnings rising and credit spreads tight means the extra liquidity will be no medicine for an ailing economy, but a recreational stimulant for risk takers? Wall Street has generally rooted for a kind of \"broadening\" of the bull market in which the handful of megacap AI winners no longer dominate index returns. Fair enough, though if the broadening comes with outright megacap weakness, it's a formula for higher volatility and more fragile tape action. As exciting as the Russell 2000's surge Friday might have been, on a three-year chart it shows up as a mere bounce from a deep hole relative to the Nasdaq 100 at this point. The CBOE Volatility Index is now quite subdued, solidly under 15, as the market gets beyond the Jackson Hole uncertainty and benign late-summer churn is the default assumption for this week.

Worshippers pay $4.50 and, only after unwrapping the dessert, read that they are a top student or are destined to have a splendid future.\nThe mania over mystery boxes is catching on across the economy with everyone from travel agents to supermarkets offering their own versions. Fliggy, Alibaba Group's travel services platform, is offering \"blind box\" flight tickets as low as $64 for a round trip to Japan where travelers select a Chinese departure city and get assigned one of multiple options for dates and destinations.\nBeijing-based Pop Mart has been at the forefront of this phenomenon. It's the company behind Labubu, the elf-like monster doll created by Hong Kong Dutch artist Kasing Lung. Labubu toys are sold exclusively through the collectibles company, driving massive profits, and they're sold in the same blind box format that can encourage repeat purchases to get just the right one.\nRuan Yue, a 23-year-old student, says she spends $55 a month on blind boxes — and enjoys the gamble. Ruan owns 150 Labubu and other dolls from mystery packaging.\n\"The moment you open the box if it's a version you want or a limited edition, you get so excited,\" she said. \"And it's something I can afford.\"\nPrices for Labubus and other characters sold at Pop Mart average anywhere from $9 to $30.\nBlind boxes, or \"manghe\" in Chinese, increased in popularity in China during the pandemic. Pop Mart livestreamed the toys and sold them online and in vending machines at a time when the Chinese population was under constant threat of Covid lockdowns.\nYoung Chinese consumers, feeling down because of the pandemic controls and slow economy, turned to budget-friendly splurges for a pick-me-up. Buyers could trade toys or earn bragging rights if they were lucky enough to score a rare version coveted by their peers.\nChinese retailer Miniso, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, offers blind boxes of watches, adhesive tape, stationery and ballpoint pens.\nRetail staff at Miniso told CNBC that curiosity about what's inside convinces customers to try their luck and ultimately to keep buying.\nThe Chinese government, however, has warned through its state media against \"irrational consumption\" and blind box \"addiction.\"\nThe People's Daily in June called for stricter regulations of the trend especially for children. Quoting experts, the official state newspaper reported the practice was a \"'commercial trap' that precisely targets the psychological vulnerabilities of minors.\"","content_hash":"01ec3a7eaa1fd16197093e0308f9afde","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2867,"method_rank":0}

Here's Why Analysts Could Be Wrong.\nKey Points\n-\nThe consensus 12-month price target for Nvidia reveals that analysts don't expect the stock to move much higher.\n-\nHowever, Nvidia could give investors reasons to cheer with its fiscal Q2 update.\nThe fingernail-biting phase with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) should now be over. Sure, the chip stock plunged 37% at one point this year. However, it has since rebounded strongly. Nvidia's stock is now up more than 30% year to date.\nCould Nvidia's momentum accelerate with a potential catalyst only a few days away? The company reports its fiscal 2026 second-quarter results on Aug. 27. Wall Street doesn't appear to be expecting a big pop for Nvidia. But analysts could be wrong.\nLow expectations?\nTo be sure, Wall Street is looking for great numbers from Nvidia's fiscal Q2 update. The consensus estimate is for adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.01. If Nvidia hits that mark, it will represent year-over-year growth of 48.5%.\nThe average estimate among analysts for the company's fiscal Q2 revenue is $46 billion. In the same period last year, Nvidia generated revenue of a little over $30 billion. If the company meets Wall Street's projection, its revenue will soar roughly 53.1% year over year.\nThose estimates clearly don't reflect low expectations for Nvidia. However, analysts nonetheless don't seem to think the Q2 update will serve as a significant catalyst for the stock. How can we know that? Just look at Wall Street's price targets for Nvidia.\nThe average price target for the stock is only around 8% higher than the current share price. Keep in mind, though, that this is a 12-month target. If analysts think that Nvidia's share price will be only 8% or so higher a year from now, they're almost certainly not anticipating a big move this week.\nWhy Nvidia could soar after its Q2 update\nNvidia's stock could still soar after the company reports its fiscal Q2 results, though. One possibility is that Nvidia delivers much higher earnings than expected. This isn't an unlikely event: The GPU maker has easily topped consensus EPS estimates in each of the past four quarters.\nGranted, Nvidia's past earnings beats haven't always caused its share price to surge by a jaw-dropping level. For example, the company's adjusted earnings per share were $0.06 higher than the Wall Street consensus in fiscal Q1. Nvidia's stock rose around 3% the next day -- not bad, but not anything to get excited about.\nHowever, surprisingly strong fiscal Q2 results just might be enough to fire up investors. If Nvidia does deliver much better news than expected, it will probably be because of its new Blackwell GPUs. CFO Colette Kress said in the fiscal Q1 earnings call that the Blackwell ramp-up has been \"the fastest in our company's history.\"","content_hash":"0de55d340cf98404c84ba57944ef0172","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2851,"method_rank":0}

She offers advice on how you can do this, even in times of financial uncertainty and even if you grew up in an environment of scarcity.\nCheck Out: Here’s How To Build an Emergency Fund Without Blowing Your Budget\nRead Next: 6 Big Shakeups Coming to Social Security in 2025\nWhat Does Financial Stability Mean?\nFinancial stability and security start with having three to six months’ worth of expenses in a high-yield savings account, according to Landaverde. She acknowledges that building an emergency fund in a recession can be challenging, but difficult economic times make it more important than ever.\n“If you don’t have a high-yield savings account, you are sleeping on interest, baby,” said Landaverde. And she’s right — it’s important to keep your emergency fund liquid so you can get at it when you need to, but that doesn’t mean you need to keep it in a piggy bank. Putting it in a high-yield savings account means you can earn some money while you’re not using it, which is a win-win.\nHere are Landaverde’s three ways to save three months of expenses in a recession — even if you grew up broke.\nDiscover More: Here’s How Much Cash You Need Stashed To Survive a Recession in the Midwest\nBe Mindful With Your Spending\nLandaverde cautions her followers to be mindful with their spending and cut costs where they can. “Now is not the time to be splurging on crazy things,” she said.\nWhile you want to spend mindfully all the time, it’s particularly important during economically uncertain times. Every dollar you don’t spend on something frivolous is a dollar you can put toward that emergency fund. And that’s how it grows — one dollar at a time.\nHave Multiple Sources of Income\nThere are two ways to improve your financial situation: earn more or spend less. If you do both of them at the same time, you’ll reach your goal that much faster. Landaverde understands this and encourages her followers to have more than one source of income.\n“I’m sorry, but this economy does not allow us to live off one job. We have to have multiple sources of income,” Landaverde said. “You’ve got to get creative, whether it’s DoorDash, Instacart, you’re selling food, you have a skill set that allows you to create goodies, you sell stickers — it doesn’t matter. Create a side hustle or another source of income.”\nAnother advantage to having multiple income streams during times of economic uncertainty is that if one income source goes away, you still have the others. If you lose your full-time job, your side hustle can still keep the lights on. If you have to pull back on your part-time gig, your full-time job will pay the bills. The more streams of income you have, the better protected you will be.","content_hash":"45d59ffdfa5487eaff0455910086c90b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2851,"method_rank":0}

These include a number of items the industry had not expected to be subject to tariffs, such as baby strollers and deodorant sprays.\nAn executive at international logistics provider Kuehne+Nagel commented that the expanded list now covers auto parts, chemicals, plastics, and furniture components. According to him, basically, anything that is shiny, metallic, or even remotely related to steel and aluminum could end up on the tariff list.\nThe policy was implemented with little warning. Last Friday, the U.S. government only just notified domestic importers that the new tariffs would take effect at midnight Monday Eastern time, leaving many importers unprepared.\nNow, many U.S. importers are caught in a dilemma. Goods they have already paid for are still in transit. If they accept the shipments, they must pay the sharply higher tariffs. But if they refuse delivery and prevent the goods from being unloaded at U.S. ports, they will face losses from being unable to bring the goods into the country.\nDomestically, opinions on the new tariffs are divided. The government and some steel producers support the measure. Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security Jeffrey Kessler said the expansion closes loopholes that allowed tariff evasion and will help drive a sustained revival of the U.S. steel and aluminum industries.\nBut many economists and industry experts warn that the broader tariffs could further strain supply chains and push up consumer prices. Jason Miller, a supply chain management professor at Michigan State University, wrote that based on 2024 U.S. customs import values, the new tariffs on steel and aluminum will affect at least $320 billion worth of imports—far higher than his earlier estimate of $190 billion. He said this will further raise prices among domestic producers and add to cost-push inflationary pressures. July's Producer Price Index, or PPI, already reflected this trend.\nMeanwhile, the Core Coalition, representing the U.S. electric transformer industry, said domestic manufacturers cannot meet demand. The added tariffs could lengthen delivery times for transformers and slow the development of America's artificial intelligence sector.\nSome analysts also caution that not just steel and aluminum, but other industries may see repeated shifts in tariff policy. Last Friday, President Trump hinted at such changes in a media interview, saying:\n\"I haven't even set some of the tariffs yet. I'll be setting tariffs next week and the week after on steel and on, I would say, chips.

Still, if you’re thinking of going in that direction, you should know what the pros and cons are, along with the steps you should take to do it.\nHere are the things you should factor into your decision, along with consequences you won’t want to overlook.\nBenefits of Paying Your Mortgage Faster\nThe main benefit to using your traditional 401(k) to pay off your house is that you’ll no longer have to worry about making mortgage payments. If you’re like most American households, this will provide a significant boost to your monthly cash flow, possibly in the thousands of dollars.\nYou’ll also avoid paying potentially tens of thousands of dollars in interest over the life of your mortgage. This alone could make the idea of paying off your home early make sense.\nAnother factor that many overlook when it comes to paying off your mortgage is that it can make the transfer of wealth to your heirs easier and less costly. If you pass on a 401(k) to your heirs, all of the money in the account becomes taxable as your heirs withdraw it. But in a house, your money can potentially pass to your heirs tax-free.\nThis is because upon your death, the cost basis in your house “steps up” to the current market valuation. If your heirs sell the house, they will likely pay only small or even nonexistent capital gains. That could amount to tax savings of tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars for your beneficiaries.\nLearn More: 5 Types of Homes Expected To Plummet in Value by the End of 2025\nDrawbacks of Using Your 401(k)\nIn most cases, taking money out of your 401(k) plan to pay off your mortgage is a bad idea. From just a strictly mathematical perspective, you’re likely earning more in your 401(k) plan than you are paying in interest on your mortgage.\nEven if you have a relatively conservative 401(k) allocation, for example, you’re likely earning at least 5% on your money. Considering that most existing mortgages are costing homeowners less than 5%, the math doesn’t make sense.\nAnother huge drawback is that you’ll owe ordinary income tax on any money you withdraw from your 401(k). If you’re in a high tax bracket, the combined hit to your nest egg can approach 50%, meaning your $100,000 withdrawal to pay off your mortgage is really only worth $50,000.","content_hash":"ae54c06c3b8ab9541852d6449736eb53","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2825,"method_rank":0}

This means the top 1% are heavy investors in the stock market, and owned nearly half of all funds and stocks over 35 years ago.\nToday, the top 1% own 13.5% of all real estate, and 49.8% of all stocks and mutual funds.

But not everyone on the Federal Open Market Committee sounded as dovish, including Kansas City Fed president Jeffrey Schmid.\nThat sets up another FOMC meeting with dissenting votes, after two policymakers voted to lower rates last time, going against the majority that kept rates steady.\nWhile Powell counts as one vote on the FOMC, he carries outsize influence as the chairman and could prove to be decisive in another split vote.\n“Guidance from a range of Fed speakers was mixed this week, while the July minutes struck a modestly hawkish tone,” JPMorgan economists led by Bruce Kasman wrote in a note on Friday. “A consensus decision in September looks unlikely, and it is Chair Powell who holds the key to the meeting’s outcome.”\nAnother contested meeting would mark further deviation from the Fed’s traditional consensus-driven decision-making process, which typically results in unanimous votes.\nBut future meetings could see continued division as hawks point to inflation still running above the Fed’s 2% target and other economic data signaling resilience. Indeed, the composition of the Fed is in flux, potentially leading to more push and pull among policymakers.\nStephen Miran, who has previously blasted the Fed’s consensus-based approach, is set to join the board of governors and add to the dovish votes. Meanwhile, Powell’s term as chair expires in May, and President Donald Trump has threatened to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook if she doesn’t resign.\nOutlook for Fed rate cut cycle\nAnd even if the Fed lowers rates next month, the pace of future cuts isn’t clear, providing more fodder for debate at the central bank as Trump-appointed officials push for dovish policy.\nSome Wall Street analysts don’t see an aggressive easing cycle on the horizon, and Powell indicated any rate cuts would happen in a cautious manner.","content_hash":"1fe789e2d0890f3d19969b318cbcc1eb","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2813,"method_rank":0}

Its warehouse clubs are a favorite of consumers.\nHome Depot (NYSE: HD), meanwhile, has a commanding position in the home improvement industry. It generates about double the amount of revenue that smaller rival Lowe's does.\nThese are undoubtedly two of the biggest retailers in the world, but which of these businesses is the better investment right now?\nCostco is the better business\nCostco is a dominant force in the retail world. It has consistently increased its same-store sales (SSS). At a time when consumer confidence has taken a hit, the company's SSS rose by 5.7% in its latest fiscal quarter (third-quarter 2025, ended May 11). This came mainly from more foot traffic, with a small contribution from a higher average ticket size.\nWhat makes the business unique is its membership model. Costco requires that its shoppers pay annual fees to visit its warehouses. It's a strategy that encourages repeat visits and more spending. These memberships bring in a predictable, recurring, and high-margin revenue stream for Costco. As of May 11, there were 79.6 million membership households worldwide, up 6.8% year over year.\nEven with the monster success of Amazon and its Prime membership, Costco has been able to keep growing. This gives me confidence that there's a very low probability that Costco will get disrupted, even with the popularity of online shopping. The warehouse chain's customers clearly appreciate the in-person experience. It's characterized by everyday low prices, which are a mainstay because of Costco's huge scale and negotiating leverage over its suppliers.\nCostco's ongoing success, which doesn't seem to be influenced much by changes in the broader macro environment, has not gone unnoticed by the market. The business should continue to see its sales and earnings rise in the years ahead. Investors love the reliability, and they've bid up shares to the point that the current price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio sits at a lofty 55.6. That's an expensive entry point, regardless of how wonderful the company is.\nHome Depot is the better stock\nHome Depot reported a small SSS increase of 1% in its latest fiscal quarter (second-quarter 2025, ended Aug. 3). There was growth among both DIY and pro customers. But the company is focused on strengthening its position with the latter, as its recent acquisitions of building products distributors SRS and GMS demonstrate.","content_hash":"a0a01cc7baf0a54305b62c79de9acd26","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2808,"method_rank":0}

With the initial public offering (IPO) of Circle Internet Group and growing adoption of these fiat-backed cryptocurrencies, many investors have claimed that the traditional days of cross-border payments are behind us. This has sent shares of mobile remittance player Remitly Global (NASDAQ: RELY) down 30% from highs set earlier this year.\nAs a business that makes money on cross-border payment fees, Remitly could be threatened by stablecoins. But is it truly at risk? A new announcement from Remitly around stablecoins could be huge news regarding this narrative, and may turn stablecoins into a beneficiary for the business. Time to take a closer look at Remitly stock and see whether investors should buy the dip on this hated remittance player today.\nDisrupting the stablecoin narrative\nAlong with its Q2 earnings report (which will be covered below), Remitly announced new products that its 8.5 million active customers can use earlier this month. First is the Remitly Wallet, a digital wallet through Remitly where customers can hold currencies instead of just sending them from a bank account. Importantly, stablecoins are included in the currencies customers can hold.\nSecond, Remitly is using payment provider Stripe to help fund remittance transactions on the platform with stablecoins. This expansion in the number of ways people can send and receive money through Remitly will make the platform more valuable for users, which should drive more customer adoption. Lastly, Remitly is utilizing stablecoins on its balance sheet to help move money across border in real time when funding transactions for users, which should reduce its operating costs while again improving the customer value proposition of the platform.\nMore growth and reduced costs should mean more profits for Remitly going forward.\nStrong growth and market share gains\nThe last quarter was stellar for Remitly. Revenue grew 34% year-over-year to $412 million on the back of 40% send volume growth, with positive net income of $6.5 million. If people are utilizing stablecoins to bypass Remitly's remittance platform, it is not showing up in the numbers yet. The company is barely generating a profit, but that is because of all the new products its team is building, along with heavy marketing spend to acquire new users. Both are worthwhile buckets to pour money into as long as new customers keep joining Remitly and revenue is growing at this blistering rate.","content_hash":"38a6f8fa397cb9e8f046841b25cedeca","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2776,"method_rank":0}

The firm raised $50 million in July 2025 to fund mining operations and direct crypto purchases. Its $153.8 million stock-based acquisition of Dogehash Technologies adds 2,500 Dogecoin\/Litecoin rigs, with plans to rebrand as Dogehash Technologies Holdings.\nRegulatory filings show Donald Trump Jr. owns roughly 350,000 shares of TZUP stock worth $3.3 million, positioning him as a major shareholder. As expected, this news formed a dual catalyst with dovish Fed Chair Powell signaled rate cuts, lifting Dogecoin price 12% from $0.20 to $0.24 before retracing toward $0.23 at press time.\nThe 2% Saturday reversal reflects traders “selling the news” after initial excitement. Derivatives data further show short traders were incentivized to defend the $0.25 psychological barrier.\nMore so, in the derivatives market Dogecoin’s $185 million long positions outpaced $171 million shorts at press time, affirming the dominant bullish sentiment.\nHowever, concentrated short activity around the intraday peaks was also pivotal to Dogecoin rapid price correction in the early hours of August 23.\nAccording to Coinglass liquidation maps, over $81.4 million worth of shorts are clustered around $0.25, representing the largest build-up of leverage positions in seven days. Such clusters often act as a formidable resistance, as traders strategically sell to protect positions from liquidation.\nThis short wall explains DOGE’s rejection near $0.249 on Friday and reinforces the “sell-the-news” narrative, capitalizing on the euphoric sentiment from Thumpzup’s acquisition of Dogehash and fresh dovish hits from the US Fed Chair.\nDogecoin Price Forecast: What Next For DOGE after Missing $0.25 Breakout Target?\nDogecoin price is currently consolidating just beneath the upper Bollinger Band at $0.2498, a level that continues to define short-term direction. A decisive close above this upper band would indicate renewed bullish momentum and set the stage for a possible breakout towards $0.30.\nThe Relative Strength Index is holding at 54.71, positioning the market in neutral territory. This reading signals that Dogecoin retains sufficient upside room before approaching overbought conditions, which typically come in above 70.\nOn the downside, initial support remains anchored at the middle Bollinger Band around $0.225, with deeper protection near the lower band at $0.201. A breach below $0.201 would risk reversing the current upward trend and shift sentiment toward a bear market.","content_hash":"82e9414dae8dc0fdb49ca0c7e0fa7813","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2772,"method_rank":0}

That's easily the worst performance of any major cryptocurrency. By way of comparison, crypto bellwether Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is up 22% for the year, and recently hit an all-time high of $124,000 this summer.\nSo, how is it possible that Dogecoin still ranks among the top 10 cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap? And why is it that many investors still consider this meme coin to be a high upside cryptocurrency? The answer might surprise you.\nDogecoin coin supply\nWhen it comes to Dogecoin, the one thing you need to know is that it has a massive circulating coin supply of 150.5 billion. Thus, even though it still trades for a price of less than a quarter ($0.21), it has a market cap of $31.5 billion.\nAdmittedly, that's an impressive number, which is why Dogecoin inevitably enters the conversation anytime investors start talking about potential high upside cryptocurrencies. Last year, for example, Dogecoin turned heads when it passed Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F) and General Mills Inc. (NYSE: GIS) in terms of overall market cap.\nBut, at the end of the day, it's just math. A really big number multiplied by any number will still give you a really big number. When you multiply 150.5 billion by $0.21, you get $31.5 billion.\nThat's the reason why many new meme coins launch with spectacularly large coin supplies. This is necessary because their intrinsic value is close to zero, so they need coin supplies measured in the trillions (!) in order to move up the market cap ranking charts.\nSo, for example, the frog-themed meme coin Pepe (CRYPTO: PEPE) has a circulating coin supply of 420 trillion. And Shiba Inu (CRYPTO: SHIB) has a vertigo-inducing coin supply of 589 trillion. Thus, even though the prices of Pepe and Shiba Inu are as close to zero as you can possibly get, they still rank among the top 30 cryptocurrencies in the world.\nMaking things even more challenging for Dogecoin, its total lifetime coin supply is uncapped. It is growing over time, and has no final limit on how many coins can ever be created. In contrast, Bitcoin has a maximum lifetime coin supply of 21 million coins. That's hard-coded into the Bitcoin algorithm, and there's no way that anyone can change it. That's music to the ears of investors, who view Bitcoin as a potential safe store of value over time. They don't have to worry about its value being inflated away.","content_hash":"d17e56332da3325f071a3f339cb4a58a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2754,"method_rank":0}

Having been founded in 1903, the automaker has been an important part of the American economy. And its ongoing relevance shows just how successful it has been in its industry.\nThis auto stock is having a great year thus far. As of Aug. 19, it's up 17% in 2025. But can Ford turn its investors into millionaires over the long term? Here's what you should know about the Detroit car company.\nLooking at Ford's business under the hood\nWith a history that spans more than 120 years, Ford has built up brand awareness simply from being around for such a long time. This brand recognition is also supported by the fact that the company's F-series pickups have been the best-selling trucks in the U.S. for 48 straight years. That's an unbelievable track record.\nHowever, I think a deeper look at this company will reveal that it's not a high-quality operation that investors will want to own for a long time. There are some key reasons why.\nFord isn't going to post strong revenue growth consistently. Unit volumes were up 14.2% in the U.S. in the second quarter (ended June 30), thanks to significant demand during Ford's employee-pricing program to boost sales amid trade and tariff uncertainties. This pace isn't sustainable. Between 2014 and 2024, Ford's top line increased at a compound annual rate of just 2.5%, a trend that seems likely to continue going forward.\nThe global auto industry is very mature in the sense that unit volumes won't increase in any meaningful way on a yearly basis. Ford is making a push into electric vehicles, a part of the industry with potential, but this specific segment posted a $1.3 billion operating loss in Q2.\nCyclicality is another reason that investors should tread with caution. Cars are huge buying decisions for consumers, as opposed to being small, repeat purchases. This makes Ford's demand highly sensitive to economic forces. If there's a mild downturn or even a severe recession, sales could face significant pressure.\nAs a result, Ford's low profitability, as demonstrated by its Q2 adjusted operating margin of 4.3% and adjusted return on invested capital of 10.1%, will take a hit. In fact, it wouldn't be a surprise to see the business post a net loss in an adverse economic scenario. Ford's profitability leaves much to be desired, and it's yet another reason this isn't a great company.","content_hash":"1d5c6050795f15776bd8342c238de9bd","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2754,"method_rank":0}

Despite significant volatility and little real-world utility of Dogecoin's blockchain network, the cryptocurrency continues to be one of the 10 largest in the world by market cap at roughly $31.6 billion.\nDogecoin was launched as a joke and has always thrived due to its virality, largely as investors on social media and even celebrities embraced the token. As the crypto sector has gotten a lift from President Donald Trump's pro-crypto administration, Dogecoin has benefited and is up about 100% over the past year, continuing what's been a strong overall run.\nIf you'd invested $1,000 in Dogecoin five years ago, here's how much you'd have today.\nInvestors have crushed it\nDue to Dogecoin's scale and how well known it is worldwide, the token has typically moved in line with the crypto sector but at a higher beta compared to the world's largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. This means that Dogecoin has performed better when Bitcoin and most of the crypto sector has risen, but worse so when Bitcoin and the sector has declined.\nThat said, the huge volatility has clearly benefited Dogecoin investors over the longer five-year period.\nAs you can see above, $1,000 invested in Dogecoin is now worth over $60,000, meaning the return is over an astonishing 6,000%. The broader benchmark S&P 500 index is up 87% over the past five years, and much of this time has been characterized by a bull market.\nDoes this mean you should buy Dogecoin?\nI still think the token is extremely risky because it has a substantial market cap, while its network does not yet have strong real-world utility. Dogecoin's large supply also does not make it a good store of value. Those who have gambled on the token over the past five years have been well rewarded, but I still wouldn't invest anything more than you can afford to lose.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Dogecoin right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Dogecoin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Dogecoin wasn’t one of them.

Here's a recap of Monday's key moments. 1. The Dow was down Monday after the 30-stock average closed at a record high Friday amid a broader market rally fueled by dovish comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Wall Street sent stocks soaring on the hopes that the Fed would lower interest rates at its September meeting. \"What we saw on Friday is a recognition of what would happen if there was a rate cut,\" Jim Cramer said Monday. Jim added that he agreed with Friday's market moves, except that tech was left behind. \"I don't want people to sell any of these.\" 2. Nvidia is scheduled to release earnings Wednesday evening. Analysts largely expect the Club chipmaker to post another quarterly beat and guidance raise. But the question will be by how much? Management commentary about business in China will be important, too. Overall, we have little reason to be concerned about the quarter. There is no shortage of demand for Nvidia's offerings, as seen in the boost in AI spending from our Big Tech names like Meta Platforms and Microsoft. Nvidia shares were up 1.5% on Monday. 3. Palo Alto Networks shares were roughly 1.5% on Monday, stalling out after its post-earnings run from last week. The Club name's move lower presents an opportunity for investors, according to Jim. \"You need to buy Palo Alto,\" he said. \"Out of the conference calls I read last week, it was the best.\" It's a great time to purchase more shares because the market's reaction is unwarranted. Plus, the Club anticipates the stock running higher in the long run. We like Palo Alto's planned acquisition of CyberArk . Our other cybersecurity stock, CrowdStrike reports earnings Wednesday evening. 4. Stocks covered in Monday's rapid fire at the end of the video were: American Eagle, Keurig Dr Pepper , RH , Intel , and Okta. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long NVDA, PANW, META, MSFT.

The company's share price was down 19.4% from its level at the previous week's market close heading into the market open this past Friday. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 rose 0.3% across the stretch, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell roughly 0.6%.\nTech stocks have been facing bearish pressures this week, and SoundHound AI has seen some big selloffs as a result of new research highlighting concerns about valuations in the artificial intelligence (AI) space and macroeconomic indicators that could point to a more challenging environment for growth stocks. While the conversational AI specialist has seen a big valuation pullback this week, its share price is still up roughly 31.5% over the past three months of trading.\nSoundHound AI stock sank in response to a new MIT report\nOn Tuesday, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) released new research results suggesting that most businesses have yet to see real bottom-line improvements connected to their investments in generative AI. According to MIT's new report, 95% of the businesses that it incorporated as part of its study were still in the red on their AI investments. The research triggered substantial valuation pullbacks for many AI stocks, and SoundHound AI was among the companies hit with big selloffs.\nMacroeconomic indicators also caused big moves for SoundHound AI\nLast week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics published its Produce Price Index report for July, and the data showed levels of inflation that were far higher than economists had anticipated. With inflationary trends coming in hotter than expected in the wholesaler market, alarm bells were raised that higher levels of inflation would soon arrive in the consumer sector of the economy. Quarterly updates from some of the U.S.'s biggest retailers added to the weight of those fears this week, but investors got a big relief thanks to a speech from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday.\nIn his speech, Powell seemingly indicated that signs of slowing growth in the U.S. economy had become a bigger factor than current inflationary pressures when it comes to the Fed's approach to interest rate policy. If the Fed cut rates next month, it could help strengthen bullish momentum for SoundHound AI stock.","content_hash":"766522f9936eb448eb504a005e8c8196","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2704,"method_rank":0}

After its Aug. 6 earnings report for the second quarter of 2025, the stock popped 22%. The stock has retreated since then, but it is still up by more than 80% over the last year.\nAlthough such gains are impressive, they could also lead to concerns over the stock and its valuation. Investors need to take a closer look at Shopify stock to see whether now is a good time to add shares, or whether they should stand pat or possibly sell.\nThe state of Shopify\nShopify has become the leading company among e-commerce platform providers. It first stood out by offering a no-code, highly customizable site that non-programmers could set up and launch. The company enhanced this ease of use by also emphasizing speed, making it more user-friendly and less likely that e-retailers would lose sales due to a slow website.\nMoreover, it also built an ecosystem that helped online merchants with ancillary tasks such as payments, email marketing, and, more recently, AI tools such as Sidekick and Shopify Magic. Since sales platforms are not particularly unique, the ecosystem gives Shopify a competitive advantage that its clients will not find on most other platforms.\nThese capabilities helped make Shopify stock a pandemic darling, and it had a peak closing price of more than $169 per share in 2021. Unfortunately, the stock sold off in the 2022 bear market, and this was exacerbated by an attempt to build a Shopify Fulfillment Network (SFN). Consequently, it lost as much as 87% of its value as it returned to losses.\nThe company later decided that building such a network was too costly and a poor fit for what is otherwise a software company. After selling the SFN to Flexport in 2023, profitability soon returned, and the stock began moving higher.\nThat bull market has largely continued. Today, the stock is only about 20% below its all-time closing high.\nHow Shopify fares financially\nThanks to that growth, Shopify generated nearly $163 billion in gross merchandise volume in the first half of 2025, rising 27% yearly. That generated just over $5.0 billion in revenue in the first two quarters of 2025, a 29% yearly surge.\nKeeping expense growth in check led to a 51% rise in operating income. Unfortunately, unrealized losses weighed on its performance in Q1. Thus, its net income was just $224 million in the first half of 2025, though that was an improvement over the $102 million loss in the same year-ago period.","content_hash":"fa3a414cd7981383cd208b0fae4e7bd8","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2674,"method_rank":0}

The amount includes late fees and possibly charges that stem from a brief repossession of the vehicle.\nBridget says she was given a list of payments and outstanding fees, but claims the numbers don’t add up. She’s concerned the lender might be hiding something or taking advantage of her in some way. Now, she’s stuck in a cycle of frustration, and is worried about losing her car altogether.\nDon't miss\n-\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers.

Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it\n“You’re dealing with a subprime lender,” host Dave Ramsey said in a clip posted Aug 5. “They are not usually nice to work with.”\nWhat you should know about subprime lenders\nSubprime lenders are creditors that specialize in providing loans and financing to people with low (or “subprime”) credit scores — typically under 620. These borrowers often don’t qualify for traditional loans from a bank or credit union, which makes subprime financing an appealing option. For someone with a bad credit history who needs a car for their commute to work or to take children to school, these lenders can feel like a lifeline.\nBut subprime lending can come with serious drawbacks — the biggest one being sky-high interest rates. Bridget says her interest rate on the loan is 18.95%. According to Edmunds, the average new-vehicle annual percentage rate in the second quarter of 2025 was 7.2%.\nSubprime loans can also come with hefty fees and strict policies. If a borrower falls behind on payments, these fees can quickly balloon the balance. This can make the loan difficult to pay off if you’re unable to consistently make payments.\nDealing with a shady lender\nThere’s no way to know whose calculations are correct — Bridget’s or the creditor’s — but Ramsey cautions anyone from getting involved with subprime lenders.","content_hash":"04a83530360d6eafda3d54f7d7705e69","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2672,"method_rank":0}

(NYSE:SNOW): Shares of Snowflake were up 53% during the second quarter and have almost doubled off of their September lows. 2024 was a transition year at Snowflake as Sridhar Ramaswamy took over as CEO and the company materially accelerated its AI related product pipeline. As we work our way through 2025, Snowflake’s AI strategy is beginning to come into focus and to put it mildly, the opportunity is intriguing. Historically, Snowflake has given customers the ability to query and analyze company data, both structured and unstructured, across all public clouds in a secure, user-friendly manner. As we move into the AI age, Snowflake’s ambition is to allow this analysis to take place in real-time, often through the use of AI agents whether it be through Snowflake’s own applications or secure third-party applications. Snowflake’s position right next to the customer’s data offers protection against disintermediation from third-party data analytics applications. Instead, this work will be done by Snowflake’s internal applications or by third-party applications that connect securely to the data via the Snowflake platform. This is an advantaged position within an enterprise. Data analytics is a rapidly evolving market. Add into this Snowflake’s consumption based pricing model that can pick up changes in demand signals, real or transitory, on a quarter by quarter basis and it is no wonder that this is a volatile stock. That said, as Snowflake’s AI strategy plays out in the years to come, we think the upside in the shares make what can sometimes be a wild ride in the share price one worth taking.\"","content_hash":"1778f994ed7e4a904168c86655fad5a4","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2671,"method_rank":0}

Suze Orman Says NEVER Do These 5 Things With Your Money!” In it, she shared several tips for people to help protect their hard-earned money from high fees, debt and complicated estate issues.\nHere are some of those top tips and why Orman believes they’re so important to follow to build a successful financial future.\nNever Buy a Variable Annuity in a Retirement Account\nAccording to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a variable is an insurance product that acts like an investment. Some financial advisors recommend these products, but the SEC explains that these financial professionals earn commissions when they sell them.\nOften, variable annuities come with high fees, and customers have to pay extra for certain features. Sometimes, advisors recommend that clients buy a variable annuity inside their retirement account, which Orman says is not in people’s best interest.\nConsider This: Suze Orman’s Top Tip for Building Wealth Is a ‘Very Easy One’\nNever Buy Insurance as an Investment\nOrman says this piece of advice is similar to the previous tip. She says some financial advisors try to sell insurance as an investment. However, she makes it clear that insurance and investments should be separate.\nOrman recommends term life insurance, not whole life insurance. This protects people’s families, she says, without being costly.\nNever Finance a Car for More Than Three Years\nAccording to the Federal Reserve’s Q1 2025 data, people financed nearly $40 billion in new car loans. Many car companies offer car loans for extended periods, like 84 or even 96 months. This makes people’s monthly payments lower, but it also keeps them in debt longer. Because cars are a depreciating asset, people run the risk of owing more on their car than it’s worth.\nThat’s why Orman recommends never financing a car for more than three years.\nNever Name a Minor as a Beneficiary\nMany parents name their children as beneficiaries on their life insurance or retirement accounts, but this can create legal problems, according to Orman. That’s because a minor can’t legally inherit money. People can, however, set up a revocable living trust according to Orman. Then, they can name the trust as a beneficiary.","content_hash":"8aba2f25b1ae26fd071ea7d371350644","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2669,"method_rank":0}

But it hasn't been an entirely smooth ride in 2025, with disappointing second-quarter results and slower-than-targeted production of its highly anticipated Gravity electric SUV.\nThe good news for investors is that Lucid is taking it upon itself to offset the loss of the $7,500 U.S. federal EV tax credit. Let's dive in.\nWhen one door closes...\nIn an attempt to keep the momentum it's gained with deliveries, Lucid is offering a $7,500 lease discount on the Gravity SUV during the fourth quarter to help offset the loss of the federal tax credit that expires at the end of September. It specifically applies to lessees who place an order by the end of September and take delivery between Oct. 1 and the end of 2025.\nIt's simply a way for Lucid to help out people who were banking on the federal tax credit but weren't able to take delivery of a Gravity by the end of September. It's likely a bigger deal than investors realize, because the U.S. EV market is going to be bumpy for the remainder of the year.\nRemember that due to the tax credit ending at the end of September, it pulled ahead demand from people who were on the fence, and will likely leave an equally strong lull in demand once that pull-through is finished. New U.S. EV registrations rose 4.6% in June, compared to the prior year, but EV market share fell for the month and stayed flat for the first half of the year, according to S&P Global Mobility data.

It is about agency—the right and ability for African people, institutions, and governments to shape, govern, and benefit from AI systems on their own terms.\"\nKerema highlighted the opportunities and challenges Africa faces on its digital journey:\n-\nChallenges: Infrastructure gaps, skills shortages, and siloed data.\n-\nStrengths: Africa's unmatched diversity, resilience, and local innovation in AI-driven health, education, and fintech.\nShe praised African entrepreneurs and global partners working together to co-create solutions designed for local realities—systems that are modular, explainable, privacy-respecting, and inclusive of multiple languages and communities.\nMindHYVE.ai Co-Sponsorship and Launch of Agentic AI\nThis year's conference is proudly co-sponsored by MindHYVE.ai, a leading USA AI innovation company.

Beverage Co. will focus on North America’s $300 billion beverage market, while Global Coffee Co. will participate in the $400 billion coffee market.\nOnce the acquisition is finalized, JDE Peet’s will be delisted from the Amsterdam stock exchange. Keurig Dr Pepper stated it intends to pay JDE shareholders €31.85 per share, representing a 33% premium to the company’s stock price.\nShares of Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) traded down 8% on Monday, Aug. 25.\nIn 2018, Keurig Green Mountain and Dr Pepper Snapple merged to create Keurig Dr Pepper.

This move reflects a more optimistic view from the analyst firm on the company's future performance. Adding to the positive sentiment, another research firm, Craig Hallum, had also recently raised its rating on Upland Software. It upgraded the shares from a “hold” rating to a “buy” rating and established a $3.50 price target, signaling growing confidence from market analysts.\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $2.97, down 0.7% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy Upland Software? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\nUpland Software’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 66 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock gained 17.7% on the news that its board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to buy back up to $10 million of its outstanding common stock. The buyback authorization, which represents nearly 19% of Upland's current market capitalization, was seen by investors as a strong vote of confidence from management. This move comes after the stock has declined over 60% in the past six months, suggesting the board believes the shares are undervalued. The company's decision to deploy capital on repurchases, announced in an 8-K filing, was particularly noteworthy as it followed a recent second-quarter earnings report that missed analyst estimates. The program does not have a specified expiration date.\nUpland Software is down 33.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $2.97 per share, it is trading 44.1% below its 52-week high of $5.31 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Upland Software’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $82.48.\nUnless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

While Boeing's CEO, Kelly Ortberg, is unlikely to generate the kind of returns that Culp has for the former General Electric investors, he is making great strides in improving matters at Boeing.\nA heavyweight Boeing board hires Ortberg\nBoeing's board of directors has been significantly improved in recent years, and it contains industrial heavyweights like Carrier Global CEO David Gitlin, former GE Aviation CEO David Joyce, and former United Technologies CFO Akhil Johri. Their choice of former Collins Aerospace CEO Ortberg (a colleague of both Gitlin and Johri at United Technologies) looks like a great decision.\nImprovements all around\nSince Ortberg's appointment in August 2024, Boeing has improved its production rate on the 737 MAX, reaching its initial target of 38 a month in the second quarter, and Ortberg expects Boeing will seek approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to increase production to 42 a month soon. Improving the production rate on the 737 MAX is the key to growing profit margin and cash flow at the company.\nHowever, the most significant improvement is arguably in the defense business, Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS). One of the first things Ortberg did was to replace BDS CEO Ted Colbert in September 2024 with Boeing veteran Steve Parker. As you can see in the chart below, BDS is now generating profit again, after a long period of losses.\nMost notably, Ortberg said BDS \"had another good quarter on our fixed-price development programs\" and held its estimated-at-completion (cost forecasts based on performance) for the second consecutive quarter. That's a big deal for a business which struggled to keep a lid on costs under Colbert.\nIt all points to improved execution at Boeing, and with a $619 billion backlog, there's plenty of potential for the improved execution to lead to profit growth at Boeing.\nShould you buy stock in Boeing right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Boeing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Boeing wasn’t one of them.

The sector is quite popular, and the amount of money being spent to fund this arms race is jaw-dropping. However, I think there's one stock that looks like an excellent buy that's also reasonably priced: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL).\nAlphabet is involved in the AI arms race in multiple ways. While Microsoft got the jump on Google by investing in OpenAI and incorporating ChatGPT into its browser, Alphabet has caught up and remains a top way to invest in AI at a reasonable price.\nGoogle Search is still doing well despite calls for its downfall\nAlphabet is the parent company of Google, YouTube, the Android operating system, and Waymo. It has a wide-reaching umbrella, but a significant chunk of its tech empire derives revenue from advertising, specifically from the Google Search engine.

This combination is likely enough generative AI for most consumers, and should allow Google to remain top of mind for consumers accessing the internet.\nThis seems to be how it's playing out right now, as Google Search's revenue increased by 12% year over year in the second quarter. That's an acceleration from Q1's 10% growth pace, indicating that Google Search is doing quite well despite fears of replacement.\nBut that's not the only way Alphabet is exposed to AI.\nGoogle Cloud is a growth machine for Alphabet\nThe demand for computing power to handle AI workloads is booming, and most users are running their workloads on the cloud. This is a major boost for cloud computing providers like Google Cloud, which have seen an uptick in demand alongside the AI arms race. Google Cloud built a massive network of data centers filled with high-powered computing devices for AI workloads, and other less powerful units for more generic ones. It became one of the top platforms in the industry for running AI workloads on, and even landed the business of one of its AI competitors, OpenAI.","content_hash":"8504bf246bc0d853028335194a562a2d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2594,"method_rank":0}

Fidelity notes that this trick works because it’s both painless and rewarding — you feel like you’re “winning” money, and instead of spending it right away, you let it work for you.\nStart Small With Investing\nMicro-savings doesn’t have to stop at cash. Fidelity points out that investing even small amounts consistently can build momentum.\nThanks to fractional shares and low- or no-minimum investment options, you can dip your toe into the market with just a few dollars.\nOver time, the combination of regular contributions and compounding growth can turn your micro-investments into something much bigger. Think of it as planting tiny seeds: Individually, they don’t look like much, but given time, they can grow into real money.","content_hash":"549348ae92cdeef27586b2a05401d1ad","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2592,"method_rank":0}

This one-month window gives the Redditor a sufficient cushion if they fall just short of paying off the entire balance.\nMultiple commenters suggested setting a tighter, self-imposed deadline, and it can also lead to better financial decisions. For instance, the original poster may cut their costs so they can make more progress with paying off their balance. Cardholders with 0% APR may also benefit from picking up temporary side hustles until they have paid off their balances in full.\nGetting a head start now will leave you better prepared as the deadline gets closer.

It's easy to set up notifications so they go off on multiple devices.

The move represented a return to normal after the Bitcoin-buying firm made a series of adjustments to its corporate playbook.\nStrategy signaled a week ago that it was modifying a newly adopted equity issuance policy, which restricted its ability to issue common shares when its stock traded at a certain valuation. Although the framework was intended to show “discipline,” Strategy gave itself some wiggle room by saying the framework would be set aside “when otherwise deemed advantageous.”\nThe company said it would no longer issue common stock when Strategy’s so-called mNAV was below 2.5x, or its shares traded at less than a 2.5x premium to its Bitcoin holdings. Analysts lauded the shift when it was announced less than a month ago alongside Strategy’s second-quarter earnings performance, marked by $10 billion in profit.\nStrategy shares fell nearly 2.7% to $348 on Monday, according to Yahoo Finance.

As of Monday, the Bitcoin-buying firm held roughly 632,500 Bitcoin worth $70.5 billion, according to Bitcoin Treasuries.","content_hash":"3ee802216b1a8013629154ddaf0701fd","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2547,"method_rank":0}

Meanwhile, the US-focused S&P Aerospace and Defense Select Industry Index has climbed 31% over the same period.\nThe rally in defense stocks followed the European Union's commitments to boost military budgets amid heightened security concerns — and renewed pressure from Washington for NATO allies to spend more.\nGoldman's analysts expect euro-area military spending to rise from 1.9% of GDP in 2024 to 2.7% by 2027, adding about 167 billion euros, or $196 billion, to annual budgets.\nAround 40% of that spending boost is likely to flow into the procurement of metals-heavy equipment — roughly double NATO's typical 20% norm.\nGoldman estimates Europe's rearmament will lift the region's overall demand for industrial metals by 6% by 2027 — an \"impressive\" jump given that defense made up only about 2% of Europe's metals use in 2023.\nGlobally, Goldman projects Europe's rearmament could add 0.9% to copper demand, 1.3% to nickel, and 0.4% to steel by 2027.\nCopper — one of the world's most commonly used metals — stands out.\nGoldman estimates the defense-driven bump could lift global copper demand growth from 2% to 2.4% annually. Copper runs through nearly every military system — not just vehicles and weaponry, but also the wiring, power, and communications networks that make them work.\nThe boom in AI data center infrastructure is also driving demand for copper.\nThe demand from defense and AI could ripple into prices.

Why are shares going up? Because people are buying them. Why are they buying? Because they're going up.\nEuropean and U.S. stock futures are in a more sober mood after Friday's euphoria, perhaps reflecting the realisation that things must be getting worse for the U.S. economy for the Fed to consider cutting rates even as inflation heads for 3% and above.\nThe \"why\" matters. It's one thing to ease policy because inflation is cooling, but another thing entirely to have to ease to support the economy and head off an unwelcome rise in unemployment. Powell argued the inflationary impact of tariffs was likely to be a one-off rise in the price level, but that risks sounding like the \"transitory\" tag given to the initial spike in prices post-COVID.\nThe Fed's favoured core PCE price index due on Friday is already expected to tick up to a 19-month high of 2.9%, and a 3.0% reading would cause some sticker shock for the long end of the Treasury curve.

However, no company has seen more absolute net gains in market cap than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Indeed, it's now the world's largest publicly traded company thanks to AI, worth a whopping $4.3 trillion.\nBut just how much would you have made with an investment in this stock three years ago, shortly before the public release of OpenAI's ChatGPT sparked a flood of AI investment?\nIn the right place at the right time with the right solution\nSo much has happened since then that it seems like it was much longer ago. But it's true -- the public version of ChatGPT only debuted in Nov. 2022.

Corporate-level and non-consumer developmental AI work was being done before 2022, but only in the past few years has this technology ushered in a full-blown gold rush.\nAll of this has worked in Nvidia's favor. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) remain the market's go-to source for the computing power behind artificial intelligence applications. Some estimates suggest the company's market share still stands in the ballpark of 90%. That's why the stock is up 883% since Aug. 2022, meaning a $5,000 investment then would be worth a little over $49,000 as of this writing.\nNo repeat on the horizon, but still ...\nThat was a once-in-a-decade kind of opportunity.

The disruptive company, which started out as an online seller of books in the 1990s, has now transformed into a technology juggernaut that seemingly has its hands in many different industries. And shareholders have been rewarded, with a monster 10,150% stock gain just in the past two decades.\nEven with the business sporting a market cap of $2.4 trillion and raking in $168 billion in second-quarter revenue, investors might still consider owning the stock. Here's one reason to buy Amazon.\nGrowth from multiple segments\nAmazon stands out because of its historical growth. Net sales soared 617% between 2014 and 2024. Looking ahead, the gains should be broad-based. The fact that the business has multiple growth engines propelling it forward is one top reason investors should add Amazon to their portfolio.\nObviously, there's e-commerce, a subsector that only commands 16.3% of all retail spending in the U.S. But the company also makes money from digital advertising, a segment that saw sales jump 23% year over year in Q2. Amazon is also involved in healthcare and autonomous driving.\nDon't forget about Amazon Web Services\nThere's also the cloud computing division Amazon Web Services (AWS), the most exciting part of the company. AWS is growing at a slower pace than its smaller rivals, but this isn't necessarily cause for immediate concern. Those peers are expanding off a smaller revenue base. What's more, AWS still has the lead in terms of market share, and it remains extremely profitable, with an operating margin of 32.9% in the second quarter.\nAs we look to the next five or 10 years, AWS will surely become a more important contributor to Amazon's financial success. Add this to Amazon's other growing segments, and investors should think about buying this stock today.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

About a fourth of adults said they would need to make $150,000 or more, and 16% said they would need to make at least $200,000, the Bankrate survey said.\nSimilar to the LendingTree survey, Americans told Bankrate that their definition of wealth is changing due to rising expenses and financial uncertainty, leading them to prioritize financial security over traditional measures like net worth or luxury assets.\n\"Getting rich may have once been what many Americans fantasized about, but now, simply living comfortably feels like the new aspiration, as economic challenges make financial stability a rare luxury,\" said Bankrate economic analyst Sarah Foster.\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

Shiba Inu (CRYPTO: SHIB) is worth $7.3 billion (as of Aug. 21), enough to make it one of the 25 largest cryptocurrencies.\nFor investors who do their homework on everything in their portfolio, the continued success of meme coins is perplexing. Once you see the kind of returns meme coins can offer, it's easier to understand.\nFrom $100 to over $10 million\nShiba Inu has always traded at a fraction of $0.01, because it started with a massive supply of 1 quadrillion tokens.

Your 855 billion tokens would now be worth about $10.3 million. You'd be in the two-comma club, just from putting $100 into a meme coin five years ago.\nTherein lies the appeal of meme coins. They're long shots, to put it lightly, and the vast majority go nowhere. But a select few take off and deliver life-changing profits to early investors.\nThe odds are stacked against you when buying meme coins\nIt's easy to fall victim to survivorship bias when looking at meme coins. You hear about Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and a few others that have had success, but not the thousands of meme coins that nobody buys.\nEven with successful meme coins, you need to get in very early. Five years ago, Shiba Inu had less than $10,000 in daily trading volume, and there was no reason to expect it would take off.\nWhile the entire crypto market is risky, there are legitimate investment opportunities. Meme coins, on the other hand, are a roll of the dice.\nShould you buy stock in Shiba Inu right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Shiba Inu, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Shiba Inu wasn’t one of them.

This made it possible for the council to award four $2,500 scholarships to four deserving applicants: Kelsey Hoben, Cory Padgett, Adyson Burchett and Caitlin Padgett. The families of all four recipients are active members of the KAMC as convenience services operators or industry suppliers, said Chris Stave on behalf of KAMC.\nThe recipients were selected from a pool of applications. As a part of the application process, KAMC asked applicants to explain how the pandemic had affected their lives. The council shared excerpts from their applications:\n- “While COVID-19 disrupted my college experience in a big way, it also pushed me to grow. It taught me how to adapt, stay focused on long-term goals, and be resourceful even when everything felt uncertain.”\n- “As [past KAMC President] Mr. Barsotti put it, the good life is a simple life. I want to live similarly, helping others grow and live life to the fullest. As I always say, no matter how good or bad the day was, it is another day in paradise, even after a brutal graduate course exam.”\n- “This experience taught me that even in the hardest times, something positive can come out of struggle. I discovered that my family could be both my support system and my team. We had to communicate better, make sacrifices, and trust each other more than ever before.”\n- “Upon returning back to a college campus, I realized how essential human interaction and continuous learning are. I began to love school again, and I eventually found my way to a major that I was incredibly passionate about. This love and passion carried through to the end of my undergraduate degree.”\nBy easing college expenses for students from operator and supplier families, the scholarships help encourage the next generation to stay connected to the industry and help develop future leaders and skilled professionals who understand convenience services.","content_hash":"5b7cf2194f54da57e06f02bf514968b1","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2331,"method_rank":0}

The stock is down $20, or 10%, since it was first reported that it was buying the Identity Security firm CyberArk , and we continue to view this slide as an opportunity. It hasn't been a great earnings season for cybersecurity companies, but Palo Alto Networks separated itself from the pack last Monday night.

The quarter was validation that the \"platformization\" strategy — bundling services together — is working by setting a record for such deals. The market may not be sold on the $25 billion CyberArk acquisition, but we have confidence in CEO Nikesh Arora's ability to execute given his background in making deals. The company is buying this business at the perfect time, with Arora expecting the identity security market to inflect in the next 12 to 24 months due to the emergence of agentic AI, which refers to systems capable of taking actions and adapting with less input from humans.

Bank of America analysts on Monday slapped a bearish rating on the shares, setting a $10 price target on the stock that is a buck below the Visible Alpha mean, cutting its outlook for profits and suggesting that it lacks pricing power that could help it navigate the effects of tariffs.

The firm makes and sells nuclear reactors, and Cramer is optimistic about its ability to deliver the equipment. Since his comments in February, GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV)’s shares have gained 69%. One notable catalyst came in July after the shares jumped by 13.7%. The jump came after the firm’s $9.1 billion in revenue and $1.86 in profit-per-share beat analyst estimates of $8.8 billion and profit estimates of $1.50. Seems like Cramer’s enthusiasm about GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) was warranted:\n“We’re going to talk about the stock of GE Vernova. That’s the power division that was spun off from the old General Electric that so many of you like. Right now, we’ve got several huge themes occurring at once. We know that we have a gigantic number of data centers being put up in the country, correct? Now they require tremendous amount of electricity. They’re big drainers. Our most abundant source of power comes from burning of natural gas.
