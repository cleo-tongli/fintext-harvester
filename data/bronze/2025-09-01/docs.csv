As if the ever-changing trade mandates from U.S. President Donald Trump weren't hard enough for companies, here comes a new complication: the federal appeals court.
On Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that Trump's imposition of ""reciprocal"" tariffs on countries, as well as those on China, Canada and Mexico ostensibly in relation to fentanyl trafficking, was an overreach of his authority.
That said, those tariffs will be allowed to persist until Oct. 14 so that the Trump administration has time to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
On first blush, this development might seem to benefit stocks, which have already had a rip-roaring August. For the month, the S&P 500 added nearly 2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced over 3% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.6%.
However, tariffs flicking on and off might be more anxiety-inducing than the certainty of planning strategies around tackling those duties.
And that means potential volatility in markets. August's gains could be tested in September — the worst month for the S&P 500, historically speaking. Investors might hope to score consecutive months of gains but, at this moment, the added uncertainty around trade policies might diminish those chances.

What you need to know today
Most Trump tariffs are illegal, U.S. appeals court rules on Friday. Nevertheless, the court allowed the tariffs to run until Oct. 14 to give the Trump administration time to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. Here are the tariffs affected by the ruling.
Core inflation in the U.S. ticked up in July. The personal consumption expenditures price index, released Friday, showed a 2.9% rise in prices on the year. While in line with expectations, the reading is the highest since February.
U.S. stocks had a winning August. Even though the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite fell on Friday, all notched solid gains for the month. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index lost 0.64%, with most regional bourses in the red.
China and India could be partners instead of rivals, Xi Jinping says. The Chinese president made that remark at a security conference on Sunday, according to Xinhua. The sentiment was echoed by his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi, Reuters reported.
[PRO] August jobs number in focus. After July's dismal report made Trump fire the U.S. commissioner of labor statistics, investors will keep a close eye on August's report, out Friday, not just for the data but also the president's reaction.
And finally...
Here's what it really means for Trump to get control of the Federal Reserve board
President Donald Trump's effort to sack Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is about more than firing someone: It's a maneuver that, if successful, would mark a seismic shift for an institution that for ages has been considered above politics.
Should Trump get a majority of members on the board of governors to vote the way he wants — and the evidence right now, to be sure, is scant that he can ever achieve such a goal — it would give him access to key levers that control the economy as well as the nation's financial infrastructure.

The Tesla rival on Friday reported net profit of 6.36 billion yuan ($891 million) for the April-June quarter, down about 30% from a year earlier, according to data from LSEG.
The results came despite an expansion in overseas sales, which helped the company's revenue grow 14% year over year to about 201 billion yuan.
BYD's profitability has been harmed by the breakout of yet another discount war in China last quarter — something that has become a common occurrence in the space.
The company said in its mid-year earnings filing that ""increased price competition and frequent occurrences of excessive marketing"" in China's EV space had "" exerted an adverse periodic impact on the development of the industry.""
Retail car prices in China have fallen by around 19% over the past two years to around 165,000 yuan ($22,900), according to a recent Nomura report, citing industry data from Autohome Research Institute.
Weary of unfair competition, Chinese authorities in May warned they would punish carmakers for fueling price cuts.
BYD's net profit for the first half of the year reached 15.5 billion yuan, up nearly 14%. The company's first-half revenue climbed about 23% to 371.3 billion yuan, with new energy vehicle sales hitting a record high.
Chinese automakers, including BYD, have been expanding into new markets globally amid intense domestic competition. BYD has led that charge, opening showrooms across Europe and launching its cars at competitive prices over the last two years.
In July, BYD recorded over 13,000 new registrations on the continent, up 225% annually, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association.",7f2c36b6266363383cbf91889bb9089e,trafilatura

The RatingDog manufacturing purchasing managers' index came in at 50.5, sharply beating estimates of 49.7 from economists polled by Reuters.
The gauge signaled the fastest rate of expansion since March, rebounding from July's 49.5. A reading below 50 signals contraction while one above that threshold suggests an expansion.
The improvement was in part driven by a recovery in new export orders, indicating the ""resilience of external demand in the face of tariffs,"" Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics said in a note. The gains in overall output and new orders were more muted, suggesting ""little improvement in domestic demand,"" Huang added.
Average raw material costs rose at their fastest pace in nine months, prompting some businesses to pass on the higher expenses to consumers. The average sale prices stabilized after eight months of declines, the survey showed.
Beijing has sought to curb excess capacity and the price wars sweeping across industrial sectors that have weighed on businesses' bottom lines.
That said, profit trends interpreted from the PMI data showed only a slight recovery and remain under pressure overall, Yao Yu, founder of RatingDog, said in a statement.
While overall business confidence improved, employment in the manufacturing sector remained bleak, the survey showed, as business owners remained cautious with staffing, reducing jobs for a fifth straight month.
""The latest upturn resembled a breath of relief rather than a sustained rally,"" Yu said, cautioning about persistent weak domestic demand, ""potentially overstretched external orders,"" and a slow profit recovery.
""The durability of the improvement depends on whether exports truly stabilize and whether domestic demand can pick up pace,"" Yu added.
The results of the private survey was still more upbeat than the official reading released Sunday, which showed manufacturing activity shrank for a fifth straight month in August, coming in at 49.4 compared with 49.3 in July.
The non-manufacturing PMI index, covering services and construction, expanded to 50.3 in August from 50.1 in the prior month.
Private surveys have tended to paint a better picture than official polls over the previous years on the back of stronger exports. The private survey covers a smaller batch of over 500 mostly export-oriented firms, while the official PMI surveys a larger sample of over 3,000 companies in mostly upstream sectors.
China's exports growth has beaten expectations in recent months, driven largely by a surge in shipments to Southeast Asia and European countries, while shipments to the U.S. have declined for four straight months.
Chinese authorities have courted leaders from Southeast Asian, Central Asian, European and Latin American countries in recent months to expand trade and investment ties, as Washington's tariff policy hits shipments to the U.S.
Speaking at an annual gathering of foreign leaders — including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi — in Tianjin on Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping urged the member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization to deepen trade and investment ties and reject the ""Cold War mentality.""
Earlier this month, Beijing and Washington extended their tariff truce for another 90 days, keeping steep duties at bay, locking in place levies of about 57.6% on Chinese goods and 32.6% tariff on American goods, according to estimates by Peterson Institute for International Economics.",0e78184770b841c44b8e0a6ae02a600f,trafilatura

Xi was speaking at the largest-ever summit of the SCO to date, with more than 20 foreign leaders gathered in Tianjin, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The meeting comes as China seeks to cast itself as a global peacemaker, against a backdrop of persistent trade tensions with the United States, Russia's war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict.
Xi said China has invested $84 billion in other SCO countries and pledged support for 10,000 students to join Beijing's ""Luban"" vocational education program. He added that the SCO gathering presents an opportunity to chart a new phase of high-quality development and cooperation.
Ahead of his remarks, Xi briefly gathered with Modi and Putin during a photo session with all SCO members.
Xi is expected to meet with Putin this week, with the Russian leader scheduled to stay in China for a military parade in Beijing to commemorate 80 years since the end of World War II.
Over the weekend, Xi met with at least 10 visiting leaders, including Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Manet. On Saturday, he met Modi, with both sides affirming the importance of being partners, not rivals, according to official readouts.
""A stable relationship and cooperation between India and China and their 2.8 billion peoples on the basis of mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity are necessary for the growth and development of the two countries,"" India's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement following the meeting.
Global peacemaker?
While it remains unclear if the SCO summit will pave the way for any breakthroughs in easing tensions, analysts said that China's détente with India could help strengthen Beijing's influence.
""The improvement of relations with India is a big deal. It allows India to access highly critical intellectual property that it needs if it is to industrialize and boost manufacturing,"" Marko Papic, chief strategist, GeoMacro Strategy BCA Access, said in an email.
""But, over the long term, the U.S. is losing the propaganda battle to paint China as the trouble-maker-in-chief. And that only further ossifies multipolarity,"" he said.
China has taken some ""initiative"" for economic collaboration as well as peace, said Henry Huiyao Wang, founder and president of the Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization. He also pointed to efforts by China and India to rebuild ties and said he hoped India and Pakistan would do the same.
""[U.S.] President Trump is trying to make a lot of peace, but I think with the help of China, we could do the same too,"" Wang said Monday on CNBC's ""The China Connection.""
""China could take advantage of its good relations with Russia to help [broker] the deal for the Russian war in Ukraine,"" Wang said, adding that the SCO, or members like China and India, could act as a guarantor for security.
The SCO summit could lead to China building better relations with a slew of countries, Papic said.
SCO leaders signed a ""Tianjin Declaration"" and approved a development plan for the organization for the next decade through 2035, according to Chinese state media. Details of the text were not immediately available, although the report said members adopted 24 documents on strengthening cooperation on security, the economy and ""humanity.""
China will also establish cooperation platforms on new energy, green industry and digital economy, as well as centers for tech innovation, higher education and vocational education, Xi announced during a Monday afternoon session.
Later in the day, China's top diplomat Wang Yi said that the leaders agreed to launch the SCO Development Bank. He cast the financial institution as yet another multilateral bank. China has led the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which is headquartered in Beijing.
""Global governance must be achieved by coordination and cooperation, not by unilateral bullying,"" Wang said in Mandarin, according to an official English translation, as he took a question about the Global Governance Initiative.
New 'Global Governance Initiative'
Xi's opening remarks during the Monday afternoon session included a proposal for a ""Global Governance Initiative"" without disclosing further details.
It follows similar programs that Xi has announced in the last few years, such as the ""Global Development Initiative"" and ""Global Security Initiative."" In late July, Chinese Premier Li Qiang announced that the country has put forward an AI cooperation organization.
""The Cold War mentality, hegemonism and protectionism remain,“ despite 80 years of peace and cooperation since the end of World War II, Xi said in Mandarin, according to an official English translation. ""New threats and challenges are only increasing.""
""Global governance has come to a new crossroads,"" he said, urging ""commitment to peaceful coexistence"" without targeting third parties.
In the context of calling for uniform application of the international rule of law, the Chinese president said: that ""the house rules of a few countries should not be imposed upon others.""

The Stoxx Aerospace and Defense index rose 2.2%, after the U.K. government announced Sunday that Norway had placed a £10 billion ($13.5 billion) order for British-made warships for its Armed Forces. It will be the U.K.'s biggest ever warship export deal by value and support 4,000 jobs into the 2030s, according to a government statement.
The Type 26 frigates will be built at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow, Scotland, with shares of the company rising 1.9% on Monday. Other gainers in the sector included the U.K.'s Babcock International, up 2.1%.
Shares of Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk, meanwhile, ticked 1.8% higher, after the company released trial data suggesting its blockbuster drug Wegovy outperforms major rivals in heart disease risk reduction.
The study found continued users of semaglutide, a weight management drug branded as Wegovy, had up to a 57% greater reduction in the risk of heart attack, stroke or death than those using tirzepatide — the active ingredient in Zepbound and Mounjaro, the rival drugs produced by U.S. firm Eli Lilly. The companies are the leading players in the increasingly competitive weight loss space, with investors continuing to assess study data on their key products.
Denmark last week more than halved its annual economic growth forecast, in part citing Novo's declining U.S. market share and expectations for lower exports amid its struggles with tariffs and generic competitors.
It's a quiet day on the data front in Europe, although Turkish growth data and EU unemployment figures will be released.
Regional stock markets closed lower last Friday as traders monitored European and U.S. inflation data and assessed the likelihood of the U.S. Federal Reserve cutting interest rates at its next meeting in September. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stoked expectations for a cut in a speech widely interpreted as dovish-tilting. The Fed next meets on Sept. 16-17.
Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific markets traded in mixed territory overnight as investors assessed China's RatingDog manufacturing data for August. The metric — previously known as the Caixin Purchasing Managers' Index — came in at 50.5, compared with a contraction of 49.5 the month before.
Data released Sunday showed that the country's manufacturing PMI data came in at 49.4 in August, compared with 49.3 the month before.

Tuesday's quake occurred at a relatively shallow depth of 10 km (6 miles), the same level as the one that struck at midnight on Sunday with a magnitude of 6. That was one of Afghanistan's worst quakes in years, flattening houses in remote villages.
The aftershock caused panic and halted rescue efforts as it sent rocks sliding down mountains, cutting off roads further and making it dangerous to dig through rubble, said Safiullah Noorzai, who works with Aseel, a humanitarian tech platform with networks around Afghanistan.
Noorzai, whose organization has sent teams to the mountainous region, said more people had been injured, likely pushing the death toll higher.
The difficult terrain has badly hindered rescue workers' relief efforts in the isolated villages.
A Reuters journalist who reached the area on Tuesday, before the latest tremors, saw every home had been damaged or destroyed, with locals still digging through the rubble for survivors. A lot of people were still trapped. Some partially damaged homes were destroyed by the second earthquake, according to residents.
At least 1,411 people are known to have died so far, 3,124 have been injured and more than 5,400 houses destroyed, Taliban administration spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said.
The U.N. coordinator in Afghanistan said the death toll was sure to rise further.
Aid group Save the Children called on the international community to urgently release emergency funds. The earthquake has disrupted sources of clean water, raising fears of disease, and restricted access to food, it said.
""This is now a race against time to save lives – to get injured people out of remote villages cut off by massive rock falls and to get clean water, food, and shelter in,"" said Samira Sayed Rahman, Programmes and Advocacy Director at Save the Children.
Afghanistan is prone to deadly earthquakes, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain range, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet.
The eastern provinces of Kunar and Nangarhar were worst hit in Sunday night's earthquake.
On Tuesday, a line of ambulances was on the damaged mountain road trying to reach Kunar villages, as helicopters flew in, bringing aid supplies and taking the injured to hospitals, according to a Reuters reporter.
Thousands of children were at risk, the United Nations Children's Fund warned on Tuesday.
UNICEF said it was sending medicines, warm clothing, tents and tarpaulins for shelter, and hygiene items such as soap, detergent, towels, sanitary pads, and water buckets.
Taliban soldiers were deployed in the area, providing help and security. The disaster has further stretched the war-torn nation's Taliban administration, already grappling with a sharp drop in foreign aid and deportations of hundreds of thousands of Afghans by neighbouring countries.
""Damaged roads, ongoing aftershocks, and remote locations of many villages severely impede the delivery of aid,"" the World Health Organization said, adding that over 12,000 people had been affected by the quake.
""The pre-earthquake fragility of the health system means local capacity is overwhelmed, creating total dependence on external actors,"" it said.
Food and tents were desperately needed, said Aseel's Noorzai. With their houses in ruins, many people were living in the open amid a fear of aftershocks, Noorzai added.
Aid cuts
The rescue and relief work has struggled in the face of tight resources in the impoverished nation of 42 million people and limited global help in the aftermath of the tragedy.
So far, Britain has allocated 1 million pounds ($1.35 million) to support the efforts of the U.N. and the International Red Cross.
India delivered 1,000 tents and was moving 15 metric tons of food supplies to Kunar, with more relief to be sent on Tuesday.
Other nations such as China, the United Arab Emirates, the European Union, Pakistan and Iran have pledged help but aid is yet to arrive.
Afghanistan has been badly hit by U.S. President Donald Trump's decision in January to cut funding to its humanitarian arm USAID and reductions in other foreign aid programs.
Crises elsewhere in the world, along with donor frustration over the Taliban's policies toward women and curbs on aid workers have been a factor in funding cuts, according to diplomats and aid officials.",653a330d5b8dc1f1c8f70d3c223a69d3,trafilatura

""We can indeed confirm that there was GPS jamming, but the plane landed safely in Bulgaria. We have received information from the Bulgarian authorities that they suspect that this was due to blatant interference by Russia,"" a European Commission spokesperson said at a press briefing Monday.
""We are of course aware and used to the threats and intimidations that are a regular component of Russia's hostile behavior, and of course this will only reinforce further our unshakeable commitment to ramp up defense capabilities and support for Ukraine,"" the spokesperson added.
The incident underlined the need to urgently invest in European defense and security, the spokesperson said.
Von der Leyen was on a plane chartered by the European Commission, the EU said. Asked by a reporter if the plane had been the intended target of the alleged GPS jamming — which prevents access to the satellite-based navigation system — the spokesperson said, ""I think the question is best asked to the Russians if indeed it is them that have carried it out.""
CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for a response to the allegation. Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Financial Times earlier that the information was ""incorrect,"" however.
CNBC has contacted the Bulgarian Air Traffic Services Authority for further information on the incident. However, an earlier statement to the FT read: ""Since February 2022, there has been a notable increase in [GPS] jamming and recently spoofing occurrences,"" it said. ""These interferences disrupt the accurate reception of [GPS] signals, leading to various operational challenges for aircraft and ground systems.""

Health insurance is a key employee benefit, and many workers don't spend much time picking the right plan, surveys show.
Nearly one-third of health insurance enrollees spent less than 30 minutes choosing a plan in 2024, according to an Employee Benefit Research Institute survey of more than 2,000 participants in fall 2024.
Some 48% of millennials, my generation, admitted to ""blindly"" picking health plans because they didn't understand them, a separate Justworks survey of nearly 4,200 U.S. adults from late 2024 found.

Picking the wrong plan could be costly as health care prices rise.
Companies expect health plan expenses to increase by 9% in 2026, according to the nonprofit Business Group on Health, based on June survey responses from 121 large employers with plans covering 11.6 million workers.
In 2024, employers offering health insurance covered 75% to 85% of plan costs, and workers paid the rest via premiums and copays, according to a survey of 2,100 firms from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health-care policy organization.
But as plan costs rise, companies could shift more expenses onto workers in 2025, financial consulting firm Mercer found, based on a survey of roughly 700 organizations.
Amid uncertain costs, here's how I'm preparing for health care open enrollment choices this fall.
Tracking health care spending
One of the hardest parts of picking health insurance is knowing future needs. There is no crystal ball, but you can review past medical spending.
Several years ago, I started tracking annual out-of-pocket health care costs, including co-payments, prescriptions, medical bills, over-the-counter expenses and more. It's tedious, but I use the number for two open enrollment tasks:
- Finding the right health insurance plan
- Deciding how much to save in my flexible spending account (FSA)
Total out-of-pocket expenses, along with detailed receipts, are also useful at tax time to see if I can claim the medical expense deduction, which isn't typical. (You must itemize tax breaks to qualify, and 90% of filers use the standard deduction, according to the latest IRS data. Even then, unreimbursed medical expenses have to exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income.)
Paying now vs. later
Typically, health plans offer two choices. You can pay more upfront via higher premiums from each paycheck. Or, you can pay more later with a bigger deductible, which is how much you owe before insurance kicks in.
By tracking yearly medical expenses, I can see which option could be more affordable for the coming year.
In some cases, the higher deductible is cheaper when you're healthy and rarely use services. Plus, many plans cover preventative care, such as yearly physicals, at no cost, before hitting the deductible.
That strategy could change if I expect multiple treatments or a surgery. In that case, I would consider opting for the higher premium, lower deductible plan.
Cover your health insurance deductible
Regardless of the health plan I choose, I always aim to cover my deductible plus other out-of-pocket expenses with my FSA, which is also funded via paycheck deductions.
The money goes in before taxes, and I can spend those pretax funds on eligible healthcare expenses, co-payments and deductibles. I think of the tax savings like a discount.
The downside of FSAs is I must spend the balance by the end of the calendar year — or forfeit the funds — with a small carryover allowed into the next year. I track that spending monthly to avoid a surprise balance in December.
The average household FSA contribution was $2,250 in 2024, and 77% was expected to be spent by November, according to 2024 data from Numerator, a market research data provider.
Leverage a health savings account
Before joining CNBC, I was a full-time freelance writer for six years, with a high-deductible health insurance plan through Healthcare.gov.
Premiums were high, but I could contribute to a health savings account, which works like a long-term emergency fund for medical expenses. Unlike an FSA, the balance rolls over yearly.
If you can afford to leave the money untouched, some HSAs let you invest the balance for long-term growth.
HSAs offer three tax benefits. There's an upfront deduction for deposits, the funds grow tax-free and withdrawals are tax-free for eligible health care costs.
In 2024, two-thirds of companies offered investment options for HSA contributions, according to a survey from Plan Sponsor Council of America, which polled more than 500 employers in the summer of 2024.
But only 18% of participants were investing their HSA balance, down slightly from the previous year, the survey found.",3b7584a588fe61951787b8200e4aaec1,trafilatura

A widely shared clip of Chinese President Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin laughing together in Tianjin has already gone viral.
On the surface, it appears to be an easy exchange between three leaders. But analysts say it reflects a delicate mix of competing rivalries and shifting power dynamics.
Gautam Bambawale, India's former ambassador to China, told CNBC's Inside India: ""The dragon and the elephant are not dancing as yet. They are just looking at each other from opposite sides of a room and trying to assess what are the implications of the relationship between the two? It's going to take time to bring the relationship back on track.""
The obstacles are clear. The border dispute between India and China remains unresolved since the 2020 clashes. Beijing's close partnership with Pakistan — extending beyond economic corridors into military equipment and intelligence cooperation — further constrains how far ties can develop.
This week's Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit gave the photograph its backdrop. The SCO is expanding in size and ambition, but as Jeremy Chan at Eurasia Group pointed out, more prominence does not necessarily mean more relevance.
""The SCO, while it's generally described as a security organization, really doesn't focus on military matters per se, and on all of the global conflicts that have taken place recently, whether that's Ukraine or in Gaza, the SCO has essentially been absent,"" Chan told CNBC.
The timing of the meeting is also notable. With U.S. President Donald Trump raising tariffs and unsettling global markets, Beijing is using the SCO to emphasize its outreach to the Global South. Chan said Trump is ""breathing new life"" into the summit, giving China a chance to frame its diplomacy as more dependable than Washington's.
On Monday, Trump posted on Truth Social, saying that India had offered to reduce its tariffs to U.S. goods to zero. Describing the relationship with India as one-sided, Trump said the U.S. is India's biggest client.
""The reason is that India has charged us, until now, such high Tariffs, the most of any country, that our businesses are unable to sell into India. It has been a totally one sided disaster! Also, India buys most of its oil and military products from Russia, very little from the U.S. They have now offered to cut their Tariffs to nothing, but it's getting late. They should have done so years ago,"" Trump posted.
Meanwhile, the photo-op has also drawn scrutiny in U.S. media. The New York Times described the interaction as a ""smiling manifestation of a troika that Moscow had recently said it hoped to revive,"" noting the optics of closeness between Modi and Putin, who even shared a ride to a meeting on the sidelines. The report argued that India's traditionally cautious bureaucracy might once have avoided such overt displays with China and Russia, but Trump's sweeping tariffs leave New Delhi with ""little incentive"" to hold back.
Multipolarity, defined differently
For investors, the stakes are significant. The SCO brings together economies representing nearly half the world's population, central to energy and trade flows. With tariffs threatening supply chains and markets watching for signs of fragmentation, summits like these are closely watched for signals of new alignments, even if substantive outcomes are limited.
For India, the optics carry weight. Modi's talks with Xi were interpreted as a reminder to Washington that India is willing to maintain dialogue with Beijing and Moscow while deepening ties with the U.S. and its allies. But New Delhi's decision to skip the SCO military parade underscored the limits of any thaw.
""India is using this to opportunistically send a signal indirectly to Washington, that it has strategic options, not only in Beijing, but also in Moscow,"" Chan said. Modi's quick exit from the summit, immediately after arriving from Tokyo, also underlined India's continued engagement with U.S. partners in Asia.
At the heart of the summit was a debate over ""multipolarity,"" Chan said, adding that the definition of multipolarity is different for India and China.
Beijing defines it as a system where U.S. dominance is reduced, allowing China greater scope to assert itself as Asia's leading power. India, by contrast, sees multipolarity as influence spread more evenly across many countries, with no single state in control, Chan told CNBC's Inside India.
Meanwhile, for Russia, the SCO remains one of the few international platforms where Putin is not on the defensive, underscoring Moscow's enduring ties with influential Asian partners despite Western sanctions.

According to one estimate, it is ""the largest cut to SNAP in history,"" a federal program which in one form or another dates back to the New Deal era and currently provides basic food assistance to more than 40 million people.
Grocers large and small are bracing for the impact of changes to the SNAP program. A CBO analysis released this month estimates that 2.4 million fewer Americans, including families with children, are forecast to receive food stamps benefits in an average month. Other estimates show families across the U.S. could lose anywhere from $72 to $231 per month in support.
While low-income Americans will have more difficulty qualifying for the benefits, many experts predict that some of the largest grocers, despite having many SNAP recipients among their ranks of customers, may actually benefit.
According to consumer data company Numerator's verified purchase data for SNAP users, Walmart leads in SNAP shopper spend with 24 percent, followed by Kroger (8%), Costco (6%), Amazon (5%), and Sam's Club (4%).
""On the surface one would think less SNAP would be a negative, but the way these things have played out in the past and the way I think it will play out this time is that discount grocers that focus on value, these kinds of economic headwinds for lower-income customers end up being a positive,"" said Michael Baker, analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co.
Baker cited Walmart as one of the retailers that will likely see a positive impact from the SNAP changes.
""Consumers have to find other ways to save money, they still need groceries. I can envision a little bit of a negative impact on the size of the purchase or units per transaction, but that tends to get offset by increased traffic,"" Baker said.
He thinks customers spending SNAP dollars at Target or Costco are going to trade down to stretch their dollars. Other retailers, such as B.J. Wholesale, may benefit because it is positioning itself as a value-based destination for weekly club store grocery shopping, according to Baker.
Scott Moses, group head of grocery, restaurants and pharmacy investment banking at Solomon Partners, also expects Walmart to come out a winner in the SNAP changes.
""As the world's largest grocer – by a very wide margin – Walmart can use its scale and extremely low cost of debt to capitalize on SNAP cuts – as it has done with food inflation – offering better prices than its smaller peers can afford to match and strengthening its customer value proposition,"" Moses said.
The biggest impact to grocers, according to Baker, will be felt around the edges, and it is at the level of independent stores that the most pain is expected. Independent grocery store operators are on edge.
Stephanie Johnson, group vice president of government relations at the National Grocers Association, which represents 20,000 independent and small chain grocery stores across the country, says that the changes will hit grocery stores in two waves.
Johnson says work requirements — for example, when adults do not report working 20-hours per week or complete paperwork to qualify for an exemption, they will only be eligible for SNAP benefits for three months every three years — are going into effect now as states implement changes.
""Those people will fall off immediately as states implement changes,"" Johnson said, adding that these changes are about half the impact of the SNAP changes. ""And the impact will be different depending on the neighborhood. There are a lot of unknowns,"" she added.
NGA member make up one-third of the grocery industry and $250 billion in sales a year, but exposure to SNAP varies widely, with some grocers having less than 1 percent of their sales as SNAP while others push 70 percent.
""Our members have between a 1–2 percent net profit margin, that is a big change. Because of those margins, our members are not getting rich off of SNAP,"" she said.
The trade group will be engaging with Congress, citing data such as the fact that SNAP makes up about 12 percent of grocery sales in the U.S., and 6 to 10 percent of those sales could be impacted by the loss of benefits, with ripple effects on jobs in the sector, but she said that it is unlikely any changes will be rolled back in the current Congress.
Katina Holliday, owner of Freshly's Market in Aberdeen, Mississippi, opened the grocery as a way to combat a food desert. She is in the process of opening a second Freshly's in another nearby community, which means the SNAP changes are coming at a bad time. ""Our sales have totally decreased the past couple of months to the lowest I have seen,"" Holliday said.
She says Freshly's has seen a 35 to 45 percent decrease in business, forcing her to cut hours, consolidate management positions, and put a hiring freeze in place. ""Walmart will benefit totally because they are able to get volume at a lower price. We don't take in a large volume and we pay a higher price already,"" Holliday added. ""There isn't loyalty like there used to be,"" she added.
Walmart, and most major grocery store chains, declined to comment. But Pittsburgh-based Giant Eagle, which is the No. 1 grocery store in its market, with stores also in Columbus and Cleveland, Ohio, said it is working on limiting the impact to shoppers from the SNAP changes.
""As retailers look toward the next 12 to 24 months, there is a recognition that changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) may impact grocery budgets for some families,"" said a Giant Eagle spokesman. He noted that the benefit cuts come during a period of time when consumers are prioritizing value more than ever. Over the past 12 months, he noted, industry grocery prices have been influenced by compounding factors including recent and existing tariff implementation, fluctuations in transportation costs, and product availability challenges driven by a variety of factors.
In addition to weekly sales available in circulars, discounts in the Giant Eagle mobile app, and grocery and fuel rewards through a loyalty program, the spokesman said Giant Eagle will be working with suppliers to explore all opportunities to maintain and reduce costs. ""We feel this is the best way we can help customers save on their groceries, regardless of the individual budget challenges they may be facing,"" he said.
The cost to Americans will ultimately extend beyond grocery store dollars, according to Michael Goldberg, associate professor at the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University, who says there is a larger question underlying the SNAP reform debate that gets obscured — the trading down of nutritional value.
Goldberg says SNAP has served as a sort of partnership between the federal government and grocers that has provided those at the lower end of the income scale access to food they might not have otherwise been able to purchase.
""The dollar goes farther at Walmart than at the farmers market,"" Goldberg said.
That means SNAP customers who once might have spent their benefits for costlier, but healthier, farmers market produce will now more likely find themselves picking through the aisles of Walmart. These societal costs, he says, are harder to calculate.
""We pay for this one way or another if people are not eating healthy,"" Goldberg said.",e7925351adeca5b278d3b5e49425aceb,trafilatura

The plant is the third – and likely the last – mothballed reactor in the U.S. that is in shape to come back online to support growing electricity demand in the U.S.
Duane Arnold would follow similar restarts planned for the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan and Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, which plan to resume operations later this year and in 2027, respectively, subject to approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved a request last week from NextEra Energy, Duane Arnold's owner, to let the nuclear plant reconnect to the electric grid. NextEra sees Duane Arnold restarting operations by the fourth quarter of 2028 at the earliest, according to FERC filings.
""While a significant amount of work needs to be done before the facility could be restarted, FERC's decision is another positive step in the process,"" Neil Nissan, a NextEra spokesperson, said in a statement to CNBC.
Power purchase agreement
With big technology companies looking to feed more nuclear power on to the grid to fuel the electricity-hungry data centers they are building to train artificial intelligence, Florida-based NextEra is aiming to win a lucrative power purchase agreement to restart Duane Arnold. Three Mile Island, for example, is restarting with financial support from a power agreement with Microsoft.
""The recommissioning of Duane Arnold has received significant commercial interest from premier American companies,"" Garrett Goldfinger, the NextEra executive in charge of the restart project, told FERC in a late July filing.
Duane Arnold would bring more than 600 megawatts of electricity back to the grid, equivalent to the electricity needs of more than 400,000 homes.
""If we're successful in bringing Duane forward, that obviously creates a hot bed of data center activity around that facility,"" NextEra CEO John Ketchum told investors on the company's July earnings call.
'Unicorn opportunities'
Duane Arnold, Palisades and Three Mile Island are three of the 10 U.S. reactors that closed over the past decade as nuclear power strained to compete against cheap natural gas and renewable energy.
Restarting these plants is the most concrete sign yet that the nuclear industry is coming back after years of financial struggles.
""These are unique opportunities because you don't face the new build costs associated with nuclear,"" Ketchum said on NextEra's earnings call. ""These are really unicorn-type opportunities.""
NextEra, the largest renewable power developer in the U.S., had previously divided up Duane Arnold's grid connection among multiple solar farms that the company was developing in response to the demand in Iowa for lower cost electricity.
But the market last year started to shift back in favor of high-capacity nuclear power as the U.S. saw an unprecedented increase in electricity demand from industry and data centers, NextEra said in its filing to FERC.
NextEra is now consolidating those solar grid connections back into a single one for Duane Arnold after securing FERC approval. This will ""provide commercial and financial certainty to support the recommissioning effort and expedite the resumption of clean, reliable operations at Duane Arnold,"" Goldfinger told FERC.
Capital intensive
NextEra said the restart of Duane Arnold will be a ""highly capital-intensive process."" It disclosed in its filing to FERC that it plans on spending as much as $100 million in 2025 alone on the project.
NextEra has placed orders for new transformers to replace the ones that were removed when the plant was shut down, although the transformers face significant supply chain constraints and will take about three years to deliver. The plant's cooling towers, administration building and training center were also dismantled and need to be replaced.
The nuclear industry has a long history of projects delays, Goldfinger cautioned, and the Duane Arnold restart could take longer than expected if the transformers, for example, are delivered late.
While there are risks, Duane Arnold represents a financial opportunity for NextEra, the parent company of Florida Power & Light. The stock has barely moved this year despite growing power demand, a sharp reversal from 2024 when shares jumped 18% Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump's repeated attacks on renewable energy have shaken investor confidence in solar and wind power.
Solar and wind projects will no longer be eligible for two key tax credits after 2027, which is expected to crimp demand for renewables. Duane Arnold restarting in 2028 could help offset some of the lost earnings from the phase out of the tax credits, Ketchum said on the July earnings call.
""You add Duane Arnold to the mix and that's one of many ways that we have to continue to grow the business in the future,"" Ketchum said.",c04e3c59cb9ec436f846458a8ec94c65,trafilatura

As the Trump administration continues to ramp up immigration enforcement, industries key to the state's $4 trillion economy like agriculture, construction and hospitality could be among those hardest hit by the loss of California's immigrant workforce, according to new research.
At stake are billions of dollars that fuel businesses large and small across the state, whose standalone economy is the fourth largest in the world after the United States, China and Germany.
Approximately one-fifth of the state's 10.6 million immigrants are undocumented, according to a June study from the nonpartisan Bay Area Economic Institute and the University of California, Merced.
If mass deportations were to be combined with the end of temporary protected status for thousands of immigrants and stricter border policies, the joint study estimated that California would be at risk of losing as much as $278 billion from its gross domestic product.
Immigrant workers have been essential in bolstering the state's economy given declining birthrates and an aging population, said Abby Raisz, research director at the Bay Area Economic Institute.
""These are the workers that are keeping our economy afloat. They're keeping businesses open,"" Raisz told CNBC.
One of the places that is most evident is in the fields where food is grown and harvested, researchers and advocates say.
Agriculture, a $49 billion industry for the state, has the highest concentration of immigrant and undocumented immigrant workers in California, with 63% of them immigrants and 24% of farm workers undocumented, the Bay Area Council report found.
""Without them, we wouldn't have any food available,"" said Joe Garcia, president of the California Farmworker Association and CEO of Jaguar Labor Contracting, which connects farmworkers to growers.
""The lettuce, the strawberries, all the wine we drink on a daily basis, fruit juices– everything that a farmworker picks, packs, pre-harvest– they do the jobs all year round that put food on your table,"" he said.
Garcia added that automation isn't an option for many of these positions, and American-born workers are not interested in taking on these jobs, which are often strenuous, low-paid and outdoors.
The Trump administration insists that the domestic labor market can withstand a shortage of immigrant labor, and says its focus is on creating jobs for U.S. citizens.
""Over one in ten young adults in America are neither employed, in higher education, nor pursuing some sort of vocational training,"" said White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson in response to an inquiry from CNBC about the potential impact of mass deportations on California and its key industries.
""There is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force, and President Trump's agenda to create jobs for American workers represents this Administration's commitment to capitalizing on that untapped potential while delivering on our mandate to enforce our immigration laws.""
ICE impacts
In downtown Los Angeles, businesses have felt waves of impact in June and beyond due to high-profile ICE raids, accompanying protests and National Guard Deployment, owners and advocates said, exacerbating a public perception issue that downtown Los Angeles is not safe.
The Independent Hospitality Coalition, which represents some 900 local businesses and workers in the Los Angeles Area, said the raids struck fear into the immigrant workforce and created a challenging atmosphere for businesses that were already faced with several years of uphill battles.
""COVID, it was an international emergency that we were all dealing with. Here in California, especially here in Los Angeles, with the recent Palisades and Altadena fires… now it's immigration situation that we're dealing with. It's more like a localized COVID all over again,"" said Eddie Navarette, executive director of the hospitality commission.
Courtney Kaplan owns three Los Angeles restaurants, including Camelia in the downtown Arts District. She saw a 70 percent drop in sales in June alone, she told CNBC, due to closures and curfews, even though she is not in close proximity to where protests or the National Guard deployments took place.
Her staff continue to come to work, but the uncertainty around both immigration and trade policy, as she relies on imported wines and sake, weigh on her. Data from OpenTable show a drop in dining reservations for all of Los Angeles were down from June 7th through the 21st by 3% year on year.
""The biggest challenge for us, aside from the lost revenue and the decrease in business, has been the uncertainty of every day. It's been so unpredictable. It's been chaotic,"" Kaplan told CNBC in July.
""We're still in the very early days of these changes to immigration policy, so it's hard to even predict what's coming. It just is a cause of concern that perhaps that down the line, the situation for us will change with our team members' comfort levels.""
Worker shortages
Sectors like construction and farming are staring down worker shortages that predate any change to immigration policy. In California, more than sixty percent of construction workers are immigrants and a quarter of them are undocumented, the Bay Area Council report found.
""There are profound skill shortages in these production industries, construction, manufacturing, because culturally, we have not created enough of these workers,"" said Anirban Basu, chief economist at Associated Builders and Contractors, a trade group.
""The way we've dealt with this over time has been immigration. Other cultures, cultures associated with other countries have different characteristics. Many more people there have been willing and wanting to be in the skilled trades, and we import that talent to improve our built environment.""
Contractors largely fall into two camps, he told CNBC. Some of them express confidence and support for Trump, believing the president's strategy will spur domestic manufacturing, investment and hiring. Others are pessimistic, as costs and uncertainty have risen.
Regardless of contractors' outlooks, said Basu, the nature of California's economy and its longstanding housing shortage mean that the state is constantly in need of construction workers.
""Even during tough economic times, it's in the midst of transformation,"" he said.",530c102dd0b0c46cca54205d9e5aedcb,trafilatura

Buying home, advocates say, allows you to lock in a rate and build equity in a property that will theoretically appreciate. By comparison, forking over what could be a mortgage payment in the form of rent each month is akin to throwing money away.
It's a line that Bernadette Joy, author of ""Crush Your Money Goals,"" has heard before. The self-made millionaire and financial coach gets pushback whenever she cautions against homeownership for homeownership's sake.
""My favorite thing is to challenge people and say, 'Show me your amortization table,'"" she says. ""Show me how much equity you've really built.""
Over the first several years of your mortgage, Joy points out, much of your payment goes toward interest rather than the principal. If you're in a 30-year mortgage, she says, you may find yourself a half a decade in with little equity to show for it, which is why she typically recommends an alternative for clients.
""If you're going to buy a home, buy it on a 15-year mortgage, because at least you'll build equity much faster that way,"" she says. ""If you can't afford a 15-year mortgage, you can't really afford the home.""
Buying a house you can afford
If you're currently renting and playing around with mortgage calculators, you may think you could own a home for roughly what you're paying in rent — even if you're factoring in some of the prominent costs of homeownership, such as property taxes and home insurance.
But homeownership comes with other hidden costs, Joy says. And going in unprepared could leave you in a precarious financial situation.
Help us help you: Take our survey on work, money and life goals
""I have very rarely come across a coaching client that said, 'You know what, let me actually do the proper math of what I can truly afford on a mortgage,'"" she says. ""And so what I'm finding with that, is that most people are buying more house than they can actually, practically afford.""
Here are a few things to consider in your calculations.
A pricier mortgage
Joy prefers a 15-year mortgage because you can build equity faster, with more flexibility. Though you'll eventually start paying down the principal on a 30-year mortgage, it's a long time to wait, she says.
""How likely is it that you'll see the [30-year] mortgage through to the bitter end, without selling or refinancing (and starting the clock all over again)?"" she wrote in a recent article for Bankrate.
Of course, a shorter mortgage comes at a steeper price. Buy a $435,300 home — the median price according to the National Association of Realtors — with a 20% down payment, and you're looking at a monthly payment of about $2,500 on a 30-year mortgage, according to Bankrate's calculator. Bump the loan down to 15 years, and your bill rises to nearly $3,400 a month.
The cost of sizing up
No matter which kind of mortgage you choose, a new home is likely going to be a step up in space over what you were renting, says Joy — and that comes with an increase in costs. For one, you'll have more rooms to furnish. And since you own the place, you're probably not going to want to go cheap.
""When I sit down with clients, I say, let's look at the cost of outfitting this home the way you want it to look,"" she says. ""People don't want to furnish their new home with IKEA. They're going to West Elm.""
Expect to pay more in utilities too, she says, since you have more space to heat and cool. And if you left your city apartment for the house out in the burbs, Joy recommends factoring a longer commute into your budget as well.
Maintenance and other headaches
""You have to budget a certain amount every year for repairs, because that's just going to be the case,"" Joy says.
Homeowners pay an average of $8,808 in annual maintenance costs, according to a recent Bankrate survey. If you don't have the cash to pay for a fallen tree or a new washing machine or one of the million other things that could come up, you may find yourself making some tough decisions.
""What I see happen to a lot of my clients is, they buy the home and things are good until something breaks,"" she says. ""Then they get into credit card debt, or they are having to significantly sacrifice other places in their lifestyle in order to accommodate those things.""
Know your numbers
Overall, Joy recommends a 50-25-25 approach to budgeting, with 50% of your income going toward living expenses, 25% going toward growing your wealth and the remainder on things you enjoy.
If, after accounting for all the costs, buying a home would put your living expenses over that 50% threshold ""the math isn't mathing,"" Joy says.
And even if it is within your budget, make sure that you have enough for an emergency fund, too.
""If you've been someone who has not been able to maintain a level of three months' worth of expenses sitting inside a high yield savings account,"" Joy says, ""then you're not ready to buy a home.""

The plan, outlined in a 38-page document initially disclosed by the Washington Post, is reportedly under consideration by Trump's administration. It involves ""voluntary"" relocation of Gaza's population in exchange for digital tokens, six to eight ""AI-powered smart cities,"" and a manufacturing hub named after Elon Musk.
It also calls for the entirety of Gaza's population of two million to be relocated, at least temporarily, through either what it calls voluntary departures to another country, or the moving of residents into temporary housing areas within the Strip during reconstruction.
The plan was developed by some of the same Israelis behind the controversial U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), according to the Washington Post, which first reported on the document. The GHF, whose stated goal is to provide food inside the enclave, has received heavy criticism from U.N. experts for allegedly being ""exploited for covert military and geopolitical agendas in serious breach of international law.""
The State Department and White House did not immediately respond to CNBC requests for comment.
Gaza would be under U.S. trusteeship for around ten years ""until a reformed and deradicalized Palestinian Polity is ready to step in its shoes,"" according to the plan, entitled the Gaza Reconstitution, Economic Acceleration and Transformation Trust, or GREAT Trust. It promises to transform the long-blockaded territory, on which more than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the Israel-Hamas war on Oct. 7, 2023, into a glittering tourism resort and tech hub.
""Reconstruction will also increase value of Gaza by ~$324B and dramatically improve quality of life,"" the document states. The GREAT Trust would begin under an initial U.S.-Israel bilateral agreement, and Israel would maintain ""overarching rights to meet its security needs,"" according to the document.
The State Department and White House did not immediately respond to CNBC requests for comment.
The authors of the plan claim that no federal funding or donations would be required; it would instead be financed by private and public sector investment in what it describes as ""mega-projects,"" from data centers and electric vehicle factories to luxury apartments and seaside resorts.
The development plan also envisions using roughly 30% of Gazan land that is public — leased to the Trust for up to 99 years — and any investments as its initial capital and assets, which it claims constitutes a $300 billion asset value with ""self-generating revenue streams.""
Gazans who choose to relocate to another country would be given a $5,000 relocation package, four years of rent subsidies, and one year of food subsidies, according to the document. The plan assumes that 25% of Gazans would choose to leave the country, and of those, 75% would choose not to return.
The plan claimed that this method would save $23,000 on every Palestinian relocating compared to costs of supporting those who stay inside Gaza. At no point does the document address international law, Palestinian opposition to mass relocation, or opposition to this plan by other Arab states, who have long demanded a state and self-determination for Palestinians.
The plan's ""end state"" is Gaza's ""self-governance under the Abraham Accords"" — a framework that establishes diplomatic relations with Israel — though there is no mention of an officially recognized Palestinian state.
Gaza residents who leave land that they own would also receive a ""digital token"" by the GREAT Trust in exchange for the right to develop their property, and can ""redeem their tokens for ownership of rebuilt residences,"" according to the plan.
Trump first announced his vision of a ""Gaza Riviera"" under U.S. ownership in February, drawing swift condemnation and shock from international leaders, and Middle Eastern allies like Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates in particular. Rights groups have accused Israel of carrying out ethnic cleansing and genocide in Gaza, charges that the Israeli government forcefully denies. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has praised Trump's idea.
The U.N. estimated in April that roughly 92% of all residential buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the war, which began after militant and political group Hamas, which governs the enclave, carried out a cross-border attack on Israel that killed roughly 1,200 people.
Hamas for its part vocally rejected the proposal on Monday, with its political bureau member Bassem Naim saying that ""Gaza is not for sale"" and is ""part of the greater Palestinian homeland.""",7a299570dac17b08d380c2c3c6cbf7f8,trafilatura

As the Trump administration continues to ramp up immigration enforcement, industries key to the state's $4 trillion economy like agriculture, construction and hospitality could be among those hardest hit by the loss of California's immigrant workforce, according to new research.
At stake are billions of dollars that fuel businesses large and small across the state, whose standalone economy is the fourth largest in the world after the United States, China and Germany.
Approximately one-fifth of the state's 10.6 million immigrants are undocumented, according to a June study from the nonpartisan Bay Area Economic Institute and the University of California, Merced.
If mass deportations were to be combined with the end of temporary protected status for thousands of immigrants and stricter border policies, the joint study estimated that California would be at risk of losing as much as $278 billion from its gross domestic product.
Immigrant workers have been essential in bolstering the state's economy given declining birthrates and an aging population, said Abby Raisz, research director at the Bay Area Economic Institute.
""These are the workers that are keeping our economy afloat. They're keeping businesses open,"" Raisz told CNBC.
One of the places that is most evident is in the fields where food is grown and harvested, researchers and advocates say.
Agriculture, a $49 billion industry for the state, has the highest concentration of immigrant and undocumented immigrant workers in California, with 63% of them immigrants and 24% of farm workers undocumented, the Bay Area Council report found.
""Without them, we wouldn't have any food available,"" said Joe Garcia, president of the California Farmworker Association and CEO of Jaguar Labor Contracting, which connects farmworkers to growers.
""The lettuce, the strawberries, all the wine we drink on a daily basis, fruit juices– everything that a farmworker picks, packs, pre-harvest– they do the jobs all year round that put food on your table,"" he said.
Garcia added that automation isn't an option for many of these positions, and American-born workers are not interested in taking on these jobs, which are often strenuous, low-paid and outdoors.
The Trump administration insists that the domestic labor market can withstand a shortage of immigrant labor, and says its focus is on creating jobs for U.S. citizens.
""Over one in ten young adults in America are neither employed, in higher education, nor pursuing some sort of vocational training,"" said White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson in response to an inquiry from CNBC about the potential impact of mass deportations on California and its key industries.
""There is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force, and President Trump's agenda to create jobs for American workers represents this Administration's commitment to capitalizing on that untapped potential while delivering on our mandate to enforce our immigration laws.""
ICE impacts
In downtown Los Angeles, businesses have felt waves of impact in June and beyond due to high-profile ICE raids, accompanying protests and National Guard Deployment, owners and advocates said, exacerbating a public perception issue that downtown Los Angeles is not safe.
The Independent Hospitality Coalition, which represents some 900 local businesses and workers in the Los Angeles Area, said the raids struck fear into the immigrant workforce and created a challenging atmosphere for businesses that were already faced with several years of uphill battles.
""COVID, it was an international emergency that we were all dealing with. Here in California, especially here in Los Angeles, with the recent Palisades and Altadena fires… now it's immigration situation that we're dealing with. It's more like a localized COVID all over again,"" said Eddie Navarette, executive director of the hospitality commission.
Courtney Kaplan owns three Los Angeles restaurants, including Camelia in the downtown Arts District. She saw a 70 percent drop in sales in June alone, she told CNBC, due to closures and curfews, even though she is not in close proximity to where protests or the National Guard deployments took place.
Her staff continue to come to work, but the uncertainty around both immigration and trade policy, as she relies on imported wines and sake, weigh on her. Data from OpenTable show a drop in dining reservations for all of Los Angeles were down from June 7th through the 21st by 3% year on year.
""The biggest challenge for us, aside from the lost revenue and the decrease in business, has been the uncertainty of every day. It's been so unpredictable. It's been chaotic,"" Kaplan told CNBC in July.
""We're still in the very early days of these changes to immigration policy, so it's hard to even predict what's coming. It just is a cause of concern that perhaps that down the line, the situation for us will change with our team members' comfort levels.""
Worker shortages
Sectors like construction and farming are staring down worker shortages that predate any change to immigration policy. In California, more than sixty percent of construction workers are immigrants and a quarter of them are undocumented, the Bay Area Council report found.
""There are profound skill shortages in these production industries, construction, manufacturing, because culturally, we have not created enough of these workers,"" said Anirban Basu, chief economist at Associated Builders and Contractors, a trade group.
""The way we've dealt with this over time has been immigration. Other cultures, cultures associated with other countries have different characteristics. Many more people there have been willing and wanting to be in the skilled trades, and we import that talent to improve our built environment.""
Contractors largely fall into two camps, he told CNBC. Some of them express confidence and support for Trump, believing the president's strategy will spur domestic manufacturing, investment and hiring. Others are pessimistic, as costs and uncertainty have risen.
Regardless of contractors' outlooks, said Basu, the nature of California's economy and its longstanding housing shortage mean that the state is constantly in need of construction workers.
""Even during tough economic times, it's in the midst of transformation,"" he said.",530c102dd0b0c46cca54205d9e5aedcb,trafilatura

Buying home, advocates say, allows you to lock in a rate and build equity in a property that will theoretically appreciate. By comparison, forking over what could be a mortgage payment in the form of rent each month is akin to throwing money away.
It's a line that Bernadette Joy, author of ""Crush Your Money Goals,"" has heard before. The self-made millionaire and financial coach gets pushback whenever she cautions against homeownership for homeownership's sake.
""My favorite thing is to challenge people and say, 'Show me your amortization table,'"" she says. ""Show me how much equity you've really built.""
Over the first several years of your mortgage, Joy points out, much of your payment goes toward interest rather than the principal. If you're in a 30-year mortgage, she says, you may find yourself a half a decade in with little equity to show for it, which is why she typically recommends an alternative for clients.
""If you're going to buy a home, buy it on a 15-year mortgage, because at least you'll build equity much faster that way,"" she says. ""If you can't afford a 15-year mortgage, you can't really afford the home.""
Buying a house you can afford
If you're currently renting and playing around with mortgage calculators, you may think you could own a home for roughly what you're paying in rent — even if you're factoring in some of the prominent costs of homeownership, such as property taxes and home insurance.
But homeownership comes with other hidden costs, Joy says. And going in unprepared could leave you in a precarious financial situation.
Help us help you: Take our survey on work, money and life goals
""I have very rarely come across a coaching client that said, 'You know what, let me actually do the proper math of what I can truly afford on a mortgage,'"" she says. ""And so what I'm finding with that, is that most people are buying more house than they can actually, practically afford.""
Here are a few things to consider in your calculations.
A pricier mortgage
Joy prefers a 15-year mortgage because you can build equity faster, with more flexibility. Though you'll eventually start paying down the principal on a 30-year mortgage, it's a long time to wait, she says.
""How likely is it that you'll see the [30-year] mortgage through to the bitter end, without selling or refinancing (and starting the clock all over again)?"" she wrote in a recent article for Bankrate.
Of course, a shorter mortgage comes at a steeper price. Buy a $435,300 home — the median price according to the National Association of Realtors — with a 20% down payment, and you're looking at a monthly payment of about $2,500 on a 30-year mortgage, according to Bankrate's calculator. Bump the loan down to 15 years, and your bill rises to nearly $3,400 a month.
The cost of sizing up
No matter which kind of mortgage you choose, a new home is likely going to be a step up in space over what you were renting, says Joy — and that comes with an increase in costs. For one, you'll have more rooms to furnish. And since you own the place, you're probably not going to want to go cheap.
""When I sit down with clients, I say, let's look at the cost of outfitting this home the way you want it to look,"" she says. ""People don't want to furnish their new home with IKEA. They're going to West Elm.""
Expect to pay more in utilities too, she says, since you have more space to heat and cool. And if you left your city apartment for the house out in the burbs, Joy recommends factoring a longer commute into your budget as well.
Maintenance and other headaches
""You have to budget a certain amount every year for repairs, because that's just going to be the case,"" Joy says.
Homeowners pay an average of $8,808 in annual maintenance costs, according to a recent Bankrate survey. If you don't have the cash to pay for a fallen tree or a new washing machine or one of the million other things that could come up, you may find yourself making some tough decisions.
""What I see happen to a lot of my clients is, they buy the home and things are good until something breaks,"" she says. ""Then they get into credit card debt, or they are having to significantly sacrifice other places in their lifestyle in order to accommodate those things.""
Know your numbers
Overall, Joy recommends a 50-25-25 approach to budgeting, with 50% of your income going toward living expenses, 25% going toward growing your wealth and the remainder on things you enjoy.
If, after accounting for all the costs, buying a home would put your living expenses over that 50% threshold ""the math isn't mathing,"" Joy says.
And even if it is within your budget, make sure that you have enough for an emergency fund, too.
""If you've been someone who has not been able to maintain a level of three months' worth of expenses sitting inside a high yield savings account,"" Joy says, ""then you're not ready to buy a home.""

Citi and American Airlines Partnership
In December 2024, Citi and American deepened their partnership and announced that Citi would become the sole issuer of American Airlines credit cards. American was one of the only major U.S. airlines without a credit card transfer partner, which was clearly a pain point they wanted to address.
Initially, only three cards allowed Citi ThankYou® Points transfers to American Airlines. However, Citi has expanded its American Airlines partnership to include point transfers for many credit cards with no annual fee.
Which Citi cards can transfer to American Airlines?
While there's a handful of Citi credit cards that can now transfer points to American, they don't all transfer at the same ratio.
Citi cards with 1:1 American Airlines transfers
To access the best transfer ratio to American Airlines, you'll need a Citi travel credit card that has an annual fee, such as:
- Citi Strata Elite
- Citi Strata Premier℠

The Citi Strata Premier® Card has competitive rewards rates and unlocks access to all of the Citi ThankYou® transfer partners, which boosts the value of your points.

Citi cards with a reduced transfer ratio
American Airlines transfers are also available for select no-annual-fee cards, but at a lower rate. You can transfer ThankYou® Points to American Airlines with the following cards at a 1:0.7 ratio (1,000 Citi points = 700 American AAdvantage miles):
- Citi Strata℠ Card (see rates and fees)
- Citi Double Cash® Card

- Citi ThankYou® Preferred (no longer open to new applicants)
The Citi Double Cash® Card is one of the best no-annual-fee cash-back cards thanks to its straightforward rewards structure.
- Long intro-APR for balance transfers

- If you transfer a balance, interest will be charged on your purchases unless you pay your entire balance (including balance transfers) by the due date each month.

If Citi cards seem to fit your lifestyle, you can pair a more premium card with one of the $0-annual-fee cards to maximize your rewards.
Additional American perks

Time to close up shop and return in three months when it reports again because nothing else matters, right? Not quite. Grabbing the spotlight from Nvidia in the week ahead is the U.S. jobs market — plus, there are a few noteworthy earnings reports within the broader artificial intelligence complex, including rival AI chipmaker and fellow Club holding Broadcom . We'd be remiss not to mention that Friday's appeals court ruling striking down most of President Donald Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs also figures to be a big topic of conversation this week, even though the duties are staying in effect until mid-October to give the administration time to appeal. In the holiday-shortened week of trading, here's a closer look at what we're watching for in the jobs data and on the earnings front. 1. Jobs, jobs, jobs: When Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently signaled the central bank could be ready to cut rates at its September policy meeting, he pointed to labor market conditions as justification. ""Overall, while the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers. This unusual situation suggests that downside risks to employment are rising,"" he said. And given the jobs market has cooled off, Powell said he sees a low likelihood of a so-called wage-price spiral of inflation, where workers successfully demand raises to offset any tariff-related price hikes. Against this backdrop, the question for investors is whether any of the four labor market reports due out this week do anything to cut against Powell's assessment, or perhaps show additional softening that would further solidify expectations for a September cut and additional reductions into year-end. Indeed, Fed Governor Christopher Waller, a candidate to replace Powell next year as chair, suggested last week that an especially weak August jobs report could warrant a half-percentage point cut in September instead of the Fed's traditional approach of moving in quarter-point increments. That August nonfarm payroll report is due out Friday morning, and it is the biggest of the week's releases. After what we saw with the July jobs report, revisions to prior months are particularly important to watch alongside the August hiring total and unemployment rate. As of Friday, economists polled by Dow Jones expect the U.S. economy added 75,000 jobs last month, while unemployment rate is projected to creep up to 4.3% from 4.2% in July. Ahead of that, we'll see the JOLTS report — officially called the Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey — on Wednesday morning. It measures tightness in the labor market, carrying implications for the aforementioned wage-price spiral, because when there are a lot more job openings than available workers, the upper hand in salary negotiations tilts toward the employees. Payroll processor ADP will release its monthly private employment report on Thursday, instead of its usual Wednesday. Expectations are for 75,000 job added in the ADP report, according to Dow Jones. That would be a deceleration from 104,000 in July. Also on Thursday, we'll also get the latest look at weekly initial jobless claims, which have recently retreated from higher levels seen in June. The Dow Jones consensus, as of Friday, is for 231,000 first-time filings for unemployment insurance. 2. Earnings: A pair of Club stocks report in the coming days, led off by Salesforce on Wednesday night followed by Broadcom on Thursday evening. All estimates are from LSEG, unless otherwise noted. Don't look now: Shares of beaten-up Salesforce have found a little momentum. The stock has advanced more than 10% since its lowest close of the year on Aug. 12, sharply outperforming a basket of software stocks that's down almost 1% in that stretch. The dark cloud of ""AI eating software"" is still hanging over Salesforce and its enterprise software brethren, and the stock remains down more than 20% year to date even after its rebound. But longtime investors like us will take what we can get — signs of life are, well, signs of life. News that activist firm Starboard Value boosted its stake in the company during the second quarter seems to have sparked the resuscitation. That disclosure came in a securities filing the night of Aug. 14, and the next day shares added nearly 4%, in what became the first of four straight winning seasons. It's had some down days mixed in, but the uptrend is intact. Now comes the test of earnings. The market will be keyed into the performance of Salesforce's two AI-related products: Data Cloud and the newer Agentforce, which is the early innings of monetization as many customers run pilots before large-scale deployments. The hope is that these two products, especially Agentforce, can help Salesforce's topline return to double-digits growth rates. The timing is the question. Current remaining performance obligation, or cRPO, is a key metric to gauge that future growth. Wall Street expects Salesforce's cRPO to end the July quarter at $29.15 billion, implying 10% year over year growth. In a recent note to clients, analysts at Oppenheimer argued that Salesforce's earnings report is unlikely to change anyone's mind on the stock, as ""AI messaging and estimates are unlikely to materially change post results and there remains execution risk"" in the second half of its fiscal year. Still, they haven't given up hope and neither have we, particularly ahead of its influential Dreamforce conference in October. ""Agentforce and Data Cloud are investable themes, margin growth continues, and multiples are already discounting many risks,"" Oppenheimer wrote. The consensus is for Salesforce to deliver quarterly revenue of $10.14 billion and $2.78 in adjusted earnings per share. Broadcom keeps the spotlight on the AI chip boom after Thursday's close. It's difficult to imagine that CEO Hock Tan will be any less upbeat on the long-term opportunity than Jensen Huang was on Nvidia's conference call. Broadcom's AI business falls in two camps: the custom chip design services and its networking products, which are used to stitch together large amounts of chips inside data centers so they communicate and transfer data smoothly. Google, Club name Meta and TikTok parent ByteDance are widely understood to be its three current customers, with Tan previously saying there are four more prospects in the pipeline. Any updates on those potential customers, along with general commentary on the market opportunity for custom chips, will be particularly noteworthy. Shares of Broadcom got hit Friday in sympathy with a disappointing quarter from custom-chip peer Marvell Technology , but it's difficult to know whether those challenges extended to to Broadcom because in-house silicon projects are very customer-specific. Meanwhile, Broadcom's broader chip portfolio servicing industries such as telecommunications and automotive has been a drag on growth for a while now. Citigroup expects that Broadcom will report above-consensus results ""driven by continued AI strength."" However, the analysts continued, ""With its non-AI semi business ... down roughly 40% from the peak, we believe that business should recover and offset some gross margin dilution from the AI business."" Investors also want to see additional traction in Broadcom's software business, led by virtualization software provider VMWare. Acquired by Broadcom in a blockbuster deal in late 2023, VMWare has benefited from transitioning customers from a traditional software license model to a subscription-based one and upselling them on an enhanced version of the product. JPMorgan told clients last week that it's continuing to observe ""strong momentum"" in VMWare, with analysts also reiterating Broadcom as their top semiconductor pick. Wall Street expects Broadcom to report revenue of $15.83 billion and earnings per share of $1.65.

Freixe is replaced by Nespresso chief Philipp Navratil, a rising star at the world's biggest packaged food company, which has seen slowing sales in its main businesses since the pandemic.
Shares in the maker of Nescafe coffee and KitKat chocolate bars were down 1% following Freixe's sudden dismissal, which comes a year after the predecessor Mark Schneider was axed for underperformance.
The dismissal of Freixe follows an investigation into an undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate, which breached Nestle's code of business conduct, Nestle said late on Monday.
The company said concerns about a possible relationship were raised by staff via internal company hotline, although an initial investigation was unsubstantiated. Freixe had initially denied the relationship to the board, a company spokesperson said.
When staff concerns persisted, Nestle said it ordered an investigation overseen by Chairman Paul Bulcke and Lead Independent Director Pablo Isla, with the support of independent outside counsel. Swiss media reported that Swiss lawyers Baer & Karrer helped with the inquiry.
Freixe, who spent 39 years with Nestle, will receive no exit package following his departure, the company told Reuters.
""The loss of two CEOs and a chairman in a year is of historic proportions for Nestle,"" said Ingo Speich, Head of Corporate Governance and Sustainability at Deka, a top-30 Nestle investor.
""The new CEO needs to fix the business model and bring volumes back. He needs to do better M&A and focus more on emerging markets.""
The Nestle veteran's abrupt removal comes a year after Schneider's ouster and 2-1/2 months after longstanding chair Paul Bulcke announced he would step down in 2026 in one of the most turbulent periods in the company's 159-year history.
In a short statement, Bulcke thanked Freixe for his years of service at Nestle, but said the dismissal was a ""necessary decision"".
Freixe was not immediately available to comment when contacted via email.
Stability sought
Nestle's shares, a bedrock of the Swiss stock exchange, have lost almost a third of their value over the past five years, underperforming European peers.
Freixe's appointment failed to halt the slide, with the company's shares shedding 17% during his leadership, disappointing investors.
In July, Nestle launched a review of its underperforming vitamins business that could lead to the divestment of some brands after first-half sales volumes missed expectations.
""The market did not particularly like Freixe, and the restructuring goals were also put on the back burner,"" said Maurizio Porfiri, chief investment officer at trading firm Maverix.
""Another fresh start is needed, and it is time for more stability to return to the management at this global corporation,"" he told Reuters.
Freixe's dismissal was featured on the front page of Swiss newspapers, with Neue Zuercher Zeitung noting that Nestle had lost its ""legendary stability"" where CEOs stayed for years before eventually becoming chairmen.
The latest change is likely to leave questions unanswered about Nestle's mid-term direction and ""keep a lid on the equity story until we hear more about Mr. Navratil's plan,"" JPMorgan analysts said in a research note.
Analysts said the news of Freixe's ouster was unlikely to reassure investors because it was the second time in a year that the company had appointed a new boss without carrying out a thorough search for a replacement.
The note also expressed concern that incoming CEO Navratil looked as though he would be ""boxed in"" by Freixe's turnaround strategy for now at a time when the market remained unconvinced.
Patrik Schwendimann, an analyst at Zuercher Kantonalbank, said the CEO could lead to ""paralysing uncertainty,"" at Nestle, although the switch could also accelerate the company's recovery.
""At first glance, the Swiss Philipp Navratil is a good Swiss compromise between the two predecessors Mark Schneider and Laurent Freixe,"" Schwendimann said.",d5f329653f3cf824a33264ebc49db297,trafilatura

Hayes is best known for inventing the perpetual swap at BitMEX, the derivatives contract that changed crypto trading. At Maelstrom, he invests in early-stage infrastructure projects. In his latest blog post, Hayes argued Hyperliquid’s token could rise 126 times, a claim backed by a valuation model produced by Maelstrom.
Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange built on its own blockchain. Unlike Coinbase or Binance, which are companies running private servers, Hyperliquid lives fully on-chain. Traders use it mainly for perpetual futures — contracts that let them bet on crypto prices without an expiry date.
Its native token, HYPE, acts as both a governance tool and an economic stake. Holders can vote on upgrades, stake tokens for rewards and benefit from the way trading fees link to the token’s value. In short, Hyperliquid is the venue and HYPE is how users share in its growth.
'Decentralized Binance'
Hayes begins his case with the big picture.
He says when governments print too much money, currencies lose value and ordinary savers are forced to speculate just to maintain their standard of living. Those who don’t already own houses or stocks see their savings eroded.
For many, especially in emerging markets, the easiest way to save today is with stablecoins such as USDT and USDC — digital dollars that sit natively on blockchains. Once you’re holding stablecoins, Hayes argues, the most obvious place to put them to work is crypto itself, since that’s the system where those tokens function most easily.
That funnel, according to the Maelstrom CIO, leads straight to Hyperliquid. Hayes says it already dominates decentralized perpetual futures trading, controlling around two-thirds of the market and is starting to grow against centralized giants like Binance.
He points to execution as the difference. He believes that Hyperliquid’s small team, led by founder Jeff Yan, ships features faster than rivals with hundreds of employees. The platform feels as fast as Binance, Hayes says, but every step — trading, settlement, collateral management — happens transparently on-chain.
He calls Hyperliquid a “decentralized Binance.” Like Binance, it relies on stablecoins instead of banks for deposits. Unlike Binance, everything is recorded on its blockchain. Hyperliquid’s HIP-3 upgrade also lets outside developers create entirely new markets that plug directly into its order book, turning it into a permissionless trading hub.",6403cb6c802beed635870b09ef90056f,trafilatura

(Reuters) -The dollar hit a five-week low on Monday as investors looked ahead to a raft of U.S. labour market data this week that could affect expectations for the Federal Reserve's easing path.
Traders were also assessing Friday's U.S. inflation figures and a court ruling that most of Donald Trump's tariffs are illegal, as well as the U.S. president's continuing tussle with the Fed over his attempt to fire Governor Lisa Cook.
Money markets have recently priced an around 90% chance of a 25 basis-point Fed rate cut in September and around 100 bps of easing by autumn 2026, according to the CME FedWatch tool.
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar eased 0.15% to 97.71, after hitting 97.534, its lowest level since July 28. It clocked a monthly decline of 2.2% on Friday.
Investors will be focussed on Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, which will be preceded by data on job openings and private payrolls.
Analysts said the U.S. economy is no longer outperforming as it did for much of the past decade, justifying a weaker dollar, and further signs of a softening labour market are expected to bolster that narrative.
""Severe weakness (in economic data) would point to an even more forceful Fed response than market pricing predicts,"" Societe Generale economist Klaus Baader said.
""But if May/June weakness is revealed as a statistical mirage, rate cuts would seem unwarranted given the almost certain prospect of rising inflation over the next year or so.""
Some analysts still see the chance of a 50 basis-point move by the Fed later this month.
The euro was up 0.22% at $1.1707, while sterling rose 0.25% to $1.3537. U.S. markets were closed for the Labor Day holiday on Monday.
Political risks are in focus as the French government faces likely defeat in a confidence vote next week over its plans for sweeping budget cuts.
Analysts noted that such risks tend to weigh on the currency only when there are clear signs of contagion within the euro area, something that is not evident at the moment.
U.S. TRADE POLICY
Investors are keeping a close eye on trade policy while the U.S. continues negotiations with key trading partners.
""We do not see much market impact from the court ruling,"" Jefferies economist Mohit Kumar said.
""The matter would pass on to the Supreme Court, which is likely to rule in favour of Trump.""
The greenback has also been weighed down by worries over Fed independence, as Trump seeks more influence over monetary policy.
""Fiscal dominance risks should be more clearly apparent in both higher long-end U.S. inflation break-evens and a higher risk discount on the dollar, none of which is materializing yet,"" George Saravelos, global head of forex research at Deutsche Bank, said.",5560eda7ae2802b62c6d8397916b7485,trafilatura

Overseas shipments gained 1.3% in August from a year earlier, customs data showed Monday, following a 5.8% increase in July. On a working-day adjusted basis, exports gained 5.8%, after rising at the same pace in July. Imports declined by 4%, bringing the trade balance to a surplus of $6.5 billion.

Semiconductor exports jumped 27%, driven by demand for high-performance chips used in artificial intelligence, while vehicle shipments gained 9%. Exports to Southeast Asian nations rose almost 12% in August, a third consecutive advance, driven by strong shipments of semiconductors and vessels, according to a statement from the trade ministry.
The Trump administration said Friday it’ll revoke waivers for Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. to use US technologies in their Chinese operations, posing risks to South Korea’s exports.
“In the short term, a direct impact on Korea’s semiconductor exports is unlikely, but if maintenance equipment requires case-by-case US approval, that could affect Samsung and SK Hynix’s production in China,” said Hyosung Kwon, a Bloomberg economist. “Over the longer run, restrictions may make it harder to upgrade to advanced processes at Chinese plants. That could reduce output in China — and boost Korean chip exports to the country.”
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“We expect shipments to continue to hold up in September as firms rush to get goods out the door ahead holidays in early October. Still, the bigger picture is less benign — pressure from US tariffs will probably start to register more clearly in the fourth quarter.”
— Hyosung Kwon, economist

The two firms run major chip plants in China that rely on American equipment and software, meaning the change could hamper production, limit supply to Chinese customers and add uncertainty to global technology supply chains. Samsung and SK have 120 days until the waiver expires, and can seek licenses to continue operations, according to an announcement in the US Federal Register.
Meanwhile, overall shipments to the US plunged 12% in August from a year earlier, and exports to China slipped 2.9%, the trade ministry said.",019b294c44b708dd6c0b14adc69ce43d,trafilatura

But its board faces daunting challenges on the path ahead, including how to downsize its fleet of leased aircraft while managing the roller coaster market conditions for US air travel that complicate the prospects for a long-term recovery.
“The general criticism of the first bankruptcy is that Spirit wasn’t aggressive enough in cost cutting and only using the filing to address debt to some extent (perhaps not enough even then),” Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth wrote in an email. “Spirit has been making many adjustments already since last fall. However, further cuts appear likely.”
The bankruptcy, filed late on Friday in New York, lists assets and liabilities of between $1 billion and $10 billion. The petition comes amid active negotiations with some of its largest lessors, secured noteholders and key stakeholders, the carrier said in a statement.
Spirit’s petition underscores the difficulty facing discount airlines in the US, from high labor costs to the ever-present struggle to grow enough to protect margins.
Much larger and more diversified carriers like United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc. are adding to the pressure, selling “basic economy” fares to lure cost-sensitive passengers away from cheaper options at Spirit and rivals like Allegiant Travel Co., Frontier Group Holdings Inc. and even Southwest Airlines Co.
Southwest is fighting back with an extensive makeover plan, offering premium fares with more legroom and assigned seats — breaking away from the one-size-fits-all business model it championed for five decades. Spirit and Frontier also have adjusted their business models to include upscale options.
Market Turbulence
It’s unclear how dramatic an overhaul Spirit could pursue.
Ultra-low-cost carriers are hit harder when there’s too much capacity on routes, forcing them to cut fares at the expense of profits. Unlike the industry’s leaders, Spirit lacks long-haul international routes that can make up for weakened demand in the domestic market.
Spirit emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, while the US airline industry was in the midst of a sharp decline in flying by consumers concerned with President Donald Trump’s trade war and rising inflation.
Flying has bounced back, but the whipsaw market conditions — including a new trend of late bookings — has undermined carriers’ ability to forecast demand.
There’s still a lot of uncertainty about what carriers will be able to charge for tickets given airline capacity plans are still being adjusted for the crucial holiday travel period, analysts say. An oversupply could gut fares — heaping extra pressure on lower cost carriers more so than larger operators.
Aircraft Glut
If history is any guide, Spirit’s board will have more than market forces to worry about.
Part of Spirit’s challenge will be how to downsize its fleet as it works to cut costs. It’s expected to encounter tough negotiations with lessors, which supply the bulk of Spirit’s fleet. In bankruptcy, some airlines have been allowed to return planes on lease, though it’s unclear whether Spirit will be able to win approval to pursue that path.
“With the current board and management, we expect a more aggressive review of costs and negotiation with partners, most notably lessors,” Syth said.
In a filing, Spirit said it received a written notice of default Aug. 25 from aircraft lessor AerCap Holdings, which said it was terminating dozens of leases on aircraft that were scheduled for delivery to Spirit in coming years.
Termination would cost Spirit more than $2 million per lease and apply to dozens of aircraft, the filing said. Spirit disputed the notion of a default, and said the termination of leases was invalid.
As of June 30, Spirit had 215 Airbus SE A320-family aircraft, including 148 financed under operating leases with terms expiring between 2026 and 2043. It owns 49 planes and has 18 under finance leases.
Spirit may try to return as many as 150 leased planes, Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu said. Less than 50% are likely to return to the domestic market, she said, because most carriers already have sufficient capacity to meet demand.
“This bankruptcy will be harder and look different than last year,” leaders of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA at Spirit told members on Friday. The airline will likely offer more extended voluntary leaves to employees, the union said. Previously announced pilot furloughs and downgrades will take effect in October and November.
Takeover Target
Airlines operating in Chapter 11 can be particularly vulnerable as takeover targets and the proceedings could make Spirit more susceptible to a suitor.
The carrier’s filing comes a day after Bloomberg reported that Spirit engaged rival Frontier Group Holdings Inc. in high-level talks about the carrier’s ongoing efforts to chart a path forward. Frontier and Bill Franke, the Frontier chairman, have pushed for years for a combination of the two lower-cost carriers.
America West Airlines merged with bankrupt US Airways Group in 2005. The combined company, operating under the US Airways name, acquired American Airlines parent AMR Corp. in 2013 to bring that carrier out of bankruptcy.
Spirit was bruised by a 2022 takeover battle between JetBlue Airways Corp. and Frontier. Spirit eventually agreed to be acquired by JetBlue in a $3.8 billion deal, but the combination was blocked in January 2024 by a federal judge on antitrust grounds.",0d8775899d54465d54b32765a39bf7db,trafilatura

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global benchmark Brent crude oil settled 1% higher on Monday, as concerns mounted that intensifying airstrikes in Russia and Ukraine could lead to supply disruptions, and as a weaker dollar lent additional support.
Brent crude futures settled up 67 cents, or 1%, at $68.15 a barrel. The U.S. benchmark, the West Texas Intermediate futures contract, was up 67 cents, or 1.1% at $64.68 by 2:15 p.m. ET.
There will be no settlement for WTI futures on Monday due to Labor Day holiday in the U.S. Trading volume for both Brent and WTI was also muted due to that reason.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday vowed to retaliate against Russian drone strikes on power facilities in his country's north and south, and ordered more strikes deep inside Russia.
Three and a half years into the war, both Russia and Ukraine have intensified airstrikes in recent weeks, even as efforts are underway to resolve the crisis.
Markets remain concerned about Russian oil flows, with weekly shipments from its ports dropping to a four-week low of 2.72 million barrels per day (bpd), according to tanker tracker data cited by ANZ analysts.
Elsewhere, the U.S. labour market report this week will give a read on the economy's health and test investor confidence that interest rate cuts are coming soon, a view that has strengthened appetite for riskier assets such as commodities.
Ahead of the data, the dollar was close to a five-week low on Monday, making oil less expensive for buyers using other currencies. [USD/]
Investors were also focused on Beijing, where Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are attending a regional summit.
China's manufacturing activity expanded at the quickest pace in August in five months, a private-sector survey showed on Monday. That helped lend support to oil and copper prices, SEB commodities analyst Bjarne Schieldrop said in a note to clients on Monday.
Also on the radar was an OPEC+ meeting on September 7.
""The next key fundamental question is whether OPEC+ oil producers will continue to raise the group's output targets beyond September, with a decision due within days,"" analyst Tim Evans said in the newsletter Evans on Energy.
Coming out of the summer season, oil inventories should rise in the last quarter of 2025 and the first quarter of 2026, HSBC analysts said in a note, with a surplus of 1.6 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter.

Dogen suggests working longer during bull markets could have increased financial security.
He advises testing living on a reduced income before retiring to plan for a smooth transition.
This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sam Dogen, a 48-year-old early retiree, author, and stay-at-home dad based in San Francisco. It's been edited for length and clarity.
I retired at 34 in 2012, and my wife retired a few years later at 35 in 2015. We've been mainly living off our passive income and investments since.
In 2023, I bought an expensive home I didn't need, becoming house-rich and cash-poor. Buying this house affected our desired lifestyle in San Francisco. As a family of four with two children, we had less liquid or passive income, which made me feel quite uneasy.
In retrospect, retiring early was not the optimal career path. I'm 48 now, and if I were to talk to my 34-year-old self, I'd say stick it out for another five years and try to find a different work environment. Before anyone considers retiring early, I would suggest they speak to someone who has already done it and ask them what they would've done differently.
Working for 3 to 5 more years would have made more financial sense for me
Real estate and stocks were in a total bull market from 2012 to 2017. If I had worked longer, I probably would've been able to save and invest an extra $1 million. That decision could've generated $40,000 more in passive income at a 4% return rate, and I would maybe be more financially secure now.
Instead of retiring early, maybe I could've gone to a different office within the firm, like London or Hong Kong. Changing offices could've reset my experience, colleagues, restaurants, clients, and travel.
That would've probably enabled me to enjoy work more, and I would never have to wonder what it would've been like to work in Asia or Europe during my finance career.
The fear of not being able to properly care for my family in early retirement was pretty intense
I sold stock and treasury bonds to buy my new house. My passive income went from about $380,000 to $230,000, and I kept thinking about how I could regain that liquidity and passive income to feel more secure.
The fear was intense. It's psychological, like a loss of identity or purpose. One of the biggest risks as an early retiree is that you can never get a job again. I kept that fear in check when I found a FinTech startup to join part-time at the end of 2023.
It felt great that after almost 12 years out of the workforce, I was able to jump back in, make money, and experience being in a community again. But after four months, I decided to quit and not look for another job.
I didn't miss the unnecessary meetings, micromanagement, and office politics, and I was able to save around $10,000 a month from that to help replenish my lost income.
Having kids later in life, after retiring early, changed things
Maybe I'm technically poorer than before because I retired early, but soul-wise, I'm richer. The biggest benefit was being able to have children, because when I worked 60 hours a week and was so stressed, it was hard to even think about being able to afford or have children.
I really wanted to dedicate myself to being a full-time father for both my children during the first five years of their lives, and I was able to, but I realized that since I decided to have children afterward, the desire for money, status, and power for my children became huge.
People should be very calculated and aware if they decide to have children, and if they want to achieve Financial Independence Retire Early, also known as FIRE. It's a really tough combination.
If you can't live off of 50% of your paycheck for a year, you should keep working and saving
When I retired early, I tried to rely on investments and passive income to sustain my lifestyle. I always tell people who are considering early retirement to see how they could live on 50% or even 80% less of their income for six months to a year.
The security of active income, retirement benefits, and health benefits will still remain, but this will show whether retirement is possible. If the desired lifestyle can't be sustained, it's probably necessary to save, invest, and work more.
There are so many resources, such as early retirement sites, podcasts, and books, that can help guide people who want to do this.
Set yourself up for success because it's going to feel like a big transition
Instead of just giving two weeks' notice and quitting, save right and get a good severance package. If you can do these two things, you will have a financial cushion to help you during your transition into early retirement, and you won't rush back into the job market.
I've talked to people who retired early, and then three months later, they panicked and got a new job. After early retirement, people can experience a transition where they're full of uncertainty and doubt about what they did. The life they knew for so long is no longer.
I tell my story on my blog, ""Financial Samurai,"" and in books I've written because it shows an example of taking that leap and things kind of working out.
Correction: September 2, 2025 —An earlier version of this story misstated the percentage of income people should attempt to live on before retiring early. It should be 50% to 80% less of their income, not 50% to 80% of their income.",5bcdd1853d27c4873b9b7c3a91dd7fa1,trafilatura

Their demand for options that become profitable if the yuan rises against the dollar has increased, according to traders who asked not to be identified. Investors are now targeting a yuan around 7 or stronger by year-end, SGX Derivatives Exchange data show, on rising confidence in China providing policy support, and shifting US interest-rate expectations.

“We have seen a pickup in demand for downside for dollar-offshore yuan, mainly from hedge fund clients,” said Saurabh Tandon, global head of foreign-exchange options at Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore. The pair’s implied volatility, especially in nearer-dated contracts, had declined due to low realized volatility over the last few months “and that’s making buying downside options an attractive trade.”
The increase in demand for bearish dollar-offshore yuan bets comes as The People’s Bank of China raised its daily reference rate for the yuan by the most in nearly a year last week. Meanwhile, the dollar is under pressure amid growing market expectations that the Federal Reserve will resume cutting rates next month after Chairman Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole speech.
What’s more, investor sentiment toward Chinese assets appears to be improving due to factors including supportive fiscal policy and “benign progress” in trade talks between the US and China, said Jingyang Chen, Asian FX Strategist at HSBC Global Investment Research, in a client note dated Friday.
On Aug. 28, the most heavily traded dollar-yuan option expiring in December was a put that had a strike of 6.94, according to options trades executed on the SGX Derivatives Exchange. That means the buyer of this option can sell the dollars for yuan at 6.94. The put option gains in value if the currency pair falls below this level. Dollar-offshore yuan was trading around 7.1274 as of 12:30 p.m. Hong Kong time on Monday.
“We have seen increased downside interest from clients on USD/CNH recently,” said Dhaval Shah, managing director of currencies and EM sales at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Singapore. “The expression has been a mix of cash and options.”",a8d9eee3aa0910e27a1c9efebc9a7440,trafilatura

On Saturday, Krüger wrote on X, that “most crypto charts now look so broken and bearish that it’s bullish.” He argued that when price action looks this bad, the panic has usually gone far enough that a reversal may not be far behind.
The bearish charts
Krüger attached a series of charts from Binance and derivatives dashboards.
They included bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) spot price charts, both of which had fallen below short-term upward trendlines, creating a technically bearish picture. He also posted a solana (SOL) chart that showed relative resilience compared with BTC and ETH.
Alongside those, he shared BTC-USDT and ETH-USDT derivatives charts, which combined futures indicators — such as funding rates and long liquidations — with options metrics like skew. Together, they showed traders had turned heavily defensive.
Liquidations and leverage reset
In his post, Krüger said long liquidations had been “significant,” especially in “the last two rounds after the close today.”
In futures markets, traders can borrow to take bullish bets. When prices fall, their collateral gets wiped out and exchanges automatically close positions. This kind of forced selling pushes prices down further in a cascade. Once it’s over, however, markets can stabilize because the excess leverage has already been flushed out.
Majors under pressure, alts steadier
The analyst also highlighted that bitcoin and ether absorbed most of the selling, while many altcoins had already stopped crashing earlier in the day. Normally, smaller tokens collapse after majors, not before them.
For Krüger, that divergence is “often a sign of upcoming strength,” suggesting panic selling may be winding down.
Krüger told followers to “check the skew,” noting that puts were much more expensive than calls. In options markets, that imbalance signals defensive positioning and heightened fear.
For contrarians like Krüger, one-sided fear often precedes a rebound, because if everyone is already hedging, there are fewer sellers left to push prices lower.
The FOMC catalyst
While he is “bullish into next week,” Krüger said he doesn’t expect strong trends to develop until after the Federal Reserve’s next policy meeting.
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets Sept. 16–17, with a rate decision and press conference at the conclusion on Sept. 17.
He expects the Fed to cut interest rates, which he argues is “not fully priced in.”
Lower rates reduce the cost of borrowing and often add liquidity, which can boost demand for risk assets like crypto.",26274cfab1466dee36db39ca6d569794,trafilatura

The proposed ADA ETF will trade on NYSE Arca under the ticker GADA, tracking CoinDesk’s Cardano Price Index (ADX).
Invest in Gold
Grayscale also submitted an S-1 for a Polkadot ETF, set to list on Nasdaq under ticker DOT, following the CoinDesk Polkadot CCIX Reference Rate. Both ETFs are designed as passive funds holding the underlying tokens in custody with Coinbase, without leverage or derivatives.
Despite the ETF headlines, ADA and DOT both saw muted price action as sentiment around top altcoins remained weak after Bitcoin fell to $107,000 on Friday, its lowest point since July 2.
Partly explaining the lack of a bullish market reaction to the news, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart emphasized that Grayscale’s latest filings are not fresh initiatives but continuations of earlier 19b-4 applications submitted in February 2025.
ADA Price Forecast: Can $0.82 Hold Before a Push Toward $0.90?
Technical indicators indicate that the Cardano price is holding support near $0.82 after a 10% loss, with Bollinger Bands narrowing around the current trading range. Such compression after major price declines often signals an incoming rebound phase.
The 20-day moving average is positioned near $0.87, aligning with the mid-Bollinger band and establishing the first resistance target. If bulls reclaim this level, ADA could climb toward $0.90 in the short term.
MACD indicators remain bearish, with the signal line at 0.0102 holding above the MACD line at 0.0130. However, fading bearish momentum suggests exhaustion may be setting in among sellers.
If Cardano slips below the $0.80 psychological mark, it risks testing the lower Bollinger band around $0.78, invalidating near-term ADA price rebound prospects. A sustained hold above $0.82 would confirm market stabilization and provide a base for recovery toward $0.90–$0.92.
Best Wallet Presale in Demand as Cardano ETF Momentum Builds
Grayscale’s ETF push emphasizes growing institutional interest in altcoins like Cardano. This rising adoption trend is driving demand for secure multi-chain storage solutions, such as Best Wallet (BEST).
The project has already raised over $15 million in its presale, attracting participants with low transaction fees, attractive staking yields, and early dApp access. Its built-in multi-chain compatibility makes it a preferred solution for investors navigating across Cardano and other blockchain ecosystems.",230f1ff52068dfa2f82bd46983854e00,trafilatura

“This is supported by our fieldwork over the past few months, which points to extensive activity around adopting and expanding Data Cloud footprints to power Agentforce, the majority of the latter remains in testing and pilot phases. That said, we have spoken with some partners more recently who are now seeing about 20% of Agentforce projects move forward into Phase II of projects (from 1-2 use-cases to 5-15 broader deployments), with expectations that nearly 40% of customers could be expanding scope over the next 12 months.”

Sustained profit-taking as the LTC price approached $120, and Bitcoin’s sharp retracement to 50-day lows of $107,000 on Friday, were two key catalysts that sparked bearish action this week.
However, market metrics over the past 24 hours signal a potential directional swing in Litecoin price momentum as bears take caution after failing to break the $110 psychological level.
CoinGlass’ derivatives data shows that LTC futures trading volumes declined 33.8% to $596 million, while open interest remained stable at $917 million. Flattening open interest reflects reluctance to enter new positions, a sentiment reinforced by the significant drop in daily trading volumes.
Liquidation data further emphasizes the cautious stance among short-traders. On a 24-hour basis, long liquidations totaled $496,380, versus $444,120 in shorts, indicating that buyers were still absorbing downside pressure. But momentum shifted in the last 12 hours, with short liquidations at $49,590 more than double long liquidations of $22,120.
This trend indicates bears are closing out positions at a faster rate, signaling a potential market bottoming phase.
If this dynamic persists through weekend trading, bulls could regain momentum and edge prices toward safer levels around $115, to avert the risk of a breakdown below $110.
Litecoin Price Forecast: Can Bulls Stage $115 Rebound as Golden Cross Anchors $109 Support?
Litecoin’s intraday resilience above $109 aligns with the golden cross pattern formed on August 4, where the 5-day moving average crossed above the 8-day and 13-day averages. Aside from signaling the outset of a bullish market cycle, golden crosses also provide anchoring support during short-term sell-offs.
The intraday bottom formation and short traders rapidly closing out short positions could spark an instant recovery toward $115 to $118 price range. However, a decisive breakdown below $109 would invalidate the golden cross signal, exposing Litecoin to a deeper retracement toward $100.
Momentum indicators remain neutral, with RSI hovering at 49, suggesting LTC is neither overbought nor oversold. Sustained buy-side activity around $110 could tilt momentum upward, but a lack of trading volume suggests sideways price action into September is a more likely scenario.

Sustained profit-taking as the LTC price approached $120, and Bitcoin’s sharp retracement to 50-day lows of $107,000 on Friday, were two key catalysts that sparked bearish action this week.
However, market metrics over the past 24 hours signal a potential directional swing in Litecoin price momentum as bears take caution after failing to break the $110 psychological level.
CoinGlass’ derivatives data shows that LTC futures trading volumes declined 33.8% to $596 million, while open interest remained stable at $917 million. Flattening open interest reflects reluctance to enter new positions, a sentiment reinforced by the significant drop in daily trading volumes.
Liquidation data further emphasizes the cautious stance among short-traders. On a 24-hour basis, long liquidations totaled $496,380, versus $444,120 in shorts, indicating that buyers were still absorbing downside pressure. But momentum shifted in the last 12 hours, with short liquidations at $49,590 more than double long liquidations of $22,120.
This trend indicates bears are closing out positions at a faster rate, signaling a potential market bottoming phase.
If this dynamic persists through weekend trading, bulls could regain momentum and edge prices toward safer levels around $115, to avert the risk of a breakdown below $110.
Litecoin Price Forecast: Can Bulls Stage $115 Rebound as Golden Cross Anchors $109 Support?
Litecoin’s intraday resilience above $109 aligns with the golden cross pattern formed on August 4, where the 5-day moving average crossed above the 8-day and 13-day averages. Aside from signaling the outset of a bullish market cycle, golden crosses also provide anchoring support during short-term sell-offs.
The intraday bottom formation and short traders rapidly closing out short positions could spark an instant recovery toward $115 to $118 price range. However, a decisive breakdown below $109 would invalidate the golden cross signal, exposing Litecoin to a deeper retracement toward $100.
Momentum indicators remain neutral, with RSI hovering at 49, suggesting LTC is neither overbought nor oversold. Sustained buy-side activity around $110 could tilt momentum upward, but a lack of trading volume suggests sideways price action into September is a more likely scenario.

Bitcoin (BTC) has breached key support levels in a sign of increasing bearish momentum that suggests a risk of a slide to $100,000.
The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell 6.5% in August, ending the four-month winning streak as the U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) bled $751 million, according to data source SoSoValue.
The recent price drop saw bitcoin break below several key support levels, including the Ichimoku cloud, and the 50-day and 100-day simple moving averages (SMAs). It also pierced crucial horizontal support zones formed by the May high of $111,965 and the December high of $109,364, according to the daily chart sourced from TradingView.
These breakdowns underscore growing market weakness, confirming a bearish shift in key momentum indicators such as the Guppy Multiple Moving Average (GMMA) and the MACD histogram.
The short-term exponential moving average (EMA) band of the GMMA (green) has crossed below the longer-term band (red), signaling a clear bearish momentum shift. Meanwhile, the weekly MACD histogram has dropped below zero, indicating a transition from a bullish to a bearish trend.
Together, these signals indicate a likelihood of a sustained sell-off, potentially driving the price down to the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $101,366, and possibly to the $100,000 mark.
Bearish seasonality
The negative technical outlook aligns with seasonal trends, which show September historically as a bearish month for bitcoin. Since 2013, BTC has delivered an average return of negative 3.49%, closing lower in eight of the past 12 September months, according to data from Coinglass.
As for bulls, overcoming the lower high of $113,510 set on Aug. 28 is crucial to negating the bearish outlook.

(Reuters) -A summer trading lull looks set to come to a halt with September risks stacking up hard and fast.
U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook and French political turmoil provide a glimpse of what's to come in a month that historically brings notable market swings as investors reassess portfolios.
""My big concern is that when liquidity comes back after the summer, we see some big market moves,"" said St. James's Place CIO Justin Onuekwusi.
1/ TROUBLE AT THE FED
U.S. jobs numbers have become contentious after July data prompted Trump to fire the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief.
So, August's reading, due on September 5, and the Fed's September 16–17 meeting come at a time when investors are already concerned about tension between Trump and the central bank.
Fed chief Jerome Powell, whom Trump has pressured to cut rates, signalled a September move in his Jackson Hole speech, but also warned about sticky inflation.
Markets price in a roughly 85% chance of a rate cut this month, but questions about the Fed's independence have heightened uncertainty over the rate outlook and its ability to control inflation.
""This latest political drama reignites concerns about the independence of the Fed, and by extension undermines confidence in the U.S. as the global benchmark for transparent and rules-based capital markets,"" said Swissquote Bank senior analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya.
2/ NO CONFIDENCE
French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou is expected to lose a September 8 confidence vote over government budget-cut plans, highlighting risks to European shares, French banks and long-term French bonds, yields of which are near their highest since 2011.
If the minority government falls, President Emmanuel Macron could install a new premier or dissolve parliament and hold new legislative elections, leaving budget issues unresolved for longer and raising French ratings downgrade risks.
Fitch Ratings updates its view on France on September 12, followed by DBRS on the 19th, and Scope on the 26th.
""If France fails, there will be a domino effect, and we will have to question the sustainability of the performance of European markets,"" said Stephane Ekolo, global equity strategist at broker Tradition.
3/ DON'T FORGET GEOPOLITICS

China’s e-commerce leader posted a triple-digit percentage gain in AI-related product revenue as well as a better-than-anticipated 26% jump in sales from the cloud division — the business most closely tied to the artificial intelligence boom.

That helped assuage investors nervous about the fallout from a worsening battle with Meituan (MPNGF, 3690.HK) and JD.com Inc. (JD, 9618.HK) in internet commerce. Alibaba’s shares gained their most intraday since November 2022 in Hong Kong, boosting the company’s market value by more than $50 billion. Turnover in the stock marked a record high as of early afternoon. The rally helped energize the broader AI sphere: Ernie-developer Baidu Inc. (BIDU, 9888.HK) gained as much as 5.8%, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. (0700.HK, TCEHY) also climbed.
“Alibaba’s earnings underscore a bifurcation within China tech: AI is delivering scalable growth, while traditional consumer-facing segments remain mired in destructive price competition,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets.
“The triple-digit surge in AI revenue and robust cloud sales show Alibaba is repositioning for longer-term relevance in the tech stack, not just retail dominance,” she added.
Alibaba’s progress in AI — where it is considered among the front-runners in Chinese artificial intelligence development — helped gloss over concerns about the three-way battle gripping online commerce.
That dealt more damage than anticipated to some of the country’s e-commerce leaders: JD’s profit halved in the quarter while Meituan warned of major losses, triggering a $27 billion selloff of the three companies’ shares last week.
The AI element helps explain why Alibaba’s stock has easily outpaced its more commerce-reliant rivals this year. Alibaba has also leveraged the growth of an international arm that encompasses some of the world’s most-recognized online shopping platforms from Lazada to AliExpress.
It has “China’s best AI enabler thesis,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Gary Yu wrote in a research note. That’s as losses from meal delivery and instant commerce peak this quarter, they said.",b68e14cc3e64d8ff8c0bff655e6f0d1e,trafilatura

Announced on Monday, Seker will work “to strengthen engagement with policymakers and regulators.” He would be responsible for driving the firm’s strategic initiatives across the region.
“As Binance continues to shape the future of crypto, Seker’s expertise will help Binance strengthen its partnerships, navigate the evolving regulatory landscape, and deliver sustainable growth that prioritizes transparency and user protection.”
Richard Teng, CEO of Binance, eyes the Asia Pacific as a “key region” for the company’s expansion, given the rapidly evolving pro-crypto initiatives to keep pace with the US.
“Seker’s deep-rooted experience across its diverse markets makes him uniquely positioned to lead the company’s next phase of regional growth and engagement,” Teng noted.
New Binance Asia Head Has 20 Years of Fintech Experience
Seker has more than 20 years of experience in the public sector, fintech, and blockchain industry. He spearheaded global product development, along with legal and regulatory matters for APAC at Crypto.com.
He was also a senior legal executive for Ant Group and Amicorp Group. Prior to exploring the blockchain space, Seker worked as a litigator in Australia and later served as a central banking lawyer at the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
In his new capacity, Seker is expected to focus on fostering sustainable, responsible growth, alongside upholding compliance with APAC regulators.
“By working closely with regulators, partners, and our broad community, I look forward to driving strategic initiatives and delivering robust operations throughout the region,” said Seker.
Binance is Upping its Regulatory Game in APAC
Binance faced several legal and financial hurdles in 2023, including settling allegations of regulatory violations with the SEC. As reported earlier, the world’s largest crypto exchange agreed to pay $4.3 billion in fines.
Besides, the firm’s founder, Changpeng Zhao, resigned as CEO and pleaded guilty to related charges. He served a four-month prison sentence in the US.
Further, Binance faces restrictions and bans in several countries over AML regulations. Recently, AUSTRAC identified “serious concerns” with Binance’s anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing controls. The regulator directed Binance Australia to appoint an external auditor.
Despite regulatory challenges, the firm has maintained its dominant status in the industry.
The exchange’s expansion into the APAC region comes at a time when Asia accounts for 60% of worldwide crypto users. The region contributes the largest share of global liquidity, per a study by Foresight Ventures and Primitive Ventures.",9b60211f1c88edb0a44ed6f0cccb8d41,trafilatura

(Reuters) -French carmaker Renault appointed former Mercedes-Benz vice president Katrin Adt as managing director of its low-cost Dacia brand, the company said on Monday, as it revamps its management team under new CEO Francois Provost.
Adt will succeed Denis Le Vot. Le Vot was among the frontrunners for the Renault chief executive job and will now leave the company, the group said.
It also appointed Fabrice Cambolive, currently head of the Renault brand, to the newly created role of chief growth officer for the group.
Renault named insider Provost as CEO in July, after the abrupt departure of former chief Luca De Meo.
Provost said the management changes would help the company move faster to adapt to current challenges. Renault is facing growing competition and weak demand that triggered a profit warning earlier this year.
""To meet all the challenges facing us, we need an organisation capable of making faster decisions, executing more efficiently, and being ever closer to its customers,"" he said.
Adt was previously CEO of the Smart brand, and then CEO of Mercedes-Benz Own Retail Europe before most recently becoming vice president of corporate audit.
Adt's focus on retail throughout her career will be important for Dacia, said Michael Foundoukidis, analyst at ODDO BHF.

The partnership involves a combined initial investment of approximately Rs8.55bn ($100m), with the Indian conglomerate holding a 70% stake and Meta 30%. Subject to receipt of regulatory approvals, this JV deal is anticipated to close in Q4 2025.
The JV will leverage Meta’s open-source Llama models to create enterprise AI platforms. These platforms will allow organisations to customise, deploy, and manage generative AI models tailored for various applications, including sales, marketing, IT development, customer service, and finance.
Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said: “We’re excited to deepen our partnership with Reliance to bring the power of open‑source AI to Indian developers and enterprises.
“Through this joint venture, we’re putting Meta’s Llama models into real-world use, and I’m looking forward to Meta expanding its footprint in the enterprise space as we unlock new possibilities together.”
With an aim to offer cost-effective AI solutions for Indian enterprises and small-to-medium businesses, the JV will combine Meta's technology with Reliance's vast market reach.
The joint venture plans to provide pre-configured AI solutions that cater to both cross-functional and industry-specific needs.
The Llama models are already tested in various production environments, ensuring they meet enterprise-grade standards.
According to Reliance, the collaboration promises significant flexibility in deploying these models across cloud and on-premise infrastructures, optimising infrastructure costs effectively.
Reliance chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani said: “Partnering with Meta brings our vision of providing AI to every Indian and enterprise to life - by combining Meta’s most widely adopted open‑source Llama models with our deep expertise across multiple industries.
“We will democratise enterprise‑grade AI for every Indian organisation - from ambitious SMBs to blue‑chip corporates, enabling them to innovate faster, operate more efficiently, and compete confidently on the global stage.
“RIL will also serve as a real‑world enterprise‑scale environment for deploying and refining the joint venture’s offerings - enabling rapid iteration and continuous improvement at scale.”
Additionally, Reliance has expanded its partnership with Google Cloud to advance AI infrastructure in India.

The rating update, issued ahead of the Q2 earnings print, comes with low expectations and multiples that signal multiple bad news. Oppenheimer’s research mosaic reflects softening business trends for the company and limited near-term catalysts.

AI messaging and estimates are unlikely to materially change post results and there remains execution risk in the 2H:FY26 from lingering macro- and AI-related uncertainty. Nevertheless, Agentforce and Data Cloud are investable themes, margin growth continues, and multiples are already discounting many risks. We lower our PT to $315 on group multiple compression.”

(RSG) is a leader in environmental services, steering waste management across the U.S. and Canada with a $73 billion market capitalization. Founded in 1996, it handles everything from waste collection and recycling to energy solutions, serving homes, businesses, and industries alike. With innovative landfill services, organics processing, and recycled material sales, Republic turns trash into opportunity, making sustainability not just a goal but a driving force behind its community impact.
“Large-cap stocks” are those companies valued at north of $10 billion, and Republic Services fits that mold with ease. It crossed that threshold by hauling in dominance across America’s waste business. As the nation’s second-largest trash titan, Republic Services built scale, locked in landfills, and rolled out AI-driven efficiency. That mix of muscle and smarts turned garbage into gold, pushing its market cap well past the line and cementing its heavyweight status.

Republic Services recently touched its 52-week high of $258.75 on June 3 and is currently trading 9.6% below that peak – signaling even giants stumble. RSG stock has dipped 8.1% over the past three months, lagging the Dow Jones Industrials Average's ($DOWI) 7.9% rise over the same time frame.
However, over the longer term, RSG’s performance looks much more attractive. The stock rose 12.8% over the past 52 weeks, outperforming DOWI’s 10.8% returns over the past year. In fact, RSG rose 16.3% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, surpassing the 7.1% gains of DOWI in 2025.
Republic Services is stuck in a tricky spot. Over the past year, it cruised above its 200-day moving average, flashing long-term strength. But since mid-June, the RSG has slipped under its 50-day line, hinting at short-term pressure. Now hovering just above the 200-day, RSG’s next move will matter – hold the green line and bulls regain control, crack below it and bears may finally tip the scales.
Republic Services has quietly turned trash into treasure. Over the past year, its stock has been grinding higher, riding a wave of growing demand for waste management as urbanization accelerates and sustainability rules tighten. Strategic bets on advanced recycling tech and renewable energy have boosted its growth runway, while a 20-year streak of dividend hikes and consistent earnings beats have cemented its reputation as a reliable wealth builder.",be318b607ca37fe25a127dbc2c279405,trafilatura

The rating affirmation comes amid observations made by the firm on Amazon’s automotive market place operations.
The firm elaborated that many dealers were unaware of Amazon’s partnership until the day of the launch. This led to an unpleasant experience for customers as the sales teams were unprepared to help them through the Amazon purchasing process.
Moreover, the dealers’ sales forces were unable to answer questions about Amazon transactions. This led to inquiries transitioning to Amazon’s support team, reflecting the disparity between dealer operations and the Amazon platform.
“Within our conversations, dealers’ sales forces were unable to answer questions about Amazon transactions, as questions regarding the process needed to be made to the Amazon support team, highlighting a clear separation between dealer operations and the Amazon platform as Amazon is not integrated into dealer workflows, while dealers are unaware of how the Amazon process actually works. Dealers are notified about a vehicle purchase once the transaction is complete, versus receiving notifications for new leads. To that end, we believe Amazon’s listings are sourced at the OEM level, which is creating separation between dealer operations and Amazon. This also highlights the deficiency of Amazon Autos acting as a marketing channel compared to other used vehicle marketplaces that are more directly built to hand off sales leads.”

The key reason? It may have to do with companies rapidly stockpiling the asset, according to JPMorgan strategists.
The largest cryptocurrency's three- and six-month rolling volatility, meaning the speed and extent of its price changes over those time periods, has fallen to a historically low level. This trend has continued even as bitcoin's price set new record highs in May, July, and August.
Bitcoin fell to $108,000 as of Friday afternoon, but rose over the weekend to top $110,000 on Tuesday. It's up over over 18% year to date.
""Corporate treasuries now hold over 6% of bitcoin's total supply and act as a form of private sector quantitative easing for crypto markets,"" JPMorgan global market strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a client note on Thursday.
""We believe a factor behind the collapse in bitcoin volatility has been the acceleration of bitcoin purchases by corporate treasuries,"" Panigirtzoglou added.
Over the roughly 16 years that bitcoin has been around, its market price has seen wild swings, often at magnitudes far greater than more widely held assets like bonds, gold, and many stocks and its still widely perceived as more volatile than those assets.
However, the range of its swings has been narrowing and a key factor has been the launch of new bitcoin-related financial products like futures contracts and exchange-traded funds that have brought in more investor groups.
This year, the biggest new wave has been public and private corporations seeking to put the crypto asset on their balance sheet in a play pioneered years ago by Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) (formerly MicroStrategy).
Since the Tysons Corner, Va.-based enterprise software company started purchasing the digital asset in 2020, it has become a bitcoin juggernaut. And founder Saylor has made a name for himself as the evangelist of bitcoin adoption for corporates.
For example, from the president's own namesake, Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), to video game retailer GameStop (GME), a Japanese hotel operator called Metaplanet (MTPLF), and others, these companies have picked up tens of billions of dollars' worth of bitcoin since the beginning of January, according to data aggregator Bitcoin Treasuries.
In July alone, public companies snapped up ""nearly two-thirds” of total bitcoin purchases among the biggest buyers: exchange-traded products, governments, and public and private companies, according to a recent Bitcoin Treasuries report.
Such a development may have wide implications for how much bitcoin other kinds of investors could own, according to JPMorgan's Panigirtzoglou.
By lowering bitcoin's volatility, these new buyers could make bitcoin ""more attractive from a valuation point of view,"" Panigirtzoglou said, adding that as its volatility drops, bitcoin could become a more competitive alternative to gold. While volatility doesn't equal outright investment risk, it represents a key component.
Between Washington, D.C., and Wall Street, the crypto world has already seen some major wins this year.
Earlier in August, crypto rallied after Trump signed an executive order that directs federal agencies to remove regulatory barriers blocking access to alternative assets and crypto from being offered in 401(K) other defined-contribution retirement plans.
Weeks before, Trump signed a bill that will allow US banks to issue their own dollar-pegged stablecoin. A week before big bank executives, including Citigroup's Jane Fraser and JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon, have said they are exploring that business.
And in late May, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director William Pulte ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to come up with a way for the government-sponsored mortgage companies to count crypto holdings as assets on mortgage applications.
While Michael Saylor's Strategy pioneered the gambit of rapidly acquiring crypto assets by issuing a mix of debt and equity years ago, more companies have joined the party this year.
That's due in part to a combination of less burdensome accounting rules and more favorable treatment of crypto by the Trump administration and the simple fact that Saylor's Strategy play has proven successful. Strategy's stock trades at a significant premium to the underlying bitcoin it holds.
Though the length of time that such a phenomenon can last remains a hotly debated topic, approximately 180 other companies have imitated the play.
Of that group, roughly a quarter had stocks trading below the value of the bitcoin they held as of August 22, according to Capriole Investments.
Corporate treasuries have been loading up on cryptocurrencies such as ether and others in addition to bitcoin. And for those smaller tokens, the reaction so far hasn't been boring.
Called Trump Media Group CRO Strategy, this company will hold Crypto.com's lesser-known trading platform and blockchain token Cronos (CRO-USD). The token's market capitalization has almost doubled to $9 billion since the Tuesday announcement.
Also known by critics as ""money printing,"" quantitative easing is a less conventional monetary policy tool that the US Federal Reserve used to support the economy during two of the country's most recent financial emergencies, the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2008 financial crisis.
The measure is known to have significant repercussions, such as fueling riskier behavior that can lead to asset bubbles and even future inflation.",97c343df151e5e6dd2ae5d74f92d3047,trafilatura

The report, named ""The Glass Chair,"" surveyed 1,146 finance leaders and professionals, revealing that companies with women in the CFO role tend to outpace industry benchmarks in shareholder returns.
The OneStream research found that firms with female CFOs have experienced an average annualised shareholder return of 4.5%, which is approximately 0.2% higher than the norm across Europe, the UK, and the US.
Despite these achievements, the path to the CFO seat is longer for women, who take an average of three additional years to secure the role when compared to their male counterparts.
The study also indicated that many women CFOs have reached their positions through unconventional career paths, with about 35% having diverse backgrounds that include operational or cross-functional roles outside of core finance.
The study noted that this experience equips women CFOs with a view of the enterprise, enhancing their operational insight and leadership capabilities.
These competencies are crucial for balancing financial strategy with broader business considerations such as people development, risk management, and inter-departmental collaboration.
The report goes on to describe the leadership styles that are prevalent among women CFOs, highlighting a focus on financial governance, strategic planning, and nurturing team growth.
These attributes are in line with the evolving requirements of the CFO role, which increasingly relies on technology like AI and automation to augment strategic decision-making.
The study also found that 75% of women finance leaders recognise automation and AI competencies as vital, yet only 24% rely on AI tools today.
An 83% of women CFOs acknowledged that automation is enabling a shift in the required skill set for the CFO position.
The study further identifies several obstacles that impede women's progression to the CFO role, including economic downturns, workplace politics, limited access to mentorship, and the challenge of balancing professional and personal responsibilities.
Addressing the barriers that hinder their progression could enable businesses to harness leadership that not only improves returns but also embodies the comprehensive expertise required for future financial management.
OneStream corporate controller senior vice president Pam McIntyre said: “The data is clear: advancing women into CFO roles isn’t just about equity – it’s about business performance. Women CFOs outperform industry benchmarks, especially when appointed to underperforming organisations, in part because they bring a broad range of operational experience and digital progress.",a8297bf6e81ada9733f5247c594122f5,trafilatura

The decrease has been attributed to a stronger rouble and weaker oil prices, according to a Reuters report.
The company's revenue also declined to Rbs4.99trn.
This financial update follows Gazprom's significant loss of approximately $7bn in 2023, its first annual loss since 1999, which was largely due to a substantial decline in sales to Europe.
Currently, Russian gas comprises only 18% of European imports, a stark reduction from 45% in 2021.
Similarly, the region's oil imports from Russia have dwindled to 3% from approximately 30% during the same period.
The EU has set a target to eliminate Russian energy imports by 2027.
In response to the changing market dynamics, Gazprom is actively seeking to enhance its gas supply to alternative markets, with a particular focus on China.
However, negotiations regarding a new pipeline to China have encountered several obstacles including pricing disputes, the report said.
An ""important"" agreement is expected to be signed between Gazprom and the Chinese corporation CNPC next week.
This coincides with President Vladimir Putin's upcoming visit to China, as confirmed by Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov.
In a separate development, Polish refiner ORLEN may face a financial setback of nearly $300m (1.09bn zlotys) due to an arbitration tribunal's decision that upheld Gazprom's right to impose higher retroactive prices for gas supplies.
This ruling is part of ongoing legal disputes over the prices Poland paid for Russian gas from 2017 to 2022.

By Bharath Rajeswaran and Vivek Kumar M
MUMBAI (Reuters) -India's world-beating economic growth is failing to translate into gains for equity markets as weakening pricing power and U.S. tariffs weigh on corporate earnings, turning foreign investors away.
Gross domestic product (GDP) in India grew at a faster-than-expected 7.8% in the April-June quarter in real terms. However, nominal growth, which represents output at current market prices, fell to 8.8% from 10.8% in the previous three months, indicating a drop in inflation.
This trend was also seen in corporate earnings, with revenue growth of the top 3,000 listed Indian companies slipping to a seven-quarter low of 3.4% on-year, down from 5.1% in the previous three months and 6.8% a year ago, according to Mumbai-headquartered ICICI Bank Global Market Research.
""The core corporate earnings outlook is weak and for the next few quarters at least we remain underweight,"" said Sat Duhra, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, adding that higher U.S. tariffs are an impediment to growth that India cannot afford right now.
""Weaker credit growth, weaker nominal GDP growth and warnings of weakening asset quality at the banks will continue to keep foreign investors on the sidelines,"" Duhra said.
Equity analysts in India see corporate earnings growth as more closely correlated with nominal growth. Slower nominal GDP growth translates into weaker corporate revenue and profits, which can make stocks look overvalued.
Nominal GDP growth for the current financial year is expected to be 8.5%-9%, the lowest in two decades outside the COVID-19 pandemic, which could keep earnings and equity markets under pressure, analysts at Jefferies said in a report on Friday.
India's benchmark Nifty index has risen about 4% so far this year, making it the third worst-performing across MSCI Asia countries this year, after Thailand and Indonesia.
Foreign investors have sold a net $15 billion in Indian equities so far, including $4 billion in outflows in August, when U.S. President Donald Trump hit India with tariffs of as much as 50%.
Indian consumer staples struggled in the April-June quarter, with Hindustan Unilever reporting subdued revenue growth of 4% and Colgate Palmolive India posting a 4% decline.
""In our view, markets remain on the expensive side, and we expect the impact of tariffs to lead to further earnings downgrades over the next 1-2 months,"" said Peeyush Mittal, portfolio manager at Matthews Asia.
""Accordingly, our near-term is cautious.""",166e1ac062964871f0e5f0be9278c64d,trafilatura

According to the tea and herbal drinks maker, Busain will be taking on the role from 1 October, while current CEO Pierre Laubies will return to the group's supervisory board.
Following Laubies' appointment to the role of CEO in April, Just Drinks understands that Lipton named him as a permanent CEO to give some certainty to the company's staff and partners while the company continued to look for a new chief executive.
The plan was for Laubies to move back to the supervisory board when a new chief executive was found.
He had previously been chair of the supervisory board since 2022.
Lipton's incoming CEO Busain has spent most of his career with Heineken, first joining their finance team in 1995.
He held a series of senior leadership roles from 2003 across Europe, Africa and the Americas.
In 2015, he joined Heineken’s global executive team as president for the Americas region.
Commenting on his appointment at Lipton, Marc Busain said: “It is a tremendous pleasure to join a company with responsibility for such a collection of storied and much-loved brands.
“Tea, in all its varied forms, is an exciting growth category and I look forward to working with the talented team at Lipton Teas and Infusions to ensure there’s a tea for everyone.""
Current supervisory board chair, Jean-Remy Roussel, said: “I am very pleased to welcome Marc to Lipton Teas and Infusions on behalf of the supervisory board.
“Marc has tremendous global experience in the consumer-packaged goods sector and a track record of consistently delivering growth. With his strong commercial acumen and leadership, I have every confidence that the world’s leading tea business is in good hands.”
He added: “I also look forward to having Pierre rejoin us on the supervisory board and thank him for his hands-on management during this period.”

Do I say no or risk losing the house?
Ines and Fran are both in their late 20s and have been saving to buy a house for years. To help them reach their goal, Ines’s dad offered them $50,000 to put toward a down payment. He said it was a gift, and just wanted to see his daughter and her partner start their family life together.
Now, Ines and Fran have made an offer on a home that was accepted. Ines deposited her dad’s money into the couple’s joint account, and the mortgage was approved by a broker. But shortly after the purchase agreement was signed, the dad turned around and said he needs the money back. Ines’s uncle is having business troubles and urgently needs a loan, which he cannot get from any lenders. Ines’s dad says that he needs the money to bail out his brother.
The situation has put Ines and Fran in a huge bind. They face either losing the house and possibly thousands of dollars in fees, or being outcast by Ines’s side of the family.

Losing more than just a home
Ines deposited the gift from her dad into her and Fran’s account so that they could show proof of funds during the buying process to get a mortgage. Fran thinks that what’s done is done, and the money was a gift; Ines is scared of losing her relationship with her dad and other family members.
The big problem for Ines and Fran, aside from Ines’s angry father, is that if they try to back out of the deal now, not only could they lose the earnest money deposit they made when signing the purchase agreement, but they could also lose a lot more.
What is an earnest money deposit?
An earnest money deposit, good-faith deposit or escrow deposit, is money that a buyer puts down to show they are serious about a purchase. In real estate transactions, this deposit is often submitted when a purchase agreement is signed and is held in an escrow account until closing. At that point, it’s applied to the down payment or the closing costs.
There’s no standard amount for deposits, but they’re typically 1 to 3% of the purchase price. Contract terms usually will have contingencies that, if not met, would allow a buyer to back out of a sale. Examples of this include problems found during a home inspection or appraisal, or not being able to secure financing. in these cases, a buyer would get their deposit back.",f10c2f99010cf4d9c52db4022762957e,trafilatura

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India is not ""profiteering"" from Russian oil imports and its purchases have stabilised markets while keeping prices from rising to as much as $200 a barrel, Hardeep Singh Puri, country's oil minister, said in the Hindu newspaper on Monday.
The U.S. has targeted India for its Russian oil purchases, with President Donald Trump imposing tariffs on Indian exports to the U.S. to discourage the country's crude buying.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accused India of profiteering by importing Russian oil at lower prices and then reselling refined fuel at a higher rate. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said Indian purchases were funding Moscow's war in Ukraine.
""Some critics allege that India has become a ‘laundromat’ for Russian oil. Nothing could be further from the truth,” Puri wrote in an editorial.
Puri's comments come as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in China at a regional summit.
India has emerged as the largest buyer of Russian seaborne oil. The country has taken advantage discounts for the oil as Russia sought new buyers after European countries and the U.S. shunned purchases and imposed sanctions on Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
""Russian oil has never been sanctioned like Iranian or Venezuelan crude; it is under a G-7/European Union price cap system deliberately designed to keep oil flowing while capping revenues"" Puri said.
He said every Indian oil transaction is done using ""legal shipping and insurance, compliant traders and audited channels"".
""India has not broken rules. India has stabilised markets and kept global prices from spiralling"".
""The larger truth is this - there is no substitute for the world's second largest producer supplying nearly 10% of global oil"", he added.

The protocol’s rapid expansion is “building the rails for prediction markets to evolve beyond a niche crypto product and become an entirely new segment of DeFi,” Loxley Fernandes, co-founder and CEO of Myriad, said in a statement shared with Decrypt.
“Financial markets have always been about speculation, but Myriad is turning speculation into a product,” Fernandes said, adding that Myriad’s success demonstrates that “trading ideas and forecasts is not only possible, it’s the next frontier for capital markets.”
Myriad Protocol Rolls Out Expansion to Ethereum L2 Linea
Created by Decrypt and Rug Radio’s parent company DASTAN, Myriad launched its USDC markets in March 2025. In July, Myriad expanded to Ethereum Layer-2 network Linea, marking a key stage in its evolution into a multichain prediction markets protocol designed to power a “new class of DeFi products.”
To date, Myriad users have installed its browser extension over 60,000 times and made more than 5.4 million predictions across categories including sport, politics, culture and crypto—taking in everything from Nvidia’s market cap to how many birds would fly over Texas on a given night.
Myriad continues to develop both its consumer platform and a B2B protocol for other prediction applications. Its future roadmap includes integrations with EigenLayer and EigenCloud, as well as plans for introducing blended oracles and a framework for ERC-PRED, a new asset class designed for prediction markets.
With prediction markets expected to surpass the stock market in the next decade and a half, Myriad is preparing to make prediction markets a pillar of global DeFi. Ultimately, its aim is to do for financial derivatives and predictions what Robinhood did for stocks and securities, Fernandes said—building a protocol that enables users to “tokenize your opinions with just three taps of your finger.”",adbcbd19886fb2b41925bc261442a427,trafilatura

Three people who attended the extraordinary shareholder meeting in Tokyo's Shibuya district confirmed the capital-raising plan passed, according to Reuters.
The proposal allows Metaplanet to sell up to 550 million new shares overseas alongside issuing preferred stock.
The financing scramble threatens to derail CEO Simon Gerovich's Bitcoin accumulation strategy, which has faced challenges after the firm’s stock-dependent ""flywheel"" financing mechanism “slowed,” according to Mark Chadwick, a former Jefferies analyst cited by Bloomberg.
A “door to fragility”
With Bitcoin trading near $109,000 and Metaplanet's stock declining, Ray Youssef, CEO of p2p crypto app NoOnes, told Decrypt that the divergence shows ""the moment you mix it in corporate equity with elements like leverage, warrants, and financial tricks, you open up a door to fragility that Bitcoin itself doesn't have.""
While the preferred shares approach could enable Metaplanet to buy time, the market could still see it as a “desperate move,” he added.
Metaplanet's declining stock has allegedly damaged its financing arrangement with Evo Fund, which relied on rising share prices to trigger warrant exercises that funded Bitcoin purchases.
This arrangement, known as the ""flywheel,"" has slowed down, reducing the capital available for Bitcoin purchases, according to Bloomberg. The firm's holdings grew less than 50% since June compared to a 160% surge in the prior two months.
Decrypt has reached out to Metaplanet for comment, and will update this article should the firm respond.
Despite its funding challenges, Metaplanet announced during Monday's meeting that it had acquired 1,009 BTC for approximately $112.2 million, bringing its total holdings to 20,000 BTC and achieving a ""BTC Yield of 486.7% YTD 2025.""

The equally owned JV has received NZ$300m ($177m) in financing for the 200MW first phase of the project.
The JV has arranged for an equal sharing of the project's offtake, with Meridian purchasing the total output and Nova entering a contract for difference for half of the electricity produced.
In April 2024, Nova obtained resource consent for the Te Rahui solar farm. Once both phases are operational, the facility is projected to supply enough electricity for around 100,000 households.
The initial power generation from phase one will commence in mid-2026, with full operational capacity anticipated by mid-2027.
Neither Meridian nor Nova has made a financial commitment regarding the second phase of the project, although both parties are working towards advancing it.
Meridian chief executive Mike Roan stated: “Te Rahui is a big undertaking and sharing the investment and offtake makes strong commercial sense for both parties, while the project will also benefit home and business customers by further strengthening security of supply.”
“It’s a real win-win and we’re delighted to have this opportunity to partner with Nova on Te Rahui.”
The initiative is part of Meridian's broader strategy to kickstart seven new projects by 2030, a goal that has been bolstered by the recent completion of the Harapaki wind farm and Ruakākā battery energy storage system (BESS).
Additional projects in Meridian's pipeline include another BESS in Manawatū, a wind farm at Mount Munro, a solar farm adjacent to the Ruakākā BESS and the refurbishment of the Te Rere Hau wind farm.
The Ruakākā solar farm is currently under construction, and the Mount Munro wind farm has advanced to the detailed design phase.
Roan added: “We are doing our share of the heavy lifting to secure New Zealand’s energy future. Having invested more than $1bn in the past five years, we have a further $2bn planned for investment over the next three years. These projects will add over 1,000MW of new capacity, a five percent increase to the electricity system.”

The world's biggest EV producer made 353,090 electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids (PHEV) globally last month, down 3.78% from a year earlier, according to a monthly filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Monday. That follows a 0.9% drop in July.
The last time BYD's production fell for two consecutive months was in June and July 2020.
Reuters reported in June that BYD, the biggest Chinese rival to Tesla (TSLA), was slowing its production pace by reducing shifts at some factories in China and had delayed plans to add new production lines.
Its sales in China, meanwhile, slid 14.3% year on year to 292,813 vehicles, down for a fourth consecutive month, even as global sales remained slightly up. BYD's sales in Europe are growing fast, data showed on Monday.
China sales, however, account for nearly 80% of BYD's total sales.
Monday's data suggests the company has only met 52.1% of its yearly sales target of 5.5 million units in the first eight months. And some analysts have said that the company is unlikely to meet that target.
China Merchants Bank International analysts said they had cut their BYD sales forecast by 5% to 4.9 million units for this year, as they believe it ""has become more cautious about its inventories"".
The drop in production and sales come shortly after BYD reported that quarterly profit fell for the first time in three and a half years, reflecting how pressure to stay competitive was beginning to take a toll.
The company's shares fell sharply on Monday.
A drop in BYD's PHEV production and sales since April persisted, while overall EV sales grew 34.4% and production rose 26% in August versus a year earlier. BYD has begun making and selling more EVs than PHEVs since April.

This supply is projected to fulfil around 15% of the Orlen Group's annual oil consumption.
The first deliveries under the one-year contract will commence in September.
The crude oil will be shipped from the port of Mongstad in Norway and is intended for refineries in Poland, Lithuania and the Czech Republic.
The Johan Sverdrup field is recognised as the third-largest on the NCS and boasts CO₂ emissions that are 80–90% lower than the global average.
This agreement aligns with Orlen's efforts to bolster energy security in Poland and the broader region.
The company has recently concluded its final contract for Russian oil, thereby eliminating Russian crude from its supply chain and severing ties with Russian suppliers.
Currently, Orlen's refineries are processing crude oil sourced from multiple regions including the Middle East, the North Sea, Africa and the Americas.
Equinor midstream and processing marketing executive vice-president Irene Rummelhoff said: “I am very pleased that we are now expanding our relationship with Orlen to also include supplies of crude oil from the Johan Sverdrup field in Norway.
“We are building on a long-term energy partnership with Orlen, which already includes production of oil and gas on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, a ten-year agreement for supplies of natural gas to Poland and collaboration on low-carbon solutions like carbon capture and storage.
“This agreement contributes to energy security in Poland, while we at the same time are working together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”
In the first half of 2025, Orlen processed a total of 9.8mt of crude oil, a 5% increase compared to the same time frame in the previous year.
Orlen management board president and CEO Ireneusz Fąfara said: “We are strengthening the energy security of Poland and the region as a whole. We have fully eliminated Russian crude from all our refineries, which was made possible through effective diversification of supply sources.
“The next step in this process is the first long-term contract with Equinor, giving us access to top-quality crude with high production efficiency. Johan Sverdrup is one of the largest fields in the world and accounts for one-third of Norway’s total oil production.
“Importantly, the production activities involve significantly reduced CO₂ emissions as the oil platforms are powered by electricity from shore, largely from renewables. We consistently focus on alternative sources of supply, as they are the foundation of stable production and a guarantee of energy security.”",b598a7aa779145d9e155a5657198a7ea,trafilatura

Will we owe the IRS gift tax ? ,My husband and I are giving my sister $30K each year . Will we owe the IRS gift tax ? ,2025-09-01 16:00:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"My husband and I have started giving money to my sister to help her out. It’s going to be about $30,000 a year for the next five or so years at least. Will this sum be more than the amount the IRS allows us to give without triggering federal gift-tax paperwork?
Do we have to be careful to not give more than the one-person limit from a separate checking account? Our finances are joint and we file a joint tax return, but I have a separate checking account, and I make any Zelle and Venmo payments from there.
Is it OK to just use that one account for the payment? It will be a $1,000 payment every week for 30 weeks each year. We do not see eye to eye on using paper checks because of the speed. etc., of that method of payment, but that’s a story for another day.
You are generous — and well within the parameters of federal gift-tax limits.
That’s a win-win for you and your sister. You and your husband would be liable for gift tax if you went over the limit. The annual gift-tax exclusion amount is currently $19,000 per person, or $38,000 if you are married and the gift is made with the agreement of your spouse. The IRS will view a contribution from your separate account as a gift from you alone and a from your joint account as a gift from both you and your husband. (The lifetime federal estate and gift tax exemption for 2025 is $13.99 million per individual. For a married couple, this amount is effectively doubled to $27.98 million.)
The IRS does not care much whether you send the money via Zelle, Venmo or carrier pigeon, as long as you account for it accurately and honestly. Your sister is fortunate to have such generous family members, and I hope that she puts this money to good use, whether it’s for her living expenses, education or paying off debts. One cautionary note: If it is for the latter, she may benefit from debt counselling and a more hands-on approach to her money management to help her figure out her triggers for spending money and any unhealthy patterns of behavior.
Setting up a trust
“One concern many people have about giving assets away early is that sometimes the person receiving the gift may not be ready to handle the responsibility of managing such a large amount of money,” according to Charles Schwab. “One way to give those assets, but ensure they are protected from misuse, would be to give them to an irrevocable trust and make the child or teenager the beneficiary.” That can also be useful for an adult family member who is not good at managing money.
This gives you more control. “This method allows you to set the rules of the trust and determine how the assets will be invested and distributed,” Schwab says. “For instance, you could create a trust that stipulates the beneficiary can only have access to the income generated by the assets — or you could set specific rules, such as requiring the beneficiary to graduate from college before having access to the funds in the trust. There are numerous options when it comes to structuring a trust, and each state has its own rules.”
There are also other ways to give money tax-free. “You can also make unlimited payments directly to medical providers or educational institutions on behalf of others for qualified expenses without incurring a taxable gift or affecting your $19,000 gift exclusion,” Schwab SCHW adds. “This method is a great way to help a loved one with large medical bills from an illness or to help pay for a family member’s education. For example, say you wanted to pay your granddaughter’s $60,000 annual tuition for her medical degree. You could pay the university directly.”
Writing paper checks
Finally, a postscript on paper checks, since you bring them up. They are slower and more vulnerable to being intercepted by fraudsters. A bank takes time to process a check in order to ensure the check’s validity. The Better Business Bureau recommends signing checks in black gel ink, which it says is more difficult to tamper with than regular blue or black pens. Checks are an old-fashioned payment method and rely on a legacy network to process payment or return checks. For instance, an income-tax refund can take anywhere from three to eight weeks to arrive by check.
A common scam is when consumers are fooled into cashing a check for a third party. The scammer tells a person with a U.S.-based bank account that they inherited a large sum of money and offers the person a generous commission to deposit the amount and wire the scammer the rest of the funds. However, the check is later returned and the customer is on the hook for the wired funds. (This scary New Yorker story on the subject may change your view on paper checks permanently.) That said, you and your husband agree on more important issues, like helping your sister.

-
Ethereum led the charge with $1.4B in inflows, while Bitcoin saw continued outflows.
-
Altcoins like Solana and XRP gained momentum on optimism around potential U.S. ETF launches.

The surge pushed August’s total inflows to $4.37 billion, bringing the year-to-date figure to $35.5 billion, according to a Monday report by CoinShares.
Crypto Inflows Cool as Core PCE Data Dampens Fed Rate Cut Hopes
Despite the strong showing, momentum slowed on Friday after the release of Core PCE inflation data, which tempered hopes of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September.
The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, showed a 2.9% annualized rise in July, the highest since February.
The news, coupled with recent price pressure across crypto markets, caused a dip in sentiment and trimmed total assets under management by 10% to $219 billion.
The United States remained the clear leader, accounting for $2.29 billion of last week’s inflows. Switzerland, Germany, and Canada also posted gains of $109.4 million, $69.9 million, and $41.1 million, respectively.
Analysts suggest the Friday pullback likely reflects profit-taking rather than a broader shift in investor sentiment.
Ethereum continued to outperform its peers, attracting $1.4 billion in inflows last week alone. For the month of August, Ethereum has pulled in nearly $4 billion, while Bitcoin posted outflows of $301 million.
Meanwhile, altcoins like Solana and XRP gained further traction on expectations surrounding potential U.S.-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Solana recorded $177 million in inflows, while XRP followed with $134 million.
The latest figures show renewed appetite for digital assets, particularly among investors looking for alternatives to Bitcoin and betting on future ETF approvals.

As reported, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently reviewing 92 crypto ETF applications, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart.
A detailed spreadsheet published on August 28 shows most of these filings, especially those linked to Solana, XRP, and Litecoin, are facing final decisions by October.
The wave of new applications reflects growing interest in altcoin-focused ETFs and could spark fresh capital inflows into the crypto market.

Personal finance expert Dave Ramsey says too many people are placing their hopes in the wrong strategy. Depending on government policies to redistribute wealth has never produced lasting financial success for ordinary Americans, he warned.
That message came during a recent call with Laurie from Oregon on “The Ramsey Show.” At 69, Laurie had already retired after 30 years with a local government job, while her 71-year-old husband still runs his own business. Together, they've built a solid nest egg: about $500,000 in certificates of deposit and high-yield savings, $700,000 in retirement accounts, and a paid-off home worth around $400,000.

Laurie explained that she grew up with her grandmother, who shared the same money advice Ramsey teaches. ""I only had come across you in the last year,"" she said, ""but the amazing thing was I grew up mostly with my grandma who had exactly the same advice as you. So I followed her advice and found that you gave the same exact advice.” Ramsey was quick to add, “God's and grandma’s ways of handling money. It’s called common sense.""
Ramsey praised her and her husband's discipline, noting that they started from nothing and raised their son to graduate law school debt-free.
Laurie wanted advice on whether to move her $500,000 in CDs, which currently earn about 5%, into the market. Ramsey was straightforward: ""Yes,"" he said. ""If you make 4% or 5% and you could have been making 12% or 15%, that means you’re losing 10%, which on 500,000 is you missed out on 50 grand.""

Laurie also asked if she could afford a dream trip to Australia when she turns 70. Ramsey encouraged her not to hold back. ""You can't afford not to do it,"" he said. ""The difference in this conversation, investing this money versus high yield, will pay for the trip.""
He reminded her that wealth isn't just about saving. ""You have done such a good job. I want you to enjoy your money as well as be generous with your money as well as continuing to be wise with your money,"" he told her. Ramsey and co-host George Kamel emphasized that this is the reward for decades of hard work and smart choices.

Former President Donald Trump blasted the change, conservative media piled on, and loyal customers revolted.
But one critic had sounded the alarm long before politics got involved: Sardar Biglari, an Iranian-American investor who owns about 9% of Cracker Barrel and has been warning for years that costly rebrands and remodels would backfire.
In October 2024, Biglari sent a seven-page letter to shareholders, calling CEO Julie Felss Masino's $700 million modernization plan an ""obvious folly."" His math: Cracker Barrel had spent $1.4 billion in capital expenditures since 2011, yet operating income had actually fallen from $167 million to $121 million.
Masino, who earned roughly $7 million in 2024 compensation, roughly 360 times more than the median employee, had come from Taco Bell with promises to reinvent the 55-year-old brand. But Biglari argued that remodeling would drain capital without solving the real problem: declining foot traffic.
When the board doubled down on Masino's vision, Biglari followed up with a two-page warning in November, pointing out that a $100 investment in Cracker Barrel in 2019 had already withered to just $30 by 2024. ""Therefore, there is just $30 to go before the entire investment is lost,"" he wrote.
The board's response? On November 21, 2024, shareholders re-elected all nominees, including Masino, touting it as an endorsement of the transformation plan.
Vindication arrives for Biglari
By August 2025, the logo redesign had triggered public outrage, a 15% stock plunge and the company lost over $100 million in market value. Executives posted a swift reversal just a week later. Trump claimed credit for forcing the reversal, and his supporters hailed it as a win for tradition over ""wokeness.""
Biglari and his Steak 'n Shake brand seized the moment, releasing novelty ""Biglari Was Right About Cracker Barrel"" and ""Fire Cracker Barrel CEO!"" hats and blasting the company's costly remodels: ""Logo is a symptom of a bigger problem! The $700 million remodel is insane! It's bland, soulless, and an unnecessary waste of money.""
The optics couldn't have been clearer: while Masino and the board clung to big-budget branding gambits, Biglari had long been arguing for simplicity. His flagship brands thrive on straightforward value, hearty food, and consistency — exactly what critics say Cracker Barrel risks abandoning.
Biglari is no stranger to turnarounds — or controversy. The son of a former military officer under Shah Reza Pahlavi, his family fled Tehran after the Iranian Revolution. Out of San Antonio, Texas, Biglari built Biglari Holdings from his family's Persian carpet store into an NYSE-traded company. Biglari Holdings owns a variety of companies including Steak n' Shake, Western Sizzlin' and Maxim magazine.
He earned his reputation in the restaurant business by steering Steak 'n Shake from near-insolvency in 2008 to 29 straight quarters of same-store sales growth. He also revived Western Sizzlin'. His approach emphasizes lean operations and consistency, though his aggressive tactics and public battles with boards have made him a polarizing figure in corporate America.
Yet his Cracker Barrel critique found support in an unexpected ally.
So does Biglari understand Cracker Barrel better than its CEO?
Cracker Barrel's co-founder Tommy Lowe, now 93, blasted the redesign as ""pitiful"" and said the $700 million modernization plan was ""throwing money out the window."" His criticism cut deeper than aesthetics: ""They need to work on the food and service, and leave the barrel — the logo — alone.""
Under Biglari's leadership, Steak 'n Shake turned around from near-insolvency to a decade of growth. But that momentum started to fade: locations dropped from 626 in 2018 to about 426 by the end of 2024.
Still, there's resilience. In Q2 2025, Steak 'n Shake posted a 10.7% same-store sales increase, even as operating earnings in the restaurant segment slid to $3.7 million, down from $19.7 million a year earlier. The numbers reveal a complex truth: Biglari knows how to drive traffic but hasn't fully cracked the current market challenges yet — his diagnosis of Cracker Barrel's problems may be right even if his prescription isn't perfect.
The lesson in Cracker Barrel's reversal
Beyond the logo controversy lies a fundamental question about Cracker Barrel's identity. The company spent $16 million on consulting fees to discover what Biglari and Lowe have said for free: the brand has lost relevance.
Masino admitted that many of the company's recipes and operations hadn't changed in decades. Yet her solution, a $700 million remodel focused on ""lighter, brighter"" interiors, addresses aesthetics rather than the fundamental issues both critics identified. On Masino's side is Cracker Barrel's aging customer base — how are they supposed to attract new demographics and younger consumers without making strategic updates or better marketing?
For now, the clash underscores a larger debate facing many legacy brands: how to balance heritage with reinvention without alienating the very customers that made them iconic.
In trying to escape the past, Cracker Barrel discovered its future may depend on it. Biglari understood something the ex-Taco Bell executive didn't: some brands succeed not despite being old-fashioned, but because of it.
The logo has been reversed, but with the $700 million remodel proceeding and traffic still declining, investor Chris Wunder noted after the debacle: ""Maybe we should have let Sardar Biglari and Biglari Holdings Inc. take over.""",e1049032d2f160f9b4c9aa5e4e989d7b,trafilatura

The company will issue 476.2 million new fully paid ordinary shares at A$0.105 each.
The placement has garnered strong support from new investors, and Core Lithium plans to complement this with a share purchase plan (SPP) for Australian and New Zealand shareholders, also at A$0.105 per share, aiming to raise an additional A$10m.
The proceeds from the placement will be channelled into the Finniss Lithium Project.
The funds will be specifically used for ordering long-lead items, resuming development at the BP33 boxcut and decline, operational readiness and general working capital needs. The SPP funds will further bolster working capital.
Operations at the Finniss project near Darwin were halted in January 2024 following an 85% decline in spodumene concentrate prices over the preceding year.
Argonaut Securities and Canaccord Genuity (Australia) are joint lead managers and bookrunners for the placement, with Mills Oakley providing legal advice.
The placement's first tranche will issue approximately 278.1 million new shares to raise around A$29.2m, with settlement expected on 3 September 2025.
The second tranche, subject to shareholder approval, will issue around 198.1 million new shares to raise approximately A$20.8m.
The offer price represents a 12.5% discount on the last traded share price on 26 August.
Core Lithium CEO Paul Brown said: “We are very pleased with the strong support received from new institutional investors across the Americas and Australia for this heavily supported placement. This funding milestone strengthens our balance sheet and provides the capital to advance the Finniss Lithium Project towards a positive final investment decision.
“Importantly, the equity raising makes a material contribution towards the pre-production capital requirement for Finniss by directly funding critical early works, including the BP33 box cut and decline, while also covering a portion of the operational readiness costs identified in the Restart Study.
“This ensures we can progress underground development, accelerate operational readiness and maintain flexibility as we finalise strategic funding solutions to meet the remaining capital needs. We remain focused on delivering value for all shareholders as we progress Core’s growth and development objectives.”
Core retains discretion over the SPP, which could result in raising more or less than the targeted A$10m, depending on oversubscriptions or scaled-back applications, Brown added.",c60e648e22f84cb42da2037c89dbc99c,trafilatura

",2025-09-01 16:00:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"I’m trying to find an answer for a family member who fell victim to an online romance scam. Following several months of correspondence and grooming, they wired $60,000 to the scammer before realizing there was not a real person who was interested in them. Very sad, but it happened. A police report was filed and the FBI was notified. Copies of all correspondence and the transactions have been maintained.
The bank did try to stop them from executing the transfers, but this person believed it was true love. No recourse back to the bank, as the wire transfers were willingly executed. No coverage on homeowners insurance for this type of scam either. Our question is this: Is this loss by theft deductible on their federal tax return? I am unable to get through to a live agent at the IRS to inquire. The publication on this was not very clear.
The last tranche of funds sent comprised several transactions from a loan taken out against their 401(k). It’s horrible to have been told to do that in order to help a “true love” out of a hard spot. The perpetrator of this crime told my relative not to tell anyone. Those are all red flags. Now the loan has to be paid back. No tax recourse for this either, I suppose?
Three things make people vulnerable to such scams: isolation, isolation, isolation.
That’s why the thief told your relative not to tell anyone about either the romance or the bank transfers. What makes this situation worse is that people are even less likely to talk about their experience after they realize they’ve been duped because — sad as it seems — an avalanche of scorn and ridicule and laughing emojis awaits them if they do go public. People tend to be humbled when something like this happens to them, but if it happens to someone else, it brings out a flood of mockery and ire.
Phishing scams are associated with older people in the public imagination. Studies have suggested that young people are more likely to fall for online scams, despite — and perhaps because of — the fact that they tend to be more Internet savvy. Generation Z — those born between 1995 and 2012— is more than three times more likely to fall for online scams than baby boomers, according to a 2023 Deloitte report. A 2025 Pew Research Center report found that online scams were evenly distributed across all age groups with those aged 65-plus reporting slightly less online scams.
I’m sorry this happened, and I’m glad that this person has a relative they have confided in and they can rely on. But because this was a romance scam and the money was handed over willingly, I have some bad news. First, regarding the loan from their 401(k): If your friend does not repay the loan, they will have to pay a 10% penalty if they are younger than 59½, and will also have to pay income tax on that withdrawal.
Second, for taxpayers who were motivated to transfer funds as part of a non-investment scam — such as a romance scam or kidnapping scam — where there is no profit motive for the transaction, “the loss is a disallowed personal casualty loss,” according to this memo released by the IRS last March. “For taxpayers who did not authorize any distribution or transfer, the loss does not result from the actions of the taxpayer, so that the relevant transaction for determining the character of the loss is the original investment and the motive of the taxpayer at that time.”
Lack of sympathy for victims
Consumer advocates have sympathy for people like your friend, but the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 restricted deductions on losses to federally declared disasters. The Taxpayer Advocate Service disagrees with this change, saying: “Congress should allow the TCJA restriction to expire at the end of this year. Scam victims shouldn’t be treated differently based on whether the scam involved a false investment or a false personal relationship.”
“Many victims are ordinary taxpayers misled by increasingly sophisticated frauds,” the organization adds. “Restoring the broader theft loss deduction would allow all victims a chance to deduct their losses.” As for the 401(k) issue: “This mismatch is inherently unfair to taxpayers,” it adds. “Congress should revise the law to allow taxpayers to amend the original tax return to claim the loss deduction in the same year they reported the additional income.”
Why do people fall for such scams? Your relative sent wire transfers after suspending their disbelief and becoming emotionally invested in this scenario, however unlikely it now seems, like they might be in a movie or a play. This is called “pig butchering,” because the scam artists take their time fattening up their mark, establishing trust and feeding the victim information, promising bigger and better returns, whether they be financial or emotional. Slowly, the victim’s instincts are compromised by the prospect of romance or, in other cases, a return on their “investment.”
MetLife conducted a major study on the subject and found that women were nearly twice as likely as men to be victims of elder financial abuse. Most victims lived alone, which may point to the fact that lonely people are more likely to seek out a connection online. “In almost all of the cases, there existed a combination of tenuous, valued independence and observable vulnerability that merged in the lives of victims to optimize opportunities for abuse by every type of perpetrator,” the study concluded.
This may serve as a reminder to other people who find themselves on the brink of pressing “send.”",b85d34c9eadcb8b30d4389e5ee96d0d4,trafilatura

This supply is projected to fulfil around 15% of the Orlen Group's annual oil consumption.
The first deliveries under the one-year contract will commence in September.
The crude oil will be shipped from the port of Mongstad in Norway and is intended for refineries in Poland, Lithuania and the Czech Republic.
The Johan Sverdrup field is recognised as the third-largest on the NCS and boasts CO₂ emissions that are 80–90% lower than the global average.
This agreement aligns with Orlen's efforts to bolster energy security in Poland and the broader region.
The company has recently concluded its final contract for Russian oil, thereby eliminating Russian crude from its supply chain and severing ties with Russian suppliers.
Currently, Orlen's refineries are processing crude oil sourced from multiple regions including the Middle East, the North Sea, Africa and the Americas.
Equinor midstream and processing marketing executive vice-president Irene Rummelhoff said: “I am very pleased that we are now expanding our relationship with Orlen to also include supplies of crude oil from the Johan Sverdrup field in Norway.
“We are building on a long-term energy partnership with Orlen, which already includes production of oil and gas on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, a ten-year agreement for supplies of natural gas to Poland and collaboration on low-carbon solutions like carbon capture and storage.
“This agreement contributes to energy security in Poland, while we at the same time are working together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”
In the first half of 2025, Orlen processed a total of 9.8mt of crude oil, a 5% increase compared to the same time frame in the previous year.
Orlen management board president and CEO Ireneusz Fąfara said: “We are strengthening the energy security of Poland and the region as a whole. We have fully eliminated Russian crude from all our refineries, which was made possible through effective diversification of supply sources.
“The next step in this process is the first long-term contract with Equinor, giving us access to top-quality crude with high production efficiency. Johan Sverdrup is one of the largest fields in the world and accounts for one-third of Norway’s total oil production.
“Importantly, the production activities involve significantly reduced CO₂ emissions as the oil platforms are powered by electricity from shore, largely from renewables. We consistently focus on alternative sources of supply, as they are the foundation of stable production and a guarantee of energy security.”",b598a7aa779145d9e155a5657198a7ea,trafilatura

Will we owe the IRS gift tax ? ,My husband and I are giving my sister $30K each year . Will we owe the IRS gift tax ? ,2025-09-01 16:00:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"My husband and I have started giving money to my sister to help her out. It’s going to be about $30,000 a year for the next five or so years at least. Will this sum be more than the amount the IRS allows us to give without triggering federal gift-tax paperwork?
Do we have to be careful to not give more than the one-person limit from a separate checking account? Our finances are joint and we file a joint tax return, but I have a separate checking account, and I make any Zelle and Venmo payments from there.
Is it OK to just use that one account for the payment? It will be a $1,000 payment every week for 30 weeks each year. We do not see eye to eye on using paper checks because of the speed. etc., of that method of payment, but that’s a story for another day.
You are generous — and well within the parameters of federal gift-tax limits.
That’s a win-win for you and your sister. You and your husband would be liable for gift tax if you went over the limit. The annual gift-tax exclusion amount is currently $19,000 per person, or $38,000 if you are married and the gift is made with the agreement of your spouse. The IRS will view a contribution from your separate account as a gift from you alone and a from your joint account as a gift from both you and your husband. (The lifetime federal estate and gift tax exemption for 2025 is $13.99 million per individual. For a married couple, this amount is effectively doubled to $27.98 million.)
The IRS does not care much whether you send the money via Zelle, Venmo or carrier pigeon, as long as you account for it accurately and honestly. Your sister is fortunate to have such generous family members, and I hope that she puts this money to good use, whether it’s for her living expenses, education or paying off debts. One cautionary note: If it is for the latter, she may benefit from debt counselling and a more hands-on approach to her money management to help her figure out her triggers for spending money and any unhealthy patterns of behavior.
Setting up a trust
“One concern many people have about giving assets away early is that sometimes the person receiving the gift may not be ready to handle the responsibility of managing such a large amount of money,” according to Charles Schwab. “One way to give those assets, but ensure they are protected from misuse, would be to give them to an irrevocable trust and make the child or teenager the beneficiary.” That can also be useful for an adult family member who is not good at managing money.
This gives you more control. “This method allows you to set the rules of the trust and determine how the assets will be invested and distributed,” Schwab says. “For instance, you could create a trust that stipulates the beneficiary can only have access to the income generated by the assets — or you could set specific rules, such as requiring the beneficiary to graduate from college before having access to the funds in the trust. There are numerous options when it comes to structuring a trust, and each state has its own rules.”
There are also other ways to give money tax-free. “You can also make unlimited payments directly to medical providers or educational institutions on behalf of others for qualified expenses without incurring a taxable gift or affecting your $19,000 gift exclusion,” Schwab SCHW adds. “This method is a great way to help a loved one with large medical bills from an illness or to help pay for a family member’s education. For example, say you wanted to pay your granddaughter’s $60,000 annual tuition for her medical degree. You could pay the university directly.”
Writing paper checks
Finally, a postscript on paper checks, since you bring them up. They are slower and more vulnerable to being intercepted by fraudsters. A bank takes time to process a check in order to ensure the check’s validity. The Better Business Bureau recommends signing checks in black gel ink, which it says is more difficult to tamper with than regular blue or black pens. Checks are an old-fashioned payment method and rely on a legacy network to process payment or return checks. For instance, an income-tax refund can take anywhere from three to eight weeks to arrive by check.
A common scam is when consumers are fooled into cashing a check for a third party. The scammer tells a person with a U.S.-based bank account that they inherited a large sum of money and offers the person a generous commission to deposit the amount and wire the scammer the rest of the funds. However, the check is later returned and the customer is on the hook for the wired funds. (This scary New Yorker story on the subject may change your view on paper checks permanently.) That said, you and your husband agree on more important issues, like helping your sister.

-
Ethereum led the charge with $1.4B in inflows, while Bitcoin saw continued outflows.
-
Altcoins like Solana and XRP gained momentum on optimism around potential U.S. ETF launches.

The surge pushed August’s total inflows to $4.37 billion, bringing the year-to-date figure to $35.5 billion, according to a Monday report by CoinShares.
Crypto Inflows Cool as Core PCE Data Dampens Fed Rate Cut Hopes
Despite the strong showing, momentum slowed on Friday after the release of Core PCE inflation data, which tempered hopes of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September.
The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, showed a 2.9% annualized rise in July, the highest since February.
The news, coupled with recent price pressure across crypto markets, caused a dip in sentiment and trimmed total assets under management by 10% to $219 billion.
The United States remained the clear leader, accounting for $2.29 billion of last week’s inflows. Switzerland, Germany, and Canada also posted gains of $109.4 million, $69.9 million, and $41.1 million, respectively.
Analysts suggest the Friday pullback likely reflects profit-taking rather than a broader shift in investor sentiment.
Ethereum continued to outperform its peers, attracting $1.4 billion in inflows last week alone. For the month of August, Ethereum has pulled in nearly $4 billion, while Bitcoin posted outflows of $301 million.
Meanwhile, altcoins like Solana and XRP gained further traction on expectations surrounding potential U.S.-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Solana recorded $177 million in inflows, while XRP followed with $134 million.
The latest figures show renewed appetite for digital assets, particularly among investors looking for alternatives to Bitcoin and betting on future ETF approvals.

As reported, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently reviewing 92 crypto ETF applications, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart.
A detailed spreadsheet published on August 28 shows most of these filings, especially those linked to Solana, XRP, and Litecoin, are facing final decisions by October.

That's Called Socialism'
Personal finance expert Dave Ramsey says too many people are placing their hopes in the wrong strategy. Depending on government policies to redistribute wealth has never produced lasting financial success for ordinary Americans, he warned.
That message came during a recent call with Laurie from Oregon on “The Ramsey Show.” At 69, Laurie had already retired after 30 years with a local government job, while her 71-year-old husband still runs his own business. Together, they've built a solid nest egg: about $500,000 in certificates of deposit and high-yield savings, $700,000 in retirement accounts, and a paid-off home worth around $400,000.

Building Wealth The Old-Fashioned Way
Laurie explained that she grew up with her grandmother, who shared the same money advice Ramsey teaches. ""I only had come across you in the last year,"" she said, ""but the amazing thing was I grew up mostly with my grandma who had exactly the same advice as you. So I followed her advice and found that you gave the same exact advice.” Ramsey was quick to add, “God's and grandma’s ways of handling money. It’s called common sense.""
Ramsey praised her and her husband's discipline, noting that they started from nothing and raised their son to graduate law school debt-free.
Laurie wanted advice on whether to move her $500,000 in CDs, which currently earn about 5%, into the market. Ramsey was straightforward: ""Yes,"" he said. ""If you make 4% or 5% and you could have been making 12% or 15%, that means you’re losing 10%, which on 500,000 is you missed out on 50 grand.""

Laurie also asked if she could afford a dream trip to Australia when she turns 70. Ramsey encouraged her not to hold back. ""You can't afford not to do it,"" he said. ""The difference in this conversation, investing this money versus high yield, will pay for the trip.""
He reminded her that wealth isn't just about saving. ""You have done such a good job. I want you to enjoy your money as well as be generous with your money as well as continuing to be wise with your money,"" he told her. Ramsey and co-host George Kamel emphasized that this is the reward for decades of hard work and smart choices.

Former President Donald Trump blasted the change, conservative media piled on, and loyal customers revolted.
But one critic had sounded the alarm long before politics got involved: Sardar Biglari, an Iranian-American investor who owns about 9% of Cracker Barrel and has been warning for years that costly rebrands and remodels would backfire.
In October 2024, Biglari sent a seven-page letter to shareholders, calling CEO Julie Felss Masino's $700 million modernization plan an ""obvious folly."" His math: Cracker Barrel had spent $1.4 billion in capital expenditures since 2011, yet operating income had actually fallen from $167 million to $121 million.
Masino, who earned roughly $7 million in 2024 compensation, roughly 360 times more than the median employee, had come from Taco Bell with promises to reinvent the 55-year-old brand. But Biglari argued that remodeling would drain capital without solving the real problem: declining foot traffic.
When the board doubled down on Masino's vision, Biglari followed up with a two-page warning in November, pointing out that a $100 investment in Cracker Barrel in 2019 had already withered to just $30 by 2024. ""Therefore, there is just $30 to go before the entire investment is lost,"" he wrote.
The board's response? On November 21, 2024, shareholders re-elected all nominees, including Masino, touting it as an endorsement of the transformation plan.
Vindication arrives for Biglari
By August 2025, the logo redesign had triggered public outrage, a 15% stock plunge and the company lost over $100 million in market value. Executives posted a swift reversal just a week later. Trump claimed credit for forcing the reversal, and his supporters hailed it as a win for tradition over ""wokeness.""
Biglari and his Steak 'n Shake brand seized the moment, releasing novelty ""Biglari Was Right About Cracker Barrel"" and ""Fire Cracker Barrel CEO!"" hats and blasting the company's costly remodels: ""Logo is a symptom of a bigger problem! The $700 million remodel is insane! It's bland, soulless, and an unnecessary waste of money.""
The optics couldn't have been clearer: while Masino and the board clung to big-budget branding gambits, Biglari had long been arguing for simplicity. His flagship brands thrive on straightforward value, hearty food, and consistency — exactly what critics say Cracker Barrel risks abandoning.
Biglari is no stranger to turnarounds — or controversy. The son of a former military officer under Shah Reza Pahlavi, his family fled Tehran after the Iranian Revolution. Out of San Antonio, Texas, Biglari built Biglari Holdings from his family's Persian carpet store into an NYSE-traded company. Biglari Holdings owns a variety of companies including Steak n' Shake, Western Sizzlin' and Maxim magazine.
He earned his reputation in the restaurant business by steering Steak 'n Shake from near-insolvency in 2008 to 29 straight quarters of same-store sales growth. He also revived Western Sizzlin'. His approach emphasizes lean operations and consistency, though his aggressive tactics and public battles with boards have made him a polarizing figure in corporate America.
Yet his Cracker Barrel critique found support in an unexpected ally.
So does Biglari understand Cracker Barrel better than its CEO?
Cracker Barrel's co-founder Tommy Lowe, now 93, blasted the redesign as ""pitiful"" and said the $700 million modernization plan was ""throwing money out the window."" His criticism cut deeper than aesthetics: ""They need to work on the food and service, and leave the barrel — the logo — alone.""
Under Biglari's leadership, Steak 'n Shake turned around from near-insolvency to a decade of growth. But that momentum started to fade: locations dropped from 626 in 2018 to about 426 by the end of 2024.
Still, there's resilience. In Q2 2025, Steak 'n Shake posted a 10.7% same-store sales increase, even as operating earnings in the restaurant segment slid to $3.7 million, down from $19.7 million a year earlier. The numbers reveal a complex truth: Biglari knows how to drive traffic but hasn't fully cracked the current market challenges yet — his diagnosis of Cracker Barrel's problems may be right even if his prescription isn't perfect.
The lesson in Cracker Barrel's reversal
Beyond the logo controversy lies a fundamental question about Cracker Barrel's identity. The company spent $16 million on consulting fees to discover what Biglari and Lowe have said for free: the brand has lost relevance.
Masino admitted that many of the company's recipes and operations hadn't changed in decades. Yet her solution, a $700 million remodel focused on ""lighter, brighter"" interiors, addresses aesthetics rather than the fundamental issues both critics identified. On Masino's side is Cracker Barrel's aging customer base — how are they supposed to attract new demographics and younger consumers without making strategic updates or better marketing?
For now, the clash underscores a larger debate facing many legacy brands: how to balance heritage with reinvention without alienating the very customers that made them iconic.
In trying to escape the past, Cracker Barrel discovered its future may depend on it. Biglari understood something the ex-Taco Bell executive didn't: some brands succeed not despite being old-fashioned, but because of it.
The logo has been reversed, but with the $700 million remodel proceeding and traffic still declining, investor Chris Wunder noted after the debacle: ""Maybe we should have let Sardar Biglari and Biglari Holdings Inc. take over.""",e1049032d2f160f9b4c9aa5e4e989d7b,trafilatura

The company will issue 476.2 million new fully paid ordinary shares at A$0.105 each.
The placement has garnered strong support from new investors, and Core Lithium plans to complement this with a share purchase plan (SPP) for Australian and New Zealand shareholders, also at A$0.105 per share, aiming to raise an additional A$10m.
The proceeds from the placement will be channelled into the Finniss Lithium Project.
The funds will be specifically used for ordering long-lead items, resuming development at the BP33 boxcut and decline, operational readiness and general working capital needs. The SPP funds will further bolster working capital.
Operations at the Finniss project near Darwin were halted in January 2024 following an 85% decline in spodumene concentrate prices over the preceding year.
Argonaut Securities and Canaccord Genuity (Australia) are joint lead managers and bookrunners for the placement, with Mills Oakley providing legal advice.
The placement's first tranche will issue approximately 278.1 million new shares to raise around A$29.2m, with settlement expected on 3 September 2025.
The second tranche, subject to shareholder approval, will issue around 198.1 million new shares to raise approximately A$20.8m.
The offer price represents a 12.5% discount on the last traded share price on 26 August.
Core Lithium CEO Paul Brown said: “We are very pleased with the strong support received from new institutional investors across the Americas and Australia for this heavily supported placement. This funding milestone strengthens our balance sheet and provides the capital to advance the Finniss Lithium Project towards a positive final investment decision.
“Importantly, the equity raising makes a material contribution towards the pre-production capital requirement for Finniss by directly funding critical early works, including the BP33 box cut and decline, while also covering a portion of the operational readiness costs identified in the Restart Study.
“This ensures we can progress underground development, accelerate operational readiness and maintain flexibility as we finalise strategic funding solutions to meet the remaining capital needs. We remain focused on delivering value for all shareholders as we progress Core’s growth and development objectives.”
Core retains discretion over the SPP, which could result in raising more or less than the targeted A$10m, depending on oversubscriptions or scaled-back applications, Brown added.",c60e648e22f84cb42da2037c89dbc99c,trafilatura

",2025-09-01 16:00:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"I’m trying to find an answer for a family member who fell victim to an online romance scam. Following several months of correspondence and grooming, they wired $60,000 to the scammer before realizing there was not a real person who was interested in them. Very sad, but it happened. A police report was filed and the FBI was notified. Copies of all correspondence and the transactions have been maintained.
The bank did try to stop them from executing the transfers, but this person believed it was true love. No recourse back to the bank, as the wire transfers were willingly executed. No coverage on homeowners insurance for this type of scam either. Our question is this: Is this loss by theft deductible on their federal tax return? I am unable to get through to a live agent at the IRS to inquire. The publication on this was not very clear.
The last tranche of funds sent comprised several transactions from a loan taken out against their 401(k). It’s horrible to have been told to do that in order to help a “true love” out of a hard spot. The perpetrator of this crime told my relative not to tell anyone. Those are all red flags. Now the loan has to be paid back. No tax recourse for this either, I suppose?
Three things make people vulnerable to such scams: isolation, isolation, isolation.
That’s why the thief told your relative not to tell anyone about either the romance or the bank transfers. What makes this situation worse is that people are even less likely to talk about their experience after they realize they’ve been duped because — sad as it seems — an avalanche of scorn and ridicule and laughing emojis awaits them if they do go public. People tend to be humbled when something like this happens to them, but if it happens to someone else, it brings out a flood of mockery and ire.
Phishing scams are associated with older people in the public imagination. Studies have suggested that young people are more likely to fall for online scams, despite — and perhaps because of — the fact that they tend to be more Internet savvy. Generation Z — those born between 1995 and 2012— is more than three times more likely to fall for online scams than baby boomers, according to a 2023 Deloitte report. A 2025 Pew Research Center report found that online scams were evenly distributed across all age groups with those aged 65-plus reporting slightly less online scams.
I’m sorry this happened, and I’m glad that this person has a relative they have confided in and they can rely on. But because this was a romance scam and the money was handed over willingly, I have some bad news. First, regarding the loan from their 401(k): If your friend does not repay the loan, they will have to pay a 10% penalty if they are younger than 59½, and will also have to pay income tax on that withdrawal.
Second, for taxpayers who were motivated to transfer funds as part of a non-investment scam — such as a romance scam or kidnapping scam — where there is no profit motive for the transaction, “the loss is a disallowed personal casualty loss,” according to this memo released by the IRS last March. “For taxpayers who did not authorize any distribution or transfer, the loss does not result from the actions of the taxpayer, so that the relevant transaction for determining the character of the loss is the original investment and the motive of the taxpayer at that time.”
Lack of sympathy for victims
Consumer advocates have sympathy for people like your friend, but the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 restricted deductions on losses to federally declared disasters. The Taxpayer Advocate Service disagrees with this change, saying: “Congress should allow the TCJA restriction to expire at the end of this year. Scam victims shouldn’t be treated differently based on whether the scam involved a false investment or a false personal relationship.”
“Many victims are ordinary taxpayers misled by increasingly sophisticated frauds,” the organization adds. “Restoring the broader theft loss deduction would allow all victims a chance to deduct their losses.” As for the 401(k) issue: “This mismatch is inherently unfair to taxpayers,” it adds. “Congress should revise the law to allow taxpayers to amend the original tax return to claim the loss deduction in the same year they reported the additional income.”
Why do people fall for such scams? Your relative sent wire transfers after suspending their disbelief and becoming emotionally invested in this scenario, however unlikely it now seems, like they might be in a movie or a play. This is called “pig butchering,” because the scam artists take their time fattening up their mark, establishing trust and feeding the victim information, promising bigger and better returns, whether they be financial or emotional. Slowly, the victim’s instincts are compromised by the prospect of romance or, in other cases, a return on their “investment.”
MetLife conducted a major study on the subject and found that women were nearly twice as likely as men to be victims of elder financial abuse. Most victims lived alone, which may point to the fact that lonely people are more likely to seek out a connection online. “In almost all of the cases, there existed a combination of tenuous, valued independence and observable vulnerability that merged in the lives of victims to optimize opportunities for abuse by every type of perpetrator,” the study concluded.
This may serve as a reminder to other people who find themselves on the brink of pressing “send.”",b85d34c9eadcb8b30d4389e5ee96d0d4,trafilatura

Despite reporting better-than-expected Q2 2025 adjusted EPS of $1.54 and total revenue of $20.8 billion, Wells Fargo shares fell 5.5% on Jul. 15 due to a downward revision in its 2025 net interest income (NII) guidance. The bank now expects NII to remain roughly flat at $47.7 billion, cutting its earlier forecast of 1% - 3% growth, citing lower interest income in its markets business and cautious borrower demand amid elevated interest rates.
Additionally, WFC stock has underperformed its rival, Citigroup Inc. (C). Citigroup stock has soared 37.2% on a YTD basis and 56.8% over the past 52 weeks.
Despite Wells Fargo’s underperformance relative to its industry peers, analysts remain moderately optimistic about its prospects. The stock has a consensus rating of “Moderate Buy” from 26 analysts' coverage, and the mean price target of $87.56 is a premium of 6.5% to current levels.

The Finnish state, which already owns 44.96% of Valmet Automotive through its investment company Finnish Industry Investment Ltd, did not say how much CATL was selling its stake for but said the government would also inject an additional 35 million euros ($40.97 million) of new capital into the car factory.
Valmet Automotive has previously made some cars for Porsche, Saab, Mercedes-Benz among other carmakers.
The Finnish government, in a statement, said the stake sale came amid ""a challenging market situation"" due to the ""slower-than-predicted pace of electrification"".
""The downturn in the European automobile industry has caused Valmet Automotive's order volumes to decrease in recent years,"" it said. CATL bought into Valmet Automotive in 2017.
Chinese electric vehicle (EV) makers, often backed by generous state support, have for years challenged traditional European and U.S. carmakers with cheaper, tech-savvy models.
After the CATL stake sale and the capital injection, the Finnish state will own a 79% stake in Valmet Automotive, while private investor group Pontos, an existing shareholder, will own 21%, the government said in a statement.
""In line with its strategy, Valmet Automotive is expanding its operations to new industrial sectors such as contract manufacturing for the defence industry,"" the government said.
While the European Union imposed tariffs on China-made EVs in 2024, industry lobbyists have urged the EU and national governments to bolster domestic players - especially as the sector grapples with a slowdown - to help even the playing field.
Under the arrangement announced on Monday, the state, Pontos and pension insurer Varma are also purchasing Valmet Automotive's shares in its subsidiary, battery maker Ioncor, giving the state a 70% stake in Ioncor through its investment company Finnish Minerals Group.
Ioncor, which employs around 1,000 people at its two battery plants in Finland and one in Germany, will seek to expand its operations to heavy-duty vehicles and machinery, Ioncor said in a separate statement.
In total, 120 million euros of state capital will be used for the financing arrangements, the government said.

President Donald Trump said India has offered to cut its tariff rates following the US imposition last week of 50% levies as punishment for its purchases of Russian oil.
“They have now offered to cut their Tariffs to nothing, but it’s getting late. They should have done so years ago,” Trump said in a Truth Social post Monday. It wasn’t clear when the offer was made, or whether the White House plans to reopen trade talks with India.
The new US tariffs doubled the existing 25% duty on Indian exports. The levies hit more than 55% of goods shipped to the US — India’s biggest market — and hurt labor-intensive industries like textiles and jewelry the most. Key exports like electronics and pharmaceuticals are exempt, sparing Apple Inc.’s massive new factory investments in India for now.
The tariffs have stunned Indian officials and follow months of trade talks between New Delhi and Washington. India was among the first countries to open trade talks with the Trump administration, but its own high tariffs and protectionist policies in sectors such as agriculture and dairy have frustrated US negotiators.
Trump’s latest post may signal that the US remains open to trade talks, according to Abhijit Das, a New Delhi-based expert in international trade policy. “This is his attempt to walk back on his earlier hardened stance on India,” he said.
India’s Ministry of External Affairs did not respond to a request for comment outside regular office hours and the White House didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The US Trade Representative’s Office also didn’t immediately respond.
A US trade team scheduled to visit India last month for a sixth round of talks deferred its trip, fueling concerns the negotiations may stall. The two countries continue to communicate on critical issues, including defense and foreign policy, and New Delhi has no immediate plans to retaliate against the high levies.
As part of its trade negotiations, India had expressed willingness to offer zero tariffs on industrial goods, such as auto components and pharmaceuticals, if the US reciprocated, Bloomberg News has reported earlier. Barriers on sectors like agriculture and dairy remained red lines India wouldn’t breach.",5ebb3d143c55d7b7f664fc3ffb068234,trafilatura

(NFLX), headquartered in Los Gatos, California, operates as a subscription streaming service and production company, offering entertainment services in approximately 190 countries. Valued at $513.4 billion by market cap, the company offers a wide range of TV series, documentaries, feature films, and games across different genres and languages.
Companies worth $200 billion or more are generally described as “mega-cap stocks,” and NFLX definitely fits that description, with its market cap exceeding this threshold, reflecting its substantial size, influence, and dominance in the entertainment industry. NFLX’s strong brand, extensive content library, and commitment to original productions, including award-winning films and series, set it apart from competitors. The platform has garnered critical acclaim, with its original productions winning an impressive 30 Emmy awards in 2024.

Despite its notable strength, NFLX slipped 9.9% from its 52-week high of $1,341.15, achieved on Jun. 30. Over the past three months, NFLX stock gained 2% underperforming the Nasdaq Composite’s ($NASX) 11.9% gains during the same time frame.
In the longer term, shares of NFLX rose 35.6% on a YTD basis and climbed 76.7% over the past 52 weeks, considerably outperforming NASX’s YTD gains of 11.1% and 22.2% returns over the last year.
To confirm the bullish trend, NFLX has been consistently trading above its 200-day moving average over the past year. However, the stock is trading below its 50-day moving average since late July, with slight fluctuations.
Netflix's outperformance is driven by strong membership growth, higher subscription prices, and rising ad revenues. The company's ad-supported offerings and AI-powered recommendations are key growth drivers, with expectations to double ad revenues in 2025.
On Jul. 17, NFLX reported its Q2 results, and its shares closed down more than 5% in the following trading session. Its EPS of $7.19 topped Wall Street expectations of $7.07. The company’s revenue was $11.08 billion, missing Wall Street forecasts of $11.09 billion. The company expects full-year revenue in the range of $44.8 billion to $45.2 billion.

However, I find it much easier to patiently own some stocks more than others.
You might think that stocks with high dividend yields wouldn't be in that group. After all, such dividends can often be unsustainable. That isn't always the case, though. Here are five high-yield stocks I plan on holding for the next 10 years or longer.
1. AbbVie
AbbVie(NYSE: ABBV) has proved that it's able to easily navigate one of the biggest challenges for a drugmaker: a patent cliff. The company's autoimmune-disease drug Humira once generated more than 60% of its total sales and ranked as the world's best-selling drug. But AbbVie hasn't skipped a beat since Humira lost U.S. patent exclusivity in 2023.
The company invested in research and development. It made smart acquisitions. Today, it's growing despite plunging sales for Humira. Although the big pharma company will face more patent expirations for other drugs in the future, I'm confident it will be able to survive and thrive over the long run.
I also have a warm and fuzzy feeling about the sustainability of AbbVie's dividend. The company is a Dividend King, with 53 consecutive years of dividend increases. Its payout has soared 310% since AbbVie was spun off from Abbott Labs in 2013 and now yields a healthy 3.16%.
2. Enbridge
Enbridge(NYSE: ENB) highlighted its ""low-risk, utility-like business profile"" to investors in its second-quarter update. That's the kind of business I can be comfortable owning part of for the next 10 years or longer.
By the way, Enbridge's management wasn't exaggerating. The company's pipelines transport 30% of all crude oil produced in North America and 20% of all natural gas consumed in the U.S. Enbridge is the largest natural gas utility in North America based on volume. It's investing in renewable energy. And the company projects roughly $50 billion in growth opportunities through the end of this decade.
Enbridge offers a forward dividend yield of 5.71%. While the stock isn't a Dividend King like AbbVie, the company has an impressive 30 consecutive years of dividend increases.
3. Enterprise Products Partners
Enterprise Products Partners(NYSE: EPD) has a lot in common with Enbridge. It's also a midstream energy leader, with over 50,000 miles of pipeline spanning the U.S. that transport natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs), crude oil, and other refined products.
Two key differences between Enterprise Products Partners and Enbridge stand out. First, it doesn't run a natural gas utility, as Enbridge does. Second, Enterprise is a limited partnership (LP) rather than a corporation. LPs come with some tax hassles, but I think the advantages of owning Enterprise are worth the extra work.
Notably, Enterprise Products Partners pays an especially juicy distribution that yields 6.82%. The LP has also increased its distribution for 27 consecutive years.
4. Realty Income
Realty Income(NYSE: O) listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange in 1994. Since then, the company has delivered a positive operational return (defined as the sum of annual adjusted funds from operations per share growth and dividend yield) every year.
I like that this real estate investment trust (REIT) has a highly diversified property portfolio, with 1,630 clients representing 91 industries. I like its triple-net-lease business model, which shifts most costs to tenants. I also like its growth opportunities, especially in Europe, where it faces only one major rival in a total addressable market of around $8.5 trillion.
And I love Realty Income's monthly dividend, which currently yields 5.55%. I also love that the company has increased its payout for 30 consecutive years.
5. Verizon Communications
Verizon Communications(NYSE: VZ) ranks as one of the world's largest wireless providers. The high costs associated with building out wireless networks present a formidable entry barrier for new competitors. Verizon already more than holds its own with current rivals, generating industry-leading wireless service revenue in its latest quarter.
Sure, this telecom stock's performance hasn't been great over the last five and 10 years. However, Verizon's business is humming along now. The company could also have a tremendous opportunity with 6G networks expected to roll out by the end of the decade.
I expect the dividend program will increase the chances that the stock delivers strong total returns. The dividend currently yields a mouthwatering 6.17%. Verizon has increased its dividend for 18 consecutive years, a streak that I think will soon be extended.

The consequences could impact most Americans' everyday lives: Economists worry that if Trump gets what he wants — a loyal Fed that sharply cuts short-term interest rates — the result would likely be higher inflation and, over time, higher borrowing costs for things like mortgages, car loans and business loans.
Trump on Monday sought to fire Lisa Cook, the first Black woman appointed to the Fed's seven-member governing board. It was the first time in the Fed's 112-year history that a president has tried to fire a governor.
Trump said he was doing so because of allegations raised by one of his appointees that she has committed mortgage fraud.
Cook has argued in a lawsuit seeking to block her firing that the claims are a pretext for Trump's true goal: Gaining more control over the Fed. A court may decide next week whether to temporarily block Cook’s firing while the case makes its way through the legal process.
Cook is accused of claiming two homes as primary residences in July 2021, before she joined the board, which could have led to a lower mortgage rate than if one had been classified as a second home or an investment property. She has suggested in her lawsuit that it may have been a clerical error but hasn’t directly responded to the accusations.
Fed independence ‘hangs by a thread’
Trump and members of his administration have made no secret about their desire to exert more control over the Fed. Trump has repeatedly demanded that the central bank cut its key rate to as low as 1.3%, from its current level of 4.3%.
Before trying to fire Cook, Trump repeatedly attacked the Fed’s chair, Jerome Powell, for not cutting the short-term interest rate and threatened to fire him as well.
“We’ll have a majority very shortly, so that’ll be good,” Trump said Tuesday, a reference to the fact that if he is able to replace Cook, his appointees will control the Fed's board by a 4-3 vote.
“The particular case of Governor Cook is not as important as what this latest move shows about the escalation in the assaults on the Fed,” said Jon Faust, an economist at Johns Hopkins and former adviser to Powell. “In my view, Fed independence really now hangs by a thread.”
Some economists do think the Fed should cut more quickly, though virtually none agree with Trump that it should do so by 3 percentage points. Powell has signaled the Fed is likely to cut by a quarter point in September.
Why economists prefer independent central banks
The Fed wields extensive power over the U.S. economy. By cutting the short-term interest rate it controls — which it typically does when the economy falters — the Fed can make borrowing cheaper and encourage more spending, growth, and hiring. When it raises the rate to combat the higher prices that come with inflation, it can weaken the economy and cause job losses.
Most economists have long preferred independent central banks because they can take unpopular steps that elected officials are more likely to avoid. Economic research has shown that nations with independent central banks typically have lower inflation over time.
Elected officials like Trump, however, have much greater incentives to push for lower interest rates, which make it easier for Americans to buy homes and cars and would boost the economy in the short run.
A political Fed could boost inflation
Douglas Elmendorf, an economist at Harvard and former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, said that Trump's demand for the Fed to cut its key rate by 3 percentage points would overstimulate the economy, lifting consumer demand above what the economy can produce and boosting inflation — similar to what happened during the pandemic.
“If the Federal Reserve falls under control of the president, then we’ll end up with higher inflation in this country probably for years to come,” Elmendorf said.
And while the Fed controls a short-term rate, financial markets determine longer-term borrowing costs for mortgages and other loans. And if investors worry that inflation will stay high, they will demand higher yields on government bonds, pushing up borrowing costs across the economy.
In Turkey, for example, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan forced the central bank to keep interest rates low in the early 2020s, even as inflation spiked to 85%. In 2023, Erdogan allowed the central bank more independence, which has helped bring down inflation, but short-term interest rates rose to 50% to fight inflation, and are still 46%.
Other U.S. presidents have badgered the Fed. President Lyndon Johnson harassed then-Fed Chair William McChesney Martin in the mid-1960s to keep rates low as Johnson ramped up government spending on the Vietnam War and antipoverty programs. And Richard Nixon pressured then-Chair Arthur Burns to avoid rate hikes in the run-up to the 1972 election. Both episodes are widely blamed for leading to the stubbornly high inflation of the 1960s and '70s.
Trump has also argued that the Fed should lower its rate to make it easier for the federal government to finance its tremendous $37 trillion debt load. Yet that threatens to distract the Fed from its congressional mandates of keeping inflation and unemployment low.
Independence vs accountability
Presidents do have some influence over the Fed through their ability to appoint members of the board, subject to Senate approval. But the Fed was created to be insulated from short-term political pressures. Fed governors are appointed to staggered, 14-year terms to ensure that no single president can appoint too many.
Jane Manners, a law professor at Fordham University, said there is a reason that Congress decided to create independent agencies like the Fed: They preferred “decisions that are made from a kind of objective, neutral vantage point grounded in expertise rather than decisions are that are wholly subject to political pressure.”
Yet some Trump administration officials say they want more democratic accountability at the Fed.
In an interview with USA Today Vice President JD Vance said, “What people who are saying the president has no authority here are effectively saying is that seven economists and lawyers should be able to make an incredibly critical decision for the American people with no democratic input.”
And Stephen Miran, a top White House economic adviser, wrote a paper last year advocating for a restructuring of the Fed, including making it much easier for a president to fire governors.
The “overall goal of this design is delivering the economic benefits” of an independent central bank, Miran wrote, “while maintaining a level of accountability that a democratic society must demand."" Trump has nominated Miran to the Fed's board to replace Adriana Kugler, who stepped down unexpectedly Aug. 1.
There could be more turmoil ahead
Trump has personally insulted Powell for months, but his administration now appears much more focused on the Fed’s broader structure.
The Fed makes its interest rate decisions through a committee that consists of the seven governors, including Powell, as well as the 12 presidents of regional Fed banks in cities such as New York, Kansas City, and Atlanta. Five of those presidents vote on rates at each meeting. The New York Fed president has a permanent vote, while four others vote on a rotating basis.
While the reserve banks' boards choose their presidents, the Fed board in Washington can vote to reject them. All 12 presidents will need to be reappointed and approved by the board in February, which could become more contentious if the board votes down one or more of the 12 presidents.
“The nuclear scenario is ... the reappointment of the reserve bank presidents and interfering with that, (which) would be the signal that things are truly going off the rails,"" said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",91ad66aa31c070c948cdf0d7d52ced08,trafilatura

America is about to experience a retirement tidal wave.
According to an article from Empower's publication The Currency, an estimated record 4.1 million Americans turned 65 this year.
However, some older Americans are hoping to retire even earlier than 65. But with the cost of living on the rise, they may be asking themselves whether that’s possible.
According to RetireGuide, the average annual retirement income for Americans 65 and up in 2023 was $83,085 when adjusted for inflation. Should you live for another 30 years, that means you’ll need $2,492,550.
While the average net worth for people over 65 is only around $1.6 million, Americans in their 60s spend about 18% more monthly on average than the general population, according to the Empower figures.
Before you panic, let’s look at three tips you can use to help guide your retirement decision.
The 4% rule
Many financial advisors recommend that retirees live by the rule of thumb of taking out 4% of your savings each year. This is the amount you can withdraw no matter what and hypothetically still have your retirement savings last another 30 years.
The main question here is whether this will offer you enough income, when combined with Social Security, pension, and all the rest. If you have $500,000, that would only be $20,000 per year. However, if you have $2 million, that would be $80,000.
That’s why, no matter what your 4% adds up to, you want to make sure you’re taking every measure to stretch it out. A Roth IRA account can help you in this regard — helping you build tax–free retirement savings.
Consulting a financial advisor specializing in retirement planning can help you open a new account or make the most of your current Roth IRA account.
You can then set up a free initial consultation with your preferred advisor to further assess if it's the right fit for you — with no obligation to hire.
While most would-be retirees have IRAs for savings, you may not know that you can invest your retirement savings in commodities through your IRA, including gold.
Many investors are attracted by gold’s stability relative to the stock market. For example, while the market crashed in 2008, gold prices rose, cushioning the portfolios of investors who were savvy enough to diversify.
With the help of Thor Metals, you can open a gold IRA that seamlessly integrates into your investment strategy. Similar to an automated savings platform, Thor Metals makes it easy to schedule regular contributions and manage your gold investments efficiently.
To learn more, you can get a free information guide that includes details on how to get up to $20,000 in free metals on qualifying purchases.
Get some guidance
It’s easy to get overwhelmed when it comes to retirement planning, but remember that you don’t have to make these big decisions on your own — consulting with a financial professional can provide important insight into the best steps to take next in all aspects of your life and finances.
Finding a financial advisor that suits your specific needs and financial goals is simple with Vanguard.
Vanguard’s hybrid advisory system combines advice from professional advisers and automated portfolio management to make sure your investments are working to achieve your financial goals.
With a minimum portfolio size of $50,000, this service is best for clients who already have a nest egg built and would like to try to grow their wealth with a variety of different investments. All you have to do is set up a consultation with a Vanguard advisor, and they will help you set a tailored plan and stick to it.
A recent survey by Northwestern Mutual found that Americans believe they need $1.25 million to retire comfortably today and continue receiving income for the next 20 years.
While $1.25 million isn’t realistic for everyone, it’s still a great idea to create a retirement goal based on the advice of your financial advisor and a budget.
Don’t overlook simple savings vehicles, especially as a way to keep growing your money after your retirement. One of the easiest ways to save is to take advantage of the higher rates on certificates of deposit.
Of course, your retirement years will entail a number of expenses, and essential purchases are inevitable. But you can make the most out of them by downloading the Acorns app.
With Acorns, when you spend money, the app automatically rounds up the total cost to the nearest dollar and invests the remainder in a diversified portfolio — so even when you have to spend, you're investing money at the same time.
For those looking to enhance their investing strategy, Acorns offers tiered memberships, including a gold tier that allows you to customize your portfolio by adding individual stocks, and a retirement account with a 3% IRA match.
This last rule of thumb deals with the tax implications of retiring early. While some potential retirees will have plenty of savings, it won’t be beneficial to retire early if you end up paying normal income tax. This is the case for those retiring after 55.
Usually, you’d face a 10% tax withdrawal penalty for making a withdrawal from a tax-qualified retirement plan like a 401(k). But for workers who have an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan, the IRS allows anyone over the age of 55 who decides to leave the workforce to start drawing penalty-free distributions from that plan.",403674db51a5309ddcae8bcb445b988d,trafilatura

Colin says he earns $500,000 a year from a company he helped build that brings in roughly $3 million annually. But despite the healthy income, his mental and emotional well-being has suffered. As he explained, his relationship with his co-owners has deteriorated.

“There are no regular meetings, no formal policies and very little collaboration between owners,” Colin said in a letter read by co-host Ken Coleman. “Most decisions are made by a gentleman’s agreement. When I raise concerns, I’m told, ‘Don’t rock the boat.’”
The lack of structure, combined with what Colin describes as persistent disrespect from his partners, has made him question whether the financial benefits are worth the toll. While his only significant debt is a $350,000 mortgage — which he could pay off if the other owners bought out his shares — Colin is wrestling with whether leaving would be the right move.
Ramsey's two reasons to get out now
For host Dave Ramsey, Colin’s decision comes down to two factors: personal well-being and business viability. And on both counts, the host says the verdict is clear — it’s time to leave.
1. He's miserable — and that's reason enough
Colin’s declining mental and emotional state, by itself, may be sufficient reason to walk away.
“You’re miserable and you’re done,” Ramsey said.
Toxic work environments can lead to low self-esteem, stress and a poor quality of life. Even a $500,000 yearly income may not be enough to offset the personal costs of staying in a situation that’s draining and intolerable.
2. The business seems destined to fail
Beyond Colin’s personal well-being, Ramsey senses deeper structural issues that make staying even riskier.
“The misbehavior of the business operations are going to cause the failure of the business,” he warned. “You’re going to ride the horse till it dies — and it’s going to die.”
The lack of structured policies, regular meetings and collaborative decision-making, Ramsey argued, points to serious operational dysfunction.",c8fabf24d00c03da7fa711175d75a42b,trafilatura

CNBC’s “Mad Money” host Jim Cramer has even compared the stock to defense technology supergiant Palantir Technologies (PLTR), calling it the “Palantir of Hardware.”
Cramer believes this high-flying stock could become a powerful long-term wealth creator, much like Palantir.
But more recently, shares have stalled in their rally, down nearly 10% over the past month. What should you do with AeroVironment now?
About AeroVironment Stock
Founded in 1971 and headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, AeroVironment specializes in unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), tactical missile systems, and robotic technologies. The company is a well-established name in the aerospace industry, designing and developing advanced solutions for both military and commercial applications.
AeroVironment’s Raven, Puma, and Wasp series of products are widely used by defense forces worldwide. The company’s focus has always been on small, versatile, and efficient systems that deliver cutting-edge technologies for surveillance, reconnaissance, and payload delivery.
With a market capitalization of approximately $12.4 billion, AeroVironment remains a solid performer on Wall Street despite its latest selloff. The stock has gained 25% over the past 52 weeks. This year, the stock has increased by 60%. It reached a 52-week high of $295.90 in June, but is down 18% from this high.
High-flying stocks like AeroVironment often command premium valuations, and this one’s no exception. Trading at a steep 76.6 times forward earnings, the stock is priced far above the sector median of 23x.
AeroVironment Soars After Q4 Earnings Results
Following AeroVironment’s knockout fourth quarter results, released on June 24, which sailed past both Wall Street’s top and bottom line forecasts, the stock took off almost 21.6% in the very next trading session as investors cheered the strong finish to fiscal 2025. The company reported record quarterly revenue of $275.1 million, indicating a 40% year-over-year (YOY) growth. This is also higher than the $242 million figure expected by Wall Street analysts.
For the fiscal year, AeroVironment reported record bookings of $1.2 billion, which creates a sound pipeline for generating future revenue. Management pointed out investments in its multi-generational Uncrewed Systems and Loitering Munition Systems products as a reason for this gain.
As of Apr. 30, the company also reported a solid backlog of $726.6 million, as compared to $400.2 million as of the prior-year’s period. Funded backlog is defined as remaining performance obligations for which funding has been or is currently appropriated under a customer contract.
On this top line, AeroVironment reported solid quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $61.6 million, nearly triple the amount it was a year ago. It generated an adjusted EPS of $1.61, representing a whopping 274% YOY increase. The reported EPS also surpassed analysts’ consensus estimate of $1.38.
For fiscal year 2026, the company expects revenue in the range of $1.9 billion to $2 billion, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $300 million to $320 million, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.80 to $3. The forecast figures also take into account the impact of AeroVironment’s acquisition of BlueHalo, LLC. The new entity, created after this transaction, is called AV. Its offerings include autonomous uncrewed systems, precision strike, and defensive systems.
Other factors include multiple contracts that the company has signed with the defense forces of various countries, as well as a series of product launches, including the Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-UAS) technology Titan 4 and tactical autonomy-focused UAS Red Dragon.
What Do Analysts Think About AeroVironment Stock?
Analysts are particularly keen on AeroVironment stock, assigning it a consensus rating of “Strong Buy.” Of the 13 analysts rating the stock, 11 have assigned it a “Strong Buy” rating and two recommend a “Moderate Buy” rating. The consensus price target of $297.33 represents 23% upside potential. The Street-high price target of $335 implies nearly 40% upside.
Key Takeaways
AeroVironment’s recent growth has been promising, earning the company the support of Wall Street analysts. While the company has a long way to go before it becomes as prominent as Palantir in its own field, AeroVironment might be a solid investment choice now, as the bullish case shows that the stock still has room to grow. Moreover, the company has touted its ability to be useful for President Donald Trump’s “Golden Dome” missile defense system project. This $175 billion project is expected to be operational in approximately three years.

In February 2025, the company completed its initial public offering (IPO) and quickly began displaying record revenues, accelerating margins, and a string of program wins, which put the stock on investors’ radars.
Since it began trading in February, Karman stock has soared 140% from its $22 IPO price, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 Index ($SPX).

Karman designs, tests, manufactures, and sells highly engineered subsystems for a variety of defense and space programs. Karman’s portfolio includes three distinct yet complementary end markets: hypersonics and strategic missile defense, space and launch, and tactical missiles and integrated defense systems (IDS).
Strong Momentum Since IPO
Karman has gained significant momentum since its IPO. The company is capitalizing on the growing demand for advanced missile defense, hypersonic and tactical systems, and space launch infrastructure. CEO Anthony Koblinski stated in the earnings call that in just two quarters as a public entity, Karman has set back-to-back records and secured its independence via a secondary offering. Furthermore, it has strengthened its strategic position through acquisitions and index inclusions.
In the second quarter, revenue of $115.1 million increased by 35% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA rose 29% to $35.3 million. Adjusted earnings of $0.10 per diluted share more than tripled over the previous year. Funded backlog stood at $719 million.
In the quarter, Hypersonics and Strategic Missile Defense revenue grew 22% to $35 million, boosted by programs such as the next-generation interceptor and classified contracts. Space & Launch increased 39% to $39.6 million, riding a wave of increased launch activity across both commercial and government programs. Meanwhile, Tactical Missiles & IDS increased 46% to $40.5 million, driven by production ramps in unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and counter-UAS programs. This balanced growth across all three segments shows that Karman is not overly reliant on any one segment, positioning the company for long-term, diversified growth.",dcfc3edfae5ce00e0c92595b14e749ad,trafilatura

Lululemon Athletica(NASDAQ: LULU) and Cava Group(NYSE: CAVA) are trading 60% off their previous highs, but analysts on Wall Street see value. The average price target for these stocks is at least 33% above where they currently trade.
Here's why they are down and might be worth buying ahead of a potential rebound in 2026.
1. Lululemon Athletica
Lululemon Athletica has been a growing brand in the athletic wear market for two decades, but the company is struggling with slowing sales growth and higher costs from tariffs. The stock trades well below its 52-week high of $423.
After three years of higher grocery prices and mortgage rates, consumers are pulling back on discretionary spending. This is not specific to Lululemon, but a lot of consumer brands are taking a hit. Starbucks and Nike have experienced sales pressure over the last year. After growing revenues by double-digit rates a year ago, the headwinds have finally caught up to Lululemon with sales up just 7% year over year in the most recent quarter.
Tariffs have compounded the company's challenges, yet despite this, the company expects revenue growth to remain stable next quarter, rising between 7% to 8% year over year. It also expects full-year earnings per share to come in between $14.58 to $14.78.
Apparel is highly competitive, yet that hasn't prevented Lululemon from building a strong brand over the last 20 years. It's one of the most profitable apparel brands, generating $1.8 billion in profit on $10.8 billion of revenue over the last year, which is an above-average margin of 17%.
Analysts on Wall Street have an average price target of $273 on the shares, representing upside of 33%. The stock does appear undervalued at these levels. Using management's full-year guidance, the shares trade at 14 times forward earnings. This is the lowest valuation the stock has traded in years. Just two years ago, investors were paying around 30 times earnings to own a piece of Lululemon's future growth.
Obviously, sentiment around the consumer goods space will dictate when the stock rebounds. But there is a catalyst that may be coming in the form of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve that could provide some relief for consumers and potentially put Lululemon and other discounted retail stocks on a path of recovery over the next year or so.
2. Cava Group
Cava stock rocketed to a high of $172 last year before falling to its current $68 share price. A combination of an extremely high valuation on the stock entering 2025 combined with weak consumer spending trends magnified the stock's recent slide.
Cava is capturing a big opportunity. It is meeting demand for a Mediterranean-based restaurant concept in the fast-casual market. It is still growing at robust rates, with total revenue up 20% year over year in the most recent quarter. But slowing customer traffic, where same-restaurant sales growth slowed to 2.1% year over year, has sent the stock lower.
However, one silver lining in the recent quarterly financial report suggests sales growth could already be in the process of picking up again. Management indicated that same-restaurant sales were reaccelerating toward the end of the last quarter and beginning of the current quarter.
Cava is still investing in a huge market for Mediterranean food. It opened a net 16 new restaurants last quarter. Management still sees room for 1,000 restaurants by 2032, which would more than double its locations from the current 398.
The stock could be bottoming out, as analysts' average price target is currently $92, implying upside of 36%. The stock looks expensive at a forward P/E topping 120 at the time of writing. This is based on the Wall Street consensus earnings estimate of $0.56 for this year. But Cava is a highly profitable restaurant business. As it continues to open new locations and achieve greater scale, analysts expect Cava's earnings to nearly triple over the next four years to $1.57.
From a price-to-sales (P/S) valuation perspective, Cava is more reasonably priced. The stock traded around 15 times sales at the start of the year but now trades at a 7.5x multiple. That's still a rich valuation for a restaurant stock, but it's justified considering Cava is still in the early innings of its nationwide expansion and is already producing a healthy profit for a restaurant business.
The lower valuation and continued execution toward its long-term strategy raise the odds of a rebound next year. If the stock continues to trade at the current P/S multiple and meets next year's consensus revenue estimate for $1.4 billion, the stock would rise 36%.

Amazon has multiple moats and paths to grow.
-
Vertex Pharmaceuticals' new products and pipeline candidates should help its stock rebound strongly.
Thousands of stocks trade on U.S. stock exchanges. Even more trade off-the-counter. Many of them are good picks for investors.
This makes identifying favorites exceptionally difficult. But I've taken a stab at doing just that. Although the selection process wasn't easy, here are my two favorite stocks to buy right now.
1. Amazon
Legendary investor Peter Lynch promoted the idea of buying what you know. I probably know Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) as well as any other company around. I've used its products and services multiple times in just the last 24 hours.
However, Amazon isn't one of my favorite stocks to buy right now solely because of my familiarity with its business. I believe the company has several strong moats that help it fend off competition, along with multiple ways to grow.
Those moats include cost advantages with Amazon's e-commerce platform, operational scale, and network effects. The last one on the list is especially impressive with Amazon. The more people who shop online and the more vendors who offer their products for sale using the company's platform, the more valuable the platform becomes.
Amazon's e-commerce still has plenty of room to grow. CEO Andy Jassy noted in the company's October 2024 quarterly update that Amazon's share of the global retail market is only around 1%. Between 80% and 85% of retail sales still occur in physical stores. Jassy predicts that e-commerce will capture a much larger share of the retail market over the next 10 to 20 years. I think he's right.
But e-commerce probably won't be Amazon's primary growth driver. That honor belongs to Amazon Web Services (AWS), which currently ranks as the No. 1 cloud services provider. AWS is likely to be one of the biggest winners from advances in artificial intelligence (AI) over the next decade and beyond.
Amazon has other growth opportunities, too. The company has expanded into healthcare. It's planning to launch a satellite internet service later this year using its Project Kuiper satellite network. Amazon's Zoox subsidiary is positioned to be one of the top players in a U.S. robotaxi market that one market researcher projects will grow by a compound annual growth rate of 74.6% through 2030.
2. Vertex Pharmaceuticals
Some might be surprised to see Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) as one of my two favorite stocks to buy right now. The drugmaker has experienced two setbacks recently. It's throwing in the towel on VX-993 after the experimental pain medication failed to meet the primary endpoint in a phase 2 clinical study. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also told Vertex that it doesn't see a path forward for obtaining a broad peripheral neuropathic pain label for suzetrigine at this point.",08aa838e8ac2058f5641e4ed43bcc6a0,trafilatura

But his parents just informed him that they had taken out a parent PLUS loan to help pay for his college tuition — a loan he wasn’t aware of — and now they want him to pay them back.
“I literally didn’t know it existed,” he told the hosts of The Ramsey Show. He had paid for college through grants, federal financial aid and a loan of $15,000, which he has paid off.
But, apparently, his parents also took out a parent PLUS loan of $13,000, which they only made minimum payments on, so with interest the loan now totals around $17,000.
“This is not morally right what your parents are asking you to do. It’s maddening and it’s frustrating,” said Dave Ramsey. Here’s what he advised James to do.
The dilemma
Direct PLUS loans are available from the federal government for parents and graduate or professional students to help cover educational expenses.
When parents borrow for their child’s education, it’s commonly referred to as a parent PLUS loan, which is designed to cover the funding gap between the cost of tuition and the amount of federal student aid a student receives.
Since the parent PLUS loan is in his parents’ name, “legally it’s their responsibility,” said co-host George Kamel. The issue is more about what James should do from a moral or ethical standpoint.
James and his wife make a combined $305,000 a year. They’ve built up an emergency fund of $30,000 and their only debt is a car loan, which will be paid off in less than a year. While they could have paid off the car in cash, they didn’t want to dip into their emergency fund.
Ramsey said James should commit to getting control of his money. That starts by paying off his car immediately. “And, I probably given the disparity in income, the fact that you guys make this much money, I’m probably going to reach over there and just pay that other loan off,” he said. From there, they can start saving to replenish their emergency fund.
But, he added, it’s “completely fair” if James chooses not to pay his parents back.
“It’s not fair that you come up to someone a decade later, tell them something that they didn’t even know existed, that they did not agree to, and ask them to pay something from a decade earlier,” said Ramsey. “That’s ridiculous.”
He said James has a right to be angry about it and so does his wife, who’s been unwittingly dragged into the situation.
By taking control of his finances, James could clean up his parents’ student loan debt in two months — either paying back his parents or, better yet, applying that money directly to the loan, said Kamel.
With an annual household income of more than $300K, “you can clean this debt up and savor the relationship with your parents or you can let it crush the relationship because people are petty,” he said.
Parent PLUS loans are “a cancer on relationships,” said Kamel.
Parents end up paying a higher interest rate than a normal loan “for the pleasure of your kid going to college,” he said, and then they struggle to pay it back. “This is the story we hear time and time again.”
If you’re borrowing money to pay for your child’s education, it’s important to know what you’re getting into.
As of July 1, 2025, the interest rate on a new Direct PLUS loan is 8.94%, which is the fixed rate for the life of the loan. That can add up — in the case of James’ parents, their minimum loan payments have resulted in an extra $4,000 in interest on top of the original loan.
While there’s the potential for loan forgiveness, hoping for debt forgiveness is not a financial strategy when it comes to debt repayment.
Other options include taking out a private loan, which may offer higher loan limits and lower interest rates. It’s also possible to borrow from your 401(k), but most experts don’t recommend this as it could impact your retirement. It’s well worth a chat with your financial advisor about your options and what makes the most sense for your situation.
Starting early — while your child is still actually a child — means you can avoid taking out a loan in the first place. For example, you can set aside money in an Education Savings Account (ESA), which allows you to invest up to $2,000 in after-tax dollars per child, per year, and it grows tax-free.
“The distributions are tax-free to the extent the amount of the distributions doesn't exceed the beneficiary's qualified education expenses,” says the IRS. “If a distribution exceeds the beneficiary's qualified education expenses, a portion of the earnings is taxable to the beneficiary.”
This can supplement a 529 plan, which allows you to save more than $2,000 a year, but Kamel warns that some plans aren’t any good.
“I wouldn’t use a prepaid 529 plan that freezes your tuition savings rate or automatically changes your investments based on the age of your child. Stay away from so-called ‘fixed’ or ‘life phase’ plans too,” he writes in a blog for Ramsey Solutions.
But, if you do take out a parent PLUS loan and expect your child to be partially or fully responsible for paying it back, that should be clear from the outset. This involves setting expectations with your child about who will be responsible for what — before ever taking out the loan.
It could also involve a discussion of how interest works and why it’s important to make regular payments.
In James’s case, his parents never actually told him about the loan so, as Ramsey pointed out, he’d be well within his right to walk away. But since it’s a relatively small amount of money, and James can afford it, Ramsey said he might want to “just write a check today just to get rid of it.”",e4fee7c900fe7295bb619ff9c6dbfd3c,trafilatura

More of Hong Kong's small and medium-sized property developers will face default risks, market experts said, adding that they hoped the government would provide more capital support as banks remained cautious about issuing new loans.
""There is no white knight in the market, so investors and companies that are in financial distress have to self-rescue,"" said Glen Ho, national turnaround and restructuring leader at consulting firm Deloitte.
""The market is very rigid, lacking new capital, as banks are reluctant to grant new loans,"" he said.

The multi-year price slump in the city's commercial real estate sector, which has caused considerable financial strain for developers, has raised concerns among banks over growing non-performing loan (NPL) ratios.
Hang Seng Bank saw its NPL ratio rise to 6.69 per cent in the first half from 6.12 per cent at the end of December, according to its latest financial results. Expected credit losses rose by 48.5 per cent to HK$4.9 billion during the period due to ""higher charges for Hong Kong commercial real estate exposures"".
Joseph Tsang, the chairman of JLL Hong Kong, said banks that are cautious about lending create problems for the real estate market.
""Even if someone is willing to purchase the distressed assets, no one is willing to lend new money,"" he said. ""Potential buyers need to buy with cash or at high rates.""
""We hope that the government can pay attention to this issue by lowering the loan-to-deposit ratio and reducing the reserve requirement ratio to allow banks to release more liquidity.""

Experts said in the short term, lower interest rates will not solve all developers' problems because declines in commercial capital values cannot be resolved quickly.
""For small and medium-sized developers, I can't say if the worst has come but we haven't seen any substantial improvement, [so] the situation will persist and we will see more of them facing loan default risks,"" said Deloitte's Ho.
Hong Kong property developers had more than US$18.8 billion in club and syndicated loans due by the end of 2026, according to data compiled by the London Stock Exchange Group.
Earlier in August, Road King Infrastructure suspended US$22.6 million in interest payments and said it would defer distributions of US$56.5 million in perpetual securities, making it the first Hong Kong-based developer to default on bond payments since China's property crisis began in 2021.
In July, Hong Kong developer Grand Ming Group avoided risking default by obtaining waivers from its lenders for outstanding loans totalling HK$4.8 billion (US$611.5 million). Emperor International Holdings, the conglomerate's listed property business, said in June that it had more than HK$16.6 billion in overdue loans as of March 31.
Cash-strapped owners are facing mounting pressure from banks, forcing them to offload assets. Transactions have hit record lows this year, JLL's Tsang said.
""This trend shows no signs of ending but will persist at least in 2025,"" he added.
Prime office capital and rental values have fallen to levels not seen since 2010, according to the latest data from JLL. Prices have plummeted by about 50 per cent, while high street shops have endured even more pain.
The Law Society of Hong Kong recently bought an entire floor of offices in what was once the world's most expensive tower at a 50 per cent discount.
The Law Society paid HK$345 million, or HK$14,000 per sq ft, for 24,980 sq ft (2,320 square metres) on the 26th floor of The Center from Gale Well Group. In 2021, Gale Well paid HK$693 million for the asset.
""The market will not return to the past levels and people need to face the reality,"" Ho said, adding that the correction was not necessarily negative as it created opportunities.
Last week, FWD Hong Kong signed a decade-long lease for 330,000 sq ft of office space in Taikoo Place, the largest office rental deal in the city this year. The company was adding four and a half floors in Devon House to accommodate its growth.
The expansion would make FWD the largest office tenant in Taikoo Place, a complex of 10 prime office towers. Devon House will be renamed FWD Tower next year.
Office-leasing activity in Hong Kong rose for a fourth straight month in July, chipping away at the elevated vacancy rates that continue to weigh on rents, according to JLL. However, grade A office rents continued to fall, declining 0.5 per cent in July from a month earlier despite the improved leasing activity.",dc5dfa657c2c748496618139d1c2745b,trafilatura

Still, there are only a handful of companies within striking distance, as only 19 companies worldwide have a market cap of $500 billion or greater.
One of the most promising companies in this group is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), which has a market cap of $1.2 trillion.
I think TSMC is slated to become a $2 trillion company within a few short years, thanks to its position in an important industry. Although it has delivered impressive shareholder returns over the past few years, I think it's slated for even more as it pursues a $2 trillion valuation.
Taiwan Semiconductor's new technology will keep it at the top
TSMC is a chip fabricator that offers its capabilities to some of the most important tech companies in the world. Companies like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) utilize TSMC's production capabilities, as they design the chips in-house and then send them to TSMC to be produced.
As companies like Apple and Nvidia push to have more secure supply chains, TSMC's $165 billion investment in its Arizona production facility makes it an even more attractive partner. Demand for U.S.-produced chips has been overwhelming, and production capacities at the Arizona facility that's currently operational have reportedly sold out through 2027.
With Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) chip foundry business struggling and TSMC's booming, it's clear which company has become the preferred partner for many of the leading tech companies.
Another factor in TSMC's success is its drive to continuously push the edge of what's possible. Although Taiwan Semiconductor has the best possible technology in the world with 3 nanometer (nm) chips, it's pursuing a 2nm chip that is slated for launch later this year. This chip node is seeing massive pre-production demand, as it will consume 25% to 30% less power when configured at the same speed as a 3nm chip.
This is a big deal, as it helps energy-intensive artificial intelligence (AI) workloads become more efficient as TSMC's 2nm chips roll out. Beyond that, it's working on the A16 and A14 chips that also improve energy consumption.
TSMC has cemented itself at the center of all cutting-edge technology, which will allow it to succeed as AI demand rises and falls, and a different technology boom takes its place (such as self-driving cars). Despite all of its success and its lucrative market position, Taiwan Semiconductor's stock doesn't get a ton of respect.
TSMC doesn't trade at a massive premium like its peers
TSMC's revenue grew at a 44% pace in U.S. dollars during Q2. That's a speed that few companies outside of Nvidia can match, yet TSMC trades at a fairly low price tag.
At 23.9 times forward earnings, Taiwan Semiconductor trades at basically the same price as the broader market, as measured by the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). The S&P 500 trades for 23.7 times forward earnings, so despite TSMC's rapid growth rate, it doesn't have a premium valuation.
Management is quite bullish on its long-term outlook. For the next five years starting in 2025, it believes its AI-related chip revenue will rise at a 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and overall revenue will increase at nearly 20%. That's monstrous growth, and shows that 2025 will not be the end of heightened chip demand.
Investors already know that many of the AI hyperscalers are going to be increasing their data center capital expenditures during 2026. These buildouts take several years, so it's clear that overall demand for AI computing capacity is still increasing. This is a multiyear growth driver for TSMC, and will be one of the primary reasons why the company eventually reaches a $2 trillion market cap.

Exxon Mobil stock traded sideways for years.
-
The past five years, however, Exxon stock crushed the S&P 500.
For years, ExxonMobil Corp (NYSE: XOM) was stuck in limbo. In 2007, for instance, Exxon stock traded at roughly $85 per share. In 2016, nearly a decade later, shares still traded at roughly $85 per share.
The past five years, however, have been very different. Exxon shareholders have crushed the market. You may be surprised to learn just how much a $1,000 investment would have become since the summer of 2020.
ExxonMobil shareholders are very happy about the last 5 years
As one of the largest oil stocks in the world, Exxon is heavily dependent on the prevailing price of oil. Five years ago arguably marks the nadir of the oil price collapse that occurred due to uncertainty surrounding the ongoing global pandemic. In April of 2020, oil prices fell as low as $20 per barrel! By August of that year, prices had already rebounded to around $40 per barrel, but that was still one-third below pre-pandemic levels.
Today, oil prices hover just above $60 per barrel due to rising costs and geopolitical tensions. Today's price level is roughly 50% higher than it was five years ago, but Exxon's stock price has risen significantly more.
If you had invested $1,000 into Exxon stock in August 2020, you'd have around $3,460 today. That figure includes dividend income -- an important consideration given Exxon currently pays a dividend yield of 3.5%. Over the same time period, a $1,000 investment in the S&P 500 would have grown into just $2,000.
Much of this outperformance stems from Exxon's continued investments throughout the last bear market. With greater access to capital, the company was able to invest at rock bottom prices, highlighting the company's capital advantage and savvy leadership. Exxon's CEO called these strategic moves ""counter-cyclical investments"" -- an appropriate term for a business that can deploy capital at every stage of a cyclical industry.

The S&P 500 has long been the stock market's most followed and important index. Tracking 500 of the largest American companies on the market, it's often used to gauge the health of the U.S. economy and market. After the index declined by over 19% in 2022, it has experienced a bull run, with its levels increasing by over 68% since the start of 2023. That's the good news.
The ""we should keep an eye on that"" news is that now the S&P 500 is trading at historically high levels. Based on its Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio -- which measures stock prices against inflation-adjusted average earnings over the past 10 years -- the S&P 500 is trading at levels we haven't seen in quite some time. And unfortunately, anytime the index has reached these levels, sharp declines soon followed.
For investors interested in investing in the S&P 500, its extremely high valuation may be alarming. However, there is another way to invest in the index that could possibly hedge against a sudden pullback. And that's via an S&P 500 equal-weight ETF like the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF(NYSEMKT: RSP).
The difference between the standard S&P 500 and equal-weight S&P 500
The standard S&P 500 is weighted by market cap, so larger companies account for more of the index than smaller companies. In the equal-weight S&P 500, each company accounts for roughly the same amount.
Historically, being weighted by market hasn't been an issue for the S&P 500, but as megacap tech stocks have exploded in valuation over the past couple of years, a handful of companies are now worth a large portion of the index. The Magnificent Seven stocks -- Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla -- now account for over a third of the index. In the equal-weight S&P 500, they only account for 2.18%.
The high concentration in a handful of tech stocks has worked out well for the S&P 500, given the artificial intelligence (AI)-fueled run they have been on; however, as the saying goes, ""the same thing that makes you laugh, makes you cry."" Pullbacks in these stocks, or the tech sector as a whole, will significantly weigh down the index.
Here is how the top 10 holdings of the standard S&P 500 compare between the two:
Sources: Vanguard and Invesco. Vanguard percentages as of July 31. Invesco percentages as of Aug. 26.
Going with the equal-weight ETF doesn't mean sacrificing returns
Over the past decade, the S&P 500 has outperformed the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, rising 233% compared to its 153%. However, since the ETF hit the market in April 2003, the roles have switched, and the ETF has outperformed.
Past results don't guarantee future performance, but it's worth noting that the ETF tends to outperform the market during periods when the broader market is rallying, the early stages of market recoveries, or periods when smaller companies and more value-based stocks are outperforming megacap tech stocks.
With the S&P 500 being as seemingly overvalued as it is -- and what has happened historically when it has reached these levels -- this seems like a good time to hedge against the standard S&P 500 and its reliance on the Magnificent Seven stocks.

Meanwhile, Realtor.com reports that housing inventory has risen 20.9% over the past year. Even better for buyers, supply continues to grow, signaling a budding buyer’s market.
That leaves prospective homeowners with a dilemma: should you wait for rates to fall further and inventory to rise higher in 2026, or should you buy now in today’s improving market?
Why Buy Now
Buyers have strong reasons to act now — and some reasons to wait. But while the reasons to wait often depend on individual circumstances, the arguments for buying apply more broadly.
Lower Rates Drive Up Prices
Imagine that rates do start dropping fast. That makes homes more affordable monthly, so buyers immediately start making higher offers to bid out competitors.
“You can’t wait for the ‘perfect market,'” said Austin Glanzer, real estate investor and owner of 717HomeBuyers. “Sure, rates might come down in 2026, but historically that means prices will jump accordingly.”
Instead, he urges buyers to look for other ways to offset their housing costs. “Explore house hacking, buying a property with an extra unit to rent out. Don’t just wait on the Fed; take control of your own affordability.”

Don’t Time the Market
The best-informed economists in the world can’t accurately predict the timing of market cycles. If they can’t do it, you definitely can’t.
Professional property buyer Cameron Love of StrykCam urges homebuyers to focus on their own needs, not macroeconomic trends out of their control. “Don’t try to time the market — focus on buying a home that fits your budget and needs today. You can always refinance later if rates drop.”
Missed Opportunities
You can wait on the sidelines forever for a combination of low interest rates and low home prices. Meanwhile, many ideal homes would pass you by, and you’d continue renting.
“Waiting often means paying more later, not just in price, but in lost opportunity,” said Ryan Hess, owner of title company Capstone Land Transfer. That missed opportunity includes both time living in your own home, that you customized to meet your needs, and also lost appreciation as prices continue to rise over time.",8816450921dae3cbb009e35033a629d2,trafilatura

Lumen stock jumped this week after the company announced a new contract with a leading college sports conference.
-
Lumen will provide network-as-a-service (NaaS) technologies to the Pac-12's broadcasting division.
-
Investors are trying to assess how much business Lumen will win from its NaaS and Private Connectivity Fabric (PCF) offerings.
Lumen (NYSE: LUMN) stock closed out this week's trading with big gains. The company's share price surged 7.8% higher compared to where it stood at market close on Friday of the previous week.
Lumen's valuation gained ground this week in response to news that the telecommunications company had signed a new deal with the broadcasting division of the Pac-12 college sports conference. The gains over the last week helped the telecom specialist cut its stock slide across 2025's trading to 6.4%.
Lumen stock rose in response to the Pac-12 deal
On Wednesday, Lumen announced it had won a new contract with Pac-12 Enterprises -- the broadcasting arm of the Pac-12 college athletics conference. Lumen will be providing its new partner with network-as-a-service (NaaS) technologies used to stream the conference's games. While Lumen stock is trading down roughly 52% from its high over the last three years, the company has seen some explosive periods of gains, thanks to wins in the artificial intelligence (AI) and NaaS spaces.
What's next for Lumen?
Lumen stock enjoyed a huge rally in 2024 after it was announced that the company had scored contracts with Meta Platforms and Microsoft to provide Private Connectivity Fabric (PCF) technologies to support AI infrastructure.
While the second-quarter report the company published at the beginning of August arrived with weaker-than-expected sales and earnings and spurred a big sell-off, the company actually raised its full-year free-cash-flow (FCF) target to between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion -- up from previous guidance for FCF between $700 million and $900 million. Some of the FCF target increase appears to be driven by earlier-than-expected execution on a previously signed $8.5 billion PCF deal. But the fact that the deal is being realized on an accelerated timeline seems to be a positive indicator.

Since the tech giant's dividend yield is quite low, the short answer is: quite a few.
-
Apple can't really be considered an income stock, but there are still powerful reasons for owning it.
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is known for many things. One that isn't talked about so much is the dividend that it has been bestowing on its shareholders quarterly since mid-2012, when it reinstated a payout it had previously halted in the mid-1990s.
While we can't really characterize Apple as an income stock, as its 0.5% dividend yield is too low for consideration, the company does dole out a distribution on the regular.
A bite of the Apple
In mid-August, Apple declared its latest quarterly shareholder payout; $0.26 per common share. Annualized, this is $1.04 per share, meaning you'd have to hold at least 962 shares to earn $1,000 per year in disbursements.
All told, those 962 shares would cost a little over $223,722 at the most recent closing stock price (not counting seller commissions, assuming one's broker still charges such fees). Like the prices on Apple's always-premium products, that's a rather hefty-looking amount.
In my view, though, iPhones (which I've owned continuously since 2007) and iPads are quality products that are worth the relatively high expense. I feel the same way about Apple stock, which at first glance looks pricey given that its five-year price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio sits above 2.
Smart ownership
Since most of Apple's revenue is still, after all these years, derived from device sales, many investors and analysts are concerned about the sluggish revenue growth of this category. The smartphone market in general is long past its hot growth phases, with new models tending to feature essentially incremental improvements. Most smartphone owners upgrade them only occasionally these days.
The power and potential of Apple lies in its other top-line category -- services, which is stuffed with revenue generators like the App Store. The revenue growth for services tends to outpace that of products, to the point where it now accounts for 29% of the company's considerable top line. Such offerings are the sleeper growth engine of the company, and will continue to boost its fundamentals higher, in my view.

NuScale Power has two designs approved by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
-
Management stated that there is ample attention from prospective customers.

A nuclear energy ETF may be a better option for investors looking for more conservative opportunities.
With the signing of several executive orders in May, President Donald Trump ushered in the dawn of a nuclear energy renaissance in many investors' eyes. From the developers of small modular reactors (SMRs) to uranium-producing companies, investors have bid various nuclear energy stocks considerably higher in 2025.
But of the SMR developers, NuScale Power (NYSE: SMR) is in a league of its own as the only company with a design approved by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Impressive as this is, I'm laser focused on NuScale Power this year for another reason altogether.
A flood of interest has me transfixed on NuScale Power's progress
Sure, the fact that NuScale Power has two approved SMR designs is reason enough to have the company on the radar. The other critical factor, however, is whether the company is receiving interest from prospective customers. Approved designs mean little if no one's interested in partnering with the company.
Management's commentary on the second-quarter 2025 conference call that addresses this point, though, has me intrigued.
On the call, John Hopkins, the company's president and CEO, spoke to the growing interest the company has received.
As it relates to customers, we're getting inundated now. We're focused, as I said, with our resources working with our developer partner ENTRA1 on 2 or 3 major customers that -- and we're still forecasting having what I call hard contracts in place by the end of this year 2025. And those are all U.S.-based customers.
There's no denying the gap between potential customers showing interest and the inkings of actual contracts, but this tantalizing commentary has me eagerly awaiting further news from the company in the remaining months of 2025.
What's a nuclear energy investor to do now?
Management's commentary is intriguing, but it hardly means investors should rush out to buy shares. Potential investors should look for green flags such as securing new customers, but they must also be cognizant of the risks and act accordingly. In the meantime, those looking to mitigate risk may be more interested in a nuclear energy exchange-traded fund (ETF).

In the 1990s, an elite group of investors worked for a tech-focused hedge fund called Tiger Management, led by the legendary investor Julian Robertson. Not only did Robertson mentor this group of investors, but he would go on to seed many of their future hedge funds as the talented group, referred to as the Tiger Cubs, went on to become great investors in their own right.
Philippe Laffont, the founder of Coatue Management, is part of this group, and is now viewed as one of the great tech investors of the modern era. Coatue Management's equity holdings were valued at roughly $35 billion at the end of the second quarter. That's why investors are always paying attention to which stocks Coatue is buying and selling.
In the second quarter, the fund sold its stake in Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) and piled into another artificial intelligence (AI) giant that generated a total return over 336,000% since its initial public offering.
Super Micro Computer: Beating the shorts so far
AI and tech infrastructure and server maker Super Micro Computer has been a controversial and volatile play for the past year. In August 2024, short-seller Hindenburg Research came out with a major short report alleging potential accounting fraud at the company. The report said that Supermicro rehired executives who had been a part of an accounting scandal at the company in 2018 that involved understating expenses and overstating revenue.
The stock got hit hard after Supermicro announced it would need to delay its annual 2024 filing to assess its internal controls. However, the company would eventually go on to file its 2024 10-K and did not need to restate any of its financial statements, a good sign for investors. Furthermore, management earlier this year also provided strong fiscal 2026 guidance of $40 billion in revenue, way ahead of consensus at the time. Supermicro's fiscal year ends on June 30 of each year.
In August, shares struggled after the company reported lower-than-expected quarterly results and weaker-than-expected guidance, due to President Donald Trump's tariffs, which resulted in less working capital in June and ""specification changes from a major new customer."" Laffont and Coatue loaded up on the stock some time in the fourth quarter of 2024 and sold in the second quarter of this year, so the fund could have bought the dip after the short report and might have sold over concerns about tariffs, although that's speculation. Supermicro's stock is up about 46% this year, so Coatue seems to have timed its trade well.
Supermicro looks real cheap right now for a stock benefiting from the AI boom, trading around 16 times forward earnings. Tariffs are likely to be an ongoing issue but if AI demand remains strong, Supermicro, which supplies servers to the likes of Nvidia, should be a major beneficiary. The stock may remain volatile, but I think investors can take a position in the more speculative part of their portfolio.
Oracle: A longtime tech player benefiting from AI
With a market cap of nearly $664 billion, Oracle(NYSE: ORCL) isn't part of the ""Magnificent Seven,"" but it's another large tech company expected to benefit from the AI capital expenditure boom. Coatue purchased over 3.8 million shares in the second quarter, valued at over $843 million.
The cloud giant offers clients the ability to tap into a number of AI solutions including generative AI and machine learning capabilities that provide automation tools and AI application development, among other services. Similar to Microsoft and Amazon, although not as dominant, Oracle's position as a cloud provider positions the company well to be a first point of contact for clients looking to add AI capabilities.
In the company's most recent earnings report for its fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended May 31, Oracle reported results ahead of Wall Street estimates and said that cloud infrastructure revenue sales should increase 70% in fiscal year 2026, after generating 52% growth in fiscal 2025.
Oracle CEO Larry Ellison said the company is particularly well positioned because it has a strong data advantage and has developed one of the most comprehensive databases in the world. ""Our applications take all of your application data and make that data available to the most popular AI models,"" he said on Oracle's earnings call for the company's fiscal fourth quarter of 2025.
If you like ChatGPT, you use ChatGPT. If you like Grok, you use Grok. You use that in the Oracle Cloud. We are the key enabler for enterprises to use their own data and models. No one else is doing that.
Having gone public in 1986, Oracle has been a major tech disruptor for decades. The stock is up over 336,000% since its initial public offering and also up over 41% this year. Trading at 34 times forward earnings, the stock is not necessarily cheap, but given its track record and strong expected growth in cloud infrastructure, Oracle can benefit from AI without being as much in the spotlight as some of the Magnificent Seven names.

Indeed, just a few of these gems in a portfolio can help turn modest regular contributions into life-changing totals.
So we asked a panel of Motley Fool contributing analysts which stocks they think are most likely to deliver serious multibagger growth from here. Their picks: Reddit (NYSE: RDDT), Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU), and SentinelOne (NYSE: S).
Reddit stock is already up big, but it could have much farther to go
Jake Lerch (Reddit): I'm always on the lookout for potential multibaggers, and there are a few key factors that help me identify them. First, I look for a company that is rapidly growing its revenue. Second, I would like that company's market cap to still be small enough that it can reasonably double, triple, or quadruple in size. That rules out ultra-megacap stocks like Nvidia, Microsoft, or Apple, which already boast market caps in the trillions.
Narrowing my field with these two criteria led me to Reddit, a fast-growing tech stock with a reasonable market cap of only $40 billion.
There are many things to like about Reddit, but let's start with my first key factor: revenue growth. Since late 2022, the company averaged a blistering 43% year-over-year revenue growth rate. What's more, its growth has been accelerating. In the second quarter, Reddit's top-line rose by 78% year over year -- its fastest growth ever.
Behind all this revenue is a tidal wave of new users, which, in turn, is attracting a substantial influx of new advertising dollars. The number of daily active unique visitors on the platform grew by 21% to 110 million in Q2. While that is a ton of people, Reddit remains early in its growth trajectory. For example, social media giant Meta Platforms claims more than 3.4 billion daily average users for its family of apps. In other words, there is still room for Reddit to massively grow its platform's audience -- and its revenue -- in the years to come.
I've said in previous articles that I believe Reddit's stock could increase in value by as much as 6 times over the next 10 years. Indeed, it's worth noting that the stock has already increased by more than 500% since the company's IPO in 2024. Given its impressive growth and modest market cap, I see Reddit as the next tech stock destined for serious multibagger status.
This connected TV stock is on track to stream major returns to investors
Will Healy(Roku): My prediction for tech's next multibagger is streaming giant Roku.
Admittedly, Roku may look like the last stock positioned for massive returns, since it has fallen by over 80% from its 2021 high and has yet to recover. Moreover, it competes directly in the ad market with some of tech's largest companies, which also host streaming platforms. These include Google parent Alphabet and Amazon.
However, these tech giants failed to unseat Roku in North America -- it remains the No. 1 streaming platform in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. It also continues making strides in regions like Latin America and Europe, and such gains led to hours of content streamed on its platform rising by 17% year over year in the second quarter.
Additionally, now that streaming viewership exceeds that of traditional TV in the U.S., it is poised to benefit from increased ad revenues in its home country and other regions as streaming becomes increasingly dominant in those markets.
Investors previously soured on this entertainment company due to its losses. Indeed, Roku was only profitable in Q2 because of unrealized gains on investments, not operations. Nonetheless, management forecast a full return to profitability in 2026, which should boost investors' confidence in the stock.
That improved financial outlook should highlight Roku's cheap valuation. Although past losses have left it without a P/E ratio, its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.2 closely approximates the S&P 500 average.
That is notable since many growth stocks have sales multiples in the double digits. If its P/S ratio rises above 10, that expanding multiple would turn Roku into a multibagger, possibly positioning it to revisit its all-time high.
This overlooked AI stock might be a coiled spring
Justin Pope (SentinelOne): It's harder to find potential multibagger stocks in a market that's already trading at all-time highs, but SentinelOne seems capable of multiplying in value over the coming years.
The cybersecurity company's Singularity technology platform uses artificial intelligence to proactively search for and mitigate threats across client endpoints, identities, and the cloud. The cybersecurity industry is highly competitive, but SentinelOne's high-end technology stands out in the field. It tested well in third-party evaluations, and Gartner named SentinelOne a leader in endpoint security for five consecutive years. Four companies in the Fortune 10, and hundreds more in the Global 2000, count themselves among its customers.
Despite all this, the stock hasn't performed well. Since going public in late 2021, SentinelOne is down 75% from its all-time high. The reason? Investors are likely worried about SentinelOne's competitive footing. The company's revenue of $864 million over its last four reported quarters is significantly smaller than that of its peers, and the business continues to operate at a loss.
Fortunately, SentinelOne has a substantial amount of cash on its balance sheet, which should buy investors some patience as the company continues to grow and progress toward profitability. If SentinelOne can instill confidence in investors that it can earn a profit in the competitive cybersecurity space, its upsides could be compelling.
SentinelOne trades at an enterprise-value-to-revenue ratio of roughly 5, a valuation that's a fraction of its peers, including CrowdStrike Holdings (24) and Palo Alto Networks (13). Continued business growth and a higher valuation, as profit margins improve, could send the stock significantly higher.
Nobody can guarantee that SentinelOne will deliver on its potential, but the stocks that eventually deliver home runs typically start off looking a bit more risky. SentinelOne's depressed valuation is a rarity in this market, making it a worthy candidate for a closer look.
