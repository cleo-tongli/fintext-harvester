Every prudent investor must do this now,\" Thallinger told CNBC by video call.\n\"Even if they don't like the discussion around climate change, even if they would say they denigrate the Court of Justice completely, they must expect that, in some countries, some governments, some courts are going to follow this opinion,\" Thallinger said.\n\"If they follow this opinion, it has asset valuation implications, quite clearly. So, this opinion for investors, for capital market participants, really means something.\"\nLicensing and subsidies\nOn the issue of licensing and subsidies, Thallinger said the ICJ's ruling could prove to be a significant development.\nThat's because licensing and permitting for the mining sector, for example, and government subsidies for fossil fuels could be at risk following the court opinion. The burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas is the chief driver of the climate crisis.\n\"If subsides are unlawful, then one should expect that subsidies are somehow stopped at a certain point in time,\" Thallinger said.\n\"Now, certain business processes live on these subsidies or at least benefit to a certain degree on these subsidies. And, as always for an investor, usually you look simply at the cashflow, and if the cashflow part is missing or all of a sudden becomes much smaller then that means another valuation,\" he added.\nThe U.S. and China, the world's two biggest carbon emitters, provided a mixed response to the ICJ's ruling.\n\"As always, President Trump and the entire administration is committed to putting America first and prioritizing the interests of everyday Americans,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in response to the court opinion, Reuters reported.\nA spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, said the ruling has a \"positive significance\" for advancing international climate cooperation and sought to reaffirm the Asian country's status as a developing country.\nMixed signals\nNot everyone is as concerned about the ICJ's ruling from an investor standpoint.\n\"I feel like the wide spectrum of views that exist in the investor community on climate change, and the action that investors are supposed to take, will probably mean that the decision is a bit of a Rorschach test,\" Lindsey Stewart, director of institutional insights for Morningstar, told CNBC by video call.\n\"People are just going to see things that kind of confirm their existing view,\" he added.\nA Rorschach test refers to a psychological assessment during which a person is asked to describe what they see in a series of inkblots.\nIda Kassa Johannesen, head of commercial ESG at Saxo Bank, said the ICJ's intervention is a non-binding advisory opinion, rather than a ruling, \"and this distinction is crucial.\"\nRead more\nCompanies with significant environmental footprints, such as those in the oil and gas, mining and heavy industry sectors, are likely to face increased litigation risk, which could affect their costs, valuation and reputation, Johannesen told CNBC by email.\n\"As a result, investors and particular large institutional investors may begin to reallocate capital away from high-risk sectors to manage exposure to climate-related legal and reputational risks,\" she added.\nSaxo Bank's Johannesen pointed out that the U.S. and China both expressed reservations about the ICJ's opinion, emphasizing its non-binding nature and calling for flexibility in climate action.\nThe Trump administration also recently signed into law the U.S. president's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a package that is favorable to mining and oil and gas companies.\n\"All this sends mixed signals which would probably lead to fragmented market responses between the world's 2 largest economies and the [rest of the world], slow down global regulatory convergence and ultimately limit the (short-term) impact on markets and investor behavior,\" Johannesen said.\nA spokesperson at ABP, one of Europe's largest pension funds, welcomed what they billed as \"the spirit\" of the court's opinion, but said they do not anticipate any short-term ramifications for financial markets.\n\"The ICJ's advisory opinion sends a signal that climate inaction may constitute a breach of international law. However, given its non-binding nature, we don't expect immediate changes in national policies or financial markets,\" an ABP spokesperson told CNBC by email.\nThe Dutch pension fund, which doesn't invest in fossil fuels and says it actively supports climate solutions, highlighted that Europe, for example, already has a lot of climate legislation in place.", "content_hash": "d89d36bdf938b107c3828a55f66064d2", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Every prudent investor must do this now,\" Thallinger told CNBC by video call.\n\"Even if they don't like the discussion around climate change, even if they would say they denigrate the Court of Justice completely, they must expect that, in some countries, some governments, some courts are going to follow this opinion,\" Thallinger said.\n\"If they follow this opinion, it has asset valuation implications, quite clearly. So, this opinion for investors, for capital market participants, really means something.\"\nLicensing and subsidies\nOn the issue of licensing and subsidies, Thallinger said the ICJ's ruling could prove to be a significant development.\nThat's because licensing and permitting for the mining sector, for example, and government subsidies for fossil fuels could be at risk following the court opinion.

Trump arrived earlier.\nBoth men deplaned at the same time and walked down respective red carpets toward each other, meeting where those carpets intersected. Trump clapped as Putin approached him.\nThey greeted each other with apparent warmth, smiling, exchanging words, and patting each others' arms while shaking hands. They then walked to a riser to watch a flyover of military aircraft.\nThe two leaders then got into Trump's armored vehicle, \"The Beast,\" and drove off. They did not respond to reporters' shouted questions before departing.\nThe talks come as Europe — including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was not invited — watches with bated breath.\nRubio, Witkoff joining Trump\nTrump and Putin, who were initially expected to meet one-on-one, will now each be accompanied by two senior officials for their meeting, a White House official confirmed earlier Friday.\nTrump will be joined by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Steve Witkoff, the president's special envoy to the Middle East.\nThere will then be a working lunch for both delegations, before the presidents hold a joint news conference to summarize their talks.\nTrump will be joined at the lunch by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, as well as Rubio and Witkoff, a White House official said.\nPutin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, told Russian state media earlier Friday that the entire summit could last \"at least\" six or seven hours.\nZelenskyy: 'Indeed, high stakes'\nThe presser will undoubtedly be one of the most closely watched events of this year, revealing just how near, or far, the end of the war in Ukraine is — a conflict that has spanned more than 3½ years.\n\"The president wants to exhaust all options to try to bring this war to a peaceful resolution,\" the White House stated ahead of the Alaska summit.\nIt remains to be seen whether those \"options\" will ultimately be good or bad for Ukraine.\nWhile on Air Force One, Trump suggested his yardstick for the summit's success is whether or not he can secure a ceasefire.\n\"I want to see a ceasefire rapidly, I don't know if it's going to be today, but I'm not going to be happy if it's not today,\" he said.\nAt the same time, Trump appeared to be tempering expectations. \"I can't tell you that. I don't know. It's - there's nothing set in stone,\" he said.\nThat noncommittal language echoes how Trump has talked about the meeting in the days leading up to it.\nFor instance, Trump suggested earlier this week that the summit would merely be a \"feel-out meeting,\" before later warning that Russia would face \"severe consequences\" if he determines that Putin does not plan to end the war.\nNot only is a ceasefire at stake — if Trump can persuade Putin to agree to one — but so too are Ukraine's territorial integrity, Europe's security, Russia's economy and geopolitical alliances.\nRead more\nZelenskyy, who has a checkered relationship with Trump, will be nervous as the talks get underway.\n\"Indeed, high stakes,\" Zelenskyy wrote on X earlier Friday ahead of the Alaska summit.\n\"The key thing is that this meeting should open up a real path toward a just peace and a substantive discussion between leaders in a trilateral format – Ukraine, the United States, and the Russian side.\"\n\"It is time to end the war, and the necessary steps must be taken by Russia. We are counting on America,\" he added.\nThe risks for Ukraine and Europe\nBoth he and his European allies fear the U.S. leader could capitulate to skilled negotiator Putin's likely demands for Moscow to retain occupied Ukrainian territory and cut short Ukraine's NATO membership aspirations, in return for halting its military offensive.\nAs he headed off to Alaska on Air Force One, Trump told reporters that \"something is going to come of it [the meeting].\" When asked about Russia's ongoing attacks on Ukraine, the president said Putin \"thinks that gives him strength in talks, I think it hurts him,\" in comments reported by Reuters.\nTrump also insisted that Ukraine has to decide about its territory and that security guarantees were \"possible along with Europe,\" without giving further details.\nRussia's delegation includes only a few members of Putin's inner circle, with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and Kirill Dmitriev, Russia's investment and trade envoy, as well as Ushakov.\nThe presidential aide commented that \"it is obvious to everyone that the central topic will be the settlement of the Ukrainian crisis,\" including the \"broader tasks of ensuring peace and security,\" as well as pressing international and regional issues.\nSignaling that Russia will be looking to extol the economic benefits of a rapprochement with the U.S., Ushakov added that \"an exchange of views is expected regarding the further development of bilateral cooperation, including in the trade and economic area,\" noting that \"this cooperation has enormous and, unfortunately, untapped potential.\"", "content_hash": "3e160ec92f007ab0b748626cbdd1f50b", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Yet he has also threatened \"very severe consequences\" if Putin doesn't agree to a ceasefire. It's a warning Trump has proposed before, and yet has resisted pulling the trigger on further sanctions.\nUkraine and its European allies, not invited to the summit, warned Trump this week that Putin is bluffing about wanting peace. Kyiv has even said Russia is preparing for new offensives although Moscow has not commented on that claim.\nThe talks could nonetheless be a watershed moment for stakeholders in the Ukraine war which has been raging for three and a half years, as well as a catalyst for geopolitical changes.\nCNBC takes a look at five major factors at stake in Friday's talks:\nCeasefire\nTrump's central aim on Friday is to press Putin into a ceasefire but what form this might take, what promises could be made and what \"red lines\" might have to be crossed — particularly territorial concessions and security guarantees — to reach a deal will be key.\n\"Ending the Russia-Ukraine war remains one of President Trump's signature foreign policy goals, and Friday's Anchorage talks with Putin have raised expectations of a major diplomatic breakthrough,\" Helima Croft, head of Global Commodity Strategy and MENA Research at RBC Capital Markets, said Wednesday.\n\"The purported deal discussion points are broadly similar to what has been previously floated; In return for halting its military offensive, Russia is apparently seeking to retain Crimea and the entire eastern Donbas region of Ukraine as well as secure a definitive end to Kyiv's NATO ambitions\" she said, in emailed comments.\nUkraine's territorial integrity\nUkraine and Europe have vehemently pushed back against the \"maximalist\" territorial concessions that Russia could seek in return for acquiescing to a ceasefire deal.\nTrump has sewn confusion and concern by vacillating over the thorny issue in the last week, talking about potential \"land swapping\" by Ukraine while also pledging to get as much territory back for it as possible.\nUkraine and European leaders on Wednesday urged Trump not to agree to any demands from Putin regarding peace for land, following an emergency virtual summit.\nFor his part, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine's territorial integrity is enshrined in its constitution. Any changes to this would have to be approved by a referendum, which would have to be authorized by the Ukrainian parliament, making the process a potentially fraught one.\nThere is another option: that Ukraine accepts de facto Russian control of the four regions it broadly occupies, rather than a de jure (legal and official) recognition. But again, how a \"just and lasting\" peace could then be maintained in Ukraine, and who would police it, would likely be a bone of contention.\nEurope's security\nThe fate of Ukraine's territorial integrity doesn't just affect Ukraine but the rest of Europe, regional leaders say. They argue that giving Putin a slice of its neighbor's territory effectively redraws the borders of Europe.\nUkraine aspires to membership of the European Union (as sell as NATO, although this is seen as an ambition too far) and both Kyiv and the EU argue that if Russia is given a slice of Ukrainian territory, he will regroup his forces and use the territory as a launchpad for a future wholesale invasion of Ukraine. That could mean Europe has war at its border.\nEU leaders want to be involved in any ceasefire deal and have offered to oversee keeping the peace. Russia has rejected that idea, and euroskeptic Trump might not have the region's concerns in the forefront of his mind come Friday.\n\"What the Europeans are trying to frame as non-negotiable preconditions for a deal with Russia (a ceasefire, a monitoring mission, \"ironclad\" security guarantees) might catch up with them after the U.S.-Russia summit,\" Carsten Nickel, deputy director of Research at Teneo, said in a note Wednesday.\n\"Regardless of the outcome, Trump could dare the Europeans to deliver much more of the required military capabilities and financing afterward. This would create difficult trade-offs in transatlantic relations,\" he said.\nRussia's economy\nAlthough Putin appears to be entering the talks from a position of strength rather than weakness, he could arguably look for an off-ramp from the war that has damaged Russia's economy, which is seeing slowing growth, labor shortages and rampant inflation which even Putin described as \"alarming.\"\n″[Putin] starts from a relatively strong position on the battlefield. They're advancing,\" Richard Portes, head of the economics faculty at the London Business School, told CNBC.\n\"On the other hand, from the economic point of view, he starts from a weak position. The Russian economy is not in very good shape. They're running a significant fiscal deficit, partly because oil revenues are down very substantially, oil and gas [are down] because of the oil price. And ... this is a weak economy,\" Portes told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Monday.\nGeopolitical impact\nAfter three and a half years of war, there's certainly a desire that the fighting in Ukraine comes to an end. Hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost, according to estimates, while millions of Ukrainians have been displaced. The global economy and supply chains have also been upended and redrawn as a result of the conflict.\nRussia, meanwhile, has reasonably effectively circumvented international sanctions and has buyers of its oil that funds its war machine, with the likes of China and India refusing to isolate their ally. As such, one of the key questions Friday will be, is Putin willing to play ball when it comes to ending the war, and to what extent does he need to?\n\"From Putin's point of view, the task is quite prosaic: to simply sit and wait for the desired result. Putin sees himself as a 'long power' and historical figure, in contrast with the 'short power' of Western fleeting political figures,\" Alexander Baunov, senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, commented Thursday.\nPutin's position on the eve of the meeting looks more advantageous, Baunov concluded: \"By conceding to hold a one-on-one meeting with Putin before any ceasefire, Trump is taking a bigger risk than Putin,\" he said.\n\"In diplomacy, the aggressor has nothing to lose. By offering to lower the temperature without having suffered a military defeat, that same aggressor begins to look like a peacemaker.\"", "content_hash": "32e93af619c31221fe33da8344363df2", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Property Play covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, from individuals to venture capitalists, private equity funds, family offices, institutional investors and large public companies. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.\nThe days of landlords knocking on doors for monthly rent checks, or tenants going after landlords to fix a leaky toilet are slowly coming to an end. Technology has been stepping in to address the needs of tenants, landlords and large multifamily operators, and now artificial intelligence is turning that slow progress into a rental revolution.\nWork orders, lease renewals, tours and even investor due diligence are being taken over by software and AI. As with the start of any technology, it has been largely fragmented among a multitude of vendors. The integration of all that technology is a huge opportunity for startups and the venture capitalists backing them.\nRent tech\nOne of the more mature categories for AI in the apartment space is virtual agents talking to prospective residents. This is where agentic AI comes in — meaning AI that can act autonomously and make its own decisions depending on what the consumer asks. There are still, however, just a handful of companies using that advanced level of machine learning.\nAI is also proving useful on the investment side of the multifamily business, specifically underwriting and acquisitions. For example, investors looking to purchase a large property have to go through all the leases and load those into a rent roll.\n\"If you're buying a property that hasn't been professionally managed, where those aren't all loaded into some market-leading software product, somebody may have to manually go through all those leases and capture all the information. Well, AI is great for that, right?\" said John Helm, founder and partner at RET Ventures, a fund focusing on AI in both real estate and rent tech.\nInstead, according to Helm, you can feed leases into an AI model, and it will spit out a summary of all the data the investor needs. They can then load that directly into an underwriting model and value the property.\nRET Ventures said it doesn't rely on endowments or pension funds for its capital, but instead the consumers of the products of the companies they invest in — so-called strategic limited partners.\n\"We have 60 multifamily operators that have about over 3 million units in our fund,\" he said.\nProperty management\nAI can also help with property development and accounts payable. Multifamily developers will often have multiple vendors, from landscaping to plumbing to heating. Many still use paper invoices.\nOne of RET's portfolio companies is PredictAP. It takes all those invoices, reads them and then repopulates all the necessary data into the company's payables system to make the process and payments more efficient. None of it needs to be manually coded by a human.\nFunnel\nTyler Christiansen likens the multifamily industry to car dealerships. Every renter interaction was siloed to an individual property. As CEO of Funnel, which is backed by RET Ventures, his aim is to streamline the apartment marketing and leasing process, \"enabling multifamily professionals to generate more profits, efficiency, and insight across their portfolios,\" according to the company website.\nFunnel works with large apartment real estate investment trusts such as Camden Property Trust, MAA and Essex Property Trust, as well as Cortland, which owns 90,000 apartments. Christiansen said that rather than the renter's relationship being with the community, the renter's relationship is really with the brand. He calls that \"centralization\" in the industry.\n\"And then AI, what makes it unique within Funnel is that rather than automating interactions simply at a community level, we're really opening up automations across the portfolio,\" said Christiansen.\nOne example would be if a tenant is not renewing a lease at one community because they are moving to a different market, Funnel's AI system would open up the possibility of cross-selling that person into another client community.\nHeadwinds\nDespite the progress, the technology is still in its infancy, and it's expensive. Apartment operators and investors are in the experimental phase. It remains to be seen how much they will invest.\nPlus, the multifamily industry is highly fragmented. There are close to 50 million rental units in the U.S., the majority owned by small, often mom-and-pop landlords. The largest apartment REITs own roughly between 50,000 and 100,000 units each, with a few larger private operators, like Blackstone and Greystar.\n\"I guess the challenge is going to be, probably in the next several years, really sifting through everything and understanding where there are real businesses that could grow into this. You're still seeing a lot of these tools just starting to get deployed,\" said Helm.", "content_hash": "91b9821e01765a58ffda16beba4b5f96", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

By late Saturday morning, its maximum sustained winds more than doubled to 160 mph (255 kph).\nMike Brennen, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami, said Erin had grown into a \"very powerful hurricane.\" He said its winds gained 60 mph (96 kph) in intensity within about nine hours Saturday.\n\"We expect to see Erin peak here in intensity relatively soon,\" Brennan said in an online briefing.\nThe Hurricane Center said Erin should weaken somewhat late Saturday or early Sunday as the storm encounters increased wind shear and possibly takes in more dry air. However, forecasters predict it will remain a major hurricane until midweek.\nErin close enough to trigger flooding, landslides\nThe hurricane was located 110 miles (180 kilometers) north of Anguilla at 2 p.m. Saturday, moving west at 16 mph (26 kph). The storm's center was forecast to remain at sea, passing 145 miles (233 kilometers) north of Puerto Rico, according to the National Weather Service.\nErin was close enough to affect nearby islands. Tropical storm watches were issued for St. Martin, St. Barts and St. Maarten. The Hurricane Center warned that heavy rain in some areas could trigger flash flooding, landslides and mudslides.\nTropical-storm force wind gusts are possible in the Turks and Caicos Islands and southeast Bahamas.\nThough compact in size, with hurricane-force winds extending 30 miles (45 km) from its center, the Hurricane Center said Erin was expected to double or even triple in size in the coming days.\nErin could create powerful rip currents off the U.S. East Coast from Florida to the mid-Atlantic next week, even with its eye forecast to remain far offshore, Brennan said.\n'Incredible' race from tropical storm to Category 5\nHurricane specialist and storm surge expert Michael Lowry said Erin gained strength at a pace that was \"incredible for any time of year, let alone August 16th.\"\nLowry said only four other Category 5 hurricanes have been recorded in the Atlantic on or before Aug\nThe most powerful storms tend to form later in the year, with the hurricane season typically peaking in mid-September.\nIn October 2005, Hurricane Wilma rocketed from a tropical storm to a Category 5 storm in less than 24 hours, according to National Hurricane Center advisories from that time. Wilma weakened to a Category 3 hurricane before striking Florida.\nIncluding Erin, there have been 43 hurricanes that have reached Category 5 status on record in the Atlantic, said Dan Pydynowski, senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, a private forecasting company.\n\"They're certainly rare, although this would mark the fourth year in a row that we've had one in the Atlantic basin,\" Pydynowski said about Category 5 hurricanes. Conditions needed for hurricanes to reach this strength include very warm ocean water, little to no wind shear, and being far from land, he said.\nWarming climate linked to storms strengthening faster\nScientists have linked rapid intensification of hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean to climate change. Global warming is causing the atmosphere to hold more water vapor and is spiking ocean temperatures. The warmer waters give hurricanes fuel to unleash more rain and strengthen more quickly.\nStorms that ramp up so quickly complicate forecasting for meteorologists and make it harder for government agencies to plan for emergencies. Hurricane Erick, a Pacific storm that made landfall June 19 in Oaxaca, Mexico, also strengthened rapidly, doubling in intensity in less than a day.\nErin is the fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. It's the first to become a hurricane.\nThe 2025 hurricane season is expected to be unusually busy. The forecast calls for six to 10 hurricanes, with three to five reaching major status with winds of more than 110 mph (177 kph).\nIn San Juan, locals and tourists walked, exercised and shopped on Saturday as usual. Restaurants were busy, and despite warnings to avoid the beaches, people could be seen in the water at Ultimo Trolley and Ocean Park beaches.

Goolsbee is one of 12 FOMC voters this year.\nReports this week on consumer and producer prices \"put in a note of unease\" on where inflation is headed, as services prices \"which are not obviously going to be transitory\" are \"kicking up,\" he said.\n\"So I feel like we still need another [inflation report], at least, to figure out if we're still on the golden path,\" Goolsbee said during a \"Squawk Box\" interview.\nThe July consumer price index was relatively in line with market forecasts, though the core reading that excludes food and energy nudged higher to 3.1%, a bit above Wall Street expectations. However, the July producer price index, which measures wholesale items, posted a surprisingly high 0.9% monthly gain that was the largest in about three years.\nThe data is being examined particularly closely for clues about the impact tariffs are having on inflation. While neither report showed significant obvious impacts, many economists believe the import duties President Donald Trump has imposed are slowly making their way into the data and will show up in coming months.\n\"It all depends on the data and what's the economic outlook. If we keep getting inflation reports like [previous] ones ... I would be very comfortable that, hey, the dust is out of the air, it looks like we're still where we were, which is a strong economy with inflation coming back down,\" Goolsbee said.\n\"In that circumstance ... the right thing to do [is] to just bring the rates down to where we think they're going to settle,\" he added. \"We've got to get some clarity from the numbers.\"\nMarkets are placing a near certainty that the FOMC votes to lower the benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point in September, from the current 4.25% to 4.50% level. However, there are some misgivings about what happens from there, with 55% odds of another reduction in October and just a 43% probability of a third move in December, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.", "content_hash": "bc57a6995e232db9794e5d384efc1038", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Pro sports careers can be short and unpredictable, and earnings can vary widely. The average NWSL salary is about $125,000 per season, according to the league.\nGallagher's goal is to prepare athletes for what comes next.\n\"We went in there knowing nothing about insurance, and now I could probably bore your head off about RPS,\" Nesbeth joked, referencing an industry term meaning \"risk placement services.\"\nFor Curran, it was about changing preconceived notions about the insurance industry.\n\"After doing the internship, everything I thought about insurance was the exact opposite,\" she said.\nCurran and the Chicago Stars mutually agreed to part ways days after she spoke with CNBC.\nMead said Gallagher has gone on to hire some of the athlete interns as employees when their playing careers are over.\nHe said in Europe, the company employs a professional rugby player who is one of its star salesmen.\n\"There's a time when the light bulb goes off and they see how celebrating a win on the pitch is no different than celebrating a win after a sale or doing something wonderful for a customer,\" Mead told CNBC.\nCoverage off the field\nTies between insurance and professional sports are not new.\nFor years, State Farm has run catchy commercials featuring former New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning, former Indiana Pacers shooting guard Reggie Miller, Kansas City Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes, Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark of the WNBA and a host of others.\nOn Monday, AIG announced it was becoming the first Fortune 500 company to take a stake in an EFL League Two club, with an investment in Salford City Football Club in the U.K.\nNationwide, an NWSL partner, also runs a similar internship program with league players, offering them a professional development program at the insurance company's headquarters in Columbus, Ohio.\n\"Our hope is that the players walk away with new skills and experiences that may serve them now and in their post-playing careers, perhaps back at Nationwide,\" said Jim McCoy, vice president of sports marketing for Nationwide.", "content_hash": "0dec84c548e4c3a334dc8619b2cf1e89", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Consumers have taken the worst-case scenario about tariffs off the table, the survey director said. \"However, consumers continue to expect both inflation and unemployment to deteriorate in the future.\" The government released July retail sales before Friday's open, and the headline and ex-auto numbers matched expectations. 3. HSBC analysts downgraded their rating on Club name Cisco Systems to a hold from buy, with a $69 per share price target, following this week's earnings release. They think that a restocking benefit lifting the company's networking segment is almost over. HSBC also pointed out that Cisco's security business came in below expectations. We were also critical of that in our earnings analysis on Wednesday evening and during Thursday's monthly meeting . But the key, in our view on Cisco, is that the AI infrastructure business is getting traction. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long CSCO. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

To back this up, Woodring pointed to potentially stronger-than-expected iPhone builds in China and the possibility for estimates to be revised higher, which will allow the stock's multiple to expand and drive shares up. Morgan Stanley's China team recently raised its iPhone builds estimate for September by 8%, saying iPhone sales were stronger than expected in the June quarter, which means supply will need to be replenished. \"These positive revisions are a result of better than expected iPhone sell-through in the June quarter, which reduced iPhone channel inventory below normalized levels, and thus created a larger channel fill opportunity in the September quarter, as the positive build revision is entirely iPhone 16 (2M units) and Pro Max (2M units) models,\" he said. Woodring said this more upbeat forecast is baked into its estimates already, but it could imply more upside ahead in the December quarter, which is typically more volatile than the September period. \"Relative to our current 78M December quarter iPhone shipment forecast, this could imply modest iPhone shipment upside, though we'll be able to narrow this range next month when the iPhone 17 is officially launched,\" he said. Apple has yet to fully roll out Apple Intelligence, its full suite of artificial intelligence integration. Functions like an updated Siri with AI integration has been delayed several times since it was first announced last year. Apple is expected to announce the details of its new iPhone next month. \"We are turning more bullish – forward iPhone unit/revenue growth expectations are still relatively muted, many of the same factors that got us bullish last July remain (elongated replacement cycles/pent up iPhone demand, new form factors in the pipeline, structural gross margin tailwinds, etc.), we're past peak tariff risk (Section 232 is a non-event), regulation is not as significant of a near-term headwind as feared (though remains a long-term risk), pricing is an underappreciated lever that Apple can pull for both Product and Services (Apple hasn't raise Services prices in 2 years), and relative to the S & P, Apple is trading in-line with the trailing 5 year average,\" the analyst said. Apple shares have pulled back more than 7% in 2025. The analyst said most institutions are actually underweight Apple compared with its peer megacap technology stocks. \"In our view, Apple is one potential AI partnership away from breaking out,\" the analyst said.", "content_hash": "34df5cb006445a94784eff1178db082b", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Updating your insurance policies probably isn't at the top of the list, but, from health insurance to life insurance, you'll need to make changes to keep pace with your new phase of life and ensure your family's security for years to come.\nHere are seven updates to make to your policies when you start a family.\nOffers in this section are from affiliate partners and selected based on a combination of engagement, product relevance, compensation, and consistent availability.\nAmica offers a level term life insurance and whole life insurance policies payable for 20 years or until ages 65 or 100. Both include a terminal illness rider at no extra charge.\nTerms Apply\nPacific Life offers term, permanent and no-exam life insurance, with an accelerated death benefit included at no charge.\nTerms Apply\n1. Update your health insurance\nYour health insurance will be crucial to covering your baby's many appointments in their first year of life. If you have health care through work, reach out to human resources or visit your benefits portal to add your baby to your policy.\nGiving birth and adopting are both considered \"qualifying life events,\" which means you're entitled to make changes outside of the standard open enrollment period.\n\"Your baby should automatically be covered for the first 30 days on your existing policy, but you need to officially add them during this period so that they are insured moving forward,\" Regina McCann Hess, a certified financial planner at Forge Wealth Management, told CNBC Select.\nIf you have a partner who has their own health care, you can pick the one that best suits your needs and budget.\nIf you get coverage through the ACA Health Insurance Marketplace, you'll need to buy additional coverage. If you have Medicaid, your baby is automatically enrolled for the first year.\n2. Buy life insurance\nLife insurance is the best way to ensure your family's financial stability if the worst should happen.\nNo one wants to think about death, especially their own, McCann Hess says, but once you have a family, \"you need to plan for the possibility.\"\n\"It doesn't have to be an elaborate or fancy policy,\" she adds. \"You can use term insurance to get the job done.\"\nAccording to McCann Hess, life insurance isn't just necessary to replace a breadwinner's income.\n\"Some people assume that the caregiving spouse who stays at home doesn't need a policy,\" she said. \"I disagree. You'll have to get someone to watch your kids while you are at work—or maybe full-time. And, unlike your spouse, they aren't going to do it for free.\"\nThere are many different life insurance plans on the market, but term life is a straightforward and affordable option for new parents. It's only in force for a certain number of years, usually between 10 and 30, but it can serve as a safety net during your child's most vulnerable years, when your income caregiving is most critical.\nA $250,000 policy for a 30-year-old woman averages about $15 per month, according to Policygenius. For a 30-year-old man, it would be about $18 a month.\nA whole life insurance policy, in comparison, would cost upwards of $200 per month.\nOne of our top picks for term life insurance is Ladder, because it allows you to increase or decrease your death benefit as your life changes. If you own a car or house, Amica has affordable premiums and a healthy discount of up to 30% on auto, home and umbrella policies when you add life insurance.\nAmica Life Insurance\nCost\nThe best way to estimate your costs is to request a quote\nApp available\nYes\nPolicy highlights\nAmica offers four straightforward life insurance options — a level term life insurance, and whole life insurance policies payable for 20 years or until ages 65 or 100. Both term and whole life insurance policies include a terminal illness rider for free, allowing for an advanced death benefit if the insured is diagnosed with a terminal illness.\nLadder Life Insurance\nCost\nThe best way to estimate your costs is to request a quote\nApp available\nNo\nPolicy highlights\nLadder is a digital-first life insurance company offering up to $3 million in coverage without an exam. It only offers a single term life insurance policy without riders, but Ladder's policies offer the option to increase or decrease coverage as your needs change.\n3. If you have life insurance, make sure it's enough\nYou might think you're covered if you have group life insurance through your job. Employer-sponsored policies usually only pay out the equivalent of one year's salary, however, and the rule of thumb is to have at least 10 times that amount.\nEven if you did take out a policy on your own, it probably doesn't reflect your current needs.\n\"Consider your current lifestyle, your child's lifetime educational needs, and your spouse's financial needs in case you aren't around,\" says McCann Hess.\nIf your existing policy has a guaranteed insurability rider, you should be able to increase coverage at life milestones, such as the birth of a child, without undergoing another medical exam.\n4. Consider life insurance for the baby\nNo one wants to think about something terrible happening to their child, but a child's life insurance policy can help cover medical expenses and funeral costs. It also ensures they're eligible for coverage when they're older, even if they develop a disqualifying health condition or take up a risky job or hobby.\nChildren's whole life insurance policies also have a cash value component that grows over time. Later in life, if they keep the policy current, the cash value can be withdrawn, borrowed against or used to help pay premiums.\nYou can typically get a policy for a baby 14 days after birth, with the usual medical exam requirement waived. Our top picks for children's life insurance include Aflac, one of the few companies with term life policies for children, and Foresters Financial, which has a Bright Future Children's policy that pays out up to $75,000.\nForesters Financial BrightFuture Children's Whole Life Insurance\nCost\nThe best way to estimate your costs is to request a quote\nApp available\nYes\nPolicy highlights\nBrightFuture Whole Life Insurance is designed for children up to age 18 and offers two choices for payments. Its children's policy has several included riders and features that could be useful, including coverage for health expenses after a natural disaster and accelerated benefits.\nPros\n- Premiums are able to be paid in a 10-year period or up to age 100.\nCons\n- Quotes not available online\n- Not available in all states\nAflac Juvenile Life insurance\nCost\nThe best way to estimate your costs is to request a quote\nApp available\nYes\nPolicy highlights\nAflac offers term and whole life insurance for children between 14 days old and 17 years old. With both types of coverage, the child is able to convert the policy to a permanent life insurance policy with up to double the coverage.\nPros\n- Offers term life insurance for children\n- Coverage will ensure future insurability\nCons\n- Coverage limited to $30,000 for children's life insurance\n5. Get disability insurance\nWhile life insurance may be top of mind, it's more likely you'll be disabled during your working years than pass away. According to the Social Security Administration, one in four U.S. workers in their 20s now will become disabled before they reach full retirement.\nDisability insurance can help ensure you'll have enough money to keep your household running if you're unable to work for a period. Short-term disability provides income if you're temporarily unable to work due to a covered illness, injury or medical condition. It can last up to six months and is often (but not always) provided by employers.\n\"Will it fully cover all of your lost income?\" McCann Hess says. \"No, but hopefully it will help you pay some of your household expenses and provide some financial stability while you are disabled.\"\nIf you're self-employed or don't have coverage through work, a short-term disability policy from online marketplace Breeze can replace up to 60% of your weekly income for up to two years.\nBreeze Disability Insurance\nPolicy highlights\nOnline policy broker Breeze allows you to compare rates for short- and long-term disability from Guardian, Mutual of Omaha, Assurity, Ameritas, Principal, MassMutual and other top providers.\nAge\nVaries by insurer\nBenefits period\nVaries by insurer\nMaximum monthly benefits\nVaries by insurer\nElimination period\nVaries by insurer\nLong-term disability insurance replaces up to 70% of your income for as little as two years or up to the remainder of your working life. It's especially helpful if you've invested time and resources in a highly trained career in medicine, law or another field.\nThe Standard and Guardian both made our list of the best long-term disability insurance providers.\nThe Standard® Disability Insurance\nCost\nThe best way to estimate your costs is to request a quote\nApp available\nNo\nPolicy highlights\nThe Standard® offers coverage that can protect your income if you're faced with a disability. In addition to features like guaranteed renewability, rehabilitation benefits and optional student loan coverage, The Standard's disability insurance offers a family care benefit to help you take care of a child, spouse or parent with a serious illness or injury.\nGuardian® Disability Insurance\nPolicy highlights\nGuardian issues individual long-term disability and group short-term disability insurance. Built-in benefits include automatic benefit enhancement, unemployment waiver of premiums and social insurance substitute. Optional riders include a cost-of-living adjustment, the option to increase coverage, student loan repayment and a lump sum disability benefit at age 60\nBenefits period\n2, 5 or 10 years, or to age 65 or 70\nMaximum monthly benefits\nNot stated\nElimination period\n90 or 180 days\n6. Review your home and auto policies\nIf you've made upgrades to your home in anticipation of your new arrival, it's time to bump up your homeowners insurance's dwelling coverage.\nAnd, if you purchased an SUV to shepherd your little one around, revisit your car insurance policy and see if you're still getting the best deal. State Farm offers a multi-vehicle discount of up to 20% off.\nState Farm Auto Insurance\nCost\nThe best way to estimate your costs is to request a quote\nApp available\nYes\nPolicy highlights\nState Farm is one of the largest auto insurers in the U.S. based on market share. It has an excellent reputation for customer satisfaction and offers discounts for safe driving and young drivers.\nTerms apply.\nRead our State Farm Auto Insurance review\nBundling auto and home insurance is a great way to save money. Amica, for example, offers discounts of up to 30% off if you purchase both home and auto policies.\nAmica Auto Insurance\nCost\nThe best way to estimate your costs is to request a quote\nPolicy highlights\nAmica offers a variety of auto insurance policies to fit your coverage needs. The company also offers a total of 18 discounts, including discounts for bundling and for students.\nApp available\nYes\n7. Look into umbrella insurance\nYour life is expanding, so make sure your coverage does too. Liability protection pays out if you or someone in your household unintentionally causes damage to someone or their property. An umbrella insurance policy supersedes the limits on your home and auto policies, providing an extra layer of protection.\nTravelers offers affordable umbrella insurance policies worth up to $5 million that can also cover attorneys' fees, medical bills and other expenses.\nInsurance FAQs\nHow long after having a baby can you add them to your health insurance?\nHaving a baby is a qualifying life event, so you'll have 30 days to add your newborn to your plan. If you have a Health Insurance Marketplace plan, your special enrollment period is 60 days from the child's birth.\nDoes car insurance pay to replace a child's car seat?\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recommends replacing a car seat \"following a moderate or severe crash,\" even if it doesn't seem damaged. If you have collision coverage, most car insurance providers will often cover the cost of a new seat. If there is a theft, fire or natural disaster, the seat would be covered under a comprehensive coverage policy.\nIs homeowners insurance more expensive if you have children?\nWhile the presence of a baby won't raise your premiums, you'll need to reevaluate your contents coverage after buying a crib, stroller and a mountain of baby toys. As your child grows and becomes more adventurous, additions like a swimming pool or a trampoline can increase your rates.\nMoney matters — so make the most of it.

Years later, workers are still seeking alternatives to being glued to a desk in the company office, says Dr. Laura Madrid Sartoretto, research lead at the Global Citizen Solutions Global Intelligence Unit.\nGrowth rates have slowed down compared to the pandemic peak, but the total number of digital nomads is still 150% higher than in 2019, according to Global Citizen Solutions.\n\"Remote work is steadily growing, so we think digital nomadism is something that is here to stay. It's not going to grow as it grew during the pandemic, but we see that people like millennials and Gen Zers are more likely to travel and keep traveling and with their families now too,\" Madrid Sartoretto tells CNBC Make It.\n\"People are thinking about education for their kids when they are in this digital nomad life.\"\nA digital nomad visa is a short-term permit that allows individuals to stay in a country for an extended period and work remotely. The length of time a nomad can stay varies from place to place but most countries allow for six months to a year—unless you have your eye on Croatia.\nRecently, the Balkan country announced it an update its digital nomad visa, which will allow non-EU residents to stay for up to three years. The visa also permits close family members of a digital nomad to join them.\nCroatia's digital nomad visa website states that close family members also include partners or non-married couples who have been together for longer than three years without children, or for less time if they do have children together.\nMadrid Sartoretto believes that Croatia's expansion of its digital nomad program is a sign that the country is trying to attract more talent and compete with neighboring countries and their offerings.\n\"I think they are competing with other countries that are in the same region, like Estonia and Romania, that also attract a lot of digital nomads. If you give more benefits to people to come to your country, then you attract more talent. It's all about competition now,\" she adds.\nFor those looking to apply for Croatia's digital nomad visa, Dr. Madrid Sartoretto says the country offers a low cost of living but still needs to improve its infrastructure, like more reliable internet speeds.\n\"If you compare internet speed and reliability to countries like Romania, which has one of the fastest speeds in the world, Croatia needs to improve its infrastructure,\" she adds.\nTo apply for Croatia's digital nomad visa online, applicants must provide proof that they work outside of Croatia. Additionally, they must provide a copy of a valid travel document, proof of health insurance, proof of address in Croatia, and a minimum monthly income of 3,295 euros or $3,855 USD.\nFor proof of income, applicants can submit a bank statement showing the total amount required, a bank statement demonstrating regular income, or pay slips for at least six months. Applicants must also send evidence that they have not been convicted of criminal offences in their home country or the country in which they have resided for more than a year immediately before arriving in Croatia.\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

We can't offer personal investing advice. We will only consider more general questions about the investment process or stocks in the portfolio or related industries. This week's question: I would like to start a position in Meta and Microsoft, but am unsure how, when the stocks are up this high. Is it too late? If I have to wait for a pullback, how much of a pullback should I wait for? – Ann S. It's not too late to start positions in Meta Platforms and Microsoft because, from a fundamental perspective, we think both stocks are solid long-term investments. Nonetheless, as indicated by our 2 ratings on both names, we do think waiting for a slight pullback before buying would be prudent. Looking at their charts below for buy levels from a technical standpoint, we tend to start our analysis by looking at the 50-day and 200-day moving average – represented by the maroon and green lines, respectively. From there, we look for long-term support and resistance levels – represented by the horizontal black lines. But, more than the exact prices, we want to show investors how to spot the moving averages and long-term trends. At the Club, we are first and foremost fundamental investors, but we do look to technical analysis as another tool to help out. Meta buy levels: $738, $722, $638 Starting with Meta Platforms, the first level of interest would be around $738 per share, a level that proved to be resistance twice over the past year before the stock broke above it on the back of a strong earnings report. A move to $738 would represent a pullback of roughly 6% from current levels around $788 and put shares at just under a price-to-earnings valuation of 25 times 2026 earnings estimates. The next level down would be the 50-day moving day at around $722. Given that we are above that average, we would look to it for support per the polarity principle – past resistance, once broken, typically becomes support. A move to $722 would be a pullback of just under 8%. The 200-day moving average at $638 is well below the 50-day, typical of a stock that has been on a run like Meta. That would be a pretty significant decline of about 19% and put shares at just over 21 times 2026 estimates. The $638 level would only come into play if the 50-day were breached. Microsoft buy levels: $502, $455, $438 Jumping to Microsoft, the 50-day is currently at around $502, about 4% below current levels around $524 and just over 6% off the stock's all-time closing high. That's a decent-sized pullback to start a position. From there, however, we don't see much in terms of support until we get to around $455, a level that previously served as resistance earlier this year before it was breached in late May. A move to this level would put shares at under 30 times fiscal year 2026 earnings estimates, about the midpoint of the P/E range seen over the past five years. From there, the 200-day moving average is around $438, a roughly 16% decline from current levels. Bottom line While the 200-day moving averages are pretty far down for both Microsoft and Meta, those levels are not out of the question if there were a broad-based market pullback. The 200-day moving average is usually a solid level to hold your nose and do some buying, assuming that there's no change to your longer-term investment thesis. That said, we don't foresee a major correction as the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates next month and possibly two more times before year-end. The Fed cut rates three times at the end of 2024 but has kept them steady ever since. We also don't think that trying to play a correction is in the best interest of those looking to make money. In the words of famed investor Peter Lynch, \"Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in the corrections themselves.\" (See here for a full list of the stocks INJim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

We can't offer personal investing advice. We will only consider more general questions about the investment process or stocks in the portfolio or related industries. This week's question: I would like to start a position in Meta and Microsoft, but am unsure how, when the stocks are up this high. Is it too late? If I have to wait for a pullback, how much of a pullback should I wait for? – Ann S. It's not too late to start positions in Meta Platforms and Microsoft because, from a fundamental perspective, we think both stocks are solid long-term investments. Nonetheless, as indicated by our 2 ratings on both names, we do think waiting for a slight pullback before buying would be prudent. Looking at their charts below for buy levels from a technical standpoint, we tend to start our analysis by looking at the 50-day and 200-day moving average – represented by the maroon and green lines, respectively. From there, we look for long-term support and resistance levels – represented by the horizontal black lines. But, more than the exact prices, we want to show investors how to spot the moving averages and long-term trends. At the Club, we are first and foremost fundamental investors, but we do look to technical analysis as another tool to help out. Meta buy levels: $738, $722, $638 Starting with Meta Platforms, the first level of interest would be around $738 per share, a level that proved to be resistance twice over the past year before the stock broke above it on the back of a strong earnings report. A move to $738 would represent a pullback of roughly 6% from current levels around $788 and put shares at just under a price-to-earnings valuation of 25 times 2026 earnings estimates. The next level down would be the 50-day moving day at around $722. Given that we are above that average, we would look to it for support per the polarity principle – past resistance, once broken, typically becomes support. A move to $722 would be a pullback of just under 8%. The 200-day moving average at $638 is well below the 50-day, typical of a stock that has been on a run like Meta. That would be a pretty significant decline of about 19% and put shares at just over 21 times 2026 estimates. The $638 level would only come into play if the 50-day were breached. Microsoft buy levels: $502, $455, $438 Jumping to Microsoft, the 50-day is currently at around $502, about 4% below current levels around $524 and just over 6% off the stock's all-time closing high. That's a decent-sized pullback to start a position. From there, however, we don't see much in terms of support until we get to around $455, a level that previously served as resistance earlier this year before it was breached in late May. A move to this level would put shares at under 30 times fiscal year 2026 earnings estimates, about the midpoint of the P/E range seen over the past five years. From there, the 200-day moving average is around $438, a roughly 16% decline from current levels. Bottom line While the 200-day moving averages are pretty far down for both Microsoft and Meta, those levels are not out of the question if there were a broad-based market pullback. The 200-day moving average is usually a solid level to hold your nose and do some buying, assuming that there's no change to your longer-term investment thesis. That said, we don't foresee a major correction as the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates next month and possibly two more times before year-end. The Fed cut rates three times at the end of 2024 but has kept them steady ever since. We also don't think that trying to play a correction is in the best interest of those looking to make money. In the words of famed investor Peter Lynch, \"Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in the corrections themselves.\" (See here for a full list of the stocks INJim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

Jeff Smith's Starboard Value increased its stake in Salesforce by 47% during the second quarter, according to a securities filing , ending the month of June with a position worth $341.5 million. Starboard also added to its Salesforce holdings in the first quarter. The market is taking note Friday, sending shares up 4%, because Starboard was the first activist hedge fund to start publicly pushing for changes at Salesforce in late 2022 and into 2023. Multiple other activist firms swarmed around Salesforce and echoed Starboard's calls for greater efficiency and profitability, among other demands. It proved to be a wildly successful activist campaign, with shares of Salesforce almost doubling in 2023 after losing nearly half their value in 2022. Starboard had sold down a large chunk of its stake before beginning to buy this year. Starboard's increased stake in Salesforce could once more positively influence the company's direction, according to D.A. Davidson analysts led by Gil Luria. \"We believe this is a signal there will be another round of investor activism and increased pressure on management to refocus on growth of the core business, additional margin expansion, and hold off on dilutive M & A,\" Luria wrote to clients Friday. In the same note, D.A. Davidson upgraded the stock to a hold-equivalent rating from sell, arguing the company's challenges have been appropriately priced in. Indeed, Salesforce entered Friday having lost more than a third of its value after closing at a record of $368 a share on Dec. 4. CRM 1Y mountain Salesforce's stock performance over the past 12 months. Among Salesforce's issues is a belief that artificial intelligence is threatening the business model of enterprise software companies that count on their customers growing their headcount, thereby paying for more software licenses. It's often called the seat-based model, and earlier this week, its perceived shortcomings in the generative AI era was the subject of a note from Melius Research. There is \"some truth\" to Melius Research's idea that AI is eating software, Jim Cramer acknowledged during the August Monthly Meeting on Thursday. At the same time, the Club hasn't been ready to cut bait on its long-held position in the stock. Starboard's intentions this time around aren't clear — the firm didn't respond to CNBC's request for comment — but its maneuvering nevertheless represents a glimmer of hope. In October 2024, Smith of Starboard complimented Salesforce's profitability improvements but said he still believed \"there's a lot more to go.\" \"If they execute on this plan, the stock could turn around in the same way it did last time Starboard helped CRM steer the ship,\" D.A. Davidson's Luria wrote to CNBC in an email Friday. Luria kept his price target unchanged at $225 a share, which is below where the stock is trading Friday. Luria had been among those on the Street worried that Salesforce was neglecting its core business for a premature bet on Agentforce, its agentic AI product suite. It was at the heart of D.A. Davidson's decision in April to initially downgrade Salesforce to a sell rating. Jim disagreed with the sentiment at the time, saying he believed CEO Marc Benioff was backing Agentforce because the Salesforce's core business was performing in line with expectations. That wasn't the last of Salesforce's woes. Its decision in late May to buy data management firm Informatica for $8 billion faced some skepticism, and its quarterly results released around the same time failed to quiet the doubters. RBC Capital Markets analysts, for example, downgraded the stock and expressed concerns that Benioff was slipping back into his old habit of relying on acquisitions to stoke topline growth — a big topic of conversation during the activist battle of 2022-23. At the time, Jim pushed back on the notion that Salesforce was out of innovative ideas and lent support to Benioff's Agentforce push. Salesforce said in May that Agentforce generates over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and has secured 8,000 deals since its launch last fall, with half of them being paid deals. The Club recognizes that Salesforce has been painful to own lately. \"I keep coming back to the fact that [Benioff] says business is really strong,\" said Jim when asked by a Club member about Salesforce during the August Monthly Meeting. And yet, the stock chart is ugly. \"What happens when [business is] not strong?\" Jim asked rhetorically. A few important events loom that will help shape our thinking. On Sept. 3, Salesforce reports its fiscal 2026 second quarter. Then, in mid-October, its annual Dreamforce conference is on the schedule. \"We have to make a decision around\" Salesforce by the time of Dreamforce, Jim said.

Jeff Smith's Starboard Value increased its stake in Salesforce by 47% during the second quarter, according to a securities filing , ending the month of June with a position worth $341.5 million. Starboard also added to its Salesforce holdings in the first quarter. The market is taking note Friday, sending shares up 4%, because Starboard was the first activist hedge fund to start publicly pushing for changes at Salesforce in late 2022 and into 2023. Multiple other activist firms swarmed around Salesforce and echoed Starboard's calls for greater efficiency and profitability, among other demands. It proved to be a wildly successful activist campaign, with shares of Salesforce almost doubling in 2023 after losing nearly half their value in 2022. Starboard had sold down a large chunk of its stake before beginning to buy this year. Starboard's increased stake in Salesforce could once more positively influence the company's direction, according to D.A. Davidson analysts led by Gil Luria. \"We believe this is a signal there will be another round of investor activism and increased pressure on management to refocus on growth of the core business, additional margin expansion, and hold off on dilutive M & A,\" Luria wrote to clients Friday. In the same note, D.A. Davidson upgraded the stock to a hold-equivalent rating from sell, arguing the company's challenges have been appropriately priced in. Indeed, Salesforce entered Friday having lost more than a third of its value after closing at a record of $368 a share on Dec. 4. CRM 1Y mountain Salesforce's stock performance over the past 12 months. Among Salesforce's issues is a belief that artificial intelligence is threatening the business model of enterprise software companies that count on their customers growing their headcount, thereby paying for more software licenses. It's often called the seat-based model, and earlier this week, its perceived shortcomings in the generative AI era was the subject of a note from Melius Research. There is \"some truth\" to Melius Research's idea that AI is eating software, Jim Cramer acknowledged during the August Monthly Meeting on Thursday. At the same time, the Club hasn't been ready to cut bait on its long-held position in the stock. Starboard's intentions this time around aren't clear — the firm didn't respond to CNBC's request for comment — but its maneuvering nevertheless represents a glimmer of hope. In October 2024, Smith of Starboard complimented Salesforce's profitability improvements but said he still believed \"there's a lot more to go.\" \"If they execute on this plan, the stock could turn around in the same way it did last time Starboard helped CRM steer the ship,\" D.A. Davidson's Luria wrote to CNBC in an email Friday. Luria kept his price target unchanged at $225 a share, which is below where the stock is trading Friday. Luria had been among those on the Street worried that Salesforce was neglecting its core business for a premature bet on Agentforce, its agentic AI product suite. It was at the heart of D.A. Davidson's decision in April to initially downgrade Salesforce to a sell rating. Jim disagreed with the sentiment at the time, saying he believed CEO Marc Benioff was backing Agentforce because the Salesforce's core business was performing in line with expectations. That wasn't the last of Salesforce's woes. Its decision in late May to buy data management firm Informatica for $8 billion faced some skepticism, and its quarterly results released around the same time failed to quiet the doubters. RBC Capital Markets analysts, for example, downgraded the stock and expressed concerns that Benioff was slipping back into his old habit of relying on acquisitions to stoke topline growth — a big topic of conversation during the activist battle of 2022-23. At the time, Jim pushed back on the notion that Salesforce was out of innovative ideas and lent support to Benioff's Agentforce push. Salesforce said in May that Agentforce generates over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and has secured 8,000 deals since its launch last fall, with half of them being paid deals. The Club recognizes that Salesforce has been painful to own lately. \"I keep coming back to the fact that [Benioff] says business is really strong,\" said Jim when asked by a Club member about Salesforce during the August Monthly Meeting. And yet, the stock chart is ugly. \"What happens when [business is] not strong?\" Jim asked rhetorically. A few important events loom that will help shape our thinking. On Sept. 3, Salesforce reports its fiscal 2026 second quarter. Then, in mid-October, its annual Dreamforce conference is on the schedule. \"We have to make a decision around\" Salesforce by the time of Dreamforce, Jim said.

Tech stocks tanked and private capital dried up, forcing cash-burning startups to turn their attention away from growth and toward efficiency and profitability.\nThe roadblock appeared to be loosening earlier this year, when companies like StubHub and Klarna filed their prospectuses, but then President Donald Trump roiled the markets in April with his plans for sweeping tariffs. Roadshows were put on indefinite hold.\nThe president's tariff agenda has since stabilized a bit, and investor money is pouring into tech, pushing the Nasdaq to record levels, up more than 40% from this year's low in April. Optimism is growing that the hefty backlog of high-valued startups will continue to clear as CEOs and venture capitalists gain confidence that the public markets will welcome their top-tier companies.\nAhead of Figma's debut, NYSE president Lynn Martin told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" that immense demand for that offering could \"open the floodgates\" for the rest of the market. And earlier this week, Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman told \"Fast Money\" that there's a \"very healthy list\" of companies looking to IPO in the second half of this year, ahead of the holiday season.\n\"I've been meeting a lot of CEOs, getting them prepared to think about what they want in the public markets and where they're going,\" Friedman said.\nThere are more than two-dozen venture-backed U.S. tech companies valued at $10 billion or more, according to CB Insights. StubHub has updated its prospectus, suggesting an offering is coming soon.\n\"The IPO window is open,\" said Rick Heitzmann, a partner at venture firm FirstMark, in an interview with CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" this week. \"You've seen across industry, broad-based support for IPOs, and therefore, we're advising companies we're investing in to get ready and go public.\"\nAnother big topic among VCs and bankers is the regulatory environment.\nThe Biden administration took heat from startup investors for cracking down on big acquisitions, mostly attributable to Lina Khan's perceived heavy hand at the Federal Trade Commission, while also failing to ease restrictions that they say make it less appealing for companies to go public than to stay private.\nPaul Atkins, the new head of the SEC, said in July he wants to \"make IPOs great again,\" by removing some of the impediments around the complexity of disclosures and litigation risk. He hasn't offered many specific recommendations.\nFriedman told CNBC that the first conversation she had with Atkins after he took the job was about making it easier and more attractive for companies to go public.\n\"The conversation was constructive along many fronts, looking at disclosure requirements, the proxy process, other things that really make it harder for companies to be public and navigate the public markets,\" Friedman said. \"He's as interested as we are, so hopefully we'll turn that into great action.\"\nIn addition to the big gains notched by Bullish, Figma and Circle, the public markets welcomed online banking provider Chime with a 37% gain last month and trading app eToro with a 29% pop in May. The health-tech market has seen two IPOs: Hinge Health and Omada Health.\nBut it was the roaring debuts of Circle and Figma that sparked chatter of a new bull market for IPOs. Figma jumped 250% on IPO day after pricing shares a dollar ahead of an updated range. Circle's value more than doubled after the stablecoin issuer also priced above the expected range.\nThat sort of price action reignited a debate ahead of the last IPO boom in 2020 and 2021, when venture capitalist Bill Gurley made the case that big first-day pops suggest intentionally mispriced offerings that hurt the company and hand easy money to new investors. Gurley has advocated for direct listings, where companies list shares at a price that effectively matches demand.\nAs Figma was hitting the market, Gurley was back at it, referring to the big gains as an \"expected & fully intentional\" outcome benefitting clients of major investment banks\n\"They bought it at $33 last night and can sell it today for over $90,\" he wrote. In a follow-up post, he said, \"I would have loved to see DLs replace IPOs — it just makes sense to match supply/demand. But Wall Street may just be too addicted to the massive customer give-aways.\"\nLise Buyer, founder of IPO advisory firm Class V Group, wrote on LinkedIn that the company gets to make the call on where it prices the stock and that plenty of thought gets put into the process. Also, in the IPO, companies are selling only a small percentage of outstanding shares — in Figma's case roughly 7% — so if they deliver on results, \"there will very likely be plenty of future opportunities to sell more shares at higher prices.\"\nThat's already happening.\nCircle said this week that it's offering another 10 million shares in a secondary offering. And on Friday's, CNBC's Leslie Picker reported that bankers for CoreWeave, which is up 150% since its March IPO, orchestrated some block trades this week.\nBut Buyer warns that tech markets have a history of overheating. While there's always a difference between what institutions are willing to pay in an IPO and what exuberant retail investors will pay, it's currently \"a gap like we haven't really seen since 1999, 2000,\" Buyer told CNBC, adding \"and, of course, we know how that ended.\"\nCompared to the dot-com bubble, businesses that are going public now have sizable revenue and actual fundamentals, but that doesn't mean the IPO pops are sustainable, she said.\n\"It's almost like we had several years of Prohibition,\" Buyer said, referring to a period a century ago when alcohol was banned in the U.S. \"Folks, in some cases, are drinking to excess in the IPO market.\"", "content_hash": "5a1e683d963e784e5014c881294b22b2", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The meeting was held in Alaska, which was once Russian territory.\n\"There were many, many points that we agreed on … I would say a couple of big ones that we haven't quite got there, but we've made some headway,\" Trump said at a joint press conference with Putin.

There are just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant.

So domestic consumption, younger generation consumption, is a more stable or less vulnerable sector,\" Ma added.\nMixue has emerged as the sector's heavyweight, operating more than 46,000 stores worldwide by the end of 2024. That makes it the world's largest food-and-beverage chain by outlet count — ahead of McDonald's, Starbucks and Subway. Its ultra-low pricing and high-volume model lean heavily on franchising.\n\"In 2024, they are growing at around 22% in terms of new store growth,\" Ma noted.\nFranchising is central to the bubble tea industry. Most large bubble tea chains don't run the shops themselves. Nearly every outlet is franchised. Parent companies earn from supplying ingredients and equipment, and collecting fees, while franchisees shoulder the costs of rent, labor and utilities.\nThat model fuels rapid growth but comes with trade-offs: maintaining quality and avoiding store cannibalization gets harder as outlets multiply.\n\"The normal payback period for the business owner, for the franchisee, is between 18 to 24 months,\" said Ma, estimating store closure rates at roughly 20% across the market.\nBut overseas expansion is no guarantee of success. CNBC's China reporter Elaine Yu noted that replicating the domestic formula abroad comes with added challenges.\n\"Supply chains are harder to control, and consumer tastes differ from city to city. That's why brands are adapting to regional flavors and different store formats to win over local customers,\" Yu said.\nMarket saturation at home, rising costs and intense price wars are also testing the resilience of these brands.

Alternative investments were defined to include private market investments, real estate, commodities, infrastructure projects, lifetime income strategies — and notably, \"holdings in actively managed investment vehicles that are investing in digital assets.\" (Curiously, crypto was the only asset class where \"actively managed\" was specified versus the \"direct or indirect\" language used for everything else — a regulatory breadcrumb worth exploring.)\nThe crypto industry — at least its asset management segment — cheered this latest presidential order granting crypto managers access to a $12 trillion pool of very sticky U.S. investment money. CoinDesk's coverage included industry reactions like this from Bitwise's Matt Hougan: \"This order isn't about the government saying 'crypto belongs in 401(k)s.' It's about the government getting out of the way and letting people make their own decisions.\"\nHerein lies the problem: most people who participate in 401k plans don't make their own decisions, or do so hastily. In fact, there is a law in place to make sure participants don't have to decide at all.\nThe Pension Protection Act of 2006 solved a thorny problem for employers: what to do when 401k participants don't choose their own investments. Previously, employers faced potential liability for any default investment that performed poorly. The act gives employers safe harbor protection if they make default elections a \"Qualified Default Investment Alternative\" (QDIA) — usually a target-date or balanced fund. HR departments no longer had to worry about being sued for picking the \"wrong\" default option.\nWhile this solved the employer liability problem, it created an opportunity for folks to neglect one of the most important investment decisions of their lives. Participants typically join their 401k during the chaos of starting a new job — dealing with health insurance, taxes, onboarding and actually learning the job. Faced with investment choices they don't understand, many simply go with the flow and accept whatever default option their employer has selected, often a target-date fund with a retirement date that roughly matches their age. The glidepath concept — automatically shifting from stocks to bonds as retirement approaches — creates a false sense of security. Participants assume they're \"all set\" simply by not opting out, and never revisit the decision.

Tongon, which began production in 2010, has seen its reserves decline in recent years and is projected to cease operations by 2027 without major reinvestment. Selling the mine would free up capital for Barrick to pursue higher-return opportunities, particularly in copper and long-life gold projects.\nThe potential sale reflects Barrick’s broader strategy of focusing on assets with strong margins and long production horizons. Management has signaled increased emphasis on copper, which now accounts for roughly one-fifth of the company’s output, with a target of raising that share to 30 percent by 2029. Divesting from smaller, aging mines like Tongon aligns with this shift, enabling Barrick to redeploy resources toward growth-oriented ventures in regions such as Latin America, North America, and Central Asia.\nBarrick Mining Corporation (NYSE:B) is a global leader in gold and copper production, with operations spanning North and South America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.

The company’s shares slid more than 24% to end at $7.83 on Wednesday, according to Yahoo Finance.\n-\nThe clinical trial’s timing will determine when the robot developer submits its de novo filing to the Food and Drug Administration, From said on Vicarious’ second-quarter earnings call. Vicarious had planned to make its FDA submission in late 2026, after delaying the start of the trial.\n-\nThe company plans to conduct an assessment over about four to six weeks to gauge readiness for verification of the system, From said, adding he would work with Vicarious’ board and investor base to evaluate the capital strategy for supporting its goals.\nDive Insight:\nVicarious, which counts large for-profit hospital operator HCA Healthcare and Bill Gates among its investors, is developing a single-port robotic system for abdominal procedures that will vie for market share with robot industry leader Intuitive Surgical. Vicarious is initially targeting hernia, gallbladder, gastrointestinal and gynecology procedures.\nFrom, who joined Vicarious as co-founder Adam Sachs moved into the role of president, said the single-port robotic market is still in its early stages, and he believes the company’s differentiated platform and strong technical foundation will advance minimally invasive surgery.\n“I see an industry here, which is dominated by one player, and I see a lot of others that are trying to copy what they're doing, and I saw this team wasn't,” said From. “This is a project and this is a system and a company that is worth investing in for the long term, because this is a system that isn't just a copycat. This is a system that deserves market share.”\nVicarious ended the second quarter with about $24 million in cash and expects its cash burn to be about $50 million for fiscal 2025.

But while the rails are evolving, current models for tokenized equities remain fragmented, opaque and misaligned with the safeguards that define the traditional securities markets.\nToday, two dominant approaches exist:\nThe wrapper model involves tokenized IOUs that provide synthetic exposure to existing equities rather than direct ownership. These tokens do not grant holders any governance rights or enforceable claims to the underlying shares. Transferability is typically restricted to closed ecosystems, liquidity is siloed across issuer-controlled platforms and regulation can be murky, with many products not available to U.S. persons.\nThe on-chain issuance model means creating a native digital share class issued via blockchain. While this approach aligns more closely with the legal definition of security, it introduces operational complexities and scalability challenges. Active issuer participation is mandatory, liquidity remains fragmented between the on-chain tokens and traditional securities and broker-dealer standards are inconsistent, complicating participation for regulated financial institutions and investors.\nWhat’s missing is a tokenization model that combines the speed, accessibility and composability of tokenization with the structure, safeguards and clarity of traditional capital markets. Fortunately, that model already exists elsewhere: depository receipts (DRs).\nIn many ways, DRs were the original form of tokenization. For over a century, American depository receipts (ADRs) have enabled foreign equities to trade in the U.S. through a regulated, custody-backed structure. Today, this framework can also bridge traditional securities with tokenized infrastructure, offering a scalable and legally sound foundation for modern equities.\nThe case for tokenized DRs\nBy combining blockchain rails with the legal and operational framework of DRs, market participants can unlock broader participation and real-time asset servicing without compromising on investor protections or operational standards.\nOther benefits include:\n-\nPreservation of shareholder rights\nUnlike synthetic wrappers, the ADR structure perfects shareholder rights, enabling them to be passed along to token holders. This includes economic entities, such as dividends and other corporate actions, as well as governance rights such as voting.\n-\nClear segregation of duties\nA regulated custodian bank safekeeps the underlying shares in a segregated, bankruptcy-remote structure, held solely for the benefit of ADR holders. An independent, market-neutral depositary facilitates DR issuances and cancellations, maintains accurate records using an SEC-registered transfer agent and performs daily reconciliation with the underlying assets. The depositary has no ownership claim on the underlying shares themselves.", "content_hash": "b0ecf332340bdbb5ed90594d5906aae6", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

While the cryptocurrency continues to be volatile, XRP has had an epic run since President Donald Trump won the election last November, ushering in a new, more welcoming regulatory era for cryptocurrencies. XRP has benefited immensely. With the token hovering around the $3 level, as of this writing, is $4 on the horizon?\nWhat could catapult XRP higher\nOne of the reasons XRP benefited from Trump's win so much is that the Trump administration installed new cabinet members to lead most regulatory agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In 2020, the SEC sued Ripple, the company behind XRP, and the company's co-founder and CEO for allegedly selling XRP as an unregistered security in 2013.\nThe case had implications for the crypto sector and cast a negative light on XRP. While it looked like Ripple was heading for victory in the case, new leadership at the SEC expedited a resolution. Other new regulations have paved the way for an eventual SEC-approved spot-XRP exchange-traded fund, which would likely improve liquidity and broaden institutional interest in XRP.\nRipple also continues to grow its business with mainstream banks and institutional traders. This year, the company acquired the prime brokerage Hidden Road, which it could use to integrate XRP within more mainstream finance activities. Furthermore, Ripple launched RLUSD, its own U.S.-dollar-backed stablecoin, which XRP serves as a bridge token for. A bridge token is a digital asset that allows for the transfer of value between different blockchain networks.\nAnother way for XRP to draw interest would be to continue to drive a compelling use case with its network. XRP can currently process 1,500 transactions per second (TPS), making it ideal for cross-border payments. Other crypto networks boast even higher TPS, but XRP has an interesting ecosystem around it with Ripple, which has onboarded large mainstream financial clients and now has another bridge to mainstream finance with Hidden Road.

And the gold rush is far from over.\nNo longer do business leaders need to spend decades building the next big thing to join the ranks of Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos at the top of the billionaires club; they just need to build an AI company.\nThere are now some 498 AI unicorns, or private AI companies, valued at $1 billion or more, with a combined value of $2.7 trillion, according to CB Insights.\nA complete 100 of them were founded since 2023. There are more than 1,300 AI startups with valuations of over $100 million.\nTake Mira Murati, the former CTO of OpenAI, for example. Her startup, Thinking Machines Lab, has just closed a $2 billion seed round at a $12 billion valuation.\nWe’ve not seen a tech boom like this since the late 90s and early 2000s, which propelled many of the tech giants of today, from eBay to Google, into the mainstream. While the dot-com boom can’t be directly compared because the “unicorn” label didn’t exist then and billion-dollar private valuations weren’t tracked, AI is creating billionaires at a record pace—and could even ring in an era of trillionaires.\nThe AI billionaire boom\nWith a boom in company valuation also comes hefty paydays for its founders, investors, and C-suite.\nIn March, Bloomberg reported that four of the largest private AI companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Safe Superintelligence, and Anysphere, have created at least 15 billionaires with a combined net worth of $38 billion. More than a dozen unicorns have been crowned since then.\nAI startups are receiving massive investments, resulting in high valuations and wealth for founders and early investors. According to data from Crunchbase, global venture funding in 2024 edged above 2023’s totals, with AI showing the biggest leap in amounts year-to-year.\nFor the founders of Anthropic, including CEO Dario Amodei, reports indicate the Claude chatbot maker is in talks to raise $5 billion at a valuation of $170 billion. Amodei’s net worth is now over the billion-dollar mark.\nAlso joining the billionaire club is Liang Wenfeng. The founder and CEO of Chinese AI company DeepSeek is likely worth over $1 billion based on the estimated value of the low-cost AI company.\nAnd as investments into AI continue to boom, so do the net worths of billionaires working in them. Nvidia’s CFO Colette Kress and EVP Jay Puri have become billionaires, joining its CEO Jensen Huang after its market cap surpassed $4 trillion. Similarly, Palantir’s first billion-dollar quarter is dramatically increasing the wealth of the company’s cofounders and C-suite.

President Trump’s plan to repay the debt centers on tariffs, cost-cutting, and growth programs. Critics argue the impact is likely to be minimal. Meanwhile, White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai told Fortune the debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen under Trump and will keep improving with pro-growth policies and record tariff revenues.\nPresident Trump has got plenty of ideas about how he’ll address national debt: He’ll pay it down through tariffs, or offset some of the borrowing thanks to proceeds from his “golden visa” program.\nHe’s also said he’ll rebalance the debt-to-GDP ratio by growing the economy, and would reduce the need for as much borrowing thanks to initiatives like the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\nThis month, America’s national debt surpassed $37 trillion—a record milestone that the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) had previously believed would be hit by 2030. But one pandemic later, the gargantuan spending the government undertook to steer the economy through the crisis is making its mark.\nUncle Sam is adding a trillion more dollars to the debt burden every five months, noted Michael A. Peterson, CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, an organization that works with policymakers, economists, and the public to advocate for a more sustainable fiscal outlook.\n“During a time of economic growth, it is highly irresponsible to run deficits this large … At this pace, we will run through the recent $5 trillion debt limit increase—the largest in history—in just two years. We are no longer in a Great Recession or a global pandemic, but our fiscal policy keeps acting like we are,” Peterson said.\n“As our debt continues to rise,” he noted, “at some point the financial markets will lose confidence in our ability to overcome the politics to solve this problem. International lenders are watching, and all three ratings agencies have now downgraded U.S. credit. The question is, How many more trillions will we add before we decide to stop? Despite today’s unfortunate milestone, it’s not too late to act. We should reform our budget before the damage is made even worse. Policymakers have many well-known options to stabilize our debt and put us on a stronger path for the next generation.”\nWhite House deputy press secretary Kush Desai countered to Fortune: “America’s debt-to-GDP ratio has actually declined since President Trump took office—and as the administration’s pro-growth policies of tax cuts, rapid deregulation, more efficient government spending, and fair trade deals continue taking effect and America’s economic resurgence accelerates, that ratio will continue trending in the right direction.\n“That’s on top of the record revenue that President Trump’s tariff policies are bringing in for the federal government.”\nPeterson isn’t alone in his concern. Over the past few years, alarm bells are increasingly being rung by some of the most notable names in finance and economics. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon believes it is the “most predictable crisis” in history. Ray Dalio believes it will trigger an “economic heart attack,” and the usually neutral Jerome Powell says it’s past time for an “adult conversation” about the issue.\nTrump’s national debt policies\nThus far, the White House’s cost-cutting and revenue-raising initiatives haven’t been without success. At the time of writing, DOGE’s savings calculator claims to have axed $202 billion from the government’s bottom line.\nThat figure equates to $1,254.66 in savings per taxpayer. However, given the fact that debt per capita, at the time of writing, sits at a little over $108,000 per person in America, the organization formerly headed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk still has a long way to go.\nLikewise, President Trump’s tariffs have generated significant returns in the past few months. This week the CRFB reported tariff revenue into the U.S. has more than tripled from approximately $7 billion last year to approximately $25 billion in late July.\nSuch figures are not to be sniffed at (wherever you come down in the debate about whether American consumers or foreign counterparts will be paying the price), and revenues are expected to continue rising.\nThat said, $25 billion still equates to less than 0.07% of the national debt at the time of writing. If the U.S. continued to plow every penny of its current tariff revenue into national debt as it stands, it would still take nearly 120 years to pay off.\nAnd of course, that figure and its respective interest payment is going up by the minute.\nAll of the above comes ahead of the issue of President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which the Congressional Budget Office estimates will add $3 trillion to the deficit between 2025 and 2034.\nThe White House counters that the act will rebalance the all-important debt-to-GDP ratio, which is the fundamental concern of economists. The ratio is key because it signals to foreign investors whether the growth and size of America’s economy is enough to balance its debts. If the ratio falls too out of balance, foreign buyers of American debt may fear they won’t receive their returns, or demand higher interest rates to offset the risk.\nThe government can take action on either side of the ratio to rebalance the books. It can either increase growth to bring down the disparity, or cut spending to reduce the debt.\nThe current ratio is at 121%, the St. Louis Fed reports (down from Q4 of 2024 at 122%), and the White House insists this will fall further to 94% because the OBBBA will generate economic activity. “President Trump is supersizing hardworking Americans’ paychecks and restoring fiscal sanity, helping solve our debt crisis for the long run,” the White House wrote in June.", "content_hash": "3f6c47724d3b69b1d91e75d9642cf5a2", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Two new landing zones at the base would also be built. At-sea landings would also be increased.\nIn recommending disapproval, commission staff cited what it called insufficient information about the plan and concerns over noise pollution and wildlife disturbance from more frequent, louder sonic booms as SpaceX launch activity escalates.\nThe staff report also cited the need for more frequent closures of public beaches and campgrounds that lie within the launch hazard zones around the base.\n(Reporting by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Sonali Paul)", "content_hash": "d8226c541179fc6d108cb16c7284db75", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

That implies heavy trading by institutional investors initiating contracts on both sides of the trade.\nFor example, investors who are buying these calls believe that AAL will rise over $14.45, or +10.6% from today over the next month and a half in order for the intrinsic value of the calls to rise over cost:\n$14.45 - $14.00 cost = $0.45 (i.e., the ask side today of the call option premium)\nHowever, it's likely that if this occurs in the next two to three weeks, the price of the options will be significantly higher than 45 cents. That way, the investor won't have to wait until expiration to make a profit.\nThat is due to the extrinsic value that is left in the premium, as there is time left for the stock to rise further.\nOn the other hand, sellers of these calls believe that they are getting a good deal as well. They may be long AAL stock today or bought shares at today's price. That way, selling covered calls brings them an immediate yield of 3.37%:\n$0.44 premium received / $13.06 cost of 100 shares = 0.03369 = 3.369% for just 44 days\nThat works out to an annualized expected return (ER) of at least 26.95% (i.e., 3.369% x 8x). This, of course, assumes that the same yield could be made by a trader repeating this play 8 times in a year (which may not be the case).\nLet's look at why investors may be bullish on AAL stock.\nStrong Cash Flow and Forecasts\nAmerican Airlines reported $14.392 billion in Q2 revenue, up slightly from last year's $14.332 billion (i.e., +0.4% Y/Y). Its first-half revenue was up slightly (+0.14%) to $26.943 billion.\nMoreover, the airline was able to squeeze out more cash flow from this revenue.\nFor example, its operating cash flow (OCF) was $3.419 billion for the first half, compared to $3.308 billion last year (according to Stock Analysis quarterly cash flow data), a +3.35% growth rate in OCF.\nThat also means that its operating cash flow margin (i.e., OCF/revenue) rose to 12.7% (i.e. $14.392b/$26.943b) from 12.3% last year ($3.308b/$26.904b).\nThis increase was also reflected in its free cash flow (after lower capex spending this H1). For example, FCF in H1 was $2.096 billion (according to Stock Analysis) vs. $1.833 billion last year (H1 2024).\nThat means the airline generated stronger FCF margins (i.e., 7.78% FCF margin in H1 2025 vs. 6.81% last year's H1). (Note the company talks about adj. FCF in its report, but we have not adjusted the FCF figures).\nForecasts. As a result, we can forecast significantly higher FCF going forward.\nFor example, analysts now project revenue between $54.408 billion in 2025 and $57.8 billion in 2026. So, using the next 12-month (NTM) revenue forecast of $56.1 billion with a 7.7% FCF margin, we can forecast FCF:\n$56.1 b revenue NTM x 0.077 = $4.32 billion in FCF\nThat would be well over the $1.563 billion in FCF American Airlines has generated in the last 12 months, according to Stock Analysis. It could push AAL stock significantly higher over the next 12 months (NTM).\nPrice Targets for AAL Stock\nFor example, even though American Airlines does not now pay a dividend, let's assume it eventually paid out less than half (33%) of the $4.3 billion forecast free cash flow. Let's also assume the market gives AAL stock a 10% dividend yield.\nHere is how that would value AAL stock:\n$4.32 billion x 33% = $1.43 billion dividend payments\n$1.43 billion / 0.10 = $14.33 billion market value\nThat is still +66% higher than AAL stock's current market cap of $8.617 billion, according to Yahoo! Finance. That is, AAL stock is potentially worth +66% more or $21.66 per share.\nJust as a double check, let's assume that its H1 FCF of $2.096 billion doubles to $4.192 billion. If it paid out 1/3rd of that amount or $1.4 billion, and the market gave it a 10% yield, the value would be:\n$1.4b / 0.1 = $14.0 billion, i.e., +62.5% upside\nThat could be why analysts now have higher price targets. For example, AnaChart.com says 17 analysts now have an average price target of $16.35 per share.\nThe bottom line is that AAL stock looks cheap today. That could be why there is so much interest in its call options for expiry on Sept. 26.\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

Covrig Analytics said last Friday that reports of smaller cane yields from Brazil's sugar farmers may knock Brazil's 2025/26 sugarcane production below 600 MMT, much lower than Brazilian government crop forecasting agency Conab's forecast of 663.4 MMT.\nAn excessive short position by funds could exacerbate any short-covering rally in sugar futures. Last Friday's weekly Commitment of Traders (COT) report showed funds increased their net-short positions in NY sugar futures by +25,923 positions to 151,004 short positions in the week ending August 5, the most in almost 6 years.\nLast Tuesday, sugar prices fell to 5-week lows on signs of stronger sugar production in Brazil. On July 31, Unica reported Brazil's Center-South sugar output in the first half of July rose +15% y/y to 3.4 MMT. Also, the amount of sugarcane being crushed for sugar by Brazil's sugar mills has increased to 54% from 50% the same time last year.\nThe outlook for higher sugar exports from India is negative for sugar prices after Bloomberg reported that India may permit local sugar mills to export sugar in the next season, which starts in October, as abundant monsoon rains may produce a bumper sugar crop. India's Meteorological Department reported Tuesday that cumulative monsoon rain in India was 500.8 mm as of August 4, or 4% above normal. Also, the Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association said last Thursday that it will seek permission to export 2 MMT of sugar in 2025/26.\nThe outlook for higher sugar production in India, the world's second-largest producer, is bearish for prices. On June 2, India's National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories projected that India's 2025/26 sugar production would climb +19% y/y to 35 MMT, citing larger planted cane acreage. That would follow a -17.5% y/y decline in India's sugar production in 2024/25 to a 5-year low of 26.2 MMT, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).\nSugar prices retreated through early July, with NY sugar falling to a 4.25-year low and London sugar sliding to a 4-year low, driven by expectations of a sugar surplus in the 2025/26 season. On June 30, commodities trader Czarnikow projected a 7.5 MMT global sugar surplus for the 2025/26 season, the largest surplus in 8 years. On May 22, the USDA, in its biannual report, projected that global 2025/26 sugar production would increase by +4.7% y/y to a record 189.318 MMT, with global sugar ending stocks at 41.188 MMT, up 7.5% y/y.\nSugar prices also have support from reduced sugar production in Brazil. Unica reported last Thursday that the cumulative 2025/26 Brazil Center-South sugar output through mid-July fell by -9.2% y/y to 15.655 MMT. Last month, Conab, Brazil's government crop forecasting agency, said 2024/25 Brazil sugar production fell by -3.4% y/y to 44.118 MMT, citing lower sugarcane yields due to drought and excessive heat.\nThe outlook for higher sugar production in Thailand is bearish for sugar prices. On May 2, Thailand's Office of the Cane and Sugar Board reported that Thailand's 2024/25 sugar production rose +14% y/y to 10.00 MMT. Thailand is the world's third-largest sugar producer and the second-largest exporter of sugar.\nThe International Sugar Organization (ISO) raised its 2024/25 global sugar deficit forecast to a 9-year high of -5.47 MMT on May 15, up from a February forecast of -4.88 MMT. This indicates a tightening market following the 2023/24 global sugar surplus of 1.31 MMT. ISO also cut its 2024/25 global sugar production forecast to 174.8 MMT from a February forecast of 175.5 MMT.\nThe USDA, in its bi-annual report released May 22, projected that global 2025/26 sugar production would climb +4.7% y/y to a record 189.318 MMT and that global 2025/26 human sugar consumption would increase +1.4% y/y to a record 177.921 MMT. The USDA also forecasted that 2025/26 global sugar ending stocks would climb +7.5% y/y to 41.188 MMT. The USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) predicted that Brazil's 2025/26 sugar production would rise +2.3% y/y to a record 44.7 MMT FAS predicted that India's 2025/26 sugar production would rise +25% y/y to 35.3 MMT due to favorable monsoon rains and increased sugar acreage. FAS predicted that Thailand's 2025/26 sugar production will climb +2% y/y to 10.3 MMT.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

BBB Foods(NYSE: TBBB) isn't a name that most investors are familiar with, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Toiling away in obscurity can often be a ground floor opportunity, as long as the floor doesn't buckle and dump you into the basement.\nBBB Foods operates in a sleepy and low-margin industry. It's also based in a North American country that isn't exactly a hotbed for investors. BBB Foods is the parent company of Tiendas 3B, a chain of discount grocery stores that is expanding its small-box empire across Mexico.\nYou might not expect your next potential growth stock to be a retailer in Mexico trying to drive prices in an industry with already razor-thin markups even lower. BBB Foods went public with little fanfare last year. However, then you start seeing the accelerating growth, the market share gains, and the upside.\nGrab a cart. Let's go shopping.\nIt checks out\nIf you're familiar with Aldi or Trader Joe's, you can start to picture what one of the 3,031 Tiendas 3B locations looks like. However, you would have to shrink it down to the size of a large convenience store. There are sometimes as few as three employees working at a time.\nResist the urge to compare this to a bodega. There are a lot more products stocked at a BBB Foods location, and at rock-bottom prices with a heavy flow of shopper traffic. Unlike a bodega, where customers pay a premium for convenience and to cover the stiff overhead relative to the store's modest sales, BBB Foods has volume turnover and scalability on its side. All of an average store's operating costs was just 10.5% of the revenue it generated in its latest quarter.\nThe three Bs don't stand for the company's credit rating. The moniker is short for Bueno, Bonito, and Barato, Spanish for \"nice, attractive, and affordable.\" It's not just a catchy mantra. Private-label sales accounted for 54% of its sales last year. Aldi and Trader Joe's shoppers know that game, as private labels account for an even larger percentage of those businesses. The beauty of private-label sales is that a growing chain can leverage that strength to negotiate lower prices from different suppliers. In many cases, a Tiendas 3B store will also carry a popular brand-name alternative. Its own label will sell for a 20% to 30% discount.\nBBB Foods went public early last year, the first Mexican company to hit a U.S. exchange in six years. If this is your first time hearing about it, you're in for a surprise. The hard discounter hit the market at $17.50. It closed just above $28 on Tuesday after another blowout quarter, beating the market with a 60% gain since its IPO.\nPrice check\nRevenue rose 38% to the U.S. equivalent of $995 million in the second quarter that it reported this week. It's the strongest growth of BBB Foods' five quarters as a public company. Expansion is a big part of that story. It opened 142 new stores during the quarter, and 528 over the past year. However, the store-level performance is even more impressive.\nComparable-store sales soared 17.7% in the second quarter. This isn't a fluke. It's not coming off of depressed results a year earlier. Comps shot 10.7% higher for the same period last year. This is a concept that is resonating with the hyperlocal communities it serves.\nIt wasn't a perfect quarter as you work your way down the income statement. Margins narrowed slightly, partly on a boost in logistics overhead related to four new regions that it will hit in the second half of this year. History shows that these bumps in administrative costs can be temporary, but for now it ends a streak of four consecutive quarters of positive adjusted earnings.\nThis isn't a bottom-line story right now. Working capital remains negative, as there is an empire to build out here. A chain that topped 3,000 locations during the quarter may seem like a lot, but analysts see room for as many as 15,000 Tiendas 3B stores. With a long runway for top-line growth and analysts targeting reported and adjusted profitability for next year, this is a stock story still early in the telling.\nDo the experts think BBB Foods is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

For much of the year, the iPhone maker lagged behind the broader market, weighed down by trade disputes and tariff-related uncertainties. Year-to-date, AAPL shares are still down roughly 7%, while the S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has climbed about 9.7%. However, the stock is gaining momentum. Apple has risen more than 9% in the last five trading days.\nThe turnaround has been driven by two key developments. First, Apple delivered a solid third-quarter performance, showing resilience and the capacity to generate growth even in a challenging environment. Second, the company expanded its U.S. investment and announced a new American manufacturing program, a move widely interpreted as a step to ease tariff concerns. By boosting its U.S.-based production, Apple is addressing tariff risks and aligning itself more closely with domestic policy priorities. This is particularly important given President Donald Trump’s past criticism of Apple’s reliance on overseas manufacturing.\nApple’s recent steps have been seen as a careful balancing act, strengthening its manufacturing footprint in the U.S. while maintaining a global supply chain that has been key to its margins. The market’s positive reaction suggests investors are encouraged by Apple’s ability to adapt to political and economic pressures.\nWith market sentiment improving for Apple stock, will the momentum sustain?\nApple’s Growth Drivers Remain Intact\nDespite the macro challenges, Apple’s products see solid demand, and its services business continues to post robust growth. This is evident from its latest quarterly results. Apple reported a record June quarter revenue of $94 billion, up 10% from a year ago, with growth in every geographic region.\nOn the hardware front, product sales climbed to $66.6 billion, an 8% year-over-year increase, powered by robust demand for the iPhone and Mac. The company’s ecosystem remains a key strength, with the active installed base of devices hitting all-time highs across every product category and region.\nThe iPhone generated $44.6 billion in revenue, 13% higher than last year, reflecting strong sales of the iPhone 16 lineup. Growth was broad-based, with every region contributing and many emerging markets posting double-digit increases. The number of iPhones in active use set a new record, and Apple achieved its best-ever June quarter for customer upgrades.\nMac sales also impressed, surging 15% to $8 billion. The segment witnessed gains across every region, with particularly strong growth in Greater China, Europe, and the rest of the Asia Pacific. Like the iPhone, the Mac installed base is now at its highest level ever, supported by strong demand from both new and upgrading customers.\nNot every category was in growth mode. iPad revenue came in at $6.6 billion, down 8% due to tough comparisons with last year’s product launches. Still, the iPad’s installed base reached another record, and more than half of buyers were first-time customers, which is a promising sign for future growth. Wearables, Home, and Accessories saw a 9% decline to $7.4 billion, also reflecting difficult year-ago comparisons. But here too, Apple continues to expand its reach, with the Apple Watch installed base hitting a new high and more than half of new watch buyers coming from outside the existing customer base.\nThe services segment was once again a star performer, delivering revenue of $27.4 billion, up 13% year-over-year. This growth was broad-based, with significant gains in cloud services, thanks to rising iCloud subscriptions. Customer engagement remains on an upward trajectory, with both transacting and paid accounts hitting all-time highs, and paid subscriptions growing at a double-digit pace to surpass 1 billion across Apple’s platforms.\nLooking ahead, Apple expects momentum to continue into the current quarter. Management projects total company revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits year-over-year, with services likely to sustain their double-digit growth pace.\nIs Apple Stock a Buy Right Now?\nApple’s iPhone and Mac remain highly desirable, setting the stage for solid growth. Moreover, Apple’s tight-knit ecosystem and the rising contribution of its services division provide a solid base for revenue growth that can help in navigating the broader economic uncertainty. However, trade tensions and tariffs remain a potential headwind and could continue to impact its margins in the short term.\nOn Wall Street, sentiment toward the stock is cautiously optimistic, with analysts maintaining a “Moderate Buy” consensus rating. However, with shares trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 31x and earnings growth projected at just 6.7% for fiscal 2026, much of the positives are already reflected in its current price.\nOn the date of publication, Amit Singh did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Even if you do make contact, research suggests that a batter needs to launch the ball at between 25 and 35 degrees to hit a home run. Too high an angle results in a pop fly; too low likely means a ground-out.\nThankfully for investors -- who are investing in stocks, not hitting balls -- timing doesn't have to be perfect. You can hit an investing home run even if you're late to the party. With that in mind, let's take a closer look at Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) and why I think it can still set up investors for life.\nWhat Palantir has already achieved\nFirst, we must start by acknowledging that Palantir stock has enjoyed an incredible run over the last few years.\nSince Aug. 5, 2022, shares of Palantir have advanced by a mind-blowing 1,500% as of market close Aug. 11. That means an investment of $10,000 made three years ago would now be worth $160,000.\nFurthermore, Palantir's market cap has exploded. In late 2022, it stood at around $12 billion. As of this writing, Palantir's market cap is $440 billion. That makes it the 18th-largest American company, right behind legendary energy giant ExxonMobil (market cap of $456 billion) and ahead of corporate titans including Bank of America ($342 billion), Coca-Cola ($303 billion), and AT&T ($201 billion).\nIn other words, perhaps the \"easy\" money has already been made when it comes to Palantir.\nBut it's important to remember that past performance doesn't tell you where a stock is going. That's why it's crucial to dig into Palantir's financials to understand the company's potential.\nThe AI revolution could carry Palantir's stock much higher\nAs impressive as Palantir's recent stock history is, the company may be just getting started. For proof, consider Palantir's most recent quarterly earnings report. It was an absurdly bullish report, highlighting several key factors.\n-\nThe company reported its first-ever $1 billion revenue quarter, with sales rising 48% year-over-year.\n-\nNet income surged by 144% to $326 million.\n-\nTotal customer count skyrocketed by 43% from a year ago.\nIn short, Palantir's business is booming. Moreover, analysts continue to raise expectations of Palantir's future revenue, as it becomes clear that organizations are lining up for Palantir's AI-powered products.", "content_hash": "5fe2133c24d7dda381323d4b81b8cf63", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

But shortly after Buffett announced he would retire from his CEO role at the end of 2025, Berkshire Hathaway shares started to deflate. They are now down around 15%, and its class B shares are trading below $470. Is this a good opportunity to buy the stock?\nWhat is Berkshire Hathaway, anyway?\nBerkshire Hathaway is classified as a finance sector company largely because it has significant insurance operations. And that isn't a bad label to put on it -- every company has to be categorized somewhere -- but it doesn't do justice to the actual businesses owned by the diversified conglomerate. Berkshire Hathaway's corporate umbrella covers more than 180 wholly owned companies. It also holds a massive portfolio of publicly traded stocks.\nThe variety of businesses in the Berkshire Hathaway empire includes everything from insurance companies to manufacturers, from utilities to retailers, and from railroads to candy makers. And that's far from a complete list -- I could keep going, but you probably get the idea. What investors in Berkshire Hathaway are really buying is more akin to a mutual fund than a traditional company. And that means that when you buy Berkshire Hathaway, what you are really doing is investing alongside Buffett.\nThis is why the leadership transition from Buffett to his hand-picked successor, Greg Abel, is such a big deal. And it is why investors are selling the stock even as the market rises. The conglomerate's incredible long-term performance, which was based on Buffett's unique investment approach, likely contributed to the stock's premium valuation.\nIs it time to jump ship or jump aboard?\nFor investors who only own shares of Berkshire Hathaway because of Buffett, it makes some sense to sell in the wake of his retirement announcement. There is no way to know what Abel will do at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, and he has big shoes to fill. However, there are some things you ought to consider before making a buy or sell decision about the stock.\nFor starters, Buffett is retiring as CEO, but he is not completely leaving the company just yet. He will stay on as the chairman of the board of directors. That means that he will remain Greg Abel's boss. Although Buffett famously has a hands-off management style, when a Berkshire subsidiary needs an assist, he steps in. So we can expect that Abel won't be left adrift. He will still have access to the sage wisdom of the Oracle of Omaha to help him out as needed.\nThen there's the important fact that Abel has worked for Buffett for decades. He is steeped in his mentor's investment approach and has played an important role in the conglomerate's investment process for several years, too. So when he's in the CEO seat, his investment approach will be based on Buffett's approach. Sure, Abel is a different person, so his style won't be identical to Buffett's. But they are highly likely to rhyme.\nAll in all, the CEO transition will be a huge deal for Berkshire Hathaway. But it may not be as dramatic a change as some fear when it comes to how the giant conglomerate operates. That said, Buffett is leaving Abel with a huge cash stockpile -- Berkshire had over $340 billion of cash on its balance sheet at the end of the second quarter. That will be a drag on near-term performance, but could also allow Abel the chance to hit the ground running since it could fund some sizable acquisitions.\nThe future is unknowable, but Berkshire isn't likely to change much\nThe recent slide in Berkshire Hathaway's share price is likely related to Buffett's impending retirement. That event is a big deal, but given Abel's long history with Buffett, it may not be as big a deal as some investors fear. If you only have Berkshire in your portfolio because of Buffett, selling could make sense. But if you simply want to be a long-term investor in a Buffett-like investment approach, then there's literally no better option than Berkshire Hathaway. And the stock's decline below $470 could make this a smart moment for you to get on board.\nShould you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

On August 11, Seaport Global Securities analyst Jay Goldberg initiates coverage on the stock with a Buy rating and a price target of $150.00.\nThe firm believes Arm has revitalized itself after keeping out of the spotlight for years. The company has a big presence in the data center market and is now expanding into automotive.\n“Historically, Arm was highly reliant on the mobile phone market. Mobile is still important, but the company has diversified widely beyond that. It now has considerable penetration in the data center. The company claims that 50% of data center servers now have some form of IP in them. This includes CPUs, AI head nodes, networking and other chips. This is up from 0% less than 10 years ago. We expect their penetration to grow both deeper (more substantial content) and wider (more deployments in coming years). The company also has considerable design traction in automotive, albeit on the very long time frames associated with that industry.\"\nAn accountant in a suit entering the Federal Reserve with an arm full of U.S. Treasury securities.\n\"Overall, the company has roughly tripled its addressable market. The company has revamped the entry-level for its products. Three years ago, the company introduced a number of changes to its licensing terms which allowed smaller companies and start-ups to more readily access Arm IP. This has shored up the bottom end of the market which had been gradually shifting to ‘open source’ RISC V. Finally, Arm is attempting to move up the value chain by providing more complete designs for chips. This could be a strong way to increase value capture, but comes at the risk of infringing on the business of some of its licensees. Arm has been very vague about its ultimate ambitions in this space. There is some room here for the company to navigate this prospect, but as of now, its course remains unclear to us.”\nArm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) is a semiconductor and software design company that designs and manufactures semiconductor technology and other related products.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of ARM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Experts predict that the global cybersecurity market will grow from $218.9 billion in 2025 to $562.8 billion by 2032, exhibiting a steady 14.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the forecast period.\nMoreover, as cyberattacks become increasingly sophisticated, the demand for advanced, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered protection is also surging, creating fertile ground for market leaders like CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD). The cybersecurity giant’s success story hinges on strong demand for its AI-driven Falcon platform, which is designed to detect, prevent, and neutralize threats with real-time speed and precision.\nMulti-year contracts, growing demand for Falcon Flex deals, and a robust pipeline of enhancements are further solidifying its position as a cybersecurity heavyweight. That said, as the calendar inches closer to August 27, when CrowdStrike is set to unveil its fiscal 2026 second-quarter results, anticipation is running high. So, here’s a fresh look at this digital defense giant before its next big reveal.\nAbout CrowdStrike and CRWD Stock\nValued at roughly $108.6 billion by market capitalization, Texas-based CrowdStrike is a global leader in cybersecurity, offering a cloud-native platform that helps protect some of the most critical areas of enterprise risk, including endpoints, cloud workloads, identities, and sensitive data. Its Falcon platform leverages the power of the CrowdStrike Security Cloud and AI to identify threats in real-time.\nBy analyzing attack indicators, threat intelligence, and hacker tactics, along with data from across an organization, it delivers accurate threat detection, automated protection, and quick response times. Built in the cloud with a single lightweight-agent design, Falcon enables quick deployment at scale, strong protection with minimal complexity, and the ability for organizations to see results right away.\nFollowing last year’s high-profile outage incident in July that shook investors confidence, when a flawed update to CrowdStrike’s Falcon Sensor security software crashed approximately 8.5 million Microsoft (MSFT) Windows systems worldwide and sent the stock tumbling to a low of $242.25 in September, the company has demonstrated remarkable resilience, staging an impressive rebound of nearly 81.4% from that level.\nAnd while CRWD stock has experienced some turbulence over the past month due to macroeconomic and business-related factors, its longer-term trajectory remains strong. Year-to-date (YTD), shares of the cybersecurity leader have surged nearly 27.4%, outpacing the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) 9.6% gain.\nCrowdStrike’s Q1 Earnings Snapshot\nCrowdStrike kicked off fiscal 2026 with a mixed bag, posting first-quarter results on June 3. For the quarter ended April 30, 2025, the cybersecurity leader reported revenue of $1.10 billion, up 20% year-over-year (YOY) and in line with Wall Street estimates. Subscription revenue matched that pace, also rising 20% annually to $1.05 billion, underscoring the strength of its recurring revenue engine.\nAnnual Recurring Revenue (ARR) grew 22% YOY to $4.44 billion, with net new ARR coming in at about $194 million. The company also ended the quarter with a record $4.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, reinforcing its strong financial position. Profitability, however, told a different story. Non-GAAP net income slipped to $0.73 per share from $0.79 a year earlier, though it still comfortably topped expectations of $0.66.\nOn a GAAP basis, the company reported a $110.2 million net loss, compared to a $42.8 million profit in the same period last year, as spending increased across sales, marketing, R&D, and administration, partly due to last summer’s widespread software outage. Still, in a show of confidence in its long-term outlook, CrowdStrike’s board approved a share repurchase program of up to $1 billion, reinforcing its commitment to driving shareholder value.\nStrategically, CrowdStrike continued to build momentum around Falcon Flex deals, which saw total deal value soar more than sixfold to $3.2 billion YOY. Product innovation remained front and center, with the launch of Falcon Privileged Access, Charlotte AI Agentic Response and Workflows, and advanced AI-powered capabilities in model scanning, Shadow AI detection, and Falcon Exposure Management, positioning the platform for broader enterprise adoption.\nCrowdStrike Investors, Mark Your Calendars for August 27\nCrowdStrike is set to release its fiscal 2026 second-quarter earnings after the market closes on Wednesday, August 27, and anticipation is building. For the quarter, the cybersecurity leader projects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.82 to $0.84, with revenue expected between $1.14 billion and $1.15 billion.\nShowing increased confidence, management has raised its full-year earnings guidance to $3.44–$3.56 per share, while holding its revenue outlook steady at $4.74–$4.81 billion. That said, analysts remain watchful, projecting that CrowdStrike will continue to post a loss on a GAAP basis, with Q2 losses forecast at $0.19 per share, reflecting higher operating expenses tied to growth initiatives and innovation investments.\nEven so, the company’s expanding Falcon platform, accelerating recurring revenue streams, and steady rollout of advanced AI-driven capabilities are reinforcing its competitive edge in a rapidly growing market, giving investors plenty of reason to keep a close eye on its earnings.\nWhat Do Analysts Think About CrowdStrike Stock?\nAs the company gears up for its next big reveal, Wall Street appears optimistic about CRWD stock, maintaining a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating overall. Of the 47 analysts covering the stock, a majority of 27 analysts have rated it a “Strong Buy,” three suggest a “Moderate Buy,” 15 analysts are playing it safe with a “Hold,” and the remaining two give a “Strong Sell” rating.\nCRWD stock’s average analyst price target of $483.65 signals 11% potential upside from current levels, while the Street-high target of $575 indicates that it can rally as much as 32% from here.\nOn the date of publication, Anushka Mukherji did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

A few months later, Issa told The Sunday Times that the “road map is starting now” for the IPO, which would probably commence in 2026 and list EG Group under Cumberland Farms, its largest c-store banner in the U.S.\nNow, Issa appears to be changing his outlook. He told the Financial Times this week that he wants EG Group to sell its assets in the U.S. and that there are already parties interested in purchasing them. Selling these assets, including over 1,500 c-stores under several banners, would help EG Group relieve its over $5 billion in debt much faster than an IPO, Issa told the publication.\nAs Issa continues to speak to the press, EG Group isn’t talking. The company declined to comment on any speculatory IPO or sale of EG America to the outlets Issa has spoken with, and declined to speak when reached this week by C-Store Dive. Issa himself did not respond by press time when asked for comment by C-Store Dive.\nIt’s understandable for EG Group to keep quiet if either of these moves is in the works. But Issa’s comments contradict what the company has done the past few years in growing its U.S. network. M&A efforts aside, EG America has revamped its digital ecosystem, overhauled its c-suite team and boosted its fresh food offerings amid efforts to unify its many c-store banners across the country. EG Group even said earlier this year that EG America has become its most profitable market.\nWhich leads me to this: If EG Group is indeed mulling both options, how would selling EG America impact its potential IPO?\nFamiliar territory\nIn early 2023, reports surfaced that EG Group was looking to sell its assets in the U.S. in an effort to relieve over $8 billion of debt falling due in 2025. About two months later, the company entered into a $1.5 billion deal with Realty Income Corporation under which the real estate investment trust purchased over 400 c-stores in the U.S. and leased them back to EG America.", "content_hash": "c8cad169fdb0dfaa91009305916aa586", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Powered by a strong earnings report and an unexpected Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) partnership, Webtoon's shares had gained 93% as of 11:40 a.m. ET — and the chart is still trending upward as of this writing.\nWebtoon's results and a sweet Disney deal\nLet's start with the financial filings. The average Wall Street firm had expected second-quarter earnings of roughly $0.02 per share, with top-line revenue near $341 million. The mobile webcomics specialist posted adjusted earnings of $0.07 per share instead, based on $348 million of revenues. That's a clean sweep, also exceeding the top end of management's guidance ranges for this period.\nBut the bigger news came from the House of Mouse. Besides the earnings report, Webtoon also announced a brand new Disney deal. This contract adds a selection of Disney, Marvel, 20th Century Fox, and Star Wars content on the Webtoon platform.\nIt will start with a handful of free webcomics at launch, followed by approximately 100 pieces of premium content over time. That's a robust slice of Disney's instantly recognizable content portfolio, but Webtoon users won't get full access to this deep well.\nHow the partnership helps Webtoon and Disney\nWebtoon COO & CFO David Lee wasn't able to share financial terms or launch dates quite yet, as the commercial details are still being hammered out. But he called the deal a win-win for both companies. Webtoon will supplement its mainly anime-style comics with a deep well of proven hits, while Disney reaches the Gen Z kids (and younger) from a new angle.\nThe stock calmed down to an 85% gain by noon ET. That's still a solid 52-week high. Again, the Disney deal holds more weight than a modest earnings surprise.

Shoppers are walking away from the more opulent wares offered by luxury firms, including Kering .\nRevenue in the New York-based company's fiscal fourth quarter is expected to have climbed to $1.7 billion, its second-quickest pace of growth in 12 quarters, according to LSEG data. Last week, Tapestry's rival and Michael Kors-owner Capri forecast quarterly revenue above estimates.\nShares of Tapestry, which beat Wall Street revenue estimates in the past four quarters, have surged more than two-thirds this year. Revenue from the Coach brand, which accounted for 82% of the company's revenue for the first nine months of the year, likely grew almost 11% in the June quarter, according to LSEG estimates.\n\"They've successfully repositioned the brand to target younger demographics with their Tabby and Brooklyn Bag brands,\" said Adam Steffanus, a managing director at Advisory Research Investment Management, which owns Tapestry stock. Steffanus noted that sales of European luxury brands LVMH and Chanel have suffered because they raised their prices too high.\nTapestry said in May that it was well covered on cross-border tariff risk thanks to less than 10% of production from China and a diversified manufacturing base that includes 70% of production from Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Philippines.\nStill, Tapestry's other brand, Kate Spade, has been a drag on its performance. The brand has suffered from heavy promotions that have hurt its status as an upscale brand, Steffanus said.\nMorningstar analyst David Swartz said Coach could raise prices without driving away customers because of its high margins, but Tapestry cannot do the same for Kate Spade handbags.\nKate Spade's revenue likely fell 13% in the April-June period, according to LSEG estimates.\nTapestry reports earnings on Thursday.

It would be 1929 all over again, a GREAT DEPRESSION!” Trump wrote in a recent post on Truth Social.\nThe warning comes as a federal appeals court hears arguments on the legality of his tariff policy. Trump added that if the court were to rule against him, “they should have done so LONG AGO,” claiming, “there is no way America could recover from such a judicial tragedy.”\nHe also credited tariffs for the U.S. stock market’s recent performance. “Tariffs are having a huge positive impact on the Stock Market. Almost every day, new records are set,” he wrote.\nIt’s true stocks have been on a tear, with the S&P 500 recently hitting fresh highs. But back in April — when Trump first unveiled his sweeping tariffs — markets plunged. They only began to rebound after he softened his stance and scaled back some measures.\nMany experts disagree with Trump’s view that striking down tariffs would be an economic blow. Even economist Peter Schiff, who backed Trump in the 2024 election, argues the tariffs are hurting Americans, not foreign countries.\n“The media is helping Trump deceive the public by reporting that he's hitting other countries with tariffs. In reality, he's hitting American consumers who buy imports from those countries with tariffs,” Schiff said in a recent post on X. “We are being taxed, and our freedom to choose what we buy is being abridged.”\nOthers see a court ruling against tariffs as a potential boost.\n“If courts shoot down the tariffs, it would be complicated — but a huge positive. There would be a massive celebration,” Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, told CNN.\nWhile the outcome of the court battle remains uncertain, Trump’s stark warning underscores a broader concern: how quickly political and geopolitical events can rattle markets. For investors, it’s a reminder that safeguarding wealth often means turning to assets that can hold their value in times of turmoil — from global trade tensions to the threat of a severe economic downturn.\nA safe haven shines again\nWhen uncertainty looms, gold has a way of reclaiming the spotlight.\nLong seen as the ultimate safe haven, gold isn’t tied to any single country, currency or economy. It can’t be created at will by central banks like fiat money, and in times of economic turmoil or geopolitical uncertainty, investors tend to pile in — driving up its value.\nOver the past 12 months, the price of gold has surged more than 35%.\nRead more: Nervous about the stock market? Gain potential quarterly income through this $1B private real estate fund — even if you’re not a millionaire. Here’s how to get started with as little as $10\nRay Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, recently highlighted gold’s importance in a resilient portfolio.\n“People don't have, typically, an adequate amount of gold in their portfolio,” Dalio told CNBC earlier this year. “When bad times come, gold is a very effective diversifier.”\nOne way to invest in gold that also provides significant tax advantages is to open a gold IRA with the help of Thor Metals.\nGold IRAs allow investors to hold physical gold or gold-related assets within a retirement account, which combines the tax advantages of an IRA with the protective benefits of investing in gold, making it an attractive option for those looking to potentially hedge their retirement funds against economic uncertainties.\nTo learn more, you can get a free information guide that includes details on how to get up to $20,000 in free metals on qualifying purchases.\nThe asset that made Trump rich\nIf gold is the common go-to hedge for moments of chaos, real estate is the long game — and no one knows that better than Trump himself.\nBefore politics, Trump made his fortune in real estate — and the asset class remains a powerful tool for building and preserving wealth, especially during inflationary times. That’s because property values and rental income tend to rise along with the cost of living.\nUnlike some other investments, real estate doesn’t need a roaring stock market to deliver returns. Even during downturns, high-quality properties can generate rental income — offering a dependable stream of passive cash flow.\nAs Trump told Steve Forbes back in 2011, “I just notice that when you have that right piece of property, whatever it might be, including location, it tends to work well in good times and in bad times.”\nToday, you don’t need to buy a property outright to benefit from real estate investing. Crowdfunding platforms like Arrived offer an easier way to get exposure to this income-generating asset class.\nThe process is simple: browse a curated selection of homes that have been vetted for their appreciation and income potential. Once you find a property you like, select the number of shares you’d like to purchase, and then sit back as you start receiving any positive rental income distributions from your investment.\nAnother option is First National Realty Partners (FNRP), which allows accredited investors to diversify their portfolio through grocery-anchored commercial properties without taking on the responsibilities of being a landlord.\nWith a minimum investment of $50,000, investors can own a share of properties leased by national brands like Whole Foods, Kroger and Walmart, which provide essential goods to their communities. Thanks to Triple Net (NNN) leases, where the tenant covers property expenses such as property taxes and insurance, accredited investors are able to invest in these properties without worrying about such costs cutting into their potential returns.\nSimply answer a few questions — including how much you would like to invest — to start browsing their full list of available properties.", "content_hash": "b202f2ac66299282738c8883606c0697", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

According to Bank of America Institute’s latest report, Consumer Checkpoint: Gains and Gaps, higher-income households are enjoying accelerating wage growth and increased spending, while lower-income households face slowing pay gains and flat expenditure—marking the widest such divide in more than four years.\nThe institute’s research, based on aggregated and anonymized deposit and transaction data, reveals that after-tax wages for the lowest-income tercile grew just 1.3% year over year (YOY) in July, down from 1.6% in June. In contrast, higher-income wage growth accelerated to 3.2% YOY—its third consecutive monthly increase.\nThe result is the biggest gap between top and bottom earners’ wage growth since February 2021—a warning sign for the economy despite a strong overall spending picture. Bank of America Institute senior economist David Tinsley told Fortune in an interview: “In some sense, we had an improvement in lower-income wage growth since the pandemic, and now that’s gone into reverse.”\nComing out of the pandemic was a “very unusual situation,” Tinsley added, and lower-income households genuinely did see stronger wage growth than other areas of the economy.\n“There was a narrowing of wealth inequality, and now it’s widening,” Tinsley said, though cautioned it was “early days.” Still, when he looks at what’s happening to higher- and lower-income Americans, he says, “the divergence is quite stark.”\nOverall consumer activity picks up\nTinsley emphasized the overall consumer picture is “fairly healthy,” and his team’s research on the latest data shows total credit and debit card spending per household rose 1.8% YOY in July, the fastest pace since January. On a seasonally adjusted basis, spending climbed 0.6% month over month (MOM), following a 0.4% gain in June.\nNotably, the rebound was broad-based, as services spending surged 0.9% month over month, the strongest increase since April 2024, after three straight months of declines. Retail spending (excluding gasoline and restaurants) also edged higher, though part of the lift came from temporary factors such as extended Prime Day–style online promotions and a late surge in back-to-school shopping.\nTinsley and his team cautioned these boosts may fade. Some of July’s uptick may reflect “buy-ahead” behavior linked to the Aug. 1 trade-deal deadline, as consumers sought to avoid potential tariff-related price hikes. Overall, temporary promotional spikes and inflation pass-through from tariffs complicate the picture. Retail transaction volumes rose more modestly than spending values, hinting higher prices, rather than greater quantities, may have driven part of the increase.\nThe widening wage gap tracks closely with labor market shifts. Recent Bureau of Labor Statistics revisions show a sharp slowdown in payroll growth in the second quarter of 2025, with the biggest step-downs in low-wage industries such as retail, wholesale, leisure, and hospitality.\nBank of America deposit data indicates only a modest 4% year-over-year rise in the number of lower-income households receiving unemployment payments, compared with 10% increases among middle- and higher-income households. This suggests low-wage workers are not losing jobs in large numbers, but are instead facing reduced hours or muted pay growth.\nSpending divergence now clear-cut\nThe spending data mirrors the pay trends. “Lower-income households aren’t really spending,” Tinsley told Fortune, finding that their spending growth was flat (0% year over year) in the three months to July. Higher-income households posted 1.8% year-over-year growth, with middle-income households up 1.0%.\nWhile the lowest-income 30% of households account for less than 15% of total U.S. consumer spending, their purchases matter for sectors dependent on high transaction volumes, such as discount retail, quick-service restaurants, and budget travel. More important, Bank of America’s internal data shows the share of lower-income spending devoted to discretionary categories has barely changed since last year, suggesting they have not yet resorted to cutting nonessentials—but their capacity for future cutbacks remains small.\nNo early signs of consumer distress—yet\nOne potentially reassuring takeaway is the absence of typical distress indicators. Retail returns are not rising—the downtrend that began in 2022 has merely flattened, while deposit balances remain above 2019 levels even after adjusting for inflation, and credit card borrowing habits remain healthier than pre-pandemic. However, beneath these broad measures are hints of strain: Among lower-income households that do carry month-to-month card balances, credit card utilization rates have risen faster than in other groups since 2019.\nEven with slower wage growth at the bottom, the institute concludes household finances overall remain “sound.” Continued elevated savings, relatively low revolving credit usage, and stable borrowing capacity suggest consumers still possess spending firepower—a key factor supporting the economy’s resilience so far this year.\nThat said, the report notes middle- and higher-income households are doing much of the heavy lifting.\nAs Tinsley’s team observed: “From a macroeconomic perspective, it is reassuring that middle- and higher-income households’ spending growth does not appear to be weakening like it has for lower-income households,” noting the lowest 30% of households by income account for less than 15% of overall U.S. consumer spending.

According to Bank of America Institute’s latest report, Consumer Checkpoint: Gains and Gaps, higher-income households are enjoying accelerating wage growth and increased spending, while lower-income households face slowing pay gains and flat expenditure—marking the widest such divide in more than four years.\nThe institute’s research, based on aggregated and anonymized deposit and transaction data, reveals that after-tax wages for the lowest-income tercile grew just 1.3% year over year (YOY) in July, down from 1.6% in June. In contrast, higher-income wage growth accelerated to 3.2% YOY—its third consecutive monthly increase.\nThe result is the biggest gap between top and bottom earners’ wage growth since February 2021—a warning sign for the economy despite a strong overall spending picture. Bank of America Institute senior economist David Tinsley told Fortune in an interview: “In some sense, we had an improvement in lower-income wage growth since the pandemic, and now that’s gone into reverse.”\nComing out of the pandemic was a “very unusual situation,” Tinsley added, and lower-income households genuinely did see stronger wage growth than other areas of the economy.\n“There was a narrowing of wealth inequality, and now it’s widening,” Tinsley said, though cautioned it was “early days.” Still, when he looks at what’s happening to higher- and lower-income Americans, he says, “the divergence is quite stark.”\nOverall consumer activity picks up\nTinsley emphasized the overall consumer picture is “fairly healthy,” and his team’s research on the latest data shows total credit and debit card spending per household rose 1.8% YOY in July, the fastest pace since January. On a seasonally adjusted basis, spending climbed 0.6% month over month (MOM), following a 0.4% gain in June.\nNotably, the rebound was broad-based, as services spending surged 0.9% month over month, the strongest increase since April 2024, after three straight months of declines. Retail spending (excluding gasoline and restaurants) also edged higher, though part of the lift came from temporary factors such as extended Prime Day–style online promotions and a late surge in back-to-school shopping.\nTinsley and his team cautioned these boosts may fade. Some of July’s uptick may reflect “buy-ahead” behavior linked to the Aug. 1 trade-deal deadline, as consumers sought to avoid potential tariff-related price hikes. Overall, temporary promotional spikes and inflation pass-through from tariffs complicate the picture. Retail transaction volumes rose more modestly than spending values, hinting higher prices, rather than greater quantities, may have driven part of the increase.\nThe widening wage gap tracks closely with labor market shifts. Recent Bureau of Labor Statistics revisions show a sharp slowdown in payroll growth in the second quarter of 2025, with the biggest step-downs in low-wage industries such as retail, wholesale, leisure, and hospitality.\nBank of America deposit data indicates only a modest 4% year-over-year rise in the number of lower-income households receiving unemployment payments, compared with 10% increases among middle- and higher-income households. This suggests low-wage workers are not losing jobs in large numbers, but are instead facing reduced hours or muted pay growth.\nSpending divergence now clear-cut\nThe spending data mirrors the pay trends. “Lower-income households aren’t really spending,” Tinsley told Fortune, finding that their spending growth was flat (0% year over year) in the three months to July. Higher-income households posted 1.8% year-over-year growth, with middle-income households up 1.0%.\nWhile the lowest-income 30% of households account for less than 15% of total U.S. consumer spending, their purchases matter for sectors dependent on high transaction volumes, such as discount retail, quick-service restaurants, and budget travel. More important, Bank of America’s internal data shows the share of lower-income spending devoted to discretionary categories has barely changed since last year, suggesting they have not yet resorted to cutting nonessentials—but their capacity for future cutbacks remains small.\nNo early signs of consumer distress—yet\nOne potentially reassuring takeaway is the absence of typical distress indicators. Retail returns are not rising—the downtrend that began in 2022 has merely flattened, while deposit balances remain above 2019 levels even after adjusting for inflation, and credit card borrowing habits remain healthier than pre-pandemic. However, beneath these broad measures are hints of strain: Among lower-income households that do carry month-to-month card balances, credit card utilization rates have risen faster than in other groups since 2019.\nEven with slower wage growth at the bottom, the institute concludes household finances overall remain “sound.” Continued elevated savings, relatively low revolving credit usage, and stable borrowing capacity suggest consumers still possess spending firepower—a key factor supporting the economy’s resilience so far this year.\nThat said, the report notes middle- and higher-income households are doing much of the heavy lifting.\nAs Tinsley’s team observed: “From a macroeconomic perspective, it is reassuring that middle- and higher-income households’ spending growth does not appear to be weakening like it has for lower-income households,” noting the lowest 30% of households by income account for less than 15% of overall U.S. consumer spending. Still, the team added, “there are broader socioeconomic concerns around any slowdown in lower-income households’ wages and spending.”\nWhen asked by Fortune to expand on these broader socioeconomic concerns, Tinsley said: “There’s some time to go before this becomes really telling.” He estimated the economy is at least a year or maybe as much as 18 months away from truly reversing all the progress on wealth inequality that was seen coming out of the pandemic, but he said there’s no doubt about it.

That’s a 3% jump in just the last 24 hours and a new record high for crypto.\nNaturally, trading volume exploded, climbing 25.73% to $239.35 billion, signaling renewed investor appetite across the board. Even Monero, which tanked yesterday on fears of a 51% network attack, is in the green today.\nBitcoin is, as usual, leading the way, once again rising above $120,000. But it’s altcoins stealing the show today. The Altcoin Season Index on CoinMarketCap has risen to 39, up from 29 last month, which suggests an early-stage rotation into alternative cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin dominance wanes. What are traders rotating into you ask? Within the top 10, it's Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano showing strong signals.\nEthereum (ETH) price: Testing all-time high\nEthereum, which had previously lost a great deal of momentum following its 2021 peak, is now back in the spotlight as the “public company crypto treasury” craze spreads to ETH.\nMassive buys from publicly traded companies like the Consensys-linked Sharplink and Tom Lee’s BitMine have buoyed Ethereum prices. ETH is up a whopping 6% today, just shy of its 2021 all-time high above $4,800.\nOn Myriad—a prediction market developed by Decrypt’s parent company Dastan—predictors are confident that ETH has the strength to top $5K this year. Just last week, the odds were even, but sentiment on Myriad has flipped resoundingly bullish. Users are now placing the odds at 87% that Ethereum hits $5,000 before the end of the year.\nA separate market on Myriad shows traders are widely expecting ETH to hit $5K before dipping all the way back down to $3,500 this year, placing those odds at nearly 80%.\nDo the charts agree? At the moment, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is demonstrating remarkable strength across multiple technical indicators.\nThe Average Directional Index, or ADX, for ETH is at 46, which confirms an exceptionally strong uptrend. ADX measures trend strength on a scale from 0 to 100, where readings above 25 indicate a confirmed trend, and above 40 signals powerful directional momentum. At 46, ETH's uptrend has serious conviction.\nEthereum’s exponential moving averages also paint a bullish picture. EMAs take the average price of an asset over a set period of time. ETH’s 50-day and 200-day EMAs are currently providing dynamic support well below current prices. This expanding gap between short and long-term moving averages, known as bullish divergence, typically occurs in strong uptrends and gives buyers multiple support levels during any pullbacks. Traders see this setup as a green light for trend-following strategies, and the bigger the spike gets, the more momentum the trend has.\nThe Relative Strength Index, or RSI, for ETH is at 79, pushing into overbought territory above 70. That normally triggers caution among traders. But during powerful bull runs, assets can remain overbought for extended periods. This reading suggests short-term profit-taking might emerge without posing an immediate threat to the overall momentum.\nAnd not one to be left out, Solana is turning heads today as well. SOL is up 7% over the past 24 hours, testing the psychologically significant price point of $200.\nThe \"Ethereum killer,\" as some of its proponents refer to it, is showing strong technical signals that suggest further upside, potentially breaking from the sideways-trading pattern it’s held since its dip in March.\nThis recent spike has increased the optimism among Myriad traders as well. On Myriad, the odds of Solana hitting a new all-time high above $293 this year have jumped from 30% last week to 50% today. That 20% swing is indicative of the sentiment across the broader market as SOL looks to keep pace with the gains of its biggest competitor in ETH.\nAnd the price data supports the bullish outlook.\nSolana’s ADX is now at 23, approaching the crucial 25 threshold that confirms an established trend. Rising ADX during upward price moves validates the trend’s legitimacy. Traders often watch this level closely, since crossing above an ADX of 25 usually marks a transition from choppy trading to sustained trend. With momentum building, SOL could become an appealing trade to those watching the charts.\nThe EMA configuration supports the bullish view, with the 50-day EMA providing support around $170 while price action trades comfortably above both moving averages. This positive alignment typically indicates sustained buying pressure, with the gap between price and EMAs providing a cushion for any short-term pullbacks.\nThe coin entered a golden cross formation in mid-July, but the gap between the two moving averages is still small, which means there is not really enough momentum for big price swings in either direction going too far from the averages.\nRSI at 64 sits in what traders call the \"power zone\"—strong enough to indicate genuine momentum but not yet extended enough to trigger automatic profit-taking. Judging by this indicator alone, there is space for approximately 10-15% additional upside potential before overbought conditions emerge. Of course, this doesn’t mean that will happen, but a technical analysis of the charts would suggest such a price movement would still be healthy and expected.\nStrong resistance: $220 (technical target from measured move)\nCardano (ADA) price: Testing resistance\nCardano is showing impressive strength with the ADA token currently trading at $0.868, up 3.09% and actively testing the resistance level marked by the green dotted line on the chart below at around $0.87-$0.90.\nThis critical level has capped at least three previous rallies, making the current test particularly significant for momentum traders.\nThe ADX reading at 24 is just below the 25 trend confirmation threshold, suggesting ADA is on the verge of establishing a strong directional move. When ADX crosses above 25, it typically signals the end of consolidation and the beginning of trending behavior—a setup that has traders paying close attention.\nHowever, a weak ADX near a strong resistance is usually not what traders like to see.\nThe 50-200 EMA spread remains positive with both averages providing support below current prices. The 50-day EMA near $0.75 acts as immediate dynamic support, while the 200-day provides a floor around $0.70. This stacked configuration gives bulls confidence that any pullbacks will find buyers at multiple levels, but there is not really enough of a gap between the two timeframes to notice any strong bullish (or bearish) trend.\nRSI at 65 indicates healthy bullish momentum without being overextended. This reading leaves room for continued gains—altcoins can reach very high readings during strong uptrends. The current level suggests the rally has fuel left in the tank, particularly if the resistance break is confirmed.\nOverall, indicators point to bullish behavior, however, the readings say this trend is weak. Not bearish, but very prone to corrections along the way.\nThe resistance near $0.9-$1 will be crucial for the price trend. When it failed to break past that timeline, the coin had a similarly bullish reading.\nKey Levels:\nImmediate support: $0.83 (recent breakout level)\nStrong support: $0.75 (50-day EMA zone)\nImmediate resistance: $0.90 (green dotted line - current test)\nNext resistance: $1.00 (major psychological target)\nThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.", "content_hash": "39212227929b76e3dad8882bb37431c0", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Morgan Stanley now expects investment in nuclear energy to total $2.2 trillion through 2050, up from last year’s forecast of $1.5 trillion.\nMorgan Stanley divides nuclear-exposed stocks into three categories: power generators, uranium miners, and equipment and plant providers. The firm’s three favorite U.S. stocks to play the nuclear theme all fall into the first category: Talen Energy (TLN), Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG), and Vistra (VST).\nWhat's Driving the 'Nuclear Renaissance'?\n“The dual imperatives of decarbonization and energy security, combined with a gradual decline in investor exclusions and more favorable financing conditions, are making the nuclear renaissance a truly global investment theme,” wrote Morgan Stanley analysts on Tuesday.\nPresident Donald Trump has made energy security a central theme of his second term. In May, Trump set the goal of growing America’s nuclear energy capacity to 400 gigawatts in 2050 from about 100GW today. The president signed several executive orders aiming to expedite the expansion and construction of U.S. nuclear capacity.\nInvestors around the world have become more open to nuclear energy. As of December 2024, Morgan Stanley wrote, 2.3% of global [assets under management] were subject to an exclusion policy regarding nuclear power—less than for alcohol, military contracting or gambling.\nAnd The World Bank recently lifted its ban on financing nuclear power projects, which the firm said could set the stage for other international lenders to follow.\nMorgan Stanley's Three Top Nuclear-Stock Picks\nArtificial intelligence is one of the core reasons Morgan Stanley’s preferred U.S. nuclear stocks—Talen, Vistra, and Public Service Enterprise Group—are all power generators.\nArtificial intelligence consumes a lot of energy, and nuclear power offers AI companies stable prices, reliability, and efficiency. Morgan Stanley said it believes the market currently underappreciates these long-term benefits, but tech giants don’t.", "content_hash": "e01e5a28e185e05d93ac713b2a6408bc", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The subsidiary lists Sanka and Rapido vice president of finance Vivek Krishna as the directors, per the regulatory filings reviewed by TechCrunch.\nSanka said there was no specific reason for setting up the subsidiary. However, it may be a strategic move to avoid potential conflicts of interest with Swiggy, which currently holds a 12% minority stake in the ride-hailing startup.\nSwiggy recently confirmed in a letter to shareholders that it would reevaluate its investment in Rapido, citing a potential conflict of interest “that may arise in the future.”\nMeanwhile, Rapido’s Ownly has also released its Android app on Google Play that offers food from nearby restaurants at around 15% lower prices than those on Swiggy and Zomato.\nThe lower pricing is a result of Rapido’s model of not taking commissions from restaurants, which are up to 30% in the case of other food delivery apps, including Swiggy and Zomato, and instead charging a fixed fee per order. The startup mentioned its fixed-fee approach in a proposal to restaurants in June.\nRapido has a fleet of around 10 million vehicles, including 5 to 6 million two-wheelers, across India, a person familiar with the startup’s business told TechCrunch recently.

See our Advertiser Disclosure.\nWhen you’re shopping for auto insurance, one option you’ll see is full coverage. While no auto insurance policy covers everything, full coverage offers significant protection if you’re involved in a car accident or your vehicle is damaged by weather, vandalism, or another event.\nHere’s what to know about full coverage car insurance, how it protects you financially, and whether it makes sense for you.\nWhat does full coverage car insurance cover?\nFull coverage car insurance isn’t one type of coverage; it typically includes three coverages — liability, collision, and comprehensive insurance.\n-\nLiability insurance. Liability insurance comprises two coverage types: property damage and bodily injury liability insurance. Property damage kicks in if your car damages someone else’s property, such as their fence, mailbox, or landscaping. The bodily injury component covers you if you hurt another driver or one of their passengers in an at-fault car accident.\n-\nCollision insurance. Collision insurance reimburses you for repairs to your own vehicle or replacement after an accident.\n-\nComprehensive insurance. Comprehensive insurance also covers the cost of car repairs or replacement, but there’s an important difference. Instead of kicking in after an accident, comprehensive coverage pays when your car is damaged due to a non-collision event like severe weather, burglary, vandalism, or a fire.\nOther types of full coverage\nWhile liability, collision, and comprehensive are common with full coverage insurance, you can add other coverage options to enhance a full coverage policy. Some may even be mandatory, depending on your state requirements. Here’s your other coverage options:\n-\nUnderinsured/uninsured motorist coverage. Uninsured motorist coverage protects you if the other party at fault in a car accident doesn’t have enough insurance to cover your medical bills, car repair, and other expenses.\n-\nGap coverage. Gap insurance protects you if your car is stolen or totaled and your remaining auto loan balance exceeds your car’s depreciated value.\n-\nRental car reimbursement. Rental car reimbursement kicks in if your car is damaged in a covered incident, this optional coverage helps out when you need to rent a car while yours is being repaired.\nFull coverage can help cover at-fault accidents\nA full coverage policy is particularly helpful if you're at fault in an accident. With a liability-only policy, your insurance would only cover the other driver's injuries and vehicle damage up to your policy coverage limits; you'd be on your own to repair or replace your own vehicle.\nWhat your policy covers (and what it doesn't) depends on the following variables.\nLiability coverage limit\nWhen you purchase liability coverage, you can select a maximum limit per person and per accident. State minimum requirements are quite low, so consider higher limits for increased financial protection. Remember: If damages exceed your coverage limits, you may have to pay the remainder out of your own pocket (or the other person can sue you for the excess cost).\nCollision insurance\nIf you rear-end another car at a red light and your car is damaged, collision insurance will pay for your vehicle's repairs or replacement. The maximum coverage amount is typically the actual cash value of your car.\nComprehensive insurance\nDamage to your vehicle can happen in more ways than simply colliding with other drivers or their personal property. If you had an accident where your car struck an animal, or your vehicle was vandalized, stolen, or damaged in a storm, comprehensive insurance is the coverage you’ll need.\nCar insurance deductibles\nLiability policies don't have a deductible, but collision and comprehensive insurance do. If you're at fault in an accident and need to take your own car to a mechanic or body shop for repairs, you'll have to pay the deductible before your insurer will help with the cost. Deductibles can range anywhere from a couple of hundred to a couple of thousand dollars, depending on your coverage.\nIs medical coverage included in a full coverage policy?\nTwo other common forms of car insurance coverage are personal injury protection (PIP) and medical payments coverage (MedPay). Whether these types of insurance are included in a full coverage policy depends on your state laws.\nPersonal injury protection (PIP)\nPIP pays for your own medical bills and other healthcare expenses after an accident, regardless of who is at fault. It can also pay for lost wages, funeral costs, and home care providers. In no-fault states, PIP is part of a full coverage policy.\nPIP is required in 12 states and Puerto Rico: Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, and Utah.\nMedPay\nMedPay is an optional form of coverage. It pays for medical expenses you or your passengers incur after an accident. It can cover the cost of doctor visits, surgeries, ambulance fees, or corrective dental work. And, it can help pay for your medical deductibles and co-pays.\nUnlike PIP, MedPay doesn't cover lost wages or childcare expenses.\nMedPay can come in handy if you have a high-deductible health insurance plan or a policy that won't cover accident-related injuries (or if you're without a health insurance policy).\nThree states require MedPay (sometimes listed as medical benefits coverage): Maine, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania. In other states, it can be added to your policy as an optional benefit.\nHere’s when to consider full coverage insurance\nDifferent states have different insurance requirements; nearly all require that you carry a minimum amount of bodily injury and property damage liability coverage. But none mandate full coverage. Full coverage insurance can be pricey. However, it can be worth the investment in the following scenarios:\nYou lease your car\nIf you lease your vehicle, the leasing company will typically require you to purchase and maintain full coverage insurance. You must maintain full coverage until the lease is over.\nYou financed your car with an auto loan\nTo protect their investment, auto loan companies will require you to maintain full coverage insurance until your car loan is repaid in full.\nYour car has a high replacement value\nAlthough cars tend to depreciate quickly, there are some cars that hold onto their value longer than others. If your car still has a high resale value, it would be costly to replace if it were stolen or totaled in an accident. If that happened, you could be left scrambling to come up with the cash or to qualify for an additional auto loan to purchase a new car. For cars that have held their value, full coverage can be a fiscally smart idea, so you can replace or repair the car.\nYour car is expensive to repair\nSome makes and models are particularly expensive to repair; even a minor fender bender can cause thousands in damage. If you have liability-only coverage, you'll have to cover the full cost of repairs on your own. Maintaining a full coverage policy can prevent the risk of a huge repair bill draining your finances.\nYou don't have a large emergency fund\nWhat seems like a minor dent or scrape can be surprisingly expensive to fix. For example, a side-impact repair can be anywhere from $200 to $2,000, while damage to the frame can result in five-figure repair bills.\nIf you don't have a substantial emergency fund that can cover months of expenses, paying for the repairs can deplete your savings. And, you could be at risk of incurring debt if anything else goes wrong. A full coverage policy provides added protection and peace of mind.\nWhen to consider liability-only\nStill not sure if you need liability-only coverage or full coverage? Here are a few scenarios where liability-only coverage makes sense:\n-\nThe car is at least 10 years old with a high odometer reading\n-\nThe car is paid off and has a low resale value\n-\nYou have enough cash to repair or replace your car out of your own pocket\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nPros and cons of full coverage insurance\nIf you're thinking of adding comprehensive and collision insurance to your policy, or want to downgrade to a liability-only policy, weighs the pros and cons of full coverage insurance.\nPros:\n-\nCoverage for your own vehicle after an accident\n-\nPays for repairs to your own vehicle caused by storm damage\n-\nRequired if you lease or finance your car\nCons:\n-\nPolicies are substantially more expensive than liability-only\n-\nCoverage involves deductibles\n-\nMay not be worth it for older cars\nFrequently asked questions\nDo I need full coverage auto insurance on my car?\nYou may need full coverage for your car if your vehicle is leased, financed with an auto loan, or if you'd struggle to afford to repair or replace it if it was declared a total loss.\nHow much does full coverage insurance cost?\nAccording to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the average cost of full coverage insurance is $1,438 per year — about double the average cost of liability-only policies.\nIs full coverage required by law?\nNo state requires drivers to have full coverage policies; you only need to have liability insurance to satisfy your state's laws. But, if you lease or finance your car with an auto loan, the lender may require you to have full coverage.\nWhat does 100/300/100 mean?\nInsurance policies with liability coverage frequently describe its limits with three numbers, such as 100/300/100. These numbers reflect the following:\n-\nThe first number is how much coverage the policy provides for a single person injured in an accident.\n-\nThe second number is how much coverage the policy provides for two or more people injured in an accident.\n-\nThe final number is how much the policy will pay for property damage you cause in an accident.\nSo, a 100/300/100 policy provides $100,000 in coverage for one injured person, $300,000 for two or more injured people in an accident, and $100,000 in property damage.\nTim Manni edited this article.", "content_hash": "b1e5d17cefd04aeef74cbd68ec4c8a5d", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Subscribe to our free daily Wealthmanagement newsletter.\nIn the latest edition of its annual look at dollar-weighted and time-weighted returns of over 25,000 individual U.S. open-end funds and ETFs, Morningstar found that investors continue to miss out on around 15% of aggregate total returns due to the timing and magnitude of their purchases and sales over a 10-year period.\nOverall, Morningstar found that over the decade ended Dec. 31, 2024, the average dollar invested in funds and ETFs earned around 7.0% per year vs. the overall performance of 8.2% for those funds—a gap of 1.2 percentage points, a figure roughly in line with previous editions of the report.\n“One of the things we try to underscore as a potential lesson is that it’s a persistent cost. People should approach that in a way that’s not unlike how they approach fund expense ratios,” said Jeffrey Ptak, a managing director at Morningstar and the report’s lead author. “You should be deliberate about the necessity, timing and nature of transactions and put yourself in a position where you do as little trading as possible. If that’s the case, you’re in a better position to capture as much of a fund’s returns as possible.”\n[[scm-embed type=\"everviz\" src=\"https://app.everviz.com/inject/geF9f5vn1/?v=5\"]]\nRelatedly, the analysis found that funds in which investors are committed to staying for the long-term—such as target-date funds and other vehicles held in retirement plans—the gap between investor and fund performance is smaller. For example, investors in allocation funds posted 6.3% per year dollar-weighted return compared with 6.5% for the funds’ aggregate annual total return, capturing nearly 97% of the funds’ performance.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, taxable-bond and municipal-bond fund investors captured 1.2% returns out of 2.2% total returns—just slightly more than half.\nMorningstar also added new wrinkles to this year’s report by gauging investor and fund performance relative to tracking errors (i.e., how funds that performed relative to benchmarks) and cash flow. The analysis found that investors in funds with larger tracking errors tended to have wider gaps than those in funds that hewed more closely to benchmarks. It also found that investors in funds with more volatile cashflows had bigger gaps than those in ones with more consistent flows.\n“It’s the nature of investing that when a fund diverges in a notable way from the rest of the pack, if it works in your favor, you stick with it. However, if it goes the other way and you feel like that difference is working to your detriment, you may be more likely to sell that fund,” Ptak said. “That may hurt you because that shortfall you are seeing could be fleeting, and if the performance perks up, you miss out.”", "content_hash": "7eee12cbf3288beefc9163aa80b1fbd6", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Neither of the 10 is Nano Nuclear or NuScale, which is pretty bad news for those companies, I suspect.\nBut also, eight of them are not Oklo, and that means Oklo's not quite the odds-on favorite to inaugurate the nation's nuclear renaissance, as its initial press release might lead one to believe.\nAnd this, I suspect, is why Oklo stock was unable to hold on to its gains today.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oklo right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Oklo, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oklo wasn’t one of them.

Experts recommend that you increase the proportion of bonds relative to stocks in your portfolio as you age. The reason is simple: Bonds, especially Treasury bonds, are far less volatile than stocks. In a market downturn, bonds historically fall much less sharply than stocks or may even rise as investors seek out safe investments. They can also provide an income stream in retirement.\nRead Next: 12 Best Safe Investments To Grow Your Money in 2025\nFor You: 4 Affordable Car Brands You Won't Regret Buying in 2025\nBut the day of the week on which you buy your bonds may make a difference. Some retirees are buying bonds on Friday instead of Thursday — here’s why.\nWhich Day of the Week Is Best for Bonds?\nIn an analysis of long-term treasury bond purchases from 2002 to mid-2025, Quantified Strategies found that Fridays have historically been the best day for bonds. The average daily return for bonds on a Friday was 0.05%, compared to a -0.02% return on Thursdays.\nThe research also shows that Tuesday is also a good day to buy bonds, particularly if Monday is a down day. On a Tuesday following a down Monday, bonds returned an average of 0.06%.\nPerformance was measured from the close of trading one day to the close of trading the next day.\nCheck Out: I’m a Financial Advisor: 4 Investing Rules My Millionaire Clients Never Break\nThe Benefits of Bonds\nThere are two main benefits of bonds in your portfolio. They provide income, which can stay in your account or be used to supplement social security and other forms of retirement income. And they can lower the volatility in your portfolio, which is important for retirees. Let’s look at these two benefits in more detail.\nIncome From Bonds\nWhen you buy a bond, you are loaning money to a corporation or a government entity. In exchange, the issuer of the bond pays you interest periodically. When the bond matures, you get your principal payment back. The interest you received over time is your return on the investment.\nHere’s an example. Suppose you purchase a $1,000 bond that pays 4% interest for ten years. You’ll get $40 in interest each year, usually paid twice a year. During the ten years you own the bond, you’ll get $400 total in interest — that’s your return on your investment. At the end of ten years, you’ll get back the $1,000 you paid for the bond.\nBefore you retire, you can reinvest the income you earn from bonds to increase the size of your nest egg. Once you stop working, you can use the income from bonds to supplement your social security, pension or other retirement income stream.", "content_hash": "b61dd26a337fff2a0d00bf1bce6e9e9f", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The cash-rich companies, including the likes of Fastenal Co., Palantir Technologies Inc. and West Pharmaceutical Services Inc., have gained for three straight weeks, the longest run since Donald Trump’s initial tariff announcement sent markets into a tailspin.\nThe rotation lets traders who are growing anxious about the market’s three-month surge stay invested while trimming some exposure to more vulnerable companies. Buying shares of firms that have the financial wherewithal to withstand a slowing economy and the threat of margin compression from tariffs could limit downside exposure if the S&P 500’s run begins to falter.\n“We’ve been sensing that investors, while riding the rally higher, they’re getting nervous,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “A little caution is warranted” in the current market, he said.\nThe S&P 500 has surged 29% since a low on April 8, closing at a record on Tuesday. Much of the rally owes to artificial intelligence euphoria that’s powered Nvidia Corp. and Microsoft Corp. to multi-trillion dollar valuations. Solid corporate earnings bolstered optimism that Trump’s chaotic trade policies haven’t caused the damage expected. But most of the profit growth was clustered in tech and tech-adjacent sectors, papering over weakness among purveyors of consumer products and makers of industrial equipment.\nAs a consequence, Citigroup Inc. strategists noted “early” signs of a rebound in value factors from July into early August as investors sought companies whose shares were underpriced relative to financial fundamentals. That has meant losses for profitless tech companies and other speculative plays.\nHigher quality, defensive names have “held their own,” said Colin Cieszynski, portfolio manager and chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management. Telecommunication companies, utilities and insurance firms have performed well, along with the tech behemoths, he said. Other strong defensive performers include tobacco producer Philip Morris International Inc., which is up 40% in 2025.", "content_hash": "578023478a7acc33ecc78cf4ba69b585", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

That action handily beat out the S&P 500’s (SPY) about 25% gain during this same time period, which is a reflection of investors' enthusiasm for growth being fueled by AI.\nFrom a valuation point of view, Nvidia is priced at 45.40 times forward earnings and 34.16 times sales, much higher than industry averages in the semiconductor sector. Even though multiples this high would normally be seen to reflect a premium, this valuation is justified through its 55.85% net profit margin and return on equity in excess of 105%. Despite this, investors are paying for quality and scalability in a world where Nvidia enjoys a near-monopoly position in high-end AI chips.", "content_hash": "be98026daa5b2e1d89b2e3587ef11d70", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Thanks to artificial intelligence integration, the digital assistant can comment on an Instagram photo or scroll through a shopping app and add items to a cart.\nWith the new upgrades, Apple is exploring ways to make its voice control operate with precision inside interfaces. The upgrades would mark an important milestone and fulfillment of a promise that Siri made 15 years ago. It will also be a significant upgrade to the company’s hardware. Without App Intents, Apple’s products would be less compelling than those offered by Amazon and Google.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories. It also sells a variety of related services, including software, digital content, and subscription-based services. The stock boasts of a high return on equity of 149.81%, affirming its ability to convert shareholder equity to profit.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

That date marks the end of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit under U.S. President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” signed into law in July. The move effectively shortens what was, under the President Joe Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, a generous incentive slated to run through 2032. Now, with the clock ticking, the U.S. EV market is bracing for a major shift.\nIn this article, we’ll explore what the Sept. 30 deadline means for Tesla, how it could reshape U.S. EV demand, and why investors should mark their calendars for what may be one of the most pivotal dates for TSLA stock in 2025.\nTesla is a prominent innovator dedicated to accelerating the global transition to sustainable energy. The Elon Musk-led powerhouse designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems, and energy storage products. It also offers maintenance, installation, operation, charging, insurance, financial, and various other services related to its products. In addition, the company is increasingly focusing on products and services centered around AI, robotics, and automation. TSLA’s market cap currently stands at $1.1 trillion.\nShares of the EV maker have dropped 15.8%on a year-to-date basis. Tesla shares have been on a steady upward trend since Aug. 5. Several factors have supported the stock’s gains. First of all, there’s risk-on sentiment across markets, driven by Federal Reserve rate-cut expectations, easing global trade tensions, and a strong Q2 earnings season in the U.S. U.S. EV demand also appears strong in the third quarter, though this is likely driven by the impending loss of the $7,500 federal tax credit in September.\nTesla Rides Sales Surge Ahead of Tax Credit Expiration\nThe third-quarter EV buying frenzy is underway. The main reason is that consumers are rushing to purchase EVs ahead of a looming deadline to claim tax credits of up to $7,500. As a reminder, U.S. President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” signed in July, eliminates the tax credits for new, used, and leased EVs after Sept. 30.\nThe tax credits, worth up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used ones, are designed to make EV purchases more financially appealing to consumers. The EV tax incentives were among several policies implemented by the Biden administration to help reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, with the transportation sector being the nation’s largest emitter. Notably, under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, the tax credits were initially set to be available to consumers through 2032.\n“We’re expecting Q3 may be [a] record for EV sales because of the tax incentives going away,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, a senior analyst at Cox Automotive. The firm’s data revealed that consumers bought nearly 130,100 new EVs in July, marking the second-highest monthly sales on record, trailing only roughly 136,000 sold in December. Streaty said that July’s figures represent a 26.4% jump from June and an increase of nearly 20% compared to the same month last year. In addition, EVs made up roughly 9.1% of total passenger vehicle sales in July, the highest monthly share on record. All of this indicates that the impending expiration of the federal tax credit is fueling a surge in demand this quarter.\nAnalysts noted that dealers are leveraging the upcoming deadline to create a sense of urgency among consumers and drive sales. Tesla’s homepage now displays the message “$7,500 Federal Tax Credit Ending” in bold lettering. Beneath it, the automaker added, “Limited Inventory — Take Delivery Now.”\nMeanwhile, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja stated during the Q2 earnings call that the company is prioritizing building and delivering as many vehicles as possible in the U.S. before the tax credits expire. The company has recently extended the estimated wait time for its best-selling Model Y to four to six weeks, up from the previous one-to-three-week range. It’s an indication of increased order activity.\nOn the back of higher U.S. demand, Wall Street projects Tesla will deliver 430,000 vehicles globally in the third quarter. That represents an increase from the 384,000 vehicles delivered in the second quarter but remains below the 463,000 sold in Q3 2024.\nHow Could EV Tax Credit Elimination Impact Tesla?\nThe federal electric vehicle tax credit program has played a major role in boosting Tesla’s U.S. sales. With the expiration of these credits approaching, Tesla could soon be selling vehicles at effectively higher prices for consumers. And this applies not only to Tesla, but also to other automakers selling EVs, with analysts warning it could trigger a sharp drop in U.S. EV sales in the fourth quarter and beyond. Notably, there are already precedents for how similar policy changes have impacted EV adoption, as seen in Germany, where EV sales dropped sharply following the end of subsidies in late 2023. So, the first obvious implication is a decline in consumer demand.\nOf course, automakers could lower prices to help offset the loss of tax subsidies. For instance, Ford (F) cut prices on its Mustang Mach-E after it lost a $3,750 tax credit in January 2024, while General Motors (GM) provided a $7,500 incentive on models that lost the credits at that time. In Tesla’s case, this would impact its unit gross profits, as average vehicle selling prices would have to drop substantially to offset the loss of the EV tax credit. And this comes at a time when its average selling prices have already been under pressure in recent quarters due to intense competition.\nWith that, regardless of Tesla’s response, the elimination of EV tax credits represents a significant headwind for the company. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, during the Q2 earnings call, warned of tough times ahead for the company as incentives such as the EV tax credit phase out in the U.S. “We probably could have a few rough quarters,” Musk said.\nMeanwhile, the company is expected to launch its more affordable vehicle, which Musk described as resembling a Model Y, to the public in the fourth quarter. On the one hand, the vehicle is likely to provide some support to delivery volumes. On the other hand, the affordable model could cannibalize Model Y sales since it is essentially a stripped-down version of the latter. With that, monitoring delivery figures will be key to assessing the potential impact of cannibalization. Anyway, I expect a decline in deliveries, both sequentially and year-over-year, in Q4.\nOver the past few months, analysts have gradually reduced their estimates for Tesla’s fourth-quarter top and bottom lines. They currently expect Tesla’s adjusted EPS for Q4 to fall 45.5% year-over-year to $0.36, while revenue is projected to remain largely unchanged at $25.81 billion.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for TSLA Stock?\nWall Street analysts remain split on Tesla, with the stock carrying a consensus “Hold” rating. Among the 41 analysts covering the stock, 12 rate it as a “Strong Buy,” two as a “Moderate Buy,” 17 recommend holding, and 10 assign a “Strong Sell” rating. TSLA stock is currently trading above its average price target of $299.28.\nOn the date of publication, Oleksandr Pylypenko did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

These are the businesses that are making money from AI right now as AI hyperscalers and cloud infrastructure providers are rapidly building out their capacity to support AI training and inference.\nEven though many chip stocks have undergone massive growth over the past few years, I think their futures are still incredibly bright. In particular, I think these three are still no-brainer buys right now.\nNvidia\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is a fabless chip company -- it designs chips, but doesn't fabricate them internally. Instead, it farms out the manufacturing work. Its most in-demand products are its graphics processing units (GPUs), which have become the primary computing unit for AI, primarily because, as parallel processors, they are ideally suited to handle the types of computing tasks AI systems perform. Further, GPUs can be connected in clusters to amplify this effect.\nOver the past few years, Nvidia has delivered impressive and fairly steady sales growth on a dollar basis, although on a percentage basis, that growth rate has naturally moderated a bit lately.\nStill, 69% revenue growth is nothing to be disappointed about, and the 50% growth that management is projecting for Q2 is also impressive considering Nvidia's sheer size.\nSome investors may be worried that demand for its chips may slow, but projections from the AI hyperscalers -- its largest customers -- indicate that 2026 will be another record year for capital expenditures, which bodes well for Nvidia. Additionally, under a deal President Trump announced Monday, Nvidia will receive a license to export its H20 chips to China, in exchange for which the company will pay the U.S. government 15% of the revenues from those chips. With the U.S. imposing restrictions on the sales of top-of-the-line, cutting-edge chips to China, the H20 was designed specifically to be somewhat less powerful, and thus exportable without running afoul of Washington's trade policy.\nAlthough over the long term, Nvidia has been one of the best-performing stocks of all time, it still has plenty of room to continue growing at a rapid pace, making it a great stock to buy now.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) is Nvidia's chip fabricator, but it also produces chips for other tech giants like AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Its manufacturing technology is second to none, and it has become the leading semiconductor foundry worldwide.\nWhile some may be concerned that its headquarters are so close to mainland China, on an island that the government in Beijing still lays claim to, Taiwan Semiconductor is working to diversify its production away from Taiwan by building fabrication facilities worldwide. Its biggest investments of this type are in the U.S., where it plans to spend $165 billion on expanding its facilities in Arizona.\nManagement sees strong growth in demand for its services for the foreseeable future: It expects its AI revenue will grow at a 45% compound annual rate over the next five years, and projects that total revenue will increase at a 20% compound annual rate. Strong growth like that should allow Taiwan Semiconductor to remain a market-beating stock.\nASML\nASML(NASDAQ: ASML) is a critical supplier of tools for the chip industry. It has a technological monopoly on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, which are irreplaceable in the production of cutting-edge chips. These machines lay the microscopic electrical traces on chips, and ASML's technology allows fabricators to make smaller transistors and other components -- and thus denser, more powerful chips.\nWith ASML being the only company in the world able to build EUV lithography machines, any time you hear about new production facilities for high-end chips being built, you can assume that ASML is benefiting. However, because it's based in the Netherlands, any ASML machine coming into the U.S. will be subject to tariffs, which management noted is making it difficult to make sales and earnings forecasts for 2026. However, on its second-quarter earnings call, management reaffirmed its longer-term 2030 guidance for revenues of 44 billion euros to 60 billion euros, indicating it expects the turbulence to be a short-term phenomenon.\nASML's technological moat is currently unassailable, and the company is a key partner for chip producers worldwide. As long as demand for cutting-edge silicon continues to rise over the long term, so will ASML's stock, making it a no-brainer buy today.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Estimates suggest between 90 and 100 million Indians have owned or used cryptocurrency — roughly 6 to 7% of the country’s 1.4 billion people. The only country to see higher crypto trading volumes over that period? The United States.\nOn paper, India looks like a crypto powerhouse. In reality, the market is suffocating. Trading volumes on Indian exchanges have cratered since the government introduced a punishing tax regime in 2022: a flat 30% tax on gains, no offsetting losses, and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on every trade.\nThe industry operates in a gray zone — not banned, but not officially recognized as legal tender — with the Reserve Bank of India maintaining a skeptical stance, as per CNBC TV18.\nThe result is a curious paradox: millions of Indians hold crypto, but much of the real trading action has gone offshore. Those who remain in the domestic market often find themselves trapped between enthusiasm and exhaustion.\nAnd if there was ever a project to bridge India’s pop culture dominance with its crypto curiosity, it was BollyCoin.\nBollywood meets the blockchain\nIn 2021, filmmaker Atul Agnihotri — with none other than Salman Khan as the face of the brand — launched BollyCoin with the promise to “bring Bollywood to the blockchain.”\nThe concept was irresistible: digital collectibles from classic Hindi films, official partnerships with production houses like Salman Khan Films and Arbaaz Khan Productions, and the megastar himself posting, “Kya aap excited ho? [Are you excited] Salman Khan Static NFTs coming on @bollycoin”.\nFans were. Reports show BollyCoin sold its entire pre-sale of 20 million tokens in just 30 days, raising about $2 million. Its first NFT drop featured scenes and assets from the Dabangg franchise, one of Salman’s biggest hits.\nThe token (BOLLY) ran on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard and later bridged to Polygon for lower transaction fees. The total supply was set at 100 million, and holders could use BOLLY tokens to buy NFTs on the platform.\nIn 2022, the team introduced a “lock-in” staking scheme where holders could lock tokens for up to 24 months in exchange for monthly USDT payouts. They even launched a “Bolly Council” governance system, allowing the community to vote on project direction.\nFor a while, it worked. BollyCoin was the perfect storm of Bollywood glamor and blockchain hype.\nUntil it wasn’t.\nAt press time, BollyCoin’s official website was defunct. The last post made by the project on their Instagram account dates back to July 2024.\nFade to black\nWithin a year, marketplace trading volumes collapsed, and the BOLLY token lost more than 90% of its value. By late 2022, the dream of Bollywood’s NFT empire had evaporated.\nIt wasn’t alone. In the same year, the cricket-themed NFT platform Rario, backed by cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar, was riding high on fan engagement.\nPlayers like Arshdeep Singh even launched their own digital collectibles on Rario. But with the NFT market’s global cooldown and India’s domestic tax squeeze, momentum faded fast.\nOther Indian crypto ventures met a similar fate. NanoHealthCare Token (NHCT), launched in 2018 to revolutionize healthcare with blockchain, was abandoned by April 2020. By 2023, dozens of play-to-earn gaming projects had shuttered after failing to sustain token economies.\nTheStreet Roundtable reached out to both Rario and BollyCoin for comment but had not received a response by the time of publication.\nThe failures aren’t just about bad business models — they’re about operating in an environment designed to discourage crypto innovation.\nThe regulatory squeeze\nSince April 2022, every crypto transaction in India — even swapping one coin for another — has attracted a 1% TDS. The 30% tax on profits mirrors the highest slab rate for gambling winnings. Losses can’t be offset against gains, meaning one bad trade can erase the benefit of several good ones for tax purposes.\nThe government defends these rules as necessary for transparency and tracking, but industry leaders warn they’re killing the domestic market. According to the Esya Centre, a Delhi-based policy think tank, Indian exchanges lost over 81% of their trading volumes in the months after TDS was introduced. Many traders simply moved to offshore platforms that don’t enforce Indian tax rules.\nMeanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India maintains its stance that cryptocurrencies pose risks to financial stability. There’s no roadmap for regulation that might legitimize the industry, leaving projects like BollyCoin in limbo.\nIndia’s 30% tax on crypto gains pulled in about $32.4 million in financial year 2022 to 2023 and $52.7 million in financial year 2023 to 2024, despite no clear regulations for the sector. Data for 2024 to 2025 isn’t available yet, as filings are still underway.\nBollywood couldn’t beat the blockade\nBollyCoin’s collapse says as much about India’s crypto climate as it does about the fickle nature of NFT hype cycles. From 2021 to 2025, the trading volume of the NFT market decreased by 93%.\nEven with Salman Khan’s star power and a built-in Bollywood fanbase, the project couldn’t escape the gravity of declining NFT interest, low domestic liquidity, and high barriers to participation.\nWhen India’s grassroots adoption numbers are so high, you’d expect more homegrown crypto success stories. But the few that have tried — from Bollywood NFTs to cricket collectibles — have mostly fizzled. Not because Indians aren’t interested, but because the environment doesn’t reward sticking around.\nThe irony is sharp: India is a global leader in Web3 talent, with its developers powering major projects abroad, yet its domestic crypto economy is locked in survival mode.\nAnd it’s also a reminder: mass adoption doesn’t always mean mass participation. Tens of millions of Indians may own crypto, but until the rules change, the country’s biggest crypto plays will keep premiering somewhere else.\nAfter all, if even Salman Khan couldn’t keep the cameras rolling, what chance does anyone else have?", "content_hash": "844668da8e7c4aa02926a35deb633cbd", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

That report cut right to the chase, with no fluff. Just bullet points on bullish and bearish elements presently impacting the cocoa futures market. So here goes on my effort to replicate that report but focusing on gold (GCZ25) and silver (SIU25) markets. At the end I’ll give you my biases on price direction.\nThe Bull Case for Gold and Silver\n-\nLower U.S. interest rates are likely coming, and lower rates are also likely to come in other major economies. That suggests better global economic growth and in turn, better consumer and commercial demand for raw commodities, including precious metals. Lower interest rates mean lower bond yields, which are also bullish for gold and silver.\n-\nNear-term technicals remain firmly overall bullish for both gold and silver markets. Price action recently has been sideways and choppy for both metals, but at still historically elevated levels. Longer-term charts show gold and silver still in solid price uptrends, dating back to 2016 for gold and back to 2022 for silver.\n-\nThe U.S. dollar index ($DXY) has backed down from its August high and is starting to trend down on the daily bar chart. The weakening U.S. dollar index is friendly for the metals, as the USDX is an important outside-market element for gold and silver markets’ daily price direction.\n-\nA move by BRICS countries away from the U.S. dollar for their global financing. That’s bearish for the U.S. dollar, which is in turn friendly for the metals, as a weaker USDX is a friendly daily outside-market element for gold and silver. Also, some countries are replacing their U.S. dollar reserves in part with gold reserves.\n-\nGeopolitical tensions are never far away from the front burner of the marketplace, and any new development that creates uncertainty would prompt keener safe-haven buying of gold and silver.\nThe Bear Case for Gold and Silver\n-\nBoth gold and silver are in mature, or perhaps very mature, bull market runs. The bulls may be running low on fuel to extend the price uptrends. History shows raw commodity markets are cyclical, meaning going through cycles of boom and bust. The metals are in a boom cycle now, but a bust cycle is coming. We just don’t know when.\n-\nGold and silver markets have seen their near-term price uptrends stall out as prices grind sideways on the daily bar charts. There are stiff overhead technical resistance levels in gold and silver, at this year’s highs, which must be overcome for the bulls to gain fresh energy to extend the price uptrends.\n-\nNew record highs scored in the major U.S. stock indexes just today are bearish for gold and silver, from a competing asset class perspective.", "content_hash": "ef468aa6c94c0be0c075a9f00247d382", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The decision came right after NIO launched the new ONVO L90 SUV, which Macquarie analysts described as a “potential blockbuster” and possibly NIO’s “most competitive offering” to date.\nThe L90 is a six-seat SUV priced at RMB 265,800 ($36,857).

As such, removing references to reputation risk from such documents will likely have little practical effect.\n“If you’re an agency, you can’t go into court and say, ‘This person violated our guidance document,’” he said.\n“You have to show that they violated the statute or that they violated a codified regulation that went through notice and comment rulemaking.”\nManagement reports\nJulie Hill, the dean of the University of Wyoming’s law school, noted that Trump-appointed bank regulators have already said they will stop using reputation risk.\nWhile the regulators have new leadership, they are largely staffed by the same people who served under the Biden administration, Hill added. And reputation risk isn’t the only tool regulators can use to pressure banks to reject certain customers.\nAnti-money laundering laws are one reason banks often reject customers, according to Hill.\n“The vast, vast majority of suspicious activity reports don’t lead to any sort of follow up, let alone any sort of enforcement,” she told DL News.\nMoreover, banks are not allowed to tell customers that their account was flagged for suspicious activity.\n“We have a situation where banks had to file one or more SARs, and they decided it’s just not worth it, we should debank, because we don’t want our regulators upset with us, and it’s getting expensive to file all these SARs.”\nAnother tool at regulators’ disposal: management reports.\n“If a regulator suggests to a bank, ‘We think this is risky, maybe you want to stop doing it’ [but] it’s not really that risky, banks might do it anyway,” Hill said, “because their management rating will get downgraded and then that impacts all sorts of things, including their capital requirements.”\nThose ratings are also secret, according to Hill.\n“Anytime you see a really broad authority with very little limit, and then also a lot of secrecy or lack of transparency about how regulators or banks implement that, you’re likely to set up claims for debanking,” she said.\nBanks’ responsibility\nThe executive order also directs the regulators to identify financial institutions that had any “past or current, formal or informal, policies or practices that require, encourage, or otherwise influence … politicized or unlawful debanking.”\nFinding examples of politically-motivated debanking could be straightforward if the orders came from federal regulators, according to Hill.\n“It’s a much harder thing if what you think happened is the banks, for whatever reason, just decided to debank people for political reasons, unconnected with risk or profit or whatever,” she said.\n“There’s a real question about how we think regulators are going to figure that out and whether we think there’s any duty on the bank to voluntarily disclose it.”\nWhatever the effect of the executive order, both professors agreed that a new administration could reinstate the use of reputation risk unilaterally.\n“It kind of highlights how unsticky changes made by the executive branch are when it comes to discretionary enforcement,” Hill said. “This is one of those things that can change from administration to administration.”\nStevenson agreed.\n“If we ever get to have other presidents, the next president can just do another executive order and put it all back, like, overnight,” Stevenson said.\nAleks Gilbert is DL News’ New York-based DeFi correspondent.

See our Advertiser Disclosure.\nFederal student loans make up the majority of education loans — they now account for over 92% of outstanding balances — and it can take 10 years or more to fully repay your loans.\nAccording to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), borrowers have reported significant issues during their repayment, including issues related to student loan servicer errors, oversights, and poor communication.\nWhether your loan servicer gave you inaccurate information about income-driven repayment plans or withdrew the wrong payment amount from your bank account, knowing how to handle those issues and who to contact for help can save you headaches and financial stress.\nDepending on the situation, you can handle issues by contacting your loan servicer, contacting your state advocacy organization, or hiring a legal representative.\nStudent loan payments are back (and so are the consequences for missed payments)\nAfter years of the pandemic-era federal loan payment freeze, loan payments resumed in 2023. The federal government introduced a 12-month on-ramp, giving borrowers a year to get back in the habit of making loan payments without worrying about late fees, collections activity, or wage garnishment.\nHowever, the Department of Education resumed collections and other measures on defaulted student loans starting in May 2025.\nYour loans are in default if you haven't made a payment in 270 days or more. Once that occurs, the consequences can be severe; your wages may be garnished, you may lose your tax refund or other benefits, and the default will be reported to the major credit bureaus.\nMore changes to your federal student loans are on the way — see how Trump’s July 2025 budget bill will alter the federal financial aid program.\n4 most common student loan issues\nNow that payments are due — and default collection activities have restarted — any errors impacting your account have more serious consequences. Unfortunately, issues are fairly common.\nAccording to the latest Annual Report of the CFPB Student Loan Ombudsman, the CFPB received over 14,000 complaints about federal student loans in 2024 — an all-time high. The most common issues include:\n1. Repayment errors\nRepayment problems or errors were the top complaint, making up about one-third of all complaints. These issues included payment processing mistakes, which occur when on-time payments are wrongfully reported as late or incorrect amounts are withdrawn through autopay.\n2. Program delays\nIssues with the loan servicer can cause significant delays for borrowers pursuing loan forgiveness through a program like Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). In complaints to the CFPB, many borrowers reported meeting the program's payment and employment requirements, but had to wait months for forgiveness to be granted (and were wrongfully charged interest while they waited).\n3. Income-driven repayment mistakes\nIncome-driven repayment (IDR) plans give borrowers who cannot afford their loan payments some relief. However, many borrowers reported issues applying for an IDR plan and processing delays, leading to financial strain while they waited for the application to go through.\n4. Refund delays\nIn some cases, student loan borrowers are entitled to a refund; for example, if they reach the requirements for PSLF, they're eligible for a refund of any excess payments and interest. Plus, borrowers were temporarily eligible for a refund of payments they made during the COVID federal payment freeze. However, many borrowers told the CFPB that their refunds were delayed for months.\nWhat to do if you have a problem with your federal student loans\nIssues with your payments or accounts can cause serious issues, including damage to your credit and even wage garnishment. If you feel that your loan servicer has mishandled your account or made a mistake, taking action quickly is key.\nFederal student loan borrowers are typically encouraged to file a complaint with the Federal Student Loan Ombudsman Office (the ombudsman is an impartial resource that helps resolve disputes between borrowers and loan servicers) or to contact the CFPB if there's an issue. However, President Trump has introduced major changes to the education system and the agencies in charge of overseeing federal financial aid.\nIn March, President Trump issued an executive order to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education. As a result, the Ombudsman Office has limited staff; according to a recent ABC News report, the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Office has a backlog of more than 27,000 complaints after losing nearly two-thirds of its staff.\nTo make matters worse, CFPB efforts to protect and aid borrowers have been deprioritized, according to an April memo to staff.\nFor borrowers, that means help is harder to find. While you can still submit complaints via the options above, there are other actions you can take too.\n1. Contact your student loan servicer\nIf you notice any errors in the amount owed or your loan interest rates, contact your student loan servicer immediately. You can typically find their contact information on your monthly statement or via StudentAid.gov.\nBefore you contact your servicer, take time to review your loan documents to ensure there's actually an error.\nIt's a good idea to have your loan documents on hand when contacting your loan servicer. They may ask you for additional information and submit supporting documents, such as a copy of your loan statements or promissory note.\n2. Send a dispute letter to your servicer\nYou should follow up any phone calls to your servicer with a written email or letter to help you keep track of your communication with them. This is also an opportunity for you to provide them with supporting documents to support your case.\n3. Contact state advocacy organizations or government agencies\nSome states have launched their own student loan ombudsman offices or government agencies dedicated to helping student loan borrowers. As of 2025, 16 states and the District of Columbia have their own ombudsman offices. With the ombudsman, you can submit your case for review and assistance.\n4. Seek out legal advice\nIn cases of significant discrepancies or unresolved issues, you may want to consult with an attorney who specializes in student loan cases.\nYou can also escalate the issue to your state’s attorney general’s office. Your state attorney general’s office often has a section of its website or a direct phone line dedicated to consumer complaints and inquiries.", "content_hash": "e9ef424d97982cf09ca5c01ca1b3f4c5", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

That’s how market bubbles form.\nSome stock-market contrarians reassuringly say that investors’ current concern that the S&P 500 SPX, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA and the Nasdaq COMP are all forming a frothy U.S. market bubble is exactly why the market isn’t in one.\nBut a market bubble can materialize even when most investors are worried about one. Like now. A recent Bank of America fund-manager survey found that a record 91% of survey participants believe the stock market is overvalued, and Google Trends shows a sizable increase in recent weeks in the number of finance-related searches focusing on bubbles, as you can see from the chart below.\nMost Read from MarketWatch\n-\nHomeowners rush to refinance as mortgage-rate plunge opens window of opportunity\n-\nI’m a senior who barely survives on $1,300 a month. No way could I live on $1,000.\nWhen it comes to bubbles, contrarian analysis typically gets it wrong. An analysis of past bubbles suggests not only that widespread concern about bubbles is consistent with one forming — such worry actually plays a central role in a bubble’s latter stages. Consider the definition of bubbles from Robert Shiller, the Yale University finance professor who won a Nobel prize in large part because of his research into stock-market bubbles.\nIrrational exuberance\nIn his 2000 book “Irrational Exuberance,” Shiller wrote that a bubble is self-perpetuating: “News of price increases spurs investor enthusiasm, which spreads by psychological contagion from person to person, in the process amplifying stories that might justify the price increases and bringing in a larger and larger class of investors.”\nShiller added that these newcomers, “despite doubts about the real value of an investment, are drawn to it partly through envy of others’ successes and partly through a gambler’s excitement.”\nNotice from Shiller’s description that bubbles involve a high degree of cognitive dissonance: Despite concern about stocks’ overvaluation, investors bet heavily on equities. This dissonance is readily apparent in the Bank of America survey, for example: Even though 91% of survey respondents say that stocks are overvalued, they on balance are more bullish than they’ve been in months.\nInvestors resolve the dissonance by telling themselves they will know when the bubble is about to burst and get out in time. But the history of bubbles teaches us that this belief represents a triumph of hope over experience. It’s simply the greater-fool theory in disguise.\nC3.ai AI illustrates how quickly a bubble can burst. Earlier this week the company reported preliminary results for its July quarter that fell far short of analyst expectations, and its stock plunged almost 26% in a single session.", "content_hash": "717320d8b6aba3d649dcb8178727d5aa", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

(NYSE:ENIC) is one of the best NYSE penny stocks to invest in now. On July 31, the company held an earnings call in which management reported strong EBITDA growth in Q2 2025. EBITDA reached $293 million for the quarter and $659 million for the first half of the year. Net income for H1 2025 was $246 million, which is 8% lower than in the previous year. Management attributed the decrease to higher expenses for general and administrative functions, as well as higher depreciation.\nchungking/Shutterstock.com\nRevenue for the quarter fell by 7.3%. The company stated that the decline was primarily because of lower energy sales in the Generation Segment. The quarter’s operating revenues were $1.177 billion, down 12.6% compared to Q2 2024.\nOperational performance was also weak. Net electricity generation dropped 5% year-over-year, totaling 5.9 terawatt-hours (TWh). This decline was attributed to weaker hydropower output (hydro dispatch) and lower renewable electricity production. The company added that transmission bottlenecks and some unavailable thermal (gas or coal) units also caused efficiency losses.\nDespite the challenges, the company’s procurement and services dropped 16.1% year-over-year for the first half and nearly 20% for Q2 alone. The cash flow from operations surged to $403 million in H1 2025, much higher than in 2024.\nEnel Chile S.A. (NYSE:ENIC) is a Chilean electric utility company that generates, transmits, and distributes electricity throughout Chile. It operates over 8.5 GW of installed capacity, including approximately 6.5 GW from renewable sources.

Estimates suggest between 90 and 100 million Indians have owned or used cryptocurrency — roughly 6 to 7% of the country’s 1.4 billion people. The only country to see higher crypto trading volumes over that period? The United States.\nOn paper, India looks like a crypto powerhouse. In reality, the market is suffocating. Trading volumes on Indian exchanges have cratered since the government introduced a punishing tax regime in 2022: a flat 30% tax on gains, no offsetting losses, and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on every trade.\nThe industry operates in a gray zone — not banned, but not officially recognized as legal tender — with the Reserve Bank of India maintaining a skeptical stance, as per CNBC TV18.\nThe result is a curious paradox: millions of Indians hold crypto, but much of the real trading action has gone offshore. Those who remain in the domestic market often find themselves trapped between enthusiasm and exhaustion.\nAnd if there was ever a project to bridge India’s pop culture dominance with its crypto curiosity, it was BollyCoin.\nBollywood meets the blockchain\nIn 2021, filmmaker Atul Agnihotri — with none other than Salman Khan as the face of the brand — launched BollyCoin with the promise to “bring Bollywood to the blockchain.”\nThe concept was irresistible: digital collectibles from classic Hindi films, official partnerships with production houses like Salman Khan Films and Arbaaz Khan Productions, and the megastar himself posting, “Kya aap excited ho? [Are you excited] Salman Khan Static NFTs coming on @bollycoin”.\nFans were. Reports show BollyCoin sold its entire pre-sale of 20 million tokens in just 30 days, raising about $2 million. Its first NFT drop featured scenes and assets from the Dabangg franchise, one of Salman’s biggest hits.\nThe token (BOLLY) ran on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard and later bridged to Polygon for lower transaction fees. The total supply was set at 100 million, and holders could use BOLLY tokens to buy NFTs on the platform.\nIn 2022, the team introduced a “lock-in” staking scheme where holders could lock tokens for up to 24 months in exchange for monthly USDT payouts. They even launched a “Bolly Council” governance system, allowing the community to vote on project direction.\nFor a while, it worked. BollyCoin was the perfect storm of Bollywood glamor and blockchain hype.\nUntil it wasn’t.\nAt press time, BollyCoin’s official website was defunct. The last post made by the project on their Instagram account dates back to July 2024.\nFade to black\nWithin a year, marketplace trading volumes collapsed, and the BOLLY token lost more than 90% of its value. By late 2022, the dream of Bollywood’s NFT empire had evaporated.\nIt wasn’t alone. In the same year, the cricket-themed NFT platform Rario, backed by cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar, was riding high on fan engagement.\nPlayers like Arshdeep Singh even launched their own digital collectibles on Rario. But with the NFT market’s global cooldown and India’s domestic tax squeeze, momentum faded fast.\nOther Indian crypto ventures met a similar fate. NanoHealthCare Token (NHCT), launched in 2018 to revolutionize healthcare with blockchain, was abandoned by April 2020. By 2023, dozens of play-to-earn gaming projects had shuttered after failing to sustain token economies.\nTheStreet Roundtable reached out to both Rario and BollyCoin for comment but had not received a response by the time of publication.\nThe failures aren’t just about bad business models — they’re about operating in an environment designed to discourage crypto innovation.\nThe regulatory squeeze\nSince April 2022, every crypto transaction in India — even swapping one coin for another — has attracted a 1% TDS. The 30% tax on profits mirrors the highest slab rate for gambling winnings. Losses can’t be offset against gains, meaning one bad trade can erase the benefit of several good ones for tax purposes.\nThe government defends these rules as necessary for transparency and tracking, but industry leaders warn they’re killing the domestic market. According to the Esya Centre, a Delhi-based policy think tank, Indian exchanges lost over 81% of their trading volumes in the months after TDS was introduced. Many traders simply moved to offshore platforms that don’t enforce Indian tax rules.\nMeanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India maintains its stance that cryptocurrencies pose risks to financial stability. There’s no roadmap for regulation that might legitimize the industry, leaving projects like BollyCoin in limbo.\nIndia’s 30% tax on crypto gains pulled in about $32.4 million in financial year 2022 to 2023 and $52.7 million in financial year 2023 to 2024, despite no clear regulations for the sector. Data for 2024 to 2025 isn’t available yet, as filings are still underway.\nBollywood couldn’t beat the blockade\nBollyCoin’s collapse says as much about India’s crypto climate as it does about the fickle nature of NFT hype cycles. From 2021 to 2025, the trading volume of the NFT market decreased by 93%.\nEven with Salman Khan’s star power and a built-in Bollywood fanbase, the project couldn’t escape the gravity of declining NFT interest, low domestic liquidity, and high barriers to participation.\nWhen India’s grassroots adoption numbers are so high, you’d expect more homegrown crypto success stories. But the few that have tried — from Bollywood NFTs to cricket collectibles — have mostly fizzled. Not because Indians aren’t interested, but because the environment doesn’t reward sticking around.\nThe irony is sharp: India is a global leader in Web3 talent, with its developers powering major projects abroad, yet its domestic crypto economy is locked in survival mode.\nAnd it’s also a reminder: mass adoption doesn’t always mean mass participation. Tens of millions of Indians may own crypto, but until the rules change, the country’s biggest crypto plays will keep premiering somewhere else.\nAfter all, if even Salman Khan couldn’t keep the cameras rolling, what chance does anyone else have?", "content_hash": "844668da8e7c4aa02926a35deb633cbd", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

That report cut right to the chase, with no fluff. Just bullet points on bullish and bearish elements presently impacting the cocoa futures market. So here goes on my effort to replicate that report but focusing on gold (GCZ25) and silver (SIU25) markets. At the end I’ll give you my biases on price direction.\nThe Bull Case for Gold and Silver\n-\nLower U.S. interest rates are likely coming, and lower rates are also likely to come in other major economies. That suggests better global economic growth and in turn, better consumer and commercial demand for raw commodities, including precious metals. Lower interest rates mean lower bond yields, which are also bullish for gold and silver.\n-\nNear-term technicals remain firmly overall bullish for both gold and silver markets. Price action recently has been sideways and choppy for both metals, but at still historically elevated levels. Longer-term charts show gold and silver still in solid price uptrends, dating back to 2016 for gold and back to 2022 for silver.\n-\nThe U.S. dollar index ($DXY) has backed down from its August high and is starting to trend down on the daily bar chart. The weakening U.S. dollar index is friendly for the metals, as the USDX is an important outside-market element for gold and silver markets’ daily price direction.\n-\nA move by BRICS countries away from the U.S. dollar for their global financing. That’s bearish for the U.S. dollar, which is in turn friendly for the metals, as a weaker USDX is a friendly daily outside-market element for gold and silver. Also, some countries are replacing their U.S. dollar reserves in part with gold reserves.\n-\nGeopolitical tensions are never far away from the front burner of the marketplace, and any new development that creates uncertainty would prompt keener safe-haven buying of gold and silver.\nThe Bear Case for Gold and Silver\n-\nBoth gold and silver are in mature, or perhaps very mature, bull market runs. The bulls may be running low on fuel to extend the price uptrends. History shows raw commodity markets are cyclical, meaning going through cycles of boom and bust. The metals are in a boom cycle now, but a bust cycle is coming. We just don’t know when.\n-\nGold and silver markets have seen their near-term price uptrends stall out as prices grind sideways on the daily bar charts. There are stiff overhead technical resistance levels in gold and silver, at this year’s highs, which must be overcome for the bulls to gain fresh energy to extend the price uptrends.\n-\nNew record highs scored in the major U.S. stock indexes just today are bearish for gold and silver, from a competing asset class perspective.", "content_hash": "ef468aa6c94c0be0c075a9f00247d382", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The decision came right after NIO launched the new ONVO L90 SUV, which Macquarie analysts described as a “potential blockbuster” and possibly NIO’s “most competitive offering” to date.\nThe L90 is a six-seat SUV priced at RMB 265,800 ($36,857).

They see this as a key way for NIO to address its “core problem of insufficient volume” in past sales.\nMacquarie projects monthly sales for the L90 could reach 8,000–12,000 units and describes the vehicle as a possible “category killer” in its segment.

As such, removing references to reputation risk from such documents will likely have little practical effect.\n“If you’re an agency, you can’t go into court and say, ‘This person violated our guidance document,’” he said.\n“You have to show that they violated the statute or that they violated a codified regulation that went through notice and comment rulemaking.”\nManagement reports\nJulie Hill, the dean of the University of Wyoming’s law school, noted that Trump-appointed bank regulators have already said they will stop using reputation risk.\nWhile the regulators have new leadership, they are largely staffed by the same people who served under the Biden administration, Hill added. And reputation risk isn’t the only tool regulators can use to pressure banks to reject certain customers.\nAnti-money laundering laws are one reason banks often reject customers, according to Hill.\n“The vast, vast majority of suspicious activity reports don’t lead to any sort of follow up, let alone any sort of enforcement,” she told DL News.\nMoreover, banks are not allowed to tell customers that their account was flagged for suspicious activity.\n“We have a situation where banks had to file one or more SARs, and they decided it’s just not worth it, we should debank, because we don’t want our regulators upset with us, and it’s getting expensive to file all these SARs.”\nAnother tool at regulators’ disposal: management reports.\n“If a regulator suggests to a bank, ‘We think this is risky, maybe you want to stop doing it’ [but] it’s not really that risky, banks might do it anyway,” Hill said, “because their management rating will get downgraded and then that impacts all sorts of things, including their capital requirements.”\nThose ratings are also secret, according to Hill.\n“Anytime you see a really broad authority with very little limit, and then also a lot of secrecy or lack of transparency about how regulators or banks implement that, you’re likely to set up claims for debanking,” she said.\nBanks’ responsibility\nThe executive order also directs the regulators to identify financial institutions that had any “past or current, formal or informal, policies or practices that require, encourage, or otherwise influence … politicized or unlawful debanking.”\nFinding examples of politically-motivated debanking could be straightforward if the orders came from federal regulators, according to Hill.\n“It’s a much harder thing if what you think happened is the banks, for whatever reason, just decided to debank people for political reasons, unconnected with risk or profit or whatever,” she said.\n“There’s a real question about how we think regulators are going to figure that out and whether we think there’s any duty on the bank to voluntarily disclose it.”\nWhatever the effect of the executive order, both professors agreed that a new administration could reinstate the use of reputation risk unilaterally.\n“It kind of highlights how unsticky changes made by the executive branch are when it comes to discretionary enforcement,” Hill said. “This is one of those things that can change from administration to administration.”\nStevenson agreed.\n“If we ever get to have other presidents, the next president can just do another executive order and put it all back, like, overnight,” Stevenson said.\nAleks Gilbert is DL News’ New York-based DeFi correspondent.

See our Advertiser Disclosure.\nFederal student loans make up the majority of education loans — they now account for over 92% of outstanding balances — and it can take 10 years or more to fully repay your loans.\nAccording to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), borrowers have reported significant issues during their repayment, including issues related to student loan servicer errors, oversights, and poor communication.\nWhether your loan servicer gave you inaccurate information about income-driven repayment plans or withdrew the wrong payment amount from your bank account, knowing how to handle those issues and who to contact for help can save you headaches and financial stress.\nDepending on the situation, you can handle issues by contacting your loan servicer, contacting your state advocacy organization, or hiring a legal representative.\nStudent loan payments are back (and so are the consequences for missed payments)\nAfter years of the pandemic-era federal loan payment freeze, loan payments resumed in 2023. The federal government introduced a 12-month on-ramp, giving borrowers a year to get back in the habit of making loan payments without worrying about late fees, collections activity, or wage garnishment.\nHowever, the Department of Education resumed collections and other measures on defaulted student loans starting in May 2025.\nYour loans are in default if you haven't made a payment in 270 days or more. Once that occurs, the consequences can be severe; your wages may be garnished, you may lose your tax refund or other benefits, and the default will be reported to the major credit bureaus.\nMore changes to your federal student loans are on the way — see how Trump’s July 2025 budget bill will alter the federal financial aid program.\n4 most common student loan issues\nNow that payments are due — and default collection activities have restarted — any errors impacting your account have more serious consequences. Unfortunately, issues are fairly common.\nAccording to the latest Annual Report of the CFPB Student Loan Ombudsman, the CFPB received over 14,000 complaints about federal student loans in 2024 — an all-time high. The most common issues include:\n1. Repayment errors\nRepayment problems or errors were the top complaint, making up about one-third of all complaints. These issues included payment processing mistakes, which occur when on-time payments are wrongfully reported as late or incorrect amounts are withdrawn through autopay.\n2. Program delays\nIssues with the loan servicer can cause significant delays for borrowers pursuing loan forgiveness through a program like Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). In complaints to the CFPB, many borrowers reported meeting the program's payment and employment requirements, but had to wait months for forgiveness to be granted (and were wrongfully charged interest while they waited).\n3. Income-driven repayment mistakes\nIncome-driven repayment (IDR) plans give borrowers who cannot afford their loan payments some relief. However, many borrowers reported issues applying for an IDR plan and processing delays, leading to financial strain while they waited for the application to go through.\n4. Refund delays\nIn some cases, student loan borrowers are entitled to a refund; for example, if they reach the requirements for PSLF, they're eligible for a refund of any excess payments and interest. Plus, borrowers were temporarily eligible for a refund of payments they made during the COVID federal payment freeze. However, many borrowers told the CFPB that their refunds were delayed for months.\nWhat to do if you have a problem with your federal student loans\nIssues with your payments or accounts can cause serious issues, including damage to your credit and even wage garnishment. If you feel that your loan servicer has mishandled your account or made a mistake, taking action quickly is key.\nFederal student loan borrowers are typically encouraged to file a complaint with the Federal Student Loan Ombudsman Office (the ombudsman is an impartial resource that helps resolve disputes between borrowers and loan servicers) or to contact the CFPB if there's an issue. However, President Trump has introduced major changes to the education system and the agencies in charge of overseeing federal financial aid.\nIn March, President Trump issued an executive order to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education. As a result, the Ombudsman Office has limited staff; according to a recent ABC News report, the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Office has a backlog of more than 27,000 complaints after losing nearly two-thirds of its staff.\nTo make matters worse, CFPB efforts to protect and aid borrowers have been deprioritized, according to an April memo to staff.\nFor borrowers, that means help is harder to find. While you can still submit complaints via the options above, there are other actions you can take too.\n1. Contact your student loan servicer\nIf you notice any errors in the amount owed or your loan interest rates, contact your student loan servicer immediately. You can typically find their contact information on your monthly statement or via StudentAid.gov.\nBefore you contact your servicer, take time to review your loan documents to ensure there's actually an error.\nIt's a good idea to have your loan documents on hand when contacting your loan servicer. They may ask you for additional information and submit supporting documents, such as a copy of your loan statements or promissory note.\n2. Send a dispute letter to your servicer\nYou should follow up any phone calls to your servicer with a written email or letter to help you keep track of your communication with them. This is also an opportunity for you to provide them with supporting documents to support your case.\n3. Contact state advocacy organizations or government agencies\nSome states have launched their own student loan ombudsman offices or government agencies dedicated to helping student loan borrowers. As of 2025, 16 states and the District of Columbia have their own ombudsman offices. With the ombudsman, you can submit your case for review and assistance.\n4. Seek out legal advice\nIn cases of significant discrepancies or unresolved issues, you may want to consult with an attorney who specializes in student loan cases.\nYou can also escalate the issue to your state’s attorney general’s office. Your state attorney general’s office often has a section of its website or a direct phone line dedicated to consumer complaints and inquiries.", "content_hash": "e9ef424d97982cf09ca5c01ca1b3f4c5", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

That’s how market bubbles form.\nSome stock-market contrarians reassuringly say that investors’ current concern that the S&P 500 SPX, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA and the Nasdaq COMP are all forming a frothy U.S. market bubble is exactly why the market isn’t in one.\nBut a market bubble can materialize even when most investors are worried about one. Like now. A recent Bank of America fund-manager survey found that a record 91% of survey participants believe the stock market is overvalued, and Google Trends shows a sizable increase in recent weeks in the number of finance-related searches focusing on bubbles, as you can see from the chart below.\nMost Read from MarketWatch\n-\nHomeowners rush to refinance as mortgage-rate plunge opens window of opportunity\n-\nI’m a senior who barely survives on $1,300 a month. No way could I live on $1,000.\nWhen it comes to bubbles, contrarian analysis typically gets it wrong. An analysis of past bubbles suggests not only that widespread concern about bubbles is consistent with one forming — such worry actually plays a central role in a bubble’s latter stages. Consider the definition of bubbles from Robert Shiller, the Yale University finance professor who won a Nobel prize in large part because of his research into stock-market bubbles.\nIrrational exuberance\nIn his 2000 book “Irrational Exuberance,” Shiller wrote that a bubble is self-perpetuating: “News of price increases spurs investor enthusiasm, which spreads by psychological contagion from person to person, in the process amplifying stories that might justify the price increases and bringing in a larger and larger class of investors.”\nShiller added that these newcomers, “despite doubts about the real value of an investment, are drawn to it partly through envy of others’ successes and partly through a gambler’s excitement.”\nNotice from Shiller’s description that bubbles involve a high degree of cognitive dissonance: Despite concern about stocks’ overvaluation, investors bet heavily on equities. This dissonance is readily apparent in the Bank of America survey, for example: Even though 91% of survey respondents say that stocks are overvalued, they on balance are more bullish than they’ve been in months.\nInvestors resolve the dissonance by telling themselves they will know when the bubble is about to burst and get out in time. But the history of bubbles teaches us that this belief represents a triumph of hope over experience. It’s simply the greater-fool theory in disguise.\nC3.ai AI illustrates how quickly a bubble can burst. Earlier this week the company reported preliminary results for its July quarter that fell far short of analyst expectations, and its stock plunged almost 26% in a single session.", "content_hash": "717320d8b6aba3d649dcb8178727d5aa", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

In my column today I suggest that what's giving Fed Chair Jerome Powell his biggest headache right now is not the pressure or attacks from U.S. President Donald Trump, but the inconclusive economic data.\nIf you have more time to read, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today.\n1. Fed cut seen near certain after inflation data, Bessentcomments 2. U.S. embeds trackers in AI chip shipments to catchdiversions to China, sources say 3. Just in time? Manufacturers turn to AI to weather tariffstorm 4. China July bank loans unexpectedly contract for firsttime in 20 years 5. Stablecoins fuel liquidity, not yet money: Mike Dolan\nToday's Key Market Moves\n* FX: Dollar falls again, lowest in nearly three weeks onindex basis. Biggest G10 FX mover is sterling, up 0.5%. * STOCKS: MSCI All Country, Canada, Japan, S&P 500 andNasdaq hit new highs. Chinese stocks now up 16 of last 20sessions, Wall Street's VIX volatility index falls to 2025 low. * SHARES/SECTORS: Beaten-down healthcare, and basicmaterials sectors lead Wall Street rally, both up around 1.7%. * BONDS: U.S. yields down across the curve, as much as 6bps at the long end. The 'MOVE' implied volatility index fallsto lowest since January 2022. * COMMODITIES: Oil falls to lowest in more than twomonths. Brent crude touches $65/bbl, WTI dips below $62/bbl.\nToday's Talking Points:\n* Fed policy. In the realms of market pricing, a rate cut next month is now a nailed-on certainty, with traders putting the chances of a quarter point cut at 99.9%.\nThis wager was strengthened by comments from Bessent, who told Bloomberg News a 50-basis point cut was possible.\nBessent's comments are the latest in a growing list of verbal interventions - or outright political interference - from the Trump administration in the business and economics arena it traditionally steers clear of, like the Fed, non-partisan institutions, and private sector companies and banks.\n* Trump's Fed nominations. Bessent said early on Wednesday that no fewer than 11 candidates were being considered to replace Powell, whose term expires in May (or, earlier, if he is fired or resigns).\nThe president later shortened that list to three or four.\nInterestingly, absent from Bessent's list was current Council of Economic Advisers Stephen Miran, nominated to fill an open Fed board seat with a term that ends in January.\n* Trump-Putin meeting. The U.S. and Russian leaders are scheduled to meet in Alaska on Friday, a face-to-face which Ukraine's allies hope will see Trump urge Putin to agree a ceasefire without selling out Kyiv's interests or carving up its territory.\nTrump, Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskiy and European leaders met in a last-ditch videoconference on Wednesday to lay out Ukraine's red lines, a call Trump said was \"very friendly\".\nFrance's Emmanuel Macron said Trump was \"very clear\" that he wants to achieve a ceasefire in Alaska.\nFed more hamstrung by murky data than Trump interference\nIt's widely believed that U.S. President Donald Trump's insistence on lower interest rates is what's making life most difficult for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues. But what's causing the biggest headache for Fed officials is, in fact, probably more prosaic: economic data.\nThe key challenges facing Powell were encapsulated perfectly on Tuesday by the release of an inconclusive U.S. inflation readout followed by Trump's latest verbal attack – and threats of a \"major lawsuit.\"\nPolitics aside, most Fed officials agree that rates will fall this year, with the median \"dot plot\" in the Fed's June Summary of Economic Projections pointing to 50 basis points of easing through December. Traders are betting heavily that the first move will be in September.\nBut it's tough to justify that confidence based purely on economic data. While some indicators suggest policy should be eased sooner rather than later, others indicate that would be a high-risk move. Looking at the \"totality of the data,\" to borrow a phrase from Powell, there is no clear signal either way.\nPLENTY NOISE, FEW SIGNALS\nConsider the latest U.S. inflation and employment reports, the two most important data sets. On their own, they don't appear soft enough to warrant the Fed trimming rates right now, but they also aren't firm enough to dispel the notion that policy easing is only a question of \"when\" not \"if.\"\nAnnual headline CPI inflation held steady in July at 2.7%, contrary to an expected rise, with month-on-month increases in line with forecasts. But annual core inflation rose more than expected to 3.1%, the highest level since February and still meaningfully above the Fed's 2% target.\nEconomists calculate that durable goods prices rose 1.7% in the first six months of the year – the biggest six-month rise since 1987, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic. They warn there is likely more of that to come as Trump's tariffs kick in.\n\"July's CPI data are probably more worrying under the surface than in the headlines, and we expect the upward pressure to goods inflation to build in the coming months,\" James Pomeroy, a global economist at HSBC, wrote on Tuesday.\nMeanwhile, last week's employment report showed job growth in July was much weaker than anticipated, and, more importantly, downward revisions to the previous two months were among the biggest on record.\nBut these ominous signals were offset by accelerating wage growth, an increase in hours worked, and a meager rise in the unemployment rate. Hardly signs of a shaky labor market.\nNevertheless, markets focused more on the softer elements in the jobs data, suggesting investors think the Fed's bar to easing is much lower than the bar to standing pat. Indeed, the rates market is now pricing in a near-100% chance of a cut at the U.S. central bank's September 16-17 meeting.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nBut markets may be getting ahead of themselves.\nPowell has indicated that a rise in the unemployment rate is needed for the Fed to act. But that rate is potentially being distorted by post-pandemic labor supply issues - employers' reluctance to fire workers and Trump's immigration policies are limiting the number of people looking for work.\nRegardless, cutting before seeing a meaningful rise in the unemployment rate would be tough to justify, creating a significant communications problem for Powell.\nAnd on a more fundamental level, as economist Phil Suttle noted on Tuesday, is preparing to cut rates at full employment just as inflation is accelerating good risk management?\nThis is a particularly apt question when looking at financial markets: the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, gold, and bitcoin are all near record highs, and corporate bond spreads are the tightest in years. This hardly looks like a restrictive policy environment.\nIn that light, patience and caution would appear justified, especially given the added risk of appearing to buckle under Trump's political pressure. If the Fed wants to cut, Powell could use some cover. Unfortunately for him, he's unlikely to find that in this noisy data.\nWhat could move markets tomorrow?\n* Australia unemployment (July) * China's JD.com earnings (Q2) * UK GDP (Q2, preliminary) * UK industrial production (June) * UK trade (June) * Euro zone GDP (Q2, flash estimate) * Euro zone unemployment (Q2) * Euro zone industrial production (June) * U.S. weekly jobless claims * U.S. producer price inflation (July) * U.S. Fed officials on the stump: Richmond Fed PresidentThomas Barkin, St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem * U.S. earnings - Cisco Systems, Deere & Company\nWant to receive Trading Day in your inbox every weekday morning?

As a result, the shares of one of the more prominent multistate operators in the sector, Curaleaf (OTC: CURLF), motored to a gain of more than 10% on the day.

Meanwhile, on Wednesday, a Republican congressman quadrupled down on a legislative effort to get that job done.\nGreg Steube of Florida filed a bill he's sponsoring, the \"Marijuana 1-to-3 Act,\" for the fourth session in a row. The name references the \"schedules\" used by the Drug Enforcement Agency, from 1 (for the most harmful drugs with minimal medical value) to 5 (least harmful). The proposed rescheduling of pot would knock it down from 1 to 3 within 60 days of the bill's passing, effectively legalizing it.\nSteube has been an advocate for reform for years. In 2019, he said that if the restrictions on marijuana are loosened, \"the opportunities for research and study are drastically expanded.\"\nLegalize it, say Americans\nLeaning toward legalization is a clever stance for a politician to take, as there is very broad public support for reform of the federal government's harsh, rigid stance on the drug. According to a 2024 survey conducted by Gallup and cited by PBS News, support for legalization has risen dramatically, to 68% last year from 36% in 2005.\nShould you buy stock in Curaleaf right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Curaleaf, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Curaleaf wasn’t one of them.

The dollar index continued lower on increased expectations for Fed rate cuts through year-end. The dollar was also undercut by weaker dollar interest rate differentials, with the 10-year T-note yield falling by -5 bp.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Wednesday that interest rates are \"too constrictive\" and that rates \"should probably be 150, 175 basis points lower.\" He added, \"There's a very good chance of a 50 basis point cut. We could go into a series of rate cuts here, starting with a 50 basis point rate cut in September.\" The Fed is currently targeting the federal funds rate in the range of 4.25%-4.50% and the effective rate is currently at 4.33%.\nMore News from Barchart\nThe markets have started to think about the chances for a -50 basis point rate cut in September, based on Monday's largely benign CPI report and the fact that the US labor market is slowing, with average monthly payroll growth in May-July of only +35,000. On a year-on-year basis, Tuesday's July headline CPI of +2.7% y/y was slightly weaker than expected, but the core CPI of +3.1% y/y was slightly stronger than expected.\nThe federal funds futures market on Wednesday boosted the odds to 100% for a -25 bp rate cut in September and a slight 7% chance of a -50 bp rate cut. Those expectations were more dovish than the 96% chance for a -25 bp rate seen Tuesday and the 40% chance seen before the July payroll report was released on August 1.

President Trump on Monday downplayed expectations of a breakthrough, saying the summit is a \"feel-out meeting\" to end the war in Ukraine. Also, recent comments from Ukrainian President Zelenskiy dampened hopes for a quick end to the war when he rejected any talk of Ukraine ceding territory to Russia.\nIn recent tariff news, President Trump early Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. Last Wednesday, Mr. Trump announced that he will impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. Still, companies would be eligible for exemptions if they demonstrate a commitment to building their products in the US. However, the US will levy a separate tax on imports of electronic products that employ semiconductors. Also, Mr. Trump announced last Wednesday that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil. Last Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced \"within the next week or so.\" According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.", "content_hash": "e8e8cb1245592f1d7fd0c62fa84e619c", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The latest leg higher was driven by an inflation report that cemented bets the Federal Reserve will resume cutting interest rates next month.\nThat 30% jump in the S&P 500 Index from its April lows has now forced sell-side strategists who capitulated on their bullish views in April to U-turn once again by lifting their predictions to keep up with the furious momentum that few of them saw coming.\n“It’s tempting to flinch when the news flow turns negative, but that’s often when discipline matters most,” said Dave Mazza, chief executive officer at Roundhill Investments. “A good strategist trusts their process, not the whims of the market. And right now, that discipline is looking very smart for those who didn’t flinch.”\nWilson stuck to his 12-month S&P 500 target of 6,500 — just above where the index is now — and advised clients to buy the dip. And Harvey retained his year-end forecast of 7,007, one of the highest among Wall Street prognosticators, in anticipation that rate-cut bets and deregulation would propel stocks.\n“We had seen Trump 1.0. We know his style — it’s to go out to the nth degree and then to come back in,” Harvey said in an interview last month with , before he left Wells Fargo. “Furthermore, the underlying fundamentals were still fine,” he added, largely due to the outsized strength of the big technology companies.\nMeanwhile, Wilson attributed his bullishness to a Morgan Stanley sentiment indicator that showed “clear capitulation” on April 7, as well as the sharp recovery in what’s known as earnings-per-share revisions breadth — a measure of the number of analysts increasing versus downgrading their EPS estimates.\n“Combined, these two indicators suggested the rebound back would be sharp,” Wilson said in an email on Wednesday. “We also expected this selloff in our original forecast for 2025 — we thought the new administration would ‘kitchen sink’ the first half of the year. They did, it just happened even faster and more violently than we expected.”", "content_hash": "737d8946c9e4061b3e493d6919c47804", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

See our Advertiser Disclosure.\nNearly half of adults reported that their income just about matches their expenses, while close to one-third said their monthly expenses exceed their monthly income, according to a recent Yahoo Finance/Marist Poll survey.\nMeanwhile, the average household debt sits at over $100,000 according to the most recent data from Experian.\nWiping out large debts is no easy feat when your budget is tight. Yet, making extra payments beyond the minimums on your debt has several powerful benefits:\n-\nSave money on interest: The faster you reduce your balances, the less time interest has to accrue. On high-interest debts in particular (like credit cards), the savings can be significant.\n-\nPay off debt sooner: Every extra payment toward a debt shortens the payoff timeline. For installment loans (such as a mortgage, car loan, or personal loan), even a small extra monthly payment can shave months off the repayment schedule.\n-\nImprove credit utilization: For revolving accounts (namely, credit cards), extra payments lower your credit utilization ratio, which can boost your credit score.\n-\nReduce financial stress: A smaller debt balance means you have fewer monthly obligations to worry about. That can give you peace of mind that you aren’t overextended and can better handle financial surprises.\n-\nIncrease future cash flow: As you pay off your debt, it frees up more money for other priorities such as savings, investing, or big purchases.\nSo, if you’re working with a budget that doesn’t afford much wiggle room for making extra debt payments, it’s a good idea to look for ways to improve your cash flow.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nHow to increase cash flow for debt repayment\nCash flow is the movement of money in and out of your bank accounts. Having a positive cash flow means that you have more money coming in than going out, making it easier to save, invest, and pay down debt.\nA negative cash flow, on the other hand, means you’re spending more money than you’re bringing in, making it difficult to build any real wealth or hit your financial goals.\nIn order to tackle your debt, you’ll need to rework your finances so that you have enough cash left over to make extra payments. Here are a few steps you can take.\n1. Create a budget that works for you\nA budget gives you a clear snapshot of how much you have available to spend on various monthly expenses and how much money you have leftover. If you’re struggling to increase cash flow, having a clear and reliable budget will allow you to identify which spending categories can be cut back.\nThere are several different types of budgeting strategies you can use to optimize your spending and saving. Ultimately, the key is to choose a strategy that aligns with your financial personality so that you have an easier time sticking to it.\nRead more: Your complete guide to budgeting for 2025\n2. Increase your income (but not your lifestyle costs)\nCutting costs isn’t the only way to improve cash flow; you can also increase your income while keeping your spending the same.\nFor example, driving for rideshare services, freelancing online, tutoring, or delivering groceries can generate a few hundred dollars per month that can go directly toward debt repayment. But it's OK if you don’t have the time and energy for a side hustle or a second job. It may be time to make the case to your boss that you’re due for a raise, especially if you’ve had some major wins at work or have taken on new responsibilities.\n3. Restructure your debt\nIf high interest rates are inflating your payments, lowering them can improve cash flow and help you pay down the principal faster. For instance, you could consolidate multiple debts with a personal loan, which often has lower rates than credit cards. These installment loans also have fixed rates, making your payments more predictable and easier to fit into your budget.\nAnother option is using a balance transfer credit card with a promotional 0% APR. If you qualify, it can give you a window (typically, six to 18 months) to pay down your balance without interest.\nIf you’re struggling financially, ask lenders about hardship programs. They may agree to temporarily reduce your payments or interest rates, which can free up cash in the short term to aggressively pay down your debt.\nRead more: The pros and cons of refinancing your home\n4. Adjust the timing of money in vs. money out\nSometimes, successful cash flow management is a matter of timing.\nFor example, say you get paid on the 1st and 15th of every month, but your loan and credit card bills aren’t due until the last week of the month. That means you may have little cash leftover to put toward extra debt payments once all of your other bills are paid.\nThe good news is that most companies will let you move your payment due date. If you get paid biweekly, try to have roughly half of your recurring bills due after your first paycheck of the month, and the rest after your second.\nAdditionally, it’s helpful to avoid big payment pileups. For instance, if your rent/mortgage, car payment, and insurance bills all hit in the first week of the month, move at least one to mid-month to more effectively spread out your spending.", "content_hash": "e02c1a69b4f073192eb3f6560721250a", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

And if people don’t see you as a dependable, consistent, solution-oriented person, money’s never coming to you. Opportunity’s not coming to you.”\nJoin the discussion with CryptoWendyO on Roundtable here.\nOnce that foundation is set, he says the focus should be all-in on a single income-producing vehicle, not scattering small bets across multiple investments.

Because if the Bitcoin blows up, you need something to rely on to take care of your bills. I can’t eat Bitcoin.”\nGrant Cardone is a self-made real estate mogul, sales trainer, and motivational speaker whose empire spans multiple industries. He is the founder of Cardone Capital, a real estate investment firm that manages billions of dollars in multifamily properties across the United States.

See our Advertiser Disclosure.\nWhether you're starting a business or expanding your current one, you may need capital to pay for equipment, operations, or other expenses. A personal loan for business is one option for covering costs.\nPersonal loans offer a lump sum amount that you can put toward business and personal expenses. You'll pay back the amount over several years at a fixed interest rate. Unlike some business loans, you usually don't need to back a personal loan with collateral.\nAt the same time, it's worth comparing your options to determine the best way to finance your business. Understanding how personal loans work, along with how they compare to business loans, can help you make an informed decision.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nCan you use a personal loan for business?\nYou can often use a personal loan for business, but some lenders set restrictions on how you can use the money. Many say you can't put the funds toward investing, gambling, or higher education, for instance. Some also forbid personal loans for business use.\nIf the lender doesn't have this restriction, though, then you can use a personal loan for business. You could put the funds toward various expenses, including:\n-\nEquipment and tool purchases\n-\nInventory costs\n-\nLabor costs and payroll\n-\nMaintenance, repairs, and renovations\n-\nRent and property\nAs long as your lender allows it, you can use the funds from a personal loan to launch your business, pay for space, purchase inventory, hire employees, and otherwise grow your business.\nHow does a personal loan work?\nA personal loan is a type of installment loan, which means you repay it over a set period of time, often two to seven years. In general, personal loans are unsecured and don’t require collateral, an asset that the lender could repossess if you fail to pay the loan back.\nPersonal loans typically have fixed interest rates, so your payments will stay the same month after month. They are most commonly used for personal expenses such as home renovations, healthcare bills, or debt consolidation.\nThey’re easy to apply for, requiring a few pieces of documentation and a credit check to determine if you have:\n-\nA fair or good personal credit score, though you may be able to apply with a co-signer or pursue a bad-credit personal loan\n-\nEstablished credit history, with a diverse mix of accounts and a history of on-time monthly payments\n-\nA low debt-to-income ratio (DTI), which compares your total debt to your gross monthly income and helps lenders see if you can afford to take on more debt\n-\nStable income\nBecause borrowers don’t need to provide heaps of paperwork when applying for a personal loan, getting approved is quick. But if your business fails or you can’t afford to pay back the loan, your personal credit takes a hit — not your business credit. This may make it difficult to qualify for other types of credit later, such as credit cards, auto loans, or even a mortgage.\nPros and cons of using a personal loan for business purposes\nUsing a personal loan for business purposes may make sense for your business, but there are some considerations to keep in mind before you sign on the dotted line. Weigh the following pros and cons of using personal loans for business to decide if it’s right for you.\nWhen it’s a good idea to use a personal loan for business use\nBusiness owners may want to consider a personal loan for business use in the following scenarios.\n1. You don’t qualify for business funding or SBA loans\nFormal business funding options tend to have steeper requirements and more restrictions than personal loans. If you’re just starting your business, you may not have enough revenue or time in business to be approved. Small Business Administration (SBA) loans, furthermore, may restrict how you can use the money.\nIf you don’t meet the loan requirements of a business or SBA loan, a personal loan may be easier to qualify for, even if you need to compromise on the amount of money you borrow.\n2. You have good personal credit\nWhen you take out a loan, the interest rate is largely based on your creditworthiness. If you have a good credit score of 670 or higher, you may qualify for competitive rates and low (or no) origination fees on a personal loan.\nSome business loans look at your business credit when evaluating your application for a loan. If you have good personal credit but insufficient business credit, you may get better rates and terms on a personal loan than you would on a business loan.\n3. You don't want to put up collateral\nSome business loans, such as equipment financing, require collateral to back the loan. Pledging collateral can help you get a lower interest rate, but you risk losing your asset if you fall behind on payments.\nYou may also have to provide a personal guarantee on a business loan. This means that if your business can’t repay the loan, you are personally responsible for doing so — which means your personal assets, such as your home, could be taken by the bank if your business defaults.\nOne way to avoid pledging collateral or making a personal guarantee is by taking out a personal loan. There are still consequences for falling behind on payments, but you won't be risking any specific assets you pledged as collateral.\n4. You don’t need much capital\nTaking out a business loan can give your business access to millions of dollars. But what if you don’t need that much capital?\nMost personal loans start around $1,000 or $2,000 and go up to $50,000 or $100,000. Microbusinesses and home-based startups may only need a few thousand dollars to start, so you may not need a business loan at all — at least not right away.\nIn this case, a small personal loan may serve you well, giving you access to funds with few restrictions.\n5. You need flexibility\nWhen you take out a business loan, how you use the funds may be limited by the lender or the SBA. For example, if you only qualify for a microloan from an SBA intermediary, you can’t use those funds to purchase real estate, such as a storefront.\nOn the flip side, the best personal loans often have fewer restrictions than commercial funding options. This means you can use the funds to grow your business how you see fit, whether you need to pay off a business debt, purchase inventory, or cover your payroll.\n6. You need funding fast\nGetting approved for a business loan can take a while — anywhere from 30 to 90 days for an SBA loan. But applying and qualifying for a personal loan is a more straightforward process.\nMany lenders only require proof of income, address, and identity (like your driver’s license and Social Security number). This means you may get approved and receive funding in about one to five days — if not on the same day.\nOther types of business funding\nBefore taking out a personal loan for business, compare all your financing options. Some alternatives include:\n-\nBusiness loan: An installment loan that pays out a lump-sum payment upon approval.\n-\nBusiness line of credit: A flexible loan that pays out funds as needed, up to a defined limit.\n-\nEquipment loan: A loan that helps you pay for equipment purchases, including machinery, vehicles, computers, and office furniture.\n-\nBusiness mortgage: A loan to buy, renovate, or refinance a business or commercial property.\n-\nBusiness credit card: A credit card for business expenses that may earn rewards points and other perks. Some cards have a 0% APR promotional period, though interest rates can shoot up after that period ends.\nTraditional business loans aren’t always easy to qualify for. Many business lenders require you to meet certain requirements, such as:\n-\nMinimum revenue (for example, $100,000 in annual gross sales)\n-\nMinimum time in business (for example, two years or more)\n-\nAbility to secure the loan with collateral (such as an asset, down payment, or security deposit)\n-\nBusiness plan, financial statements, and other documentation\nSmall Business Administration loans\nYou can also apply for a business loan guaranteed U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). These types of loans are offered by banks and credit unions and backed by the SBA, reducing lender risk and making it easier for you to get funding with competitive rates and flexible eligibility requirements. SBA-backed loans include:\n-\n7(a) loans: A 7(a) loan is the SBA’s primary business loan. 7(a) loans may be used for working capital, refinancing business debt, buying or improving business property, purchasing supplies and tools, and changes of ownership. To qualify for a 7(a) loan, you must be actively operating a U.S. for-profit business, meet the SBA’s size requirements, be creditworthy and able to repay the loan, and be unable to get approved for a loan with reasonable terms from other sources. 7(a) loans are limited to a maximum of $5 million (though some 7(a) loan amounts are capped at $350,000).\n-\n504 loans: A 504 loan is a long-term, fixed-rate business loan to purchase or repair real estate, equipment, machinery, and other assets. 504 loans are offered through Certified Development Companies (CDCs) and can’t be used for working capital, debt consolidation, refinancing, or investments. To be eligible for a 504 loan, your company must be for-profit, have a net worth of less than $20 million, and earn an average net income of less than $6.5 million for the two years before you apply for a loan. 504 loans are limited to a maximum of $5.5 million.\n-\nMicroloans: Microloans are small business loans provided by nonprofit community-based SBA intermediaries. These loans can be used for working capital, inventory, supplies, furniture, tools, and equipment, but may not be used to pay off debt or buy real estate. Microloans are limited to $50,000, with each intermediary setting its own eligibility requirements. In general, you’ll need to provide some form of collateral and a personal guarantee to repay the loan, which must be repaid within seven years.\nIs a personal loan the best fit for your business?\nBusinesses need capital to survive and thrive, and a personal loan may provide the funding you seek. Personal loans are fast and flexible, and most don't require you to pledge collateral to borrow.\nIf you need to borrow more than $100,000, however, a business loan may be a better option. A business line of credit or credit card is also worth considering, especially if you have variable expenses.\nTake time to compare all your financing options, including their costs and eligibility requirements. By doing this research, you can choose the funding path that best supports your business goals.\nThis article was edited by Alicia Hahn.", "content_hash": "9801326eb6ea9af613e78e96bd14b504", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Although its high-profile obesity drug Wegovy has been a raging success, the company is being rocked by competition from both a rival and numerous third-party drug compounders.\nOn Wednesday, however, one analyst became notably more bullish on the Danish pharmaceutical company, and investors took this to heart. Collectively they pushed the company's share price up by more than 2% today, handily beating the 0.3% increase of the bellwether S&P 500 index.\nAn analyst makes an upgrade\nWell before market open today, BNP Paribas Exane's Peter Verdult upgraded his recommendation on Novo Nordisk. This doesn't make him a bull on the stock, however, as he only moved it up from underperform (sell) to neutral. As he did so, he also lifted his price target from $54 per share to $61.\nAccording to reports, Verdult's adjustments were based on financial modeling that was updated to reflect the latest trends driving prescriptions, foreign exchange, and drug pricing.\nAgain, this doesn't make Novo Nordisk a buy for the analyst, but given the company's share-price slump and the fact that Verdult is anticipating growth in sales and compound earnings of 7% and 8%, respectively, he believes it is fairly priced now.\nShifting focus\nRecently, Novo Nordisk announced measures to step up its legal fight against some compounders, indicating that it's focusing much of its attention on activities outside of drug development and commercialization. Still, Wegovy is a high-demand product, and the company remains tightly identified with weight loss treatments; this alone gives it significant value as an investment.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Novo Nordisk right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Novo Nordisk, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Novo Nordisk wasn’t one of them.

CK Hutchison's ports are not on the canal or part of it, however.\n\"We are into a new stage of our deal,\" group co-managing director and finance director Frank Sixt told analysts at an earnings conference.\n\"There is a reasonable chance that those discussions will lead to a deal that is good for all of the parties, ourselves included. And most importantly, that we'll be capable of being approved by all of the relevant authorities.\"\nOn July 28, the conglomerate said it was in talks to include a Chinese \"major strategic investor\" in the bid for its ports, and that it would allow as much time as needed to secure approval in relevant jurisdictions.\nOn Thursday, Sixt said these included China, the U.S., Britain and the European Union.\nHe said the talks were taking much longer than expected but that this was \"not particularly troublesome\" because the port business had delivered stronger earnings and cash flow this year than expected.\nSources have said the investor is COSCO - one of the world's dominant, vertically integrated marine transportation firms. They said COSCO wanted a bigger stake while the other parties were keen to keep it a minority.\nALLAYING CHINESE CONCERNS\nThe inclusion of a Chinese investor would alleviate Beijing's security concerns and have its blessing, the sources and other experts have said.

He will replace Sriram Krishnasamy, who stepped down in mid-July.\nThe hiring announcement came one day before FreightWaves published a commentary from parcel industry guru Satish Jindel, who argued Dataworks hasn’t made money because potential customers don’t view it as a neutral data analytics provider for optimizing e-commerce logistics. He recommended FedEx (NYSE: FDX) sell Dataworks to a fulfillment company, e-tailer or other party that can win the trust of interested users and fully harness its promise.\nTalwar was at Accenture for nearly 11 years. Before that, he held executive and management positions at Wipro, Dell Services and IBM. For nearly two years, he has been heavily engaged with FedEx’s digital transformation efforts through his advisory work at Accenture.\nFedEx said Talwar brings deep expertise in data science, digital infrastructure, and enterprise-scale transformation. In his roles, he helped businesses leverage technologies to increase business resiliency and accelerate digital adoption.\nTalwar will be responsible for developing digital solutions powered by data and AI, advanced technology, robust enterprise architecture, and comprehensive cybersecurity measures.\n“As a seasoned leader in the technology sector, Vishal has a proven track record in accelerating business growth through forward-thinking strategies and transformative digital solutions. His institutional knowledge and industry expertise will be instrumental as we continue to advance our long-term strategy and harness the full potential of FedEx intelligence to deliver even greater value to our customers and stockholders,” said CEO Raj Subramaniam.\nKrishnasamy also held the title of chief transformation officer and played a key role in the Drive strategy that eliminated $4 billion in structural costs over two years.

That is a big part of what will be the next wave of Drive. There will be some cost savings there but more importantly, speed to market because previously, every time we built a product around the world or had a change, picture proof of delivery, we had to interface with regional and operating company systems.

But some negative effects are anticipated, and that makes it necessary to keep a close eye on the matter,\" a manager at a chemical company wrote in the survey.\nThe newly agreed 15% auto tariff is still sharply higher than the 2.5% levy that had been in place before Trump's tariffs kicked in.\nFollowing the agreement, Toyota Motor cut its annual operating profit forecast by 16%, while Sony raised its full-year profit outlook by 4%, with the tariff impact expected to be smaller than first feared.\nReflecting the mixed views, about 38% of survey respondents said they expected a negative earnings impact from the agreement, while 20% anticipated a positive effect.\nThe bilateral tariff agreement is unlikely to have immediate sway over corporate Japan's capital expenditure, with 95% of respondents saying they would not change capital investment plans following the deal.\nThe survey was conducted by Nikkei Research for Reuters from July 30 to August 8.

The combined company is definitely a stronger company than it was as they were separately.”\nInvestors certainly saw the potential and traded shares of Gildan up 11.8 percent to $54.93 on Wednesday, leaving the company with a market capitalization of $8.2 million as it is set up to add branded staples Hanes, Bali, Maidenform, Wonderbra and more.\nGildan is ponying up just 13 percent, or $290 million, of the deal price in cash, with the rest of the company being bought for stock.\nThat cash purchase price will be covered quickly as the deal is expected to be “immediately accretive” to Gildan’s adjusted earnings and produce $200 million in annual cost synergies within three years.\nGildan is leaning forward and, except for the people impacted by those $200 million in cost savings, HanesBrands is in a much more protected position.\nMore brands might well be looking for a port in the storm.\n“There is a massive amount of disruption that’s coming,” said Michael Prendergast, managing director in Alvarez & Marsal’s Consumer and Retail Group.\n“Everyone is saying, ‘We’ve got it, we’ve adjusted our pricing, we’ve got concessions from our vendors and we have already optimized our supply chain,’ and then it kind of stops,” Prendergast said. “If you kind of get beneath the surface of what they’re really doing, the response is not strong enough to offset the tariffs that are actually coming.”\nThe tariff pauses have helped and a lot of retailers can live off of inventories they already own and use them to cushion the blow of higher prices, but Prendergast said the tone in the industry is starting to change.\n“People sort of punted and got through second-quarter earnings calls, got through kind of the beginning of third quarter, but it’s going to be disruptive as we go forward,” he said.\nThe fashion world has been too optimistic that consumers are going to be OK with higher costs and that companies can figure out how to manage, he said.\n“That is a very flawed approach because everything is pointing towards consumers are struggling with elevated prices and even a 5 to 10 percent increase in price from where we are today,” he said. “Consumers are going to react to that. If you really step back and look at it, there is an incremental 25 to 35 percent tariff coming.\n“People are kind of missing the plot,” he said. “It’s sort of this waiting to actually address the problem reactively versus proactively getting in front of it.”\nGildan, for one, is stepping up.\n“It’s an accretive move to strip expenses out of a business and then keep the revenue base,” Prendergast said. “I actually love this move.”\nIt’s a move that more CEOs might start looking at and wondering, is it my turn next?\nThe Bottom Line is a business analysis column written by Evan Clark, deputy managing editor, who has covered the fashion industry since 2000.

Experts warn the changes could significantly impact older Americans who rely on Medicare Advantage — the private coverage sometimes called Medicare Part C — with considerable implications for retirement planning.\nMajor insurers, including Humana, CVS Health Aetna and UnitedHealthcare, have all announced plans to scale back their Medicare Advantage operations in 2025 and 2026.\nLast May, CVS CFO Tom Cowhey said that the insurer could drop 1 in 10 — or roughly 600,000 — of its Medicare Advantage members by the end of 2025 in an effort to improve margins.\nREAD MORE:\nA health care planning checklist for financial advisors\nNew report reveals employees are underprepared for retirement and healthcare costs\nRetiree health care costs are climbing: What advisors need to know\nLong-term care costs can derail retirement plans. Here's how to manage them\n\"The goal for next year is margin over membership,\" Cowhey said. \"Could we lose up to 10% of our existing Medicare members next year? That's entirely possible. And that's OK, because we need to get this business back on track.\"\nHumana has followed suit, announcing plans earlier this year to drop approximately 550,000 Medicare Advantage members by the end of 2025.\nUnitedHealthcare, which until recently has pushed to expand its Medicare Advantage membership, announced plans last month to drop more than 600,000 members by the end of 2026.\n\"We are seeing higher-than-expected medical cost increases, particularly in outpatient care,\" UnitedHealthcare CEO Tim Noel said on the company's second-quarter earnings call. \"The American health system's long-standing cost problem is accelerating.\"\nTogether, Humana, CVS Health Aetna and UnitedHealthcare provide coverage to 58% of all Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, nearly 20 million people in total, according to KFF, a nonprofit health policy research, polling and news organization.\nMedicare Advantage plans gained popularity through $0 monthly premiums and expanded benefits compared to traditional Medicare. The program appealed to healthy beneficiaries and, until recently, delivered strong profits for insurers through generous government payments and upcoding practices. But rising medical costs and tighter oversight are pressuring margins, prompting some insurers to rethink their approach.\nMedicare experts like Melinda Caughill, the co-founder of 65 Incorporated, say that the shift could have major implications for financial advisors and the retirees they serve.\nAdvisors should understand the two paths that could shape the experience of retirees enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans.\nFor beneficiaries who remain on Medicare Advantage plans going forward, they're likely to see fewer benefits, higher costs in the form of premiums and copays and greater prior authorization requirements.\n\"Prior Authorization means your doctor is not in charge of your health care needs,\" Caughill said. \"Your doctor just advocates for you to an insurance company. Ultimately, the insurance company decides what you get or what you don't get.\"\nMedicare Advantage insurers made nearly 50 million prior authorization determinations in 2023, according to KFF. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, meanwhile, conducted fewer than 400,000 prior authorization reviews for traditional Medicare beneficiaries in that same time period.\nNearly all Medicare Advantage enrollees (99%) must get prior authorization for certain services — typically high-cost care like inpatient hospital stays, skilled nursing facility care and chemotherapy.\nOnce retirees enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, leaving it isn't always simple. In most cases, beneficiaries can only switch back to traditional Medicare during specific enrollment periods, and doing so often means losing access to certain supplemental coverage options.\nMedigap policies, which help cover out-of-pocket costs under original Medicare, may require medical underwriting if purchased after the initial enrollment window — making it more expensive or, in some cases, even impossible for older or less healthy individuals to qualify. For many retirees, that creates a barrier to exiting a Medicare Advantage plan once they're already in it.\nFor the small number of members who are dropped from their plans, Caughill calls the next step the \"nuclear option.\"\n\"When you are dropped from a Medicare Advantage policy based on no action or choice of your own, you get a Medicare do-over, meaning you can get a Medigap policy with no medical underwriting,\" Caughill said.\nWhile Medigap plans aren't strictly necessary, they can help cover costs that traditional Medicare doesn't.\n\"You can get original Medicare by itself, but then that means you'll pay 20% of every bill with no spending limit in sight. But astonishingly, the number of people who wind up doing that when they're really sick is so huge that the government wrote a study on it, because they'd rather pay 20% of everything and at least get the care they need than remain on Medicare Advantage,\" Caughill said. \"So people need to understand that these decisions are very often long-lasting. You can't just all of a sudden say, 'Ooh, here comes open enrollment, Oct. 15 through Dec. 7, and now we'll fix everything.' It's a lot more complicated than that. It's a lot more permanent than that.\"\nFor many financial advisors guiding older clients, the advice is clear: Steer clear of Medicare Advantage from the outset.\nCarolyn McClanahan, a physician and founder of Life Planning Partners in Jacksonville, Florida, tells clients to think twice before signing up. The allure of Medicare Advantage often comes from lower upfront costs and extra perks — things like gym memberships or dental coverage.\n\"When you are healthy, you don't have any problem with [Medicare Advantage] because you don't need to access health care often. The insurers are happy with that crowd because they are making money,\" McClanahan said.\nThe picture changes dramatically when health issues arise. Along with prior authorization requirements, insurers often narrow their networks further as expenses rise, making it harder for patients to find doctors.\n\"Once you get sick and have to experience the limitations of [Medicare Advantage], you wish you were on traditional Medicare,\" McClanahan said. \"But because you are sick, you will have a problem with the underwriting to get back on a Medigap policy.\"\nCaughill said it's crucial that advisors educate themselves on Medicare and incorporate it into their retirement planning.\n\"I'm constantly on a soapbox with financial advisors to try to get them to care,\" Caughill said. \"Because at some point, a financial advisor who doesn't care, who doesn't consider Medicare, … will have conversations with their best clients in 10 or 15 years [and say], 'Oh, you have all these unexpected medical costs now, and this skilled nursing facility stay is not covered. What are we going to do?'\"\n\"I get it. We all want to do just what we signed up for. But Medicare is, unfortunately, a prevalent part of retirement,\" she said. \"You can't do retirement planning without considering the number one cost in retirement, which is health care, which in this country is Medicare.\"", "content_hash": "6088cae8fac9be5418823de2f554c620", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

But not for every stock. Even some of the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) seemingly safe dividend stocks have been upended, even if only because so many investors would rather own far more exciting growth stocks at this time.\nVeteran investors know the time to step into quality names is when they're down. Time will take care of the rest.\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of three solid dividend-paying S&P 500 stocks that income-minded investors might want to buy while they're still on sale and hold forever.\n1. Merck\nThere's no denying Merck(NYSE: MRK) has become a bit too dependent on its cancer-fighting wonder drug Keytruda. The immunotherapy now accounts for half of the pharmaceutical company's total revenue. But, with its key U.S. patents set to expire in 2028 while its European patents are slated to expire in 2031, the company's struggle to come up with anything to fully replace these jeopardized sales is a big reason shares are down 39% from last year's peak. Well, that and headwinds for its HPV vaccine Gardasil in China.\nThe thing is, the stock sellers may have overshot their target, failing to recognize just how promising this pharmaceutical giant's pipeline actually is.\nTake MK-1022 as an example. Although the non-small cell lung cancer market it's addressing is a relatively crowded one, according to several analysts, this antibody-drug conjugate capable of delivering chemotherapy directly to diseased cells could, at its peak, produce annual sales of around $5 billion. The company's cholesterol drug MK-0616 could do just as well, and like MK-1022, is showing great promise in late-stage trials.\nAll told, Merck contends it's got as many as 20 drugs with blockbuster potential in the works that are collectively capable of driving more than $50 billion in annual sales by the mid-2030s. Approval and sales are not guaranteed, but that's more than Keytruda would have ever been able to produce on its own.\nThere will certainly be some developmental stumbles and setbacks along the way. With shares priced at less than 9 times this year's expected earnings, though -- and with its dividend yield pumped up to 4% -- all of Merck's current and future challenges are already priced in.\n2. Target\nGeneral merchandise retailer Target(NYSE: TGT) has been out of its element for some time now. In a normal, reasonably healthy economic environment, consumers are willing to pay its sometimes slightly higher prices for a premium experience that rival Walmart can't quite match. Given the inflation-riddled economic lethargy the country (as well as the rest of the world) has suffered since 2022, though, Target's struggled to draw its usual crowd. It's also been caught in the country's DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) fracas. Its first-quarter same-store sales dip of 3.8% extended a long streak of rather persistent weakness. That's why the stock's down 60% from its late-2021 pandemic-prompted peak.\nWhat if, however, the domestic economy was going to defy the apparent odds and ease back into a place of economic strength rather than sliding into a long-expected recession?\nDon't rule out the possibility. While plenty of people are lamenting the high cost of everything, the Conference Board said its consumer confidence index rose two points in July. And although accounting firm EY expects the country's GDP growth to cool to a pace of 1.5% this year en route to 1.4% next year, that's still growth. Let's also not forget that the second quarter's initial GDP growth estimate of 3% handily topped estimates of 2.5% even if it was tariff uncertainty behind much of it. Growth is still growth.\nThe dark cloud of future tariffs and the prices they raise is still in place, but even then it increasingly looks like President Donald Trump is using tariffs as a negotiating tool to get what he wants rather than as a means of raising revenue. Apple's iPhone, for instance, was recently made exempt from semiconductor tariffs in exchange for CEO Tim Cook's promise to invest in more American manufacturing of the device's components.\nIt's admittedly not the easiest of bets to make at this time. Most factors seems to still be working against Target's unique \"cheap chic\" premium-value approach to merchandising. And maybe the U.S. economy will remain tepid.\nAs the old adage goes, though, expect it when you least expect. Most people didn't expect 2002's or 2009's economic recoveries either until they were well underway. Time really does eventually heal all wounds. Know that the company is also (finally) making some meaningful strategic changes.\nAnd, priced at about 14 times this year's expected earnings and with a forward-looking dividend yield of 4.3%, investors are being paid pretty well for the minimal amount of risk they are taking with Target.\n3. PepsiCo\nFinally, add PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) to your list of S&P 500 dividend stocks to buy and hold forever while you can plug into its forward-looking yield of just under 4% as I write this. The 26% setback it's suffered since its 2023 high has likely run its course and is ready to reverse.\nThe difference between this stock's performance and rival Coca-Cola's is stark, but understandable. Unlike Coke, PepsiCo owns and operates the majority of its own bottling facilities, where much of the cost of the beverage business lies. When the cost of everything ranging from commodities to logistics to utilities started to rise in earnest a couple of years back, it took a sizable bite out of a bottom line that's already built on paper-thin profit margins. And price increases weren't necessarily an easy solution.\nPerhaps PepsiCo's bigger challenge over the course of the past three years, however, was on the food front, which is even less fiscally flexible than the beverage business. See, PepsiCo also owns Frito-Lay, which is parent to iconic snack chip brands like Cheetos, Doritos, and, of course, Lay's potato chips. It also owns Quaker Oats, a brand that's about more than just a hot bowl for breakfast. Consumers have been particularly cost-conscious when it comes to these sorts of groceries.\nAs is the case with Target's business, though, PepsiCo's company-specific headwinds may be about to ease if not outright cease. And not just because of the potentially improving economic backdrop resulting from the waning inflation the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee believes will continue cooling through 2027. PepsiCo's also adapting to the new normal. Just within the past few months PepsiCo has unveiled several healthier snack chip options as well as beverage choices like a prebiotic cola. Meanwhile, the company's embraced technology to tackle tricky tasks like optimizing its supply chain or making its distribution centers more efficient.\nNone of these will necessarily reignite sales growth in a major way on their own. All of them, however, position PepsiCo for to take advantage of consumers' rekindled splurging and ever-growing healthy-snacking movement.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Target right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Target, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Target wasn’t one of them.

Small caps built on yesterday's 3% gain, which was fueled by a better-than-feared report on consumer prices. The data showed that Inflation held steady at 2.7% in July, surprising Wall Street, which was braced for tariffs to cause prices to rise faster.\nMorgan Stanley analysts on Monday predicted that the odds of a rate cut in September—around 90% at the time—would rise if yesterday’s report showed few signs that tariffs were materially affecting consumer prices. “This has the potential to catalyze a more durable rotation to small caps and lower quality stocks,” the firm said.\nTuesday's data appears to have convinced investors that the Federal Reserve will look through tariff-driven inflation at its policy meeting next month. As of late Wednesday, traders saw a 96% chance of a quarter percentage point cut in the benchmark interest rate, according to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool.\n“The prospect of rate cuts bodes well for many of the traditional value sectors and small cap stocks that we have recommended clients should overweight,” said Eric Teal, Chief Investment Officer at Comerica Wealth Management, on Wednesday. “These areas have lagged the technology and growth sectors and are primed to lead the market higher as breadth expands.”\nRate Cuts Could Give Small Caps a Big Boost\nSmall-cap stocks benefit disproportionately from lower interest rates because they are more likely than large companies to rely on credit to fund growth, and are more likely to have floating-rate loans. They also tend to operate more domestic businesses, and thus benefit more than multinationals from the stimulative effects—boosted consumer and business spending—of lower rates.\nA rate cut next month would come at an opportune time for small-cap investors. Small caps grew earnings for the first time in more than a year last quarter, and are expected to outpace mid and large caps throughout the second half, according to Bank of America.", "content_hash": "a2cc9f49faf9d952cdf912742641e43a", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Ever considered investing in real estate? You might already have a big piece of what you need. \"House hacking\" is a new strategy homeowners are using to kick-start their rental portfolios.\nIn today's big story, the latest inflation data gave investors a reason to feel upbeat about what's coming next.\nNot too hot, not too cold — this was just right. The latest inflation report struck a good balance, delivering a best-case scenario for the stock market.\nThe S&P 500 closed at a record high on Tuesday, while the Nasdaq rose over 1% and the Dow spiked nearly 500 points. US stock futures are continuing the climb this morning.\nThe consumer price index rose 2.7% year-over-year in July, below economists' expectations of 2.8%. The figures may seem marginal, but for markets, this was the sweet spot.\nThat's largely because it was likely low enough to allow the Federal Reserve to cut rates at its September meeting, BI's William Edwards writes.\nAt the same time, the inflation reading was high enough to ease recession fears that had flared after the disappointing July jobs report, which included significant downward revisions to previous data.\nMeanwhile, the latest inflation report opens up more positive possibilities. The CME FedWatch Tool now shows markets seeing 92% odds the Fed cuts rates by 25 basis points next month, up from about 80% on Monday. Higher odds are also now being priced in for cuts in October and December.\nFor Trump, rate cuts can't come soon enough.\n\"Jerome 'Too Late' Powell must NOW lower the rate. Steve 'Manouychin' really gave me a 'beauty' when he pushed this loser. The damage he has done by always being Too Late is incalculable.\"\nWriting in a Truth Social post early Tuesday, Trump said that he is also \"considering allowing a major lawsuit against Powell to proceed\" over the \"grossly incompetent\" job he's done renovating the Federal Reserve.\nThis is the latest twist in Trump's feud with the Fed Chair, which seems to remain in an uncomfortable phase. The markets, at least, may be entering a brighter one.\n3 things in markets\n1. America's biggest bank is about to open its new headquarters. JPMorgan Chase's new 60-story skyscraper at 270 Park Avenue is full of high-end perks and amenities. The building includes a \"state-of-the-art\" gym — which the bank said employees will have to pay a membership fee to access — an Irish pub, AI tech systems, and more. Take a look.\n2. A September showdown may be looming. Day traders outperformed professional money managers this summer, but their dominance might not last long. A historically seasonal pullback in retail trading and other headwinds threaten to upend the summer-long rally.\n3. Trump's pick for Bureau of Labor Statistics chief suggested pausing US jobs reports. E.J. Antoni, Trump's nominee and chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, floated the idea on Fox News Digital earlier this month, citing accuracy concerns. Economists and market strategists told BI that such a move would be damaging for investors and economic planners.\n3 things in tech\n1. Microsoft has Meta AI talent in its sights. The software giant has a list of its most-wanted researchers and engineers from Meta and has already begun offering multimillion-dollar pay packages, documents viewed by BI's Ashley Stewart reveal. It's a step to compete with the eye-popping comp Microsoft's rivals are offering in the AI talent wars.\n2. AI coding startups have an inference whale problem. Anthropic and Cursor are facing surging costs from a handful of heavy users, which is eating into their business models. As a result, they're introducing tiers or rate limits to what was formerly a basic fixed-price monthly subscription plan.\n3. Baconator with a side of AI? Michael Chorey, the executive responsible for building out the AI automation for Wendy's drive-thru, which he says can take orders faster than a human in a headset, is leaving after five years. Chorey exclusively told BI that he is joining Presto, a tech company developing AI-first drive-thrus, which he believes is the next era of fast-food hospitality.\n3 things in business\n1. To solve the housing crisis, think outside the bounds. Outside the city bounds, that is. Ned Resnikoff argues that connecting cities, towns, and suburbs into large regional governances would make it easier and cheaper to buy a home in the US.

These proposals resemble the very model that enabled Luckin Coffee Inc. to overtake Starbucks as China’s biggest coffee chain two years ago by selling coffee at one-third of its price.\nMost of the prospective investors want a controlling stake of the Seattle-based company’s Chinese business. And while Starbucks has said it’ll only partner with an investor aligned with its vision, the process has put its local Chinese management team on tenterhooks, worried that a brand they’ve spent decades building will become just another low-price, trend-following chain, said people familiar with the matter.\nThe stake sale exercise is underscoring Starbucks’ identity crisis in China as it tries to salvage a flagging legacy business amid fierce domestic competition — a problem that has afflicted other foreign brands as China’s economy undergoes major shifts. What Starbucks chooses to do in China will decide whether it ends up successful like McDonald’s Corp., or faltering like Apple Inc.\nStarbucks is “in a tough position,” said Mark Tanner, managing director of consultancy China Skinny in Shanghai. “Many cost-conscious consumers are opting for cheaper alternatives, but trying to compete on price will be a race to the bottom, destroying any margins they currently hold.”\nA spokeswoman for Starbucks declined to comment but referred to comments regarding its China business recovery and stake sale process in its most recent earnings.\nStarbucks brought the cafe experience to China in the 1990s, and as China’s economic growth soared, its footprint expanded in tandem to bring its total number of stores there to over 7,800. In recent years, however, Western brands have been losing ground to local names amid rising nationalism and reluctance to pay premiums for brands.\nThe very few American brands that still thrive in China’s great consumer pullback made successful adaptations to their business. Yum China Holdings Inc.’s KFC incorporated street food and local delicacies into its menu and offers cost-conscious consumers meal deals all year long. Walmart Inc.’s Sam’s Club taps into the middle class’s craving for exclusivity and growing health consciousness with high-quality private label snacks and premium meat cuts.\nStarbucks seems stuck in between those models. While its “third place” store format is expensive to upkeep, customers have become less willing to pay higher prices for its drinks since the Covid pandemic and ongoing economic downturn. Compounding the problem was previous China Chief Executive Officer Belinda Wong’s tendency to hew more closely to the company’s strategy in developed Western markets, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Wong rejected ideas like a lower-price spinoff chain before Covid, as well as more localized campaigns during the pandemic, the people said, citing a belief that they conflicted with Starbucks’ brand.\nNew initiatives have been launched rapidly since new CEO Molly Liu took over in late 2024. These included a cheaper line of tea-based drinks and sugar-free options, and tie-ups with the movie and Taiwanese rock band Mayday, all under the aegis of a new chief growth officer. Liu’s understanding of the Chinese market enables different ideas to be discussed and approved more easily, the people said.\n“Starbucks’ new product innovation and marketing campaigns this year show it’s digging deeper to explore the demand of Chinese consumers,” said Roolee Lu, Shanghai-based director of consultancy Mintel Group Ltd. “They want new products, they want emotional connection with brands, they need some comprehensive, immersive experiences.”\nThere are signs of a turnaround. Based on conversations with three store managers in Shanghai, drinks co-branded with Mayday drove their May sales by as much as 20% in their stores. Overall, the most recent quarter showed sales returning to growth since late 2023 in China, with Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol attributing the success in an earnings call last month to “beverage innovation” and changes to “non-coffee pricing.”\nYet the lack of a clear strategy endures, especially around its stores which, depending on who you ask, are either a vaunted part of brand identity or an expensive cost overhang. The Chinese management team is now experimenting with different ways to bring people in. These include making more stores pet-friendly, providing free-to-use study rooms and targeting store openings in heritage or scenic sites, such as a recent one in Yunnan’s Yulong Snow Mountain.\nFrom the potential investors’ perspective, it isn’t necessary to have large stores if Starbucks aims to capture the needs of busy professionals who are unlikely to linger, though some shops should maintain in-store experiences, said people familiar with the proposals. Cutting the number of staff in stores is also an option, the people said, as many local chains only have one employee as orders are mostly taken online.\nJessica Gleeson, a former Starbucks China executive who now runs her own retail consultancy in Shanghai, said the risk is that the new investor doesn’t understand Starbucks’ positioning in China and turns it into just another “transactional” coffee chain.\n“The low-end of the market is already crowded,” she said.\nWhichever direction Starbucks China takes, one thing is clear: It’ll regain past glory only if consumers like Jelly Li can be persuaded to become regular customers again.\nThe 32-year-old musician from Guangzhou was recently at a Starbucks in Shanghai with a view of the Oriental Pearl Tower. She was unimpressed by the orange-flavored ice-shaken espresso she ordered, noting: “Starbucks taught me how to enjoy coffee when I was in college. Now I need coffee every day but no longer pay for Starbucks.”", "content_hash": "59e72213414cae4047986241db683a72", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Pricing pressures remained relatively benign in the consumer economy, while prices surged farther up the supply chain. The CPI news was generally positive, as the month-to-month headline number increased only two-tenths of a percent from the previous month; the annualized rate was 2.7%, steady month to month. The core inflation rate (ex-food and energy) rose three-tenths of a percent month to month, and ticked higher to an annual rate of 3.1%. The wild cards in this report have been Transportation Services and Shelter costs, which were both up around 3.5% year over year. Those rates are keeping CPI above the Fed's 2.0% target. Meanwhile, the PPI measures pricing trends at the manufacturing level. Here, the news was a bit alarming. The PPI final demand monthly rate in July was 0.9%, the highest monthly change in three years. The annualized change in final demand rate was 3.3%, up from 2.4% a month ago. It is not a certainty that this one data point in the PPI is an inflection point or the start of an alarming trend. Nothing else in the PPI report indicated that prices were spiralling out of control. As such, we continue to expect pricing pressures to ease into 2026 as the housing market cools due to hig\nUpgrade to begin using premium research reports and get so much more.\nExclusive reports, detailed company profiles, and best-in-class trade insights to take your portfolio to the next level\nUpgradeRelated Reports\nMarket Update: CCEP, CMS, GOOGL, HPE\nSep 04, 2025\n•\nGOOGL, CCEP, CMS, HPE\nAnalyst Report: Alphabet Inc\nSep 04, 2025\n•\nGOOGL\nAnalyst Report: Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co\nSep 04, 2025\n•\nHPE\nAnalyst Report: Salesforce, Inc.\nSep 04, 2025\n•\nCRM\nAnalyst Report: Alphabet Inc.\nSep 03, 2025\n•\nGOOGL", "content_hash": "ff6e0e4f511548b17a3bac491890d9af", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

For the most part, crypto currencies and associated ETFs trade on technicals as they don't have any fundamentals to evaluate. Of course, they also trade on news, including government regulation and strategist recommendations. But let's be clear. Like the hottest of hot stocks, if something is going up, the masses often will buy and chase. And that is always a slippery slope, as hyper-momentum is great until it isn't. And then things can turn ugly in a hurry. Recently, ETHE was lit on fire by one of Wall Street's perma-bulls. ETHE broke out to a minor closing all-time high (ATH) and, in the process, broke trendline resistance off the peak since late 2021. The crypto currency has had a huge advance since its April bottom and is playing catchup with Bitcoin, which left it in the dust. Bitcoin looked like it was going to break out to ATHs, but then was hit hard, declining over 4% on Thursday, with heavy, above-average volume. Price fell right to the 21-day exponential average and then bounced a bit.

June inventory readings and a consumer sentiment survey for August add to a busy diary. Fed officials threw cold water on talk of a 50 basis point cut in September, an idea that had been stoked by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent the previous day.\n* As hopes of a Ukraine ceasefire stirred with the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska due to get under way, European stocks and the euro advanced on Friday, while the European defence sector fell back 1.5%, crude oil slipped about 0.6% and gold prices remained subdued. Chinese stocks rallied despite another poor set of industry, retail and housing reports as speculation about some further stimulus there resurfaced, with reports of government support for troubled property developers in the mix. The yen firmed as Japan's Q2 GDP came in more than twice expectations at +1.0% annualised.\n* Shares of Intel surged almost 5% in pre-market trading after Bloomberg reported the Trump administration was in talks with the struggling chipmaker on the U.S. government taking a stake in the company. The reported discussions follow a meeting this week between Trump and Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan - just days after Trump called for Tan's resignation over alleged China-linked investments.\nToday's Market Minute:\n* Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin hold talks in Alaska on Friday, with the U.S. president's hopes of sealing a ceasefire agreement on Ukraine uncertain but with a last gasp offer from Putin of a possible nuclear deal that could help both men save face.\n* The talks in Alaska mark the potential beginnings of a return of Russia - and its commodities - to the global arena following Moscow's recent international isolation. ROI columnist Gavin Maguire provides a guide on the potential market impacts should global relations with Russia return to normal.\n* China's factory output growth slumped to an eight-month low in July, while retail sales slowed sharply, raising pressure on policymakers to roll out more stimulus to revive domestic demand and ward off external shocks to the $19 trillion economy.\n* Wall Street's largest hedge funds, Bridgewater Associates, Tiger Global Management and Discovery Capital, increased their exposure to Big Tech in the second quarter amid a generational boom in the growth of artificial intelligence.\n* The U.S. economy seems to be chugging along fairly smoothly, but ROI columnist Jamie McGeever discusses five charts that indicate the foundations of the resilient U.S. economy and booming stock market may be much shakier than they appear.\nChart of the day:\nChina's factory output growth slumped to an eight-month low in July, while retail sales slowed sharply, raising pressure on policymakers to roll out more stimulus to revive domestic demand and ward off U.S. tariff-related pressures. While reports of more official support for ailing property firms emerged, the housing sector remains a running sore. New home prices fell 2.8% in July year-on-year, versus a 3.2% drop in June.\nWeekly reads:\n* INDEPENDENCE AND LOYALISM: Pushing back on a view that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell should resign to clear the air over Trump's repeated attacks on him, former Fed Vice Chair Roger Ferguson gives a stout defense of Fed Independence. \"For the stability of the dollar and the entire U.S. financial system, it is critical that Powell does not resign prematurely,\" Ferguson wrote in a piece for the Council on Foreign Relations. \"Equally important is that the next chair not be seen as a political loyalist of President Trump.\"\n* WHO ARE 'BOND VIGILANTES'?: European Central Bank economists look at the role of investment funds, who they say hold up to a quarter of outstanding euro government debt in some countries, as the prime 'vigilantes' in times of stress. Foreign funds are the most jumpy and 'procyclical' of that grouping in offloading bonds due to credit, stability or interest rate concerns - while domestic households and insurance firms tend to buy the bonds investment funds sell, they explain.\n* DEBT BURDENS LIFT RATES: As some puzzle over the relatively calm U.S. bond markets despite rising sovereign deficits and debts, IMF economists re-examine the links between debt burdens and higher borrowing rates and term premiums in a paper published on CEPR's VoxEU site. Updating the dataset from earlier studies, they conclude that a 10% of GDP increase in expected debt is associated with an increase in long-term rates of between 20 and 30 basis points, while a 1% of GDP increase in the fiscal and primary deficit has a similar impact.\n* INVESTMENT SPENDING NOT ENOUGH: Using Japan's experience as a example, Daniel Gros at the Institute for European Policymaking at Bocconi argues that Europe just upping billions in investment spending may not be the spur to the economy that many assume. Ensuring the money is better spent on start-ups and its \"innovation ecosystem\" rather than via big companies alone would yield better results, he wrote on Project Syndicate.\n* DARK SIDE OF AI CHATBOTS: Internal guidelines at Facebook owner Meta Platforms explicitly permitted its artificial intelligence chatbots to \"engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual\", according to a Reuters special report.

June's retail sales were revised upward to 0.9% from the original 0.6% increase, the agency said. The pace in July matched economists' estimates.\nThe increases followed two consecutive months of spending declines in April and May.\nExcluding auto sales, which have been volatile since Trump imposed tariffs on many foreign-made cares, retail sales rose 0.3% in July.\nAuto sales rose 1.6%. They appear to have returned roughly to normalized spending after a surge in March and April as Americans attempted to get ahead of Trump’s 25% duty on imported cars and parts and then a slump after that, according to Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\nThe data showed solid spending across various stores. Business at clothing stores and online retailers saw increases. Business at home furnishings and furniture stores had strong sales gains.\nHowever, at electronics stores, sales were down. And business at restaurants, the lone services component within the Census Bureau report and a barometer of discretionary spending, also fell, as shoppers eat at home to save money.\nA category of sales that excludes volatile sectors such as gas, cars, and restaurants rose last month by 0.5% from the previous month. The figure feeds into the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s consumption estimate and is sign that consumers are still spending on some discretionary items.\nTuan Nguyen, an economist at RSM US, noted the difficulty of attributing the entire July gain to resilient American shoppers given so much uncertainty surrounding the economy and tariffs. A sizable portion of the gain likely came from rising prices of imported goods under the impact of tariffs, he said.\nNguyen also noted he can't dismiss the possibility that consumers once again pulled forward their spending ahead of the August tariff deadline, taking advantage of Amazon Prime Day sales as well as competing sales from the likes of Walmart and Target.\nIn fact, Nguyen noted the sharp rise in furniture sales, for example, appeared to indicate shoppers were trying to get ahead of the duties.\n“There is nothing fundamentally wrong with American households that would suggest a spending recession given that shoppers are in a strong enough financial position to accelerate purchases,” he wrote. \"With so much noise in the data, the rest of the year promises to be a wild and bumpy ride.”\nEarlier this month, the Labor Department reported that U.S. hiring is slowing sharply as Trump’s trade policies paralyze businesses and raise concerns about the outlook for the world’s largest economy. U.S. employers added just 73,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department reported, well short of the 115,000 expected.\nAnother government report, issued Tuesday, on U.S. inflation showed that inflation was unchanged in July as rising prices for some imported goods were offset by declining gas and grocery prices, leaving overall prices modestly higher than a year ago.\nConsumer prices rose 2.7% in July from a year earlier, the same as the previous month and up from a post-pandemic low of 2.3% in April. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.2% in July, down from 0.3% the previous month, while core prices ticked up 0.3%, a bit faster than the 0.2% in June.\nThe new numbers suggest that slowing rent increases and cheaper gas are offsetting some impacts of Trump’s sweeping tariffs.\nMany businesses are also likely still absorbing much of the cost of the duties. The consumer price figures likely reflect some impact from the 10% universal tariff Trump imposed in April, as well as higher duties on countries such as China and Canada.\nThe Labor Department reported Thursday that its producer price index — which measures inflation before it hits consumers— rose 0.9% last month from June, biggest jump in more than three years.\nThe report comes as major retailers like Walmart and Target are slated to report their fiscal second-quarter earnings reports starting next week. Analysts will study the reports to get insight into the state of consumer behavior. But they will also monitor how much stores are passing on the tariffs costs to shoppers.\nIn May, Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, warned t hat it had increased prices on bananas imported from Costa Rica from 50 cents per pound to 54 cents, but it noted that a large sting for shoppers wouldn't start to appear until June and July.\nBut a growing list of companies including Procter & Gamble, e.lf. Cosmetics, Black & Decker and Ralph Lauren told investors in recent weeks that they plan to or have already raised prices.\nSome are trying to be selective and focusing on raising prices on just their premium products as a way to offset the higher costs from tariffs.\nWarby Parker, which has been shifting their sourcing away from China, told analysts last Thursday that it plans to keep its $95 option. But it’s increasing prices on select lens types. It also wants to cater more to older shoppers who need more expensive progressive lens. Warby Parker said that progressives, trifocals and bifocals make up roughly 40% of all prescription units sold industrywide.\nBut just 23% of Warby Parker’s business now is made up of progressives, its highest priced offering and offer the highest profit margins.\n“We were able to quickly roll out select strategic price increases that have benefited our growth,” Neil Blumenthal, co-chairman and co-founder and co-CEO of Warby Parker, told analysts last week.", "content_hash": "2f2c2766e66d7be02c7bca67096297cf", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

When dealing with the futures market, I prefer to track the more heavily traded December contract (ZCZ25) only, rolling positions forward and back based on the long-time investor favorite Dec-Dec corn futures spread. As I talked about in late July, I had the opportunity to take part in Barchart’s Grain Merchandising and Technology meeting in Ames, Iowa and Manhattan, Kansas. The consistent theme in both discussions, with Thomas Call of Mid-Co Commodities and Guy Allen of Kansas State University, was that Dec25 corn was drawing near to a bullish turning point.\nI agreed at the time and do even more so given Dec25 has posted new contract lows the past two weeks. That would seem bearish, based on both the economic law of Supply and Demand and the idea that bullish markets don’t make new lows. However, if we apply my Market Rules to December corn futures, what answer do we come up with to the question of the day: Is the Corn Market a Buy?\nMarket Rule #1: Don’t get crossways with the trend.\nThe last few years have been an interesting ride after the Dec22 issue completed a bearish spike reversal[i] during May 2022, telling us the major (long-term) trend had turned down. This downtrend was in place until a year ago when the Dec24 issue completed a bullish spike reversal, leading to a Wave 1 rally peaking this past February and the ongoing Wave 2 selloff[ii].\nAs usual, at least from my point of view, the long-term trend has been driven by noncommercial activity. A look at the chart for the noncommercial futures-only position as reported weekly by the CFTC and we see funds started seriously liquidating long futures in mid-to-late May 2022 while adding short futures. The net-short futures position bottomed out at 266,067 contracts the week of February 20, 2024. By the time we reached late July 2024, Watson began covering its short futures positions.\nApproaching late August 2024, and we see the noncommercial net-short futures position is being trimmed again, a result of both short covering and new buying interest. All while Dec25 has held the August 2024 of $3.85 posted by Dec24, as is characteristic of Wave 2.\nMarket Rule #2: Let the market dictate your actions.\nWith all the hullabaloo surrounding USDA’s ridiculous August supply and demand numbers, as well as the upcoming clueless Midwest crop tour, one would think corn fundamentals are tanking.\nA funny thing about that, though, as our reads on REAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND, most notably new crop futures spreads, have stabilized of late. The Dec-March spread increased its coverage of calculated full commercial carry to 57% through the end of July – about the time I was attending the Barchart programs – but then stabilized through mid-August. At the close of Thursday, August 14, the Dec-March futures spread covered roughly 55% while the Dec-July spread (the 2025-2026 market as a whole) was covering 48%. These are neutral reads rather than bearish.\nMarket Rule #6: Fundamentals win in the end.\nIf I can see the 2025-2026 corn market is not fundamentally bearish, so can Watson. Given this, it would make sense for funds to cover short futures positions over the coming weeks.\nAnd if Watson is covering short futures, or buying, and funds set the trend of a market, as I’ve argued for decades, then the logical conclusion is the trend should remain up.\nMarket Rule #3: Use filters to manage risk. (The filters I use are Seasonal and Price Distribution Analysis, along with market volatility.)\nSeasonally, December corn futures tend to post a low weekly close the fourth week of August. This after falling roughly 12% from the normal high weekly close the third week of June. Dec25 is priced near $4.00 early Friday morning (August 15), a drop of 16% from its high weekly close of $4.75 posted the third week of February. The bottom line is Dec25 has fulfilled both the time and space components of its normal seasonal tendencies.\nAs for price, Dec25 sitting near $4.00 puts it in the lower 15% of its distribution range based on weekly closes only back through the 2020 contract. Using classic Price Distribution analysis, this tells us the contract doesn’t spend much time at or below this price level. Given funds are already short futures and producers aren’t in a hurry to sell, there is little incentive for Watson to continue to add put pressure on the market. This could lead to a round of short-covering as funds move money to markets with better return opportunities.\n[i] A bearish spike reversal pattern is when the contract extends its previous uptrend before closing lower for the timeframe being studied.\n[ii] Part of an Elliott Wave 5-wave uptrend pattern.\nOn the date of publication, Darin Newsom did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Endless bought the business in 2020.\nAt the time, Hovis was 51%-owned by US investment firm The Gores Group and UK food company Premier Foods, the owner of the Mr Kipling cakes brand. Jefferies International estimated the deal value at £75m ($101.6m at today’s exchange rate) in terms of what it deemed in 2020 as “implied gross proceeds”.\nEndless provided a statement in response to Just Food’s request for comment, noting the deal will need to be approved by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\nAidan Robson, a managing partner of Endless, said: “We are proud of the journey we’ve shared with Hovis to date, supporting this historic brand in a highly competitive and challenging market. The transaction with ABF represents an opportunity to create a platform for long-term sustainability in the bakery sector for the benefit of retailers and consumers.\n\"While we work towards achieving CMA clearance of the transaction, our focus remains on Hovis to continue delivering exceptional products and service to its customers.”\nWhen ABF revealed the review of Allied Bakeries in April in its financial results briefing for the 24 weeks to 1 March, the Primark clothing stores owner said the bakery division had added to the group’s operating losses amid “lower” volumes and sales.\nABF added more commentary today: “Profitability at Allied Bakeries has been increasingly challenged in recent years by a decline in demand for pre-sliced, packaged bread and a loss of scale in Allied Bakeries’ nationwide distribution network serving the major retailers with daily delivery of bread and bakery goods.”\nHowever, it added: “The acquisition [Hovis] will combine the production and distribution activities of the two businesses, driving significant costs synergies and efficiencies…\n“The combined business will be better placed to compete effectively and to establish a stable platform for product innovation in the segments of the UK bakery category that are growing as a result of changing consumer tastes and needs.”\nJames Watson, a UK partner at consultancy Argon & Co., said: “The Hovis-Kingsmill merger is a clear sign of the pressures facing the UK bakery sector. With inflation driving up costs and bread consumption in steady decline, consolidation was always a question of when, not if.\n“The deal gives ABF a new market leader with 41% share, overtaking Warburtons’ 34%. But behind the headline is a tough reality: both businesses have been making unsustainable losses. The real prize here is efficiency – rationalising overlapping bakery networks and cutting costs in procurement, logistics, and manufacturing.”\nABF said the forward plans for the combined business include the “improvement in existing products and expansion into new product ranges”.\nAllied Bakeries also produces the Allinson’s bread and flours brand. The division of ABF also supplies UK retailers and supermarkets with private-label bread products.\nABF does not break down the financial performance of Allied Bakeries or for other food brands within its grocery reporting unit, which includes Twinings tea and the Patak’s and Blue Dragon sauces lines.\nGroup results for the 24 weeks to 1 March showed a 2% decline in sales to £9.51bn, while adjusted operating profit dropped 12% to £835m. Profit before tax fell 21% to £692m with an EPS decrease of 8% to 83.6 pence.\nShares in ABF were little changed at 2,270 pence in London today following the Hovis announcement.\nWatson at Argon added: “Execution will be everything. Disrupting existing customer relationships now, while both brands are losing share, would risk compounding the problem.\n“Longer term, the challenge is to stop managing decline and start building momentum. That means addressing structural issues in the bread market and responding faster to shifting consumer trends - whether that’s health, speciality products, or premium lines.”\n\"ABF snaps up Hovis despite sales, profit pressures in UK bread\" was originally created and published by Just Food, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Now the Strategy Inc. chairman is betting that same belief on what may be his riskiest financing experiment yet.\nOver the years, Saylor has urged followers to pour their savings into Bitcoin, mortgage their homes, even “sell a kidney.” To admirers, he’s a prophet with a balance sheet; to skeptics, a showman with an obsession. Either way, he’s turned a once-obscure software company into the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, playing the markets with a conviction most executives would never dare.\nNow, Saylor is asking for a different kind of leap of faith: embracing an unorthodox financing instrument — perpetual preferred stock — to shift away from common stock sales and convertible bonds that helped build a $75 billion Bitcoin war chest. The twist: these securities never mature and some can skip dividend payments, making them flexible for the issuer but unnerving for investors.\nBranded “Stretch,” the latest issuance pays dividends with a variable rate and offers no voting rights. This kind of security is neither debt nor common equity, but Saylor hopes it combines advantages of both, giving him fresh cash to keep buying Bitcoin without heavily diluting shareholders. Over the next four years, he plans to retire billions in convertible notes, curtail common stock sales, and issue more preferred offerings as his main funding source.\nThe gamble is audacious: to create, as the firm puts it, a “BTC Credit Model,” where a volatile asset underpins a stream of income securities. If there’s big demand, he speculates it could even raise “$100 billion… even $200 billion” in theory. If not, Strategy, as MicroStrategy now calls itself, could be left juggling payouts with no buyers. Selling Bitcoin is a near-taboo, given Saylor’s ‘hold on for dear life’ gospel that coins are sacred. Supporters see the preferreds as a clever way to keep crypto buying; critics warn that the payouts are costly and could become a burden if Bitcoin’s price turns.\nSo far this year, the company has raised around $6 billion across four perpetual preferred offerings. The latest, a $2.5 billion “Stretch” tranche, ranked among the largest crypto capital raises this year, eclipsing Circle’s high-profile IPO. Nearly a quarter of the sale went to retail buyers, per a firm presentation, cementing Saylor’s devoted following as a key funding source.\n“I have no past knowledge of any company doing this the way that MicroStrategy has just to capitalize on the retail fervor,” said Michael Youngworth, head of global convertibles and preferred strategy at Bank of America.\nThat retail tilt stands out in the corporate preferred market, dominated by investment-grade utilities and banks. Strategy is unrated, making its preferreds junior in the structure and outside the comfort zone of many fixed-income investors. If retail appetite fades, Saylor would need to win over insurers and pensions — the buyers he says he hopes to attract — or risk falling short of his blockbuster-fundraising ambitions.\nSince the start of 2024, Saylor has raised over $40 billion through a mix of stock and bonds — $27 billion from common equity sales, $13.8 billion from fixed-income securities — transforming Strategy into a Bitcoin proxy for Wall Street. Part of the pivot is practical: the convertibles market excludes retail.\nStrategy CEO Phong Le framed the shift as a way to build a more resilient capital structure — a contrast to 2022’s “crypto winter,” when the company was burdened by a Bitcoin-backed loan from Silvergate and other debt. “Over time, we may not have convertible notes,” he said, “we will be relying on perpetual preferred notes that don’t ever come due.”\nYet the plan depends on paying large, ongoing dividends in perpetuity, using an asset — Bitcoin — that produces no income and has historically lost half its value in months. If Bitcoin prices fall and investors lose interest, the company could be stuck with big bills and no easy way to raise fresh cash.\nPerpetual preferreds don’t mature, and in some cases, dividends can be deferred without triggering default. Under current terms, Strategy can pay some obligations in cash or shares and certain payouts are non-cumulative, meaning missed payments don’t have to be made up. For now, payouts are financed largely by selling common stock through its at-the-market program — a stream Saylor has vowed to slow, but not shut off entirely. Still, the company has said it could sell shares even below its typical 2.5 net asset-value threshold, if needed to cover debt interest or preferred dividends.\nPerpetual preferreds never have to be repaid, unlike convertibles, which either dilute shareholders if they convert or must be repaid in cash if they don’t. That matters because one of Strategy’s quietest advantages has been its ability to sell stock at prices well above the value of its Bitcoin holdings. It’s a gap Saylor himself dubbed the “mNAV premium” - a multiple of net asset value, helping Saylor raise cash and buy Bitcoin at a discount.\n“With their mNAV premium compressing in recent weeks, I think management is rightfully concerned about creating too much dilution,” said Brian Dobson, managing director for Disruptive Technology Equity Research at Clear Street.\nStill, the funding model brings its own hazards. “These are high-yielding instruments,” said Youngworth. “Paying coupons of 8% to 10% in perpetuity could be quite challenging.” Liquidity, a concern for any company with little operating revenue beyond security sales, could tighten sharply in a Bitcoin downturn.\nTo short seller Jim Chanos, the non-cumulative variety of preferreds are “crazy” for institutions to buy — perpetual, non-redeemable, with dividends paid only at the issuer’s discretion. “If I don’t pay the dividends, they are not cumulative. I don’t have to pay them back,” he told Bloomberg TV in June. Chanos says Strategy’s effective leverage has plateaued and sees the preferred push as another way to juice it. He’s suggested shorting the stock while long Bitcoin, betting the premium will collapse.\nIn Strategy’s capital structure, these units sit above common stock but are subordinate to convertible bonds, lacking the protections of regular debt. Wall Street managers have tended to favor those convertible bonds, which are easier to hedge through market-neutral trades. The preferreds are typically harder to hedge, and retiring convertibles would remove a popular arbitrage vehicle.\nThe whole approach works only if Bitcoin stays valuable and investor confidence holds. If he’s right, Bitcoin could inch closer to being treated as mainstream financial collateral. If he’s wrong, his balance sheet will be a cautionary tale: what happens when you try to turn a volatile asset into an income stream — and the market stops believing.\nStill, the danger may come from the broader market as digital-asset treasury companies pile on risk.\n“I think there are some indications of a bubble in crypto treasury companies,” said Yuliya Guseva, who directs Rutgers Law School’s Blockchain and Fintech Program. “If the market appetite dries up, then the model will no longer persist.”", "content_hash": "72c37f09fc3ed55626ec06ca9ddaf6db", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

See our Advertiser Disclosure.\nWhen disaster strikes, a little inside information can make a big difference.\nThe sweet scent of cinnamon rolls baking in the oven, a steaming cup of coffee in hand, and holiday carols softly playing in the background is how Christmas mornings usually look in my household.\nBut last year, our quiet Christmas morning quickly turned into chaos with smoke hanging in the air, sirens blaring, and dozens of firefighters racing from room to room.\nAs an insurance writer, I’ve spent the past decade covering the ins and outs of homeowners insurance, helping consumers understand their policies so they can make more informed decisions about protecting their homes. I’m well-versed in the steps to take when filing a claim, coverage details, and the questions to ask. But when disaster came knocking at my door, it hit completely differently. While I expected challenges along the way, the claim and restoration process brought more curveballs than I could have ever imagined.\nTo help you avoid some of the stress, delays, and unexpected costs I faced, here’s what I learned from my house fire insurance claim.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nLearn more: Homeowners insurance: What it covers and how much you'll pay\nNo. 1: Trust your gut\nI’ve always lived by the motto, “It’s better to be safe than sorry.” So when I caught a faint smell of smoke in my bathroom, I knew something was off. My husband wanted to let it go because there was no visible smoke or fire, but I went with my gut and called 911. Within minutes, six local fire departments arrived at my home with axes, pick poles, and hoses in hand.\nIt only took a few minutes to locate the source of the fire before they started ripping down my walls, ceiling, and even my beloved shower tile. Once the demolition began, I contacted my insurance agent and started the claim process.\nLearn more: How much homeowners insurance do I need?\nNo. 2: Check your lightbulbs\nTo my surprise, they identified the cause as a small can light above my linen closet. Over the years, the wiring had become brittle, whether due to incorrect wattage, faulty wiring, or a defective bulb, and eventually began sparking and spreading into the insulation.\nLearn more: How can a lightbulb start a fire?\nAfter the fire was extinguished and everyone was out of harm’s way, the fire captain explained that if I had waited even an hour or two to call, the fire would have engulfed my entire home.\nTrusting my instincts saved our home and our pup from what could have been complete devastation. Every year, the Electrical Safety Foundation International (ESFI) estimates that 51,000 home fires result from electrical issues, causing around $1.3 billion in property damage. So if you have even the slightest gut feeling something isn’t right, make the call, even if you’re second-guessing yourself.\nNo. 3: Document and save everything, if you can\nThe fire department managed to save most of the debris, including the charred wood above the cabinet, but somehow the actual light fixture got tossed out.\nEven though this doesn't sound like a big deal, it was. If we had saved the light, or even just a piece, it could have helped the engineer who inspected my home pinpoint exactly why it caught fire. That could have helped us spot any other electrical problems in the house and prevent another fire. Because the light was lost in the shuffle, I hired my electrician to inspect most of the electrical work throughout my house and replace every canned light with LEDs.\nHome insurance policies usually only cover costs they consider “necessary for the covered repairs,” and what’s considered “necessary” is typically up to your insurer's interpretation. Therefore, if they decide something isn’t essential, they may not cover it. This means you'll be left picking up the tab for extra inspections or repair work.\nThat's why, if the cause of your fire is unknown, do your best to save (and document) everything that may be relevant to solving the mystery. This could include lightbulbs, wiring, or other items that could serve as evidence and even help provide more support for your claim.\nLearn more: How much is homeowners insurance? A guide to lowering costs.\nNo. 4: Have a reputable repair crew on speed dial\nWhen the unexpected happens, the last thing you want is to scramble for help while you’re still in shock. Fortunately, my insurance agent referred me to a reputable restoration company, and I already had a list of trusted professionals to contact for repairs. After working with him for two decades, I trusted his recommendations.\nThat said, even if your insurer gives you referrals, you’re not required to use them, and in some cases, their recommendations may not be the best fit for your situation.\nIf you don’t have these contacts handy, you may find yourself wondering who to trust. In moments of crisis, it’s easy for pushy companies, or even outright scammers, to take advantage of panicked and uninformed policyholders.\nLearn more: What does homeowners insurance not cover?\nSo, before you need them, make a list of trusted professionals. Ask friends and family for recommendations, and check reviews to find reputable options such as contractors, painters, and plumbers.\nFor me, having this list ready was worth its weight in gold, especially when the pressure was on.\nExpert tip: In addition to cleanup services, restoration companies may offer contracting services, which can act as a one-stop shop for repairs. While this sounds appealing and convenient, their contractors may not have the expertise to help with your project. That’s why it’s important to vet any contractor thoroughly, whether you find them yourself or through your insurance or restoration company.\nNo. 5: ‘Preferred’ doesn’t always mean the best\nSome vendors, especially those recommended by your insurer, may assure you they’ll handle everything directly with your insurance company, including settling the final payment. While these “preferred” vendors usually have a direct line of communication with your insurer, that doesn’t mean you should step back completely. In fact, some preferred contractors rely on insurance companies for work, so they may prioritize keeping that relationship intact over giving you the best advice.\nIn my case, the restoration company did communicate with my adjuster, but when it came time for payment, the logistics still ended up on my plate. In other cases, homeowners have faced blank contracts that lock them into unfavorable terms, hidden waivers that remove the contractor’s liability for damage, or payment arrangements where the contractor gets paid directly, leaving the homeowner without visibility into costs.\nThat’s why it’s worth vetting every contractor, whether they come from your insurer’s list or your own research, and keeping the lines of communication open from the start.\nNo. 6: Don’t let repairs run on autopilot\nJust because you’ve picked a reputable contractor doesn’t mean it’s time to kick back and watch the magic happen. While you’d hope every professional treats your home with the same care you do, the reality is, to them, it might just be another job. Staying hands-on, especially with the construction details, can help you avoid costly mistakes and unnecessary headaches.\nUnfortunately, I had to learn this the hard way: Paint spilled all over my hardwood floors, my marble countertop chipped, the shower door shattered from a bad installation, and I had to scramble at the last minute to find floor tile I was told didn’t need replacing.\nActing as your own project manager is crucial to make sure the work is done right the first time and up to your standards. So, don’t be afraid to check progress regularly, ask questions, and confirm details — even if you’ve been assured they know what to do. This is your home, and the work should meet your expectations from the start.\nLearn more: The important difference between actual cash value and replacement cost\nNo. 7: Set realistic expectations on timing\nEven a minor fire claim can take far more time and energy than you expect. When my contractor first walked through the damage, he estimated we’d have everything wrapped up in a month or two. Eight months later, we were still putting the finishing touches on repairs and trying to get life back to normal.\nThe delays weren’t always dramatic, but they added up over time, from discontinued tile to backordered floor stain to installation mistakes and crew vacations. And between those setbacks were the constant interruptions: contractors coming and going, noise, dust, and the mental load of making decisions about colors, materials, and layouts while juggling work and life. On top of that, the time away from work to meet contractors, oversee repairs, or handle claim details can cut into your paycheck, especially if you’re self-employed or don’t have paid leave.\nBut here’s something to keep in mind: Restoration takes patience and organization. So, prepare for delays and do your best to stay on top of all the moving parts. That way, the process hopefully feels more manageable and less overwhelming.\nWhat my home insurance policy didn’t teach me\nHaving a solid homeowners insurance policy in place is only half the battle when it comes to filing a fire claim. The rest comes down to trusting your gut, documenting everything, choosing suitable professionals for the job, and staying hands-on every step of the way. It’s a roller coaster of an experience, so staying patient through delays, mistakes, and endless decisions can help you keep your peace of mind intact.\nWhile you won’t find this advice hidden in your homeowners insurance policy’s fine print, it can make a world of difference when living through a house fire insurance claim.\nTim Manni edited this article.", "content_hash": "79fb384ddb53a58f5313cf8e433dd1c8", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The company also issued generally reassuring commentary on its outlook for receiving the necessary permitting approvals.\nThe company's seabed mining projects have seemingly received some significant support in the form of an executive order from President Donald Trump aimed at speeding up permitting approvals for offshore domestic mining projects.

And given the high demand for AI chips, demand for Micron's HBM chips has also been robust, which explains why its growth has been remarkable in recent quarters.\nImportantly, it appears Micron's terrific growth will persist thanks to its lucrative opportunity in the HBM space -- and its latest guidance update provides further evidence to that effect.\nMicron Technology's AI-fueled growth is just getting started\nOn Monday, Micron increased its guidance for its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter. For the period, which will end Aug. 28, it now expects revenues of $11.1 billion to $11.3 billion, up from a range of $10.4 billion to $11 billion previously. At the midpoint, that's a boost of $500 million. Additionally, management bumped up its non-GAAP earnings guidance from $2.50 per share to $2.85 per share. Those figures would equate to a year-over-year increase of 44% in revenue and a 141% jump in adjusted earnings per share.\nMicron management says that \"improved pricing, particularly in DRAM, and strong execution\" are the reasons behind its improved guidance. Booming demand for HBM is a key factor that's allowing memory makers to increase prices. According to one estimate, the HBM market's revenue could double in 2024 to $34 billion, driven by a combination of higher shipments and increased pricing.\nSpecifically, production capacity constraints are expected to push up the price of HBM by 15% to 20% in the calendar third quarter, which would be sharper than the 5% to 10% growth seen in the previous quarter. At the same time, the next iterations of AI graphics cards designed by Nvidia and AMD will be equipped with bigger HBM chips.\nNvidia, for instance, is packing 288 gigabytes (GB) of HBM into its Blackwell Ultra B300 GPU, up from the 192GB configuration of the B200. Similarly, AMD is bumping up the HBM capacity of its MI355X and MI350X accelerators to 288GB; the previous generation MI325X had 256GB.\nWhat's more, AMD is planning to increase the HBM capacity of its next-generation MI400X GPUs to a whopping 432GB.\nGiven all that, demand for HBM is likely to remain solid. Micron's peer SK Hynix is forecasting annualized increases of 30% in the HBM market through 2030. AI, therefore, can be expected to remain a solid long-term growth driver for Micron, especially considering the company's improving share of this market.\nThe memory specialist says it's supplying HBM chips \"in high volume\" to four major customers, which indicates that custom AI chipmakers such as Broadcom and Marvell Technology are also among its big clients. Not surprisingly, Micron's HBM market share is expected to jump to 24% by the end of 2025 as compared to around 20% earlier this year.\nThat potential improvement in Micron's market share, along with the outstanding growth of the HBM market, explains why analysts have increased their revenue growth expectations from the company.\nEven better, Micron's healthy top-line growth will drive a big jump in the company's bottom line since demand for HBM is outpacing supply. The favorable supply-and-demand dynamic should lift memory prices and supercharge Micron's earnings, which is why buying the stock right now is a no-brainer.\nMicron stock is too cheap to ignore\nMicron reported $1.30 per share in earnings in its fiscal 2024. The following chart makes it clear that its earnings are on track to grow significantly in the current fiscal year and beyond.\nThe best part for investors is that Micron stock is trading at just 10 times forward earnings, which is dirt cheap considering the earnings growth that it's projected to deliver. Its forward earnings multiple is significantly lower than the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 index's multiple of 30.\nIdeally, the market will reward the AI-fueled growth that this chipmaker is set to deliver with a higher earnings multiple.

All the major indices have hit new highs recently, but most of the focus among investors is concentrated on companies benefiting from artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, valuations for companies in other sectors are looking attractive.\nSome top brands in the consumer goods sector are starting to look interesting from a value perspective. Here are two stocks that have fallen out of favor on Wall Street but could see a rebound over the next few years.\n1. Lululemon Athletica\nShares of Lululemon Athletica(NASDAQ: LULU) have plummeted to new 52-week lows in the past month and are down by more than 60% from their peak, but there seems to be a growing discrepancy between the company's brand strength and its stock price. There are customers of the brand who swear by the product quality, and this is echoed in growing search interest on Google Trends. Wall Street obviously has cooled toward companies dependent on a cautious consumer, but Lululemon stock offers incredible value at under $200.\nLululemon has had an amazing growth story. Over the last 10 years, revenue and earnings grew at a compound annual rate of 19% and 24%, respectively. Those are impressive numbers for a company that must vie for market share with powerhouses like Nike and Adidas. They also show how much room there is in the athletic apparel industry for new brands to stand out with differentiated product designs.\nFurther, Lululemon's successes highlight how fragmented this part of the apparel industry is, and the opportunity for a rising tide to lift all boats. After five decades of growth, Nike is the largest brand, but it only reaps a minor portion of consumers' activewear spending. Overall, the athletic apparel market was worth $406 billion in 2024, according to Grand View Research, which expects it to grow at an annualized rate of 9% through 2030.\nLululemon reported a 7% year-over-year revenue increase in the first quarter, which is relatively strong considering the weak consumer spending backdrop across the apparel industry. It still has a lot of potential in international markets, which provide only a small portion of annual revenue now, and it continues to see strong customer responses to new releases. I believe it will grow sales much faster in a stronger economy.\nThe stock looks undervalued at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 13. This might be a fair multiple for a company growing sales and earnings at low rates, but if Lululemon returns to double-digit percentage sales growth over the next year, the stock could rocket higher. Just returning to its previous peak of $516 would more than double an investment made at today's price.\n2. Roku\nRoku(NASDAQ: ROKU) stock also has underperformed the past few years, which doesn't match the growth of its streaming platform. Its key product is a smart TV operating system that aggregates content from all the major streaming services, which is part of the value proposition for consumers who feel increasingly swamped by too many streaming options. While Apple TV is a top competitor, not everyone needs to be locked into the Apple ecosystem, especially at the premium prices the tech giant charges for its devices. Roku has a large and growing customer base thanks to its position as a budget-friendly alternative with an ad-supported revenue strategy.\nThe stock's current $84 price is well off the $490 high it reached during the pandemic. A slowing advertising market weighed on revenue growth, and the company is still recovering from that slump. However, management has made a lot of investments into ad technology and partnerships with third-party demand-side platforms like Amazon, and this strategy is paying off.\nPlatform revenue, gross profit, and streaming hours all grew by double-digit percentages in the second quarter. Roku's active accounts consistently grew at double-digit rates over the past few years. Roku says it now serves over half of all U.S. broadband households. Overall, these users spent more than 35 billion hours watching content on Roku last quarter, up from 30 billion in the prior-year period.\nAdvertising dollars ultimately flow to where the viewers are, and this is why I think Roku stock could deliver strong returns from its currently depressed level. The growth rate in video advertising on its platform during Q2 was greater than the growth of the broader U.S. digital ad market, signaling that Roku is taking advantage of its opportunity to capture a greater amount of the ad spending that is shifting to digital media.\nManagement expressed optimism about Roku's prospects in 2026. It cited execution in monetization initiatives and pointed to improvements in its EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margins. Adjusted EBITDA grew 79% year over year in Q2, with trailing-12-month free cash flow up 23%, and the company expects further margin expansion next year.\nWall Street is not too hot on the stock due to Roku's history of weak profitability. The company needs to prove it can profitably benefit from growth in digital advertising, but that is the outlook management is offering for 2026. Assuming the company succeeds in improving margins, the stock should move higher over the next 18 months or so.\nDo the experts think Lululemon Athletica Inc. is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

She asked whether it would be best to continue working her two jobs to pay down the couple’s debt, or should she take up her husband’s offer to use his military benefits to attend college for free?\nDelony and Kamel quickly realized that Phoebe could achieve both goals, and the only thing stopping her was herself.\nThe answer is right there\nPhoebe described her financial situation with her husband. They live on a military base while her husband serves, meaning that his pay is low, but most of their living expenses are taken care of. He takes home around $4,500 per month, while she pulls down $50,000 per year between her two jobs. However, the couple owe $70,000 in consumer debt, including two car loans.\nKamel and Delony advised the couple to get rid of the husband's expensive truck, which was a major drag on their budget. They also figured that if the couple was frugal, they might find a way to pay off most of all of their debt in less than a year, especially considering their living expenses are so low.\n“You’re sitting on a solution and you won’t use it,” Delony said. “If you sold your cars and you worked really hard for six months … you could be debt-free.”\nHe added: “As a taxpayer, I am all about veterans and their dependents going to college. I think that’s an amazing use of my tax dollars.”\nRead more: Nervous about the stock market?

Together, they’re earning six figures annually. They have the means to live comfortably, but are saddled by enormous debt.

Cocoa prices rallied to that high due to recent dry weather in West Africa, but forecasts have since emerged for some rain in some cocoa-growing areas of West Africa.\nCocoa prices saw strength through Monday from concern about dry weather in West Africa that threatened the region's cocoa crops. There has been little to no precipitation over the past few weeks in the cocoa-growing areas of the Ivory Coast and Ghana, which could negatively impact the development of cocoa plants. According to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, rainfall in the Ivory Coast and Ghana this season remains below the 30-year average, and combined with high temperatures, risks hurting cocoa pod development for the main crop harvest that starts in October.\nCocoa prices have support from tighter inventories. ICE-monitored cocoa inventories held in US ports fell to a 2-month low of 2,234,877 bags on Thursday.\nCocoa has support from the slowdown in the pace of cocoa exports from the Ivory Coast. Monday's government data showed that Ivory Coast farmers shipped 1.78 MMT of cocoa to ports this marketing year from October 1 to August 10, up +6.6% from last year but down from the much larger +35% increase seen in December.\nQuality concerns regarding the Ivory Coast's mid-crop cocoa, which is currently being harvested through September, are supportive of prices. Cocoa processors are complaining about the quality of the crop and have rejected truckloads of Ivory Coast cocoa beans. Processors reported that about 5% to 6% of the mid-crop cocoa in each truckload is of poor quality, compared with 1% during the main crop. According to Rabobank, the poor quality of the Ivory Coast's mid-crop is partly attributed to late-arriving rain in the region, which limited crop growth. The mid-crop is the smaller of the two annual cocoa harvests, which typically starts in April. The average estimate for this year's Ivory Coast mid-crop is 400,000 MT, down -9% from last year's 440,000 MT.\nAnother supportive factor for cocoa is smaller cocoa production in Nigeria, the world's fifth-largest cocoa producer. Nigeria's Cocoa Association projects Nigeria's 2025/25 cocoa production will fall -11% y/y to 305,000 MT from a projected 344,000 MT for the 2024/25 crop year. In related news, Nigeria's Jun cocoa exports rose +0.9% y/y to 14,597 MT.\nWeakness in chocolate demand is a negative factor for cocoa prices. Chocolate maker Lindt & Spruengli AG in July lowered its margin guidance for the year due to a larger-than-expected decline in first-half chocolate sales. Also, chocolate maker Barry Callebaut AG in July reduced its sales volume guidance for a second time in three months, citing persistently high cocoa prices. The company projects a decline in full-year sales volume and reported a -9.5% drop in its sales volume for the March-May period, the largest quarterly decline in a decade.\nWeakness in global cocoa demand has been a bearish factor for cocoa prices. The European Cocoa Association reported on July 17 that Q2 European cocoa grindings fell by -7.2% y/y to 331,762 MT, a bigger decline than expectations of -5% y/y. Also, the Cocoa Association of Asia reported that Q2 Asian cocoa grindings fell -16.3% y/y to 176,644 MT, the smallest amount for a Q2 in 8 years. North American Q2 cocoa grindings fell -2.8% y/y to 101,865 MT, which was a smaller decline than the declines seen in Asia and Europe.\nHigher cocoa production by Ghana is bearish for cocoa prices. On July 1, the Ghana Cocoa Board projected the 2025/26 Ghana cocoa crop would increase by +8.3% y/y to 650,000 from 600,000 MT in 2024/25. Ghana is the world's second-largest cocoa producer.\nOn May 30, the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) revised its 2023/24 global cocoa deficit to -494,000 MT from a February estimate of -441,000 MT, the largest deficit in over 60 years. ICCO said 2023/24 cocoa production fell by 13.1% y/y to 4.380 MMT. ICCO stated that the 2023/24 global cocoa stocks-to-grindings ratio declined to a 46-year low of 27.0%. Looking ahead to 2024/25, ICCO on February 28 forecasted a global cocoa surplus of 142,000 MT for 2024/25, the first surplus in four years. ICCO also projected that 2024/25 global cocoa production will rise +7.8% y/y to 4.84 MMT.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

It reported earnings for the second quarter, posting strong revenue growth but still disappointing investors.\nAs of 12:23 p.m. ET on Friday, Aug. 15, Monday.com stock is down 28.8%. It is currently off 60% from all-time highs set in 2021.\nStrong growth, high expectations\nOn Aug. 11, Monday.com reported its quarterly results for the three months ending in June. Revenue grew 27% year over year to $299 million, as more and more customers adopt its project management software. However, this is a slowdown from previous quarters, where Monday.com was growing sales at north of 30% a year.\nGetting more granular, Monday.com reports some figures that are important for an enterprise software provider. Customers with more than $100,000 in annual spending with Monday.com hit 1,472 in Q2, up 46% year over year. This is an important figure because of how durable and reliable software revenue can be from large businesses. If they choose Monday.com for workflow management, it is likely that they will stick with the company for a long time.\nSo why did Monday.com stock fall? Likely due to continued slowing revenue growth and negative operating earnings. Investors have high expectations for this company, given its valuation, and would like to see it generate a profit. The company had a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) operating loss of $11.6 million in the period due to high levels of stock-based compensation.\nShould you buy Monday.com stock?\nIn a 60% drawdown, Monday.com stock is cheaper but not overly cheap for investors interested in buying today. In order to value the software company, we can use the price-to-sales ratio (P/S) to help estimate future profitability versus the current market capitalization.\nToday, Monday.com trades at close to a record low P/S of 8.4. It has 90% gross margins, meaning that the company will likely be able to convert a ton of its revenue into operating earnings as it stops aggressively spending on marketing and product development. It is still growing rather quickly, even if the revenue growth rate has begun to slow down a bit.\nWith $1.1 billion in trailing-12-month revenue, let's assume that at scale, Monday.com would have a net income margin of 30%. That equates to $330 million in annual net income. Compared to a market cap of $9 billion, that is a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 27, which does not look expensive for a company growing this quickly.", "content_hash": "86c3f2a5835a00daf50de2dcf57290ef", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

That's why it is a good time to take a closer look at two names that are benefiting from the rapid growth in AI spending in different areas. These companies are already delivering healthy growth and are trading at attractive valuations, so buying them right now could be a smart move.\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM) is right in the middle of the AI revolution as it fabricates the high-end chips that go into devices ranging from data centers to smartphones to personal computers to cars. It's the largest third-party chip foundry in the world by far. Gartner points out that 80% of generative AI spending this year will be on hardware products, including both devices and servers.\nTSMC is already benefiting from this opportunity. The foundry giant's revenue in the first seven months of 2025 increased by 38% year over year. That impressive growth can be attributed to robust chip demand from top customers such as Nvidia, Apple, AMD, and Broadcom.\nThe strong end-market demand led TSMC to increase its 2025 revenue growth guidance to 30% from its earlier expectation of growth in the mid-20% range. However, don't be surprised to see the Taiwan-based company exceeding even that upgraded target thanks to its AI-related catalysts.\nFor instance, Counterpoint Research is expecting a 68% spike in sales of generative AI-capable smartphones in 2025. Apple, which is one of TSMC's largest customers, reported a 13.5% jump in its iPhone revenue in its most recently reported fiscal quarter. Importantly, Apple is expecting sales growth in the mid to high single-digit percentages in the current quarter, suggesting that it could witness another period of robust iPhone sales ahead of the holiday season.\nMoreover, TSMC's relationship with smartphone processor giant Qualcomm should pave the way for the company to grow its footprint in the smartphone market. On the other hand, TSMC's relationships with the leading AI chip designers and its focus on expanding its manufacturing capacity to serve this fast-growing market will set the stage for further healthy sales growth.\nThe diversity of its customer base helps explain why the foundry's revenue is anticipated to increase at healthy double-digit percentages over the next couple of years as well.\nHowever, TSMC could end up doing better than that over the long run thanks to its improving share of the Foundry 2.0 market, which is expected to generate $298 billion in revenue this year. IDC expects Foundry 2.0 to grow at an annualized rate of 10% through 2029, and TSMC has been able to expand its market share in the space thanks to its focus on advanced chip packaging.\nAs such, TSMC seems capable of outperforming expectations in the long run, and that's why buying the stock while it is trading at an attractive 24 times forward earnings (a discount to the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 index's multiple of 30) looks like the right thing to do.\n2. Twilio\nSpending on generative AI services and software is also taking off as organizations and people adopt more applications to automate processes and increase productivity. According to estimates from Gartner, in 2025, total spending on AI services and software could jump by 119% to almost $65 billion. Twilio(NYSE: TWLO), a cloud communications specialist, is witnessing a healthy acceleration in growth thanks to the adoption of AI tools in its industry.\nTwilio's application programming interfaces (APIs) enable its clients to stay in touch with their customers through multiple channels such as text, voice, email, chat, and video. The company offers AI tools that allow its clients to build voice AI solutions such as AI agents to elevate the customer service experience, along with AI-powered marketing tools to improve conversion.\nThe company's AI tools are helping it close bigger deals with customers. Twilio says that it saw a 57% year-over-year increase in the number of communications deals valued at $500,000 or more in the second quarter of 2025. The company's active customer accounts increased by 10% from the year-ago period, compared to a 4% increase in the same period last year.\nSpending by Twilio's established customers improved as well. This is evident from an increase of 5 percentage points in its dollar-based net expansion rate to 108%. (That metric compares the spending of active customers in a quarter to the same cohort's spending in the year-ago period.) Not surprisingly, Twilio has increased its organic revenue growth estimate for 2025 by 1.5 percentage points.\nIt could, however, end up doing better than that thanks to its accelerating customer base growth as well as the cross-selling opportunities that its AI solutions are creating. Analysts covering the company are encouraged by its improving growth profile, and have raised their expectations for it.\nFinally, this cloud stock is trading at just 3 times sales, a slight discount to the S&P 500's sales multiple. Investors, therefore, can get a good deal on an AI stock that seems capable of flying higher in the long run.\nShould you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

What’s behind this massive upswing, and why are house prices so high still today? Here’s what hopeful home buyers need to know.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nRead more: The best low- and no-down-payment mortgage lenders\nHistorical housing prices\n*At the time of publishing, the U.S. Census Bureau had only released data through the second quarter of 2025.\nThis graphic shows the steady rise of median home prices over the years and the dramatic jump beginning in 2020. Prices peaked in October 2022 and then fell sharply.\nToday, home prices remain higher than those of the pre-pandemic days, though home price growth has shown signs of slowing down. In some cities, prices have even begun to decline. For example, in Austin, Texas, home prices fell almost 5% between July 2024 and July 2025 and decreased by over 9% compared to 2022.\nStill, the median national home price remains above $400,000, and mortgage interest rates are much higher than those bargain-basement 3%-ish pandemic rates. So, for most consumers looking to buy their first home, it’s a less-than-optimal time.\nFactors contributing to high housing prices\nWhy have home prices soared past $400,000 in the last few decades? The ongoing rise in home prices can be pegged to two key factors, said Josh Hirt, senior U.S. economist at Vanguard: a lack of supply and what’s called the “rate lock effect.”\nDemand outpacing supply\nThere’s no two ways about it: America has a supply issue regarding affordable homes. By “affordable,” we’re talking about entry-level homes designed for the first-time home buyer.\n“These are people starting their careers, getting married, wanting to start a family,” said Hirt. Generally, these buyers would gravitate toward homes sold by those looking to upsize. As previous first-time buyers move up, the supply of starter homes opens up. But today, Hirt said, that’s not happening for a couple of reasons.\nFirst, there’s a longstanding lag in homebuilding. “There was a notable slowdown in housing starts in the wake of the financial crisis of the early 2000s,” Hirt said. During this period, the market was flooded with foreclosure properties, and supply far outpaced demand. In reaction, builders were reluctant to forge ahead with new construction projects catering to first-time buyers. “Now, we really need those homes, and they’re not there,” said Hirt.\nSo, that’s the first part of the reason home prices remain high: There are more buyers in the market than available properties — especially low-to-moderate-income buyers. This creates a seller’s market, which tends to keep prices high. Sometimes, it creates bidding wars where homes sell for over market value.\nDig deeper: When will the housing market crash again?\nThe rate-lock effect\nHigher mortgage rates are also a driving factor. As Hirt put it, “If you have a mortgage in the 3% range, there’s little incentive for you to trade up or out of that home when mortgage rates today are more than double that.”\nHe’s not wrong. As of Q4 2024, 82% of mortgaged homeowners had a rate of 6% or lower. A whopping 54% had rates of 4% or below. When you consider 2025’s rates, which have bounced between 6% and 7% all year, many homeowners would have to be hard-pressed to exchange those low rates for today’s significantly higher ones.\nFor reference, trading a 3% rate for a 6% one on a $300,000 mortgage loan would add $534 to your monthly payment — and more than $6,400 per year.\n“A lot of homeowners who would be selling their homes just aren’t doing that,” said Hirt. The cost is too high.\nNew economic stressors add to home price pain\nThe news cycle has been tumultuous lately. In addition to the factors above putting upward pressure on home prices, additional geopolitical pressures have now joined the conversation.\nReed Letson, a branch manager with Elevation Mortgage based in Colorado Springs, has been in the lending business long enough to see a wide range of economic pressures affect home prices. In the current market, he saw two rare influences affecting the prices of new homes: tariffs and a combination of labor and insurance climates.\n“Tariffs are crushing builders,” Letson said in an interview via email. “Construction costs are projected to increase 4% to 6% from Canadian lumber tariffs alone.” At present, the tariff rate on Canadian lumber sits at 35% — a cost that U.S. builders can’t reasonably be expected to absorb.\nAs the National Association of Homebuilders (NAHB) succinctly put it, “In effect, the lumber tariffs act as a tax on American builders, home buyers and consumers.”\nLetson added that builders and buyers are both racking up additional costs in the current economy. “The real killer is labor shortages have builders paying top dollar just to get projects done, while skyrocketing insurance costs in disaster-prone areas are making buyers' monthly payments look like car notes for a Bentley,” said Letson.\nCurrent immigration policy impacts labor shortages as ramped-up deportation efforts could have an outsized effect on the construction industry. Even back in 2022, research from the Center for Migration Studies estimated that 54% of foreign-born U.S. construction workers were undocumented.\nIf buyers can afford the price of a home for sale, they may have a rude awakening on the insurance side of things. The U.S. Treasury reports that buyers in the top 20% of disaster-prone ZIP codes pay an average of roughly $2,321 in premiums — rates 82% higher than those in lower-risk areas.\nEven buyers willing to pay those sums face nonrenewal rates (meaning your insurance company refuses to renew your policy) that are 80% higher than those in low-risk areas. Some insurance companies are pulling out of high-risk markets completely.\n“I don't think I've ever seen buyers getting squeezed from so many angles all at once,” Letson said.\nLearn more: How much house can I afford? Use the Yahoo Finance home affordability calculator.\nHome prices ahead: What’s the outlook?\nSo, with low housing supply and current homeowners clinging to their existing sub-4% mortgages for dear life, what does that mean for hopeful home buyers moving forward? Surprisingly, there’s actually some room for optimism.\nFor one, housing inventory is improving. Data from Realtor.com shows that the total active inventory of homes for sale increased almost 25% between July 2024 and July 2025. Over 20% of July listings saw a price reduction.\nMortgage rates are also likely to decline before the end of the year. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates at its September meeting, which could trickle down to mortgage rates, spurring more listings from existing homeowners. While interest rates probably won’t nosedive, any level of decrease helps with home affordability.\nAll in all, most industry experts project that home price growth will continue to slow — or even fall slightly in some areas — over the next few years. Fannie Mae’s July Home Price Index predicts that annual home price growth will fall from 3.8% this quarter to just 1.1% by the end of next year. The Mortgage Bankers Association predicts the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s House Price Index will dip from the 2.9% annual increase in Q2 2025 to a mere 0.3% by the close of 2026.\nRead more: The median home price by state\nBuying a house when prices are high\nAre you not in a position to wait for home prices to slow down or decrease? “If you can’t afford the home you want at today’s prices, consider trading down,” Hirt says.\nConsider a condo instead of a single-family home or a smaller home with fewer features. A fixer-upper could also be a way to get your foot in the door.\nOwning something at today’s rates still lets you build equity, and you can refinance your mortgage later on if rates take a drop.\nYou can also explore ways to get a lower mortgage rate, which can reduce your costs as a home buyer and owner. Ask your lender about a mortgage rate buydown, or see if your seller will pay for one on your behalf as part of your closing negotiations. Improving your credit score and paying down debt can also help you land a lower rate and payment.\nLearn more: How to buy down your mortgage interest rate\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nWhy house prices are so high: FAQs\nWhy are U.S. housing prices so high?\nThe main reason home prices are so high in the U.S. is the low inventory compared to the number of buyers. This is driven by two factors: chronic under-building by homebuilders in the wake of the financial crisis and a lack of incentive for existing homeowners to sell their homes. Many homeowners locked in super-low mortgage rates in 2020 and 2021 and don't want to sell their homes only to buy new ones at today’s much higher interest rates.\nWhy is U.S. housing so unaffordable?\nU.S. housing is unaffordable for many right now — especially first-time buyers looking for less expensive homes — due to supply issues and mortgage rates. There simply aren’t enough homes in lower price ranges due to a lack of new home construction in the wake of the early 2000s financial crisis. Mortgage rates also impact the month-to-month cost of homeownership, and rates in the 6.5% to 7% range can make affordable homes unaffordable for low-to-moderate-income buyers on a budget.\nWhy are homes overpriced right now?\nToday, it’s a seller’s market — where the number of buyers far outweighs the sellers. This allows sellers to command higher sales prices and gives buyers less opportunity to negotiate for price discounts and seller concessions at the closing table. However, the market is balancing out a little bit, so home prices aren’t skyrocketing like they were a few years ago.\nWill U.S. housing ever be affordable again?\nThat depends on what you consider “affordable.” Home price growth has been slowing recently, and in some areas, prices have even declined slightly. For home prices to really drop significantly, though, the market needs more inventory — both from new home construction and from existing homeowners selling their homes.\nLaura Grace Tarpley edited this article.", "content_hash": "492551e153913459c08b9f411df078ca", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Cocoa prices rallied to that high due to recent dry weather in West Africa, but forecasts have since emerged for some rain in some cocoa-growing areas of West Africa.\nCocoa prices saw strength through Monday from concern about dry weather in West Africa that threatened the region's cocoa crops. There has been little to no precipitation over the past few weeks in the cocoa-growing areas of the Ivory Coast and Ghana, which could negatively impact the development of cocoa plants. According to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, rainfall in the Ivory Coast and Ghana this season remains below the 30-year average, and combined with high temperatures, risks hurting cocoa pod development for the main crop harvest that starts in October.\nCocoa prices have support from tighter inventories. ICE-monitored cocoa inventories held in US ports fell to a 2-month low of 2,234,877 bags on Thursday.\nCocoa has support from the slowdown in the pace of cocoa exports from the Ivory Coast. Monday's government data showed that Ivory Coast farmers shipped 1.78 MMT of cocoa to ports this marketing year from October 1 to August 10, up +6.6% from last year but down from the much larger +35% increase seen in December.\nQuality concerns regarding the Ivory Coast's mid-crop cocoa, which is currently being harvested through September, are supportive of prices. Cocoa processors are complaining about the quality of the crop and have rejected truckloads of Ivory Coast cocoa beans. Processors reported that about 5% to 6% of the mid-crop cocoa in each truckload is of poor quality, compared with 1% during the main crop. According to Rabobank, the poor quality of the Ivory Coast's mid-crop is partly attributed to late-arriving rain in the region, which limited crop growth. The mid-crop is the smaller of the two annual cocoa harvests, which typically starts in April. The average estimate for this year's Ivory Coast mid-crop is 400,000 MT, down -9% from last year's 440,000 MT.\nAnother supportive factor for cocoa is smaller cocoa production in Nigeria, the world's fifth-largest cocoa producer. Nigeria's Cocoa Association projects Nigeria's 2025/25 cocoa production will fall -11% y/y to 305,000 MT from a projected 344,000 MT for the 2024/25 crop year. In related news, Nigeria's Jun cocoa exports rose +0.9% y/y to 14,597 MT.\nWeakness in chocolate demand is a negative factor for cocoa prices. Chocolate maker Lindt & Spruengli AG in July lowered its margin guidance for the year due to a larger-than-expected decline in first-half chocolate sales. Also, chocolate maker Barry Callebaut AG in July reduced its sales volume guidance for a second time in three months, citing persistently high cocoa prices. The company projects a decline in full-year sales volume and reported a -9.5% drop in its sales volume for the March-May period, the largest quarterly decline in a decade.\nWeakness in global cocoa demand has been a bearish factor for cocoa prices. The European Cocoa Association reported on July 17 that Q2 European cocoa grindings fell by -7.2% y/y to 331,762 MT, a bigger decline than expectations of -5% y/y. Also, the Cocoa Association of Asia reported that Q2 Asian cocoa grindings fell -16.3% y/y to 176,644 MT, the smallest amount for a Q2 in 8 years. North American Q2 cocoa grindings fell -2.8% y/y to 101,865 MT, which was a smaller decline than the declines seen in Asia and Europe.\nHigher cocoa production by Ghana is bearish for cocoa prices. On July 1, the Ghana Cocoa Board projected the 2025/26 Ghana cocoa crop would increase by +8.3% y/y to 650,000 from 600,000 MT in 2024/25. Ghana is the world's second-largest cocoa producer.\nOn May 30, the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) revised its 2023/24 global cocoa deficit to -494,000 MT from a February estimate of -441,000 MT, the largest deficit in over 60 years. ICCO said 2023/24 cocoa production fell by 13.1% y/y to 4.380 MMT. ICCO stated that the 2023/24 global cocoa stocks-to-grindings ratio declined to a 46-year low of 27.0%. Looking ahead to 2024/25, ICCO on February 28 forecasted a global cocoa surplus of 142,000 MT for 2024/25, the first surplus in four years. ICCO also projected that 2024/25 global cocoa production will rise +7.8% y/y to 4.84 MMT.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

It reported earnings for the second quarter, posting strong revenue growth but still disappointing investors.\nAs of 12:23 p.m. ET on Friday, Aug. 15, Monday.com stock is down 28.8%. It is currently off 60% from all-time highs set in 2021.\nStrong growth, high expectations\nOn Aug. 11, Monday.com reported its quarterly results for the three months ending in June. Revenue grew 27% year over year to $299 million, as more and more customers adopt its project management software. However, this is a slowdown from previous quarters, where Monday.com was growing sales at north of 30% a year.\nGetting more granular, Monday.com reports some figures that are important for an enterprise software provider. Customers with more than $100,000 in annual spending with Monday.com hit 1,472 in Q2, up 46% year over year. This is an important figure because of how durable and reliable software revenue can be from large businesses. If they choose Monday.com for workflow management, it is likely that they will stick with the company for a long time.\nSo why did Monday.com stock fall? Likely due to continued slowing revenue growth and negative operating earnings. Investors have high expectations for this company, given its valuation, and would like to see it generate a profit. The company had a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) operating loss of $11.6 million in the period due to high levels of stock-based compensation.\nShould you buy Monday.com stock?\nIn a 60% drawdown, Monday.com stock is cheaper but not overly cheap for investors interested in buying today. In order to value the software company, we can use the price-to-sales ratio (P/S) to help estimate future profitability versus the current market capitalization.\nToday, Monday.com trades at close to a record low P/S of 8.4. It has 90% gross margins, meaning that the company will likely be able to convert a ton of its revenue into operating earnings as it stops aggressively spending on marketing and product development. It is still growing rather quickly, even if the revenue growth rate has begun to slow down a bit.\nWith $1.1 billion in trailing-12-month revenue, let's assume that at scale, Monday.com would have a net income margin of 30%.

That's why it is a good time to take a closer look at two names that are benefiting from the rapid growth in AI spending in different areas. These companies are already delivering healthy growth and are trading at attractive valuations, so buying them right now could be a smart move.\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM) is right in the middle of the AI revolution as it fabricates the high-end chips that go into devices ranging from data centers to smartphones to personal computers to cars. It's the largest third-party chip foundry in the world by far. Gartner points out that 80% of generative AI spending this year will be on hardware products, including both devices and servers.\nTSMC is already benefiting from this opportunity. The foundry giant's revenue in the first seven months of 2025 increased by 38% year over year. That impressive growth can be attributed to robust chip demand from top customers such as Nvidia, Apple, AMD, and Broadcom.\nThe strong end-market demand led TSMC to increase its 2025 revenue growth guidance to 30% from its earlier expectation of growth in the mid-20% range. However, don't be surprised to see the Taiwan-based company exceeding even that upgraded target thanks to its AI-related catalysts.\nFor instance, Counterpoint Research is expecting a 68% spike in sales of generative AI-capable smartphones in 2025. Apple, which is one of TSMC's largest customers, reported a 13.5% jump in its iPhone revenue in its most recently reported fiscal quarter. Importantly, Apple is expecting sales growth in the mid to high single-digit percentages in the current quarter, suggesting that it could witness another period of robust iPhone sales ahead of the holiday season.\nMoreover, TSMC's relationship with smartphone processor giant Qualcomm should pave the way for the company to grow its footprint in the smartphone market. On the other hand, TSMC's relationships with the leading AI chip designers and its focus on expanding its manufacturing capacity to serve this fast-growing market will set the stage for further healthy sales growth.\nThe diversity of its customer base helps explain why the foundry's revenue is anticipated to increase at healthy double-digit percentages over the next couple of years as well.\nHowever, TSMC could end up doing better than that over the long run thanks to its improving share of the Foundry 2.0 market, which is expected to generate $298 billion in revenue this year. IDC expects Foundry 2.0 to grow at an annualized rate of 10% through 2029, and TSMC has been able to expand its market share in the space thanks to its focus on advanced chip packaging.\nAs such, TSMC seems capable of outperforming expectations in the long run, and that's why buying the stock while it is trading at an attractive 24 times forward earnings (a discount to the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 index's multiple of 30) looks like the right thing to do.\n2. Twilio\nSpending on generative AI services and software is also taking off as organizations and people adopt more applications to automate processes and increase productivity. According to estimates from Gartner, in 2025, total spending on AI services and software could jump by 119% to almost $65 billion. Twilio(NYSE: TWLO), a cloud communications specialist, is witnessing a healthy acceleration in growth thanks to the adoption of AI tools in its industry.\nTwilio's application programming interfaces (APIs) enable its clients to stay in touch with their customers through multiple channels such as text, voice, email, chat, and video. The company offers AI tools that allow its clients to build voice AI solutions such as AI agents to elevate the customer service experience, along with AI-powered marketing tools to improve conversion.\nThe company's AI tools are helping it close bigger deals with customers. Twilio says that it saw a 57% year-over-year increase in the number of communications deals valued at $500,000 or more in the second quarter of 2025. The company's active customer accounts increased by 10% from the year-ago period, compared to a 4% increase in the same period last year.\nSpending by Twilio's established customers improved as well. This is evident from an increase of 5 percentage points in its dollar-based net expansion rate to 108%. (That metric compares the spending of active customers in a quarter to the same cohort's spending in the year-ago period.) Not surprisingly, Twilio has increased its organic revenue growth estimate for 2025 by 1.5 percentage points.\nIt could, however, end up doing better than that thanks to its accelerating customer base growth as well as the cross-selling opportunities that its AI solutions are creating. Analysts covering the company are encouraged by its improving growth profile, and have raised their expectations for it.\nFinally, this cloud stock is trading at just 3 times sales, a slight discount to the S&P 500's sales multiple. Investors, therefore, can get a good deal on an AI stock that seems capable of flying higher in the long run.\nShould you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

What’s behind this massive upswing, and why are house prices so high still today? Here’s what hopeful home buyers need to know.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nRead more: The best low- and no-down-payment mortgage lenders\nHistorical housing prices\n*At the time of publishing, the U.S. Census Bureau had only released data through the second quarter of 2025.\nThis graphic shows the steady rise of median home prices over the years and the dramatic jump beginning in 2020. Prices peaked in October 2022 and then fell sharply.\nToday, home prices remain higher than those of the pre-pandemic days, though home price growth has shown signs of slowing down. In some cities, prices have even begun to decline. For example, in Austin, Texas, home prices fell almost 5% between July 2024 and July 2025 and decreased by over 9% compared to 2022.\nStill, the median national home price remains above $400,000, and mortgage interest rates are much higher than those bargain-basement 3%-ish pandemic rates. So, for most consumers looking to buy their first home, it’s a less-than-optimal time.\nFactors contributing to high housing prices\nWhy have home prices soared past $400,000 in the last few decades? The ongoing rise in home prices can be pegged to two key factors, said Josh Hirt, senior U.S. economist at Vanguard: a lack of supply and what’s called the “rate lock effect.”\nDemand outpacing supply\nThere’s no two ways about it: America has a supply issue regarding affordable homes. By “affordable,” we’re talking about entry-level homes designed for the first-time home buyer.\n“These are people starting their careers, getting married, wanting to start a family,” said Hirt. Generally, these buyers would gravitate toward homes sold by those looking to upsize. As previous first-time buyers move up, the supply of starter homes opens up. But today, Hirt said, that’s not happening for a couple of reasons.\nFirst, there’s a longstanding lag in homebuilding. “There was a notable slowdown in housing starts in the wake of the financial crisis of the early 2000s,” Hirt said. During this period, the market was flooded with foreclosure properties, and supply far outpaced demand. In reaction, builders were reluctant to forge ahead with new construction projects catering to first-time buyers. “Now, we really need those homes, and they’re not there,” said Hirt.\nSo, that’s the first part of the reason home prices remain high: There are more buyers in the market than available properties — especially low-to-moderate-income buyers. This creates a seller’s market, which tends to keep prices high. Sometimes, it creates bidding wars where homes sell for over market value.\nDig deeper: When will the housing market crash again?\nThe rate-lock effect\nHigher mortgage rates are also a driving factor. As Hirt put it, “If you have a mortgage in the 3% range, there’s little incentive for you to trade up or out of that home when mortgage rates today are more than double that.”\nHe’s not wrong. As of Q4 2024, 82% of mortgaged homeowners had a rate of 6% or lower. A whopping 54% had rates of 4% or below. When you consider 2025’s rates, which have bounced between 6% and 7% all year, many homeowners would have to be hard-pressed to exchange those low rates for today’s significantly higher ones.\nFor reference, trading a 3% rate for a 6% one on a $300,000 mortgage loan would add $534 to your monthly payment — and more than $6,400 per year.\n“A lot of homeowners who would be selling their homes just aren’t doing that,” said Hirt. The cost is too high.\nNew economic stressors add to home price pain\nThe news cycle has been tumultuous lately. In addition to the factors above putting upward pressure on home prices, additional geopolitical pressures have now joined the conversation.\nReed Letson, a branch manager with Elevation Mortgage based in Colorado Springs, has been in the lending business long enough to see a wide range of economic pressures affect home prices. In the current market, he saw two rare influences affecting the prices of new homes: tariffs and a combination of labor and insurance climates.\n“Tariffs are crushing builders,” Letson said in an interview via email. “Construction costs are projected to increase 4% to 6% from Canadian lumber tariffs alone.” At present, the tariff rate on Canadian lumber sits at 35% — a cost that U.S. builders can’t reasonably be expected to absorb.\nAs the National Association of Homebuilders (NAHB) succinctly put it, “In effect, the lumber tariffs act as a tax on American builders, home buyers and consumers.”\nLetson added that builders and buyers are both racking up additional costs in the current economy. “The real killer is labor shortages have builders paying top dollar just to get projects done, while skyrocketing insurance costs in disaster-prone areas are making buyers' monthly payments look like car notes for a Bentley,” said Letson.\nCurrent immigration policy impacts labor shortages as ramped-up deportation efforts could have an outsized effect on the construction industry. Even back in 2022, research from the Center for Migration Studies estimated that 54% of foreign-born U.S. construction workers were undocumented.\nIf buyers can afford the price of a home for sale, they may have a rude awakening on the insurance side of things. The U.S. Treasury reports that buyers in the top 20% of disaster-prone ZIP codes pay an average of roughly $2,321 in premiums — rates 82% higher than those in lower-risk areas.\nEven buyers willing to pay those sums face nonrenewal rates (meaning your insurance company refuses to renew your policy) that are 80% higher than those in low-risk areas. Some insurance companies are pulling out of high-risk markets completely.\n“I don't think I've ever seen buyers getting squeezed from so many angles all at once,” Letson said.\nLearn more: How much house can I afford? Use the Yahoo Finance home affordability calculator.\nHome prices ahead: What’s the outlook?\nSo, with low housing supply and current homeowners clinging to their existing sub-4% mortgages for dear life, what does that mean for hopeful home buyers moving forward? Surprisingly, there’s actually some room for optimism.\nFor one, housing inventory is improving. Data from Realtor.com shows that the total active inventory of homes for sale increased almost 25% between July 2024 and July 2025. Over 20% of July listings saw a price reduction.\nMortgage rates are also likely to decline before the end of the year. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates at its September meeting, which could trickle down to mortgage rates, spurring more listings from existing homeowners. While interest rates probably won’t nosedive, any level of decrease helps with home affordability.\nAll in all, most industry experts project that home price growth will continue to slow — or even fall slightly in some areas — over the next few years. Fannie Mae’s July Home Price Index predicts that annual home price growth will fall from 3.8% this quarter to just 1.1% by the end of next year. The Mortgage Bankers Association predicts the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s House Price Index will dip from the 2.9% annual increase in Q2 2025 to a mere 0.3% by the close of 2026.\nRead more: The median home price by state\nBuying a house when prices are high\nAre you not in a position to wait for home prices to slow down or decrease? “If you can’t afford the home you want at today’s prices, consider trading down,” Hirt says.\nConsider a condo instead of a single-family home or a smaller home with fewer features. A fixer-upper could also be a way to get your foot in the door.\nOwning something at today’s rates still lets you build equity, and you can refinance your mortgage later on if rates take a drop.\nYou can also explore ways to get a lower mortgage rate, which can reduce your costs as a home buyer and owner. Ask your lender about a mortgage rate buydown, or see if your seller will pay for one on your behalf as part of your closing negotiations. Improving your credit score and paying down debt can also help you land a lower rate and payment.\nLearn more: How to buy down your mortgage interest rate\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nWhy house prices are so high: FAQs\nWhy are U.S. housing prices so high?\nThe main reason home prices are so high in the U.S. is the low inventory compared to the number of buyers. This is driven by two factors: chronic under-building by homebuilders in the wake of the financial crisis and a lack of incentive for existing homeowners to sell their homes. Many homeowners locked in super-low mortgage rates in 2020 and 2021 and don't want to sell their homes only to buy new ones at today’s much higher interest rates.\nWhy is U.S. housing so unaffordable?\nU.S. housing is unaffordable for many right now — especially first-time buyers looking for less expensive homes — due to supply issues and mortgage rates. There simply aren’t enough homes in lower price ranges due to a lack of new home construction in the wake of the early 2000s financial crisis. Mortgage rates also impact the month-to-month cost of homeownership, and rates in the 6.5% to 7% range can make affordable homes unaffordable for low-to-moderate-income buyers on a budget.\nWhy are homes overpriced right now?\nToday, it’s a seller’s market — where the number of buyers far outweighs the sellers. This allows sellers to command higher sales prices and gives buyers less opportunity to negotiate for price discounts and seller concessions at the closing table. However, the market is balancing out a little bit, so home prices aren’t skyrocketing like they were a few years ago.\nWill U.S. housing ever be affordable again?\nThat depends on what you consider “affordable.” Home price growth has been slowing recently, and in some areas, prices have even declined slightly. For home prices to really drop significantly, though, the market needs more inventory — both from new home construction and from existing homeowners selling their homes.\nLaura Grace Tarpley edited this article.", "content_hash": "492551e153913459c08b9f411df078ca", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

There have certainly been ups and downs, given some of the volatility, but if you look back to Donald Trump's presidential election victory last November, many of the big cryptocurrencies are up significantly since then, although not all.\nTrump's new regulatory regime has ushered in a more welcoming environment for cryptocurrencies and businesses focused on the sector. This has made many investors more bullish on crypto's future than ever.\nTwo of the more popular cryptocurrencies, XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) and Shiba Inu (CRYPTO: SHIB), have been on different paths, with XRP soaring since Trump's election win and Shiba Inu struggling to gain traction. Which cryptocurrency is more likely to be a millionaire maker: XRP or Shiba Inu?\nXRP: Can it take a share of international payments?\nXRP has been one of the best-performing cryptos since Trump's win -- if not the best. The token has clearly benefited from a change in leadership at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which led the agency to drop an appeal in a long-standing lawsuit against Ripple, the company behind XRP. That had clearly been an overhang on the token. And the SEC is likely to eventually approve a spot-XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) this year.\nInvestors looking ahead to what's next for XRP should pay attention to its network and its ability to participate in international payment transactions. It can process up to 1,500 transactions per second at minimal cost.\nIt's also part of a broadening ecosystem that includes Ripple and its more traditional financial clients, Ripple's stablecoin RLUSD, and the company's recent acquisitions of the prime broker Hidden Road, and more recently the stablecoin platform Rail.\nRipple Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse is confident that XRP can attract traditional international payments from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), which lets financial institutions all over the world send payment instructions to one another. Garlinghouse has made comments on what he believes to be a high error rate at SWIFT, and he thinks there is a prime opportunity for XRP to gobble up 14% of its payment volume during the next five years.\nShiba Inu: Where is the token heading?\nShiba Inu has had an interesting run since its huge ascent that started in 2020. First launched as another meme token and basically a joke that's a play on Dogecoin, the token has begun to move in another direction.

Bank of America, Truist, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank, U.S. Bank, and Wells Fargo jointly own its parent, and some 2,200 financial institutions allow customers to use Zelle directly through their app or services.\nIt’s not an understatement to say that, with access to the enormous customer base of all these financial institutions, Zelle has taken off. Last year, the network topped $1 trillion in person-to-person transactions, a 27% year-over-year increase, while its user base grew 12% to 151 million accounts. That was the most in P2P transactions for any payments service in a single year — PayPal, by comparison, reported $400 billion in P2P payments in 2024. But Zelle’s astronomical growth, the state Attorney General’s Office alleged, coincided with negligent loopholes the size of the Milky Way Galaxy:\n-\nNew York’s lawsuit claims Zelle’s registration process was missing verification steps, which it alleges EWS and its bank backers were aware contributed to fraud amounting to roughly $1 billion, “for years.” James is seeking restitution and damages based on the claim that scammers stole more than $1 billion from Zelle users from 2017 to 2023, and is asking for a court order requiring Zelle to put anti-fraud measures in place.\n-\nZelle, rebuffing the lawsuit, said the Attorney General’s Office did not conduct an investigation of its platform and argued the claims are meritless. “Had they conducted an investigation, they would have learned that more than 99.95% of all Zelle transactions are completed without any report of scam or fraud — which leads the industry,” a spokesperson said.", "content_hash": "dcb9e69f2048461723dd231970969454", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Investors piled into it hoping it would have similar success to the industry's original meme token, Dogecoin, which was soaring in value at the time.\nShiba Inu rocketed higher by 45,278,000% in 2021, which remains one of the best annual returns for any asset in the history of the financial markets. It would have been enough to turn a perfectly timed investment of just $3 into more than $1 million.\nHowever, the incredible move was fueled by speculation that inevitably fizzled out, and Shiba Inu has since lost 84% of its peak value. It's struggling to build sustainable momentum because it lacks fundamental catalysts, but a series of pro-crypto policies from President Donald Trump's administration is driving some positive sentiment across the industry right now.\nCould 2025 be the year it stages another historic run, this time reaching the $1 milestone? There might be a $589 trillion problem standing in the way.\nShiba Inu might not benefit from crypto-friendly policies\nShiba Inu doesn't have much utility in the real world. It's too volatile to be considered a legitimate store of value, and according to crypto directory Cryptwerk, just 1,074 businesses worldwide are willing to accept it as payment for goods and services.\nTrump is making it easier for cryptocurrencies to find new ways to create value by introducing supportive government policies and by relaxing regulations, but it's unclear whether these moves will help speculative tokens like Shiba Inu.\nFor example, the president created a digital assets stockpile to store a variety of cryptocurrencies that the U.S. government seizes as a result of criminal activity, but Shiba Inu isn't one of them. He also appointed crypto advocate Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, but a lighter regulatory touch won't solve the meme token's volatile nature or its lack of adoption among businesses and consumers.\nThe $589 trillion problem preventing a run to $1\nThe crypto's plentiful supply is perhaps the biggest hurdle on the path to $1. There are 589.5 trillion tokens in circulation, so at the current price of $0.000014 per token, it has a market capitalization of $8.1 billion.\nSimple math dictates that a price of $1 would result in a market cap of $589.5 trillion, which would make it 137 times more valuable than the world's largest company, Nvidia. The token would also be five times bigger than the annual output of the entire global economy, which was $111 trillion last year.\nIn other words, there is simply no way Shiba Inu will ever trade at $1 in its current state. But the community is trying to carve another pathway to $1 by burning tokens, which removes them from circulation forever. Basically, when tokens are sent to a dead wallet where they can never be retrieved, the price of each remaining token should rise organically to account for the reduction in supply.\nBurning enough tokens will take thousands of years\nBased on Shiba Inu's current market cap of $8.1 billion, burning 99.99998% of the 589.5 trillion tokens to leave just 8.1 billion in circulation would, theoretically, result in a price of $1. But it would require participation from almost every holder, meaning nobody would actually make any money.\nTo put it another way, even though each Shiba Inu token would be worth $1, every investor would have 99.99998% fewer tokens, so their net financial position would remain exactly the same.\nBesides, just 1.7 billion tokens were burned last month, which translates to an annualized rate of 20.4 billion. It would take 28,882 years to burn enough tokens to warrant a price of $1 at the current pace. That's a long time to wait to make no money!\nIn summary, reaching $1 is completely out of the question for Shiba Inu in 2025. In fact, it's unlikely to happen at any point in our lifetime.\nShould you buy stock in Shiba Inu right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Shiba Inu, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Shiba Inu wasn’t one of them.

It's up more than 40% on the year, more than any of the other top 10 coins. XRP has also passed a price of $3 multiple times this year, a level it hadn't reached since a brief period in January 2018.\nThe next significant milestone would be $4, about a 22% increase from XRP's current price of $3.28 (as of Aug. 12). Is that a realistic target for the end of the year? Let's look at what could help XRP take off during the last five months of 2025.\nNo more legal issues with the SEC\nRipple, the issuer of XRP, spent nearly five years locked in a legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple in 2020, alleging that the initial sale of XRP was an unregistered securities offering. Most of the major crypto exchanges subsequently delisted XRP, making it much more difficult to buy.\nLast week, Ripple and the SEC agreed to dismiss their appeals. A 2023 ruling by a New York federal judge is now final, and Ripple will pay $125 million in fines, much less than the $2 billion the SEC was seeking.\nThe end of the lawsuit is great news for Ripple because it no longer needs to spend time and money fighting the SEC in court. The crypto market reacted quickly, with XRP's price initially surging more than 10%. But that initial surge may be the only impact we see here.\nSince the U.S. elected Donald Trump as president amid promises of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, investors have been expecting a conclusion to the SEC's lawsuit against Ripple. XRP's value has skyrocketed since the presidential election largely for that reason. While the lawsuit ending is still a big deal, it probably won't continue to move the needle price-wise for XRP.\nPotential spot ETF approval in October\nA development that could move the needle for XRP is approval of exchange-traded funds that invest in it and sponsor ETFs. The SEC approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last year. Several asset managers, including Grayscale, Bitwise, and 21Shares, have submitted applications for XRP ETFs.\nThe SEC is reviewing these applications and it has set approval deadlines between Oct. 18 and Oct. 25 for all of them. Polymarket puts the odds of XRP ETF approval this year at 84%. That seems fair, considering the SEC has already approved ETFs for the two largest cryptocurrencies and isn't involved in a lawsuit with Ripple anymore.\nCryptocurrency ETFs are important because they're regulated and accessible to hedge funds, banks, and other institutional investors. Bitcoin ETFs and Ethereum ETFs have seen inflows of about $54 billion and $10 billion, respectively, since they started trading, demonstrating the kind of impact this can have.\nETF approval is a growth catalyst that could push XRP past $4. However, it wouldn't necessarily happen overnight -- Ethereum's price didn't move much after ETF approval, and it only recently started seeing heavy inflows. There's also the possibility that the SEC doesn't approve XRP ETFs, which would be a serious headwind.\n$4 may be out of reach this year for XRP\nXRP is hot right now, and to its credit, it's not just some meme coin that briefly caught fire. It has a legitimate use case, facilitating transactions on Ripple's cross-border payment network. However, many financial institutions only use the Ripple payment network and not XRP, one of the potential problems with it as an investment.\nIt could continue to grow, especially if Ripple is able to find more ways to integrate XRP into the payment services it offers. That said, I think the most likely scenario during the rest of this year is that XRP doesn't hit $4 or even a new all-time high (currently $3.84 on Jan. 4, 2018).\nMuch of the good news surrounding XRP is already priced in, and other cryptocurrencies are starting to take the spotlight. Case in point, in July it was Ethereum, and not XRP, that delivered the highest returns among the top coins.\nIf you're optimistic about Ripple's payments technology and XRP's role in that, then a small investment is reasonable. Just keep in mind that XRP is extremely volatile. It may or may not reach $4 by December, but as long as you're a long-term investor, what really matters is where XRP ends up during the rest of the decade.\nShould you buy stock in XRP right now?\nBefore you buy stock in XRP, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and XRP wasn’t one of them.

But quietly, silver was also gaining momentum, with prices now up roughly 30% this year versus gold’s 28% rise. Silver’s role as an inflation hedge and its industrial uses, combined with a supply deficit, have created strong tailwinds for the precious metal.\n“Gold sometimes steals the spotlight as an inflation hedge, especially given the tariffs, but silver has been benefiting from that, too, as a store of value,” said Nate Miller, vice president of product development at Amplify.\nREAD ALSO: ETFs and 401(k)s Don’t Play. Could Dual Share Classes Change That? and Yieldstreet Losses Highlights the Potential Dangers of Private Investments\nI’ve Got One More Silver Dollar\nUnlike gold, which is primarily an investment or jewelry component, silver has broad industrial applications driving demand. “Silver is second to oil when it comes to industrial application,” Miller told Advisor Upside. “Solar panels are the most common use, but it’s in smartphones, AI, semiconductors, data centers, so there’s a structural tailwind from all that.” Supply constraints are also in play. HSBC projects a deficit of 206 million ounces this year, up from 167 million in 2024.\nThat combination has powered strong returns from silver ETFs:\n-\nThere are only five silver-focused ETFs trading in the US, and they have $21.5 billion in assets, with the iShares Silver Trust (SLV) accounting for 85% of the total, according to CFRA data.\n-\nThe ProShares Ultra Silver (AGQ) is the best performing this year at 53%; the ProShares UltraShort Silver (ZSL), an inverse fund, is down almost as much at 45%. The rest — the Abrdn Physical Silver Shares ETF (SIVR), the Sprott Physical Silver Trust (PSLV) and SLV — are all up more than 30%.\n-\nSeparately, funds that track silver mining companies are performing even better, with the Global X Silver Miners ETF (SIL), the Amplify Junior Silver Miners ETF (SILJ) and the iShares MSCI Global Silver Miners ETF (SLVP) all up roughly 70% or more this year.\nSilver Lining. Still, silver funds haven’t seen the same investor inflows as gold or copper. Silver ETFs have attracted $1.15 billion in 2025 — about 6% of current assets — while gold ETFs and copper funds are up 12% and 17% in flows, respectively, according to CFRA data.\nSilver’s lag may stem from macro and geopolitical factors, with central banks favoring gold to hedge against US Treasuries, said Aniket Ullal, head of ETF research and analytics at CFRA. “Flows tend to lag performance, so if silver returns continue to be strong in 2H 2025, ETF flows could pick up further,” he told Advisor Upside. “Price momentum will be sustained if there is demand from sectors like electronics and renewable energy.”\nThis post first appeared on The Daily Upside.

Under the leadership of Lisa Su, it overtook longtime rival Intel in the PC market. Although Nvidia's success with the artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator market initially took AMD by surprise, AMD's efforts to catch up have made it an increasingly important company in that market.\nSuch innovations have also made AMD a prime candidate to join the 10 companies that now have a market cap above $1 trillion. Here's how it can reach that milestone, and why the path might be easier to achieve than many investors might assume.\nWhere AMD stands now\nAt first glance, AMD might appear far away from that milestone since its $280 billion market cap means it is only 28% of the way toward that goal.\nHowever, that is not as far away from $1 trillion as it might appear. At the current market cap, it has to double in value less than two times to reach that point.\nMoreover, a simple increase in popularity could get AMD to that point. Although its 99 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio might make it appear pricey, it currently sells at a forward P/E ratio of 44. Thus, if it achieves some of the popularity that has boosted Palantir, a stock that sells at 623 times its earnings, multiple expansion alone could take it there.\nReaching $1 trillion through business growth\nMore importantly, AMD is in a strong position to reach a $1 trillion market cap even if such hype does not materialize. The company's data center segment, which designs AI accelerators, generated just over $6.9 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, around 46% of AMD's total. In comparison, Nvidia's data center segment made up 89% of the company's revenue in its most recent quarter.\nAdmittedly, AMD is significantly behind Nvidia in the AI accelerator market, and while AMD's MI350 chip has generated some interest due to its lower cost, it is hardly a threat to Nvidia's dominance.\nHowever, AMD plans to release the MI400 next year. With its integration with AMD's upcoming Helios rack-scale solution, some analysts believe it can become a competitive threat to Nvidia's upcoming Vera Rubin platform. Nvidia's CUDA software, which has previously cemented its dominance, also faces increased competitive threats. Such conditions could mean AMD is on the way to becoming a full-fledged competitor in the AI market.\nAdditionally, Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29% through 2030, taking the market's size to an estimated $323 billion. If that prediction comes to pass, AMD will almost certainly benefit from that industry growth.\nEven if data center revenue becomes AMD's dominant revenue source, investors should not forget about the client, embedded, and gaming segments. Fortune Business Insights forecasts a CAGR of 15% for the semiconductor industry through 2032. That seems to affirm Grand View's findings, and the market rising above $2 trillion presents AMD with a massive tailwind.\nFinally, as conditions stand now, Nvidia has reached a market cap of just under $4.5 trillion, making AMD approximately 6% of its size. Hence, even if AMD grew to slightly less than one-fourth of Nvidia's size, its market cap would presumably reach $1 trillion or higher.\nAMD at $1 trillion (and beyond)\nUltimately, AMD is on track to benefit from numerous catalysts that will likely take its market cap to $1 trillion and beyond.\nThe company is less than two doubles away from reaching $1 trillion, meaning hype alone could take it to that milestone. Still, the growth of the semiconductor industry in general puts it on track to spark massive growth.\nAdditionally, even though all four of AMD's segments will probably contribute to the company's growth, the path to $1 trillion will most likely hinge on the AI accelerator market, particularly with the upcoming release of the MI400. Even if it falls somewhat short of expectations, investors should remember that AMD can reach $1 trillion even if it grows to less than one-fourth of Nvidia's size. Such conditions make reaching a $1 trillion market cap easier than most investors are likely assuming.\nShould you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn’t one of them.

Bottom-line results were also strong with net income up 24% to $27.2 million, or $2.65 per share.\nHowever, one comment stood out in the company's earnings report, especially for investors in quantum computing stocks like Quantum Computing Inc. (NASDAQ: QUBT), IonQ (NYSE: IONQ), D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS), and Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI).\nQuantum computing stocks have attracted attention, soaring since Alphabet unveiled a new milestone with its Willow quantum computing chip, and now Microsoft appears to be jumping on the bandwagon.\nCEO Satya Nadella made a bold statement on the earnings call, saying, \"The next big accelerator in the cloud will be quantum, and I'm excited about progress. In fact, earlier this month, we announced the world's first operational deployment of a level two quantum computer with Atom Computing.\"\nWhat Microsoft is doing with quantum computing\nFollowing in the footsteps of Alphabet, Microsoft announced its new Majorana 1 quantum chip in February, saying it's powered by a new Topological Core architecture, which will help create computers that can solve large-scale problems in years, not decades.\nMicrosoft's focus on topological qubits separates it from its competitors, though the company says that it's theoretically more stable than any other qubit engineered to date. Its quantum computing strategy will be driven by Azure, which will allow it to scale up its capabilities. Eventually, Microsoft says, its quantum computer will be able to handle bandwidths over 10-100 terabits per second and complete operations in less than a microsecond.\nMicrosoft's partnership with Atom Computing on quantum computers appears to be progressing rapidly, as in July, the company received an 80 million euro investment from a new Nordic quantum initiative, QuNorth, to build one of the very first Level 2 quantum computers.\nWhat it means for quantum computing stocks\nQuantum computing stocks didn't get the same boost from the announcement of Majorana that they did from Willow, but that may be because Alphabet's announcement took the industry by surprise, essentially kicking off a race for what may be the next disruptive technology after AI.\nMicrosoft is working with many of the top quantum computing stocks, so its success in quantum could be their success.\nSome of these quantum computing companies also use Azure Quantum to power their operations and give customers access to their programs. For example, IonQ can reconfigure trapped-ion quantum computers for up to 11 fully connected qubits, and Rigetti's systems also operate on Azure Quantum and are known for fast gate times, low-latency conditional logic, and fast program execution.\nHowever, the whole sector should benefit from improving visibility for quantum computing as tech leaders like Nadella tout its proximity and potential.\nNadella recognized the potential in AI early on and partnered with OpenAI to establish itself as a leader in generative AI. He also recognized the opportunity in cloud computing and has built Azure into a force that can soon topple Amazon Web Services as the biggest cloud infrastructure platform.\nNow, Microsoft is aiming to do the same thing with quantum computing. While quantum seems unlikely to have its \"ChatGPT moment\" the way AI did, we could see it generating meaningful revenue in the next few years for some of the companies above.\nIf Microsoft gets more bullish on the technology, that should be a clear signal for the industry as a whole. While not every quantum stock will be a winner, any progress for the technology at this point is a win for the sector.\nDo the experts think Microsoft is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

Every tile is a consultation paper, draft bill, or regulatory speech about stablecoins, and once the first domino topples, nobody wants to be the last one standing.\nThat chain reaction is now well underway. Fresh legislation from Singapore to South Korea aims to corral fiat currency‑backed tokens, and the jurisdictions that move fastest could siphon a torrent of digital cash. That cash will tend to spill into assets like Ethereum(CRYPTO: ETH), among others.\nIf clear rules really do lure capital, investors need to know which domino falls next.\nAsia's many rulebooks are being rewritten quickly\nAcross the region, officials are shifting from white-paper promises to binding statutes, each with its own flavor.\nSingapore started it in late 2023, when its Monetary Authority finalized a framework that forces stablecoin issuers to keep reserve assets at all times. As of this June, the city-state will be tightening the licensing requirements on crypto companies and asset issuers, so the landscape there is still evolving.\nJapan's Liberal Democratic Party Web3 Project Team took a different tack this May, proposing to fold fiat-backed tokens into the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act so banks can distribute them like electronic money.\nStarting in June, South Korea is betting on a homegrown won-based stablecoin. A draft Digital Asset Basic Act slated for debate next week would make issuers hold at least $38 million in core capital and exempt swap transactions from value added tax (VAT) to keep liquidity onshore. Hong Kong issued its Stablecoins Ordinance on July 29, requiring every issuer to hold a license and carefully hold client funds.\nAs of early August, even China is considering sidelining its digital yuan-based central bank digital currency (CBDC) and dipping a cautious toe into renminbi-denominated stablecoins, supposedly in an attempt to challenge the dollar's global dominance in the asset class thus far. If its initiative gains traction, it should lead to a lot of capital being onboarded into the crypto sector.\nAre these moves bullish for crypto?\nRegulation may sound dull, but it unlocks growth. Total stablecoin market cap already sits near $258 billion. Stablecoins add new rails that shuttle fiat currency onto blockchains at the click of a button. The bigger the float, the faster value can rotate into cryptoassets.\nSo, new stablecoin regulations are indeed very unambiguously positive for crypto. The richer the country that creates stablecoin frameworks, the more capital there will be onboarded, generally speaking. But where will that capital rest?\nToday, Ethereum currently processes roughly half of all stablecoin transactions, and $140.5 billion in value is parked in stables on its chain. Therefore, it's likely that it'll capture a lot of the inflows. Every additional token minted under the new Asian regimes could fuel demand for more gas fees, and history shows that network activity often tracks the coin's price. The picture is thus quite bullish, even if other chains ultimately benefit as well.\nStill, nothing is written in stone in terms of this trend's winners as of right now, and that will remain the case until well after the regulations are mostly settled. Moreover, reserve mandates in Singapore and South Korea could thin profit margins for smaller issuers, slowing supply growth. And China's ambivalence means that abrupt policy shifts remain a tail risk.\nNonetheless, another beneficiary might be Tron, which hosts 51% of Tether's supply thanks to its rock-bottom fees, and a compliant Hong Kong license might entice issuers to broaden their chain footprint.\nAssuming frameworks land roughly as drafted, the likely near-term outcome is a bigger, safer stablecoin pool coupled with fiercer competition among blockchains to host it. That is textbook bullish for Ethereum today, but investors should keep an eye on how quickly rival chains adapt. Low-fee layer-2 (L2) networks or specialty compliance-ready ledgers like XRP could siphon capital share if issuers decide costs or legal risks outweigh Ethereum's liquidity advantages as they are today.\nAsia's regulatory sprint is just starting. For investors willing to think in years rather than days, clearer rules that invite more digital dollars onto blockchains tip the risk-reward balance just a bit further in crypto's favor. For a highly risky asset class, that could make a big difference in the long run.\nShould you buy stock in Ethereum right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Ethereum, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ethereum wasn’t one of them.

But it will be a hawkish cut. It's way too early still for the Fed to wish to guide the market towards an extended easing cycle,\" said Thierry Wizman, global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie Group.\n\"The next important thing will be the Expenditures Price Index later this month. If there are signals that there's inflation broadly in services, the market will take that adversely.\"\nA separate report on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new applications for jobless benefits fell last week.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 11.01 points, or 0.02%, down to 44,911.26, the S&P 500 gained 1.96 points, or 0.03%, to 6,468.54 - a new closing high - and the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.47 points, or 0.01%, to 21,710.67.\nOn Thursday, seven of the 11 S&P 500 sectors declined.\nRecent data reflecting labor market weakness and a moderate rise in consumer prices had strengthened expectations that the central bank will potentially lower interest rates next month.\nHowever, Thursday's report fanned concerns that U.S. tariffs on imports could start to impact prices in the coming months and dampen a rally in U.S. stocks that had helped the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq log record highs over the past two sessions.\n\"U.S. stocks are pricy,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist CFRA Research.\nThe S&P 500 index is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 23 based on forward estimates, or a near-40% premium to its 20-year average, he said.\nThe hotter-than-expected PPI report now has investors pulling petals from a daisy saying \"They (the Fed) will cut rates, they won’t cut rates,\" he added.\nSt. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, a voting member on the Federal Open Market Committee this year, said a half-point rate cut at the Fed's September meeting is not warranted, a day after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it was possible.", "content_hash": "35e4a3f20bdd50ae22e4911ff8066a4e", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

This includes health and defence, as Labour pours billions of pounds into the NHS and ramps up its pledge to spend more on the military.\nStatisticians added that public sector administration costs had also climbed in the three months to June. By contrast, business investment declined and household spending barely grew.\nAt the same time, private sector businesses saw a massive increase in costs – with the Chancellor’s record National Insurance raid on employers coming alongside a big jump in the minimum wage at the start of April.\nReeves’s decision to boost public spending for the rest of the parliament while taxing private sector businesses will only cement these trends.\nThe Chancellor hailed the “strong start to the year”, adding: “I know that the British economy has the key ingredients for success but has felt stuck for too long.”\nHowever, Anna Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: “It is good to see a stronger growth outturn than many feared.\n“But it is striking that momentum is coming from the public sector, with consumer spending slowing and business investment contracting. Private sector growth is being held back by both global and domestic policy uncertainty, with speculation over forthcoming tax increases adding to the headwinds.”\nWith this speculation of further tax rises likely to create more uncertainty and hold back vital investment, the Chancellor faces becoming even more reliant on the public sector to fuel growth.\nThe trend didn’t just start under Labour. The Bank of England has previously highlighted that public sector output has been driving growth for almost two years now while private sector growth has lagged behind.\nThis is dangerous for two reasons. Public sector productivity is barely above levels seen in 1997, meaning that despite all the technological advances over the past few decades, for every £1 spent on schools, hospitals and teachers, it still gets about the same amount out.\nBy contrast, output per hour in the private sector is about 32pc higher than its 1997 level, which is still not much to celebrate. Productivity tells us how much the economy can grow without generating too much inflation. When productivity grows, so do company profits and staff wages. This leads to stronger growth, a bigger economy, rising tax revenues and smaller borrowing bills.\nAs Andrew Bailey, the Governor of the Bank of England, put it earlier this year: “It is fair to say we have seen an increase in public sector employment. We haven’t seen a commensurate increase in measured public sector output.”\nMeasurement issues play a role. After all, it is difficult to quantify what an hour of teaching is worth.\nBritain’s older and sicker population also suggests the state will only get bigger, relying on ever higher taxes on the private sector to pay for it all.\nAnalysis by the Resolution Foundation, a think tank, shows that Reeves has put health spending on course to gobble up half of all the money spent on day-to-day services by the end of the decade. This is up from a third in 2010 and roughly a quarter in 1999.\nWith public sector employment on the rise and demands for ever higher pay getting louder, there is a risk that the trend of dire public sector productivity continues.\nFor this reason, Reeves’s allies say she will focus on driving up productivity in the Budget. She needs to if Labour is to achieve a pledge of raising living standards across the country.\nONS data showed real GDP per head grew by 0.2pc in the three months to July, following growth of 0.6pc in the first quarter. The UK is also holding its own on the international stage, with overall growth of 0.3pc compared to a contraction of 0.1pc in Germany and Italy, two of Europe’s biggest economies.\nIt’s not all gloomy, with net trade confounding all expectations by contributing positively to growth.\nThe UK has emerged relatively unscathed from Donald Trump’s trade war, with exports actually rising in the second quarter by 1.6pc. Pharmaceutical manufacturing also ramped up over the quarter, with the sector still fearful of being hit by higher tariffs.\nSanjay Raja at Deutsche Bank said the strong momentum at the end of the quarter suggested annual growth could be revised up in “a welcome sign for the Chancellor and the Office for Budget Responsibility”.\nHowever, he also cautioned that a strong private sector was the key to sustainable growth.\n“To be sure, the economy is growing,” Raja said. “Positive momentum is brewing. But animal spirits remain tepid.\nWhile the Chancellor is poised to focus her Budget on improving productivity – a very welcome focus for the UK – Number 11 should also prioritise lifting household and business confidence to sustain the UK’s outperformance.”", "content_hash": "4467a9393438e38f2f80e251612e088e", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The real artificial intelligence (AI) opportunity lies in owning the companies supplying the chips, cloud platforms, and enterprise software powering today's AI gold rush.\nWith $300 billion in infrastructure spending from tech giants this year alone, modern prospectors are investing in computing and networking. The companies selling that infrastructure are the ones striking gold.\nFor investors who prefer to avoid single-stock risk, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) provides exposure to the AI technology supply chain. Read on to find out more about this top AI vehicle.\nThe accidental AI fund\nThis exchange-traded fund (ETF) wasn't designed as an AI play when it was launched in 2004, years before deep learning went mainstream. But through market-cap weighting and technology's winner-take-all dynamics, it has become a strong proxy for the AI build-out.\nNvidia commands 16.7% of the fund, reflecting its stranglehold on the GPU market that powers AI training. Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) represents 14.9%, with its Azure cloud platform hosting everything from OpenAI's ChatGPT to thousands of enterprise AI applications. Apple rounds out the top three at 13%, preparing to push AI features to over 2.35 billion active devices.\nThe concentration gets more interesting further down. Broadcom, at 4.6%, designs custom AI chips for hyperscalers and supplies the networking gear that keeps data flowing between thousands of processors. Oracle, at 2%, has reinvented itself as an AI cloud provider, winning customers with specialized infrastructure for training large models.\nThese aren't speculative bets. Microsoft's cloud revenue hit $40.9 billion last quarter, up 21% year over year. Nvidia's data center revenue reached $39.1 billion in its most recent quarter, up 73% relative to the same period a year ago. The AI gold rush is generating real revenue, and this fund captures the companies mining the most gold.\nBeyond the mega-caps and long-term performance\nThe ETF's reach extends beyond its mega-cap holdings, with 319 stocks providing AI exposure across the technology stack. Palantir Technologies (1.6%) delivers AI solutions to government agencies and Fortune 500 clients. Cisco Systems (1.6%) supplies the networking hardware that links together vast AI computing clusters. IBM (1.6%) deploys its Watson AI platform to help enterprises integrate advanced analytics and automation into their operations.\nOver the past 15 years, the fund has delivered 19.7% annual total returns (including distributions), turning $10,000 into roughly $155,000. That's about 9 percentage points per year ahead of the benchmark S&P 500 over the same period. That's the power of owning the leaders in the most important technological innovation of our time.\nUpside potential, fees, and risk profile\nAnalysts remain optimistic about the ETF's largest holdings, thanks to AI spending. Morgan Stanley estimates that Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms will invest about $300 billion in AI infrastructure in 2025. That level of investment should directly benefit the ETF's hardware and semiconductor holdings.\nOn the fee front, investors get this exposure for just $9 per year on a $10,000 investment -- a fraction of what most actively managed tech funds charge.\nThe ETF has some blind spots. As a fund in the information technology sector, it excludes Amazon and Alphabet entirely, leaving out Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud despite their dominant role in AI. It is also heavily weighted toward Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, so weakness in any of these companies could weigh on performance.\nMoreover, technology-sector drawdowns can be severe. The fund declined more than 50% in 2008 and 30% in 2022. Even so, decades of compounding have more than offset the occasional sharp downturn.\nThe innovation premium\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF doesn't need to guess the next AI breakthrough. It owns the companies with the capital, talent, and market dominance to adapt to whatever comes next. Periods of volatility are inevitable, but history shows that technology leaders often emerge from downturns even stronger.\nFor investors willing to ride out the drawdowns, the reward has been decades of market-beating compounding. So, with AI adoption accelerating and the sector's fundamentals in their best shape in years, this Vanguard ETF offers a low-cost way to capture the gains from this platform shift.\nDo the experts think Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

However, revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) came in above expectations, and guidance was strong.\nLet's take a closer look at Pinterest's most recent results and prospects to see if the dip is a buying opportunity.\nAccelerating growth\nThe transformation of Pinterest under CEO Bill Ready continued to bear fruit in the second quarter, with the company reporting solid revenue and user growth. Ready has invested heavily to make Pinterest's platform more attractive to both users and advertisers through the use of artificial intelligence (AI).\nThis includes developing proprietary multimodal large language models (LLMs) that can handle visual searches, improve its search recommendation algorithm, and better handle conversational search queries.\nThe company has also worked to make its platform more shoppable, and on this front, it announced a new partnership with Instacart. Pinterest will now have ads that are directly shoppable via Instacart. This will include items in the food and beverage category, as the company looks to attract more consumer packaged goods advertisers to its platform.\nPinterest once again saw solid average revenue per user (ARPU) and user growth in the quarter, especially in international markets. Monthly active users (MAUs) increased by 11% to 578 million, led by a 14% rise in \"rest of world\" users to 329 million. U.S. and Canada MAUs rose by 4% to 102 million, while European users grew by 7% to 146 million.\nIts overall ARPU climbed by 6% year over year to $1.74. However, due to the big regional difference, it's best to look at the metric on a regional basis. ARPU rose by 6% to $7.29 in the U.S. and Canada, while European ARPU surged by 26% to $1.30. \"Rest of world\" ARPU soared 44% to $0.19.\nPinterest said it was starting to narrow the gap between U.S. and international ARPU, but that there was a lot more room to go. For most ad platforms, the U.S. has the best monetization levels, but Pinterest has always lagged its competitors in international markets. It noted that it was seeing strong success with lower funnel and performance ad budgets in Europe with retailers, while reseller partners and its Google partnership were helping it in emerging markets.\nOverall revenue for Pinterest climbed 17% year over year to $988 million, ahead of the $975 million consensus estimate compiled by data analytics provider LSEG. U.S. and Canada revenue rose by 11% to $745 million, while European revenue jumped 34% to $191 million. Revenue from its \"rest of world\" segment soared 65% to $63 million.\nTurning to profitability, Pinterest saw its adjusted EBITDA climb 25% year over year to $251 million. Meanwhile, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) jumped by 38% to $0.33. Analysts at LSEG were looking for adjusted EPS of $0.35, and adjusted EBITDA of $233 million, according to business news tracker StreetAccount.\nPinterest forecasts third-quarter revenue to be between $1.033 billion and $1.053 billion, representing 15% to 17% growth year over year. That midpoint is solidly ahead of the $1.025 billion analyst consensus.\nThe company said it is seeing some effects from tariffs, with some Asia-based e-commerce retailers lowering spending. However, it said its geographical diversification has helped mitigate the impact. And management says it has been seeing strong growth among younger users, with 50% of its user base now Gen Zers.\nShould investors buy the dip?\nPinterest's second-quarter results were arguably better than its first-quarter results, when the stock rallied. Both its revenue and EPS growth accelerated, and its international metrics were also better. In addition, its future guidance was also stronger.\nThe company's upgrades to its platform appear to be resonating with younger users, who are now using its multimodal search. Meanwhile, advertisers are also benefiting from the improving functionality, automation, and effectiveness of its Performance Plus ad platform\nTurning to valuation, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of about 19 based on 2025 analyst estimates and 16 based on the 2026 consensus. Given its revenue and profitability growth, I would view that as cheap.\nWith Pinterest continuing to transform its business and seeing strong momentum in its international segment, I would be a buyer of the stock on this dip.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Pinterest right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Pinterest, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Pinterest wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $660,783!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,122,682!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,069% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 184% for the S&P 500.

The New York City market will provide high foot traffic and dense urban neighborhoods, which the chain said is ideal for introducing the brand’s Southern flavors to an entirely new audience.\nHashimi brings significant experience operating QSRs in New York and Connecticut, according to the press release.\nBojangles also signed a 35-unit deal to open locations in New Jersey with an unspecified franchisee, according to the press release, which gives it a development target of about 55 units in the Northeast.\nThe brand has relatively strong unit economics, according to its FDD, with average gross sales of about $2.4 million at its full-sized franchised locations, which comprise a majority of its store base.\nThe increase in demand for chicken overall has helped propel growth across concepts spanning a wide range of culinary traditions. Korean chain Bonchon is looking to more than triple its U.S. unit count. Filipino chicken brand Jollibee has also announced ambitious franchising plans. The growth of Dave’s Hot Chicken — a California brand with a menu anchored around a Nashville specialty — attracted a major investment from Roark Capital earlier this year. Raising Cane’s and Wingstop saw their sales surpass KFC in the U.S. last year.\nBojangles has carved out a menu niche for itself with a Southern menu and a focus on breakfast. The chain’s FDD shows its full-size company-owned restaurants, a useful proxy for its franchise units, see about 36% of their sales in the breakfast daypart. According to the FDD, the chain targets locations “with direct access to a major ‘going-to-work’ traffic artery, in order to benefit from Bojangles’ significant breakfast business.”", "content_hash": "12e60dd5c2c28ea509703d22609a3045", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Chip stocks climbed amid growing expectations for Fed rate cuts, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) rising over +5% and NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI) gaining more than +4%. Also, Amazon.com (AMZN) advanced over +1% after announcing plans to expand its same-day grocery delivery service to 2,300 cities by the end of the year. In addition, Intapp (INTA) surged more than +15% after the AI cloud company posted upbeat FQ4 results and announced a $150 million stock buyback. On the bearish side, CoreWeave (CRWV) tumbled more than -20% after the AI cloud vendor reported a wider-than-expected Q2 loss.\nChicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said on Wednesday that the central bank’s meetings this fall will be “live,” as he and his colleagues work to interpret mixed economic data and determine how best to adjust interest rates in response. “As we go into the fall, these are going to be some live meetings and we’re going to have to figure it out,” Goolsbee said. At the same time, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he still considers one interest rate cut appropriate in 2025 if the labor market remains solid.\nMeanwhile, U.S. rate futures have priced in a 100% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut at September’s monetary policy meeting.\nToday, all eyes are focused on the U.S. Producer Price Index, which is set to be released in a couple of hours.

Defense stocks rose on Thursday after U.S. officials downplayed the likelihood of a ceasefire deal in Ukraine being reached at Friday’s meeting between Trump and Putin. Insurance stocks also gained ground, supported by solid results from Admiral and Aviva. Eurostat said in an update on Thursday that the Eurozone’s gross domestic product growth for the second quarter stood at 0.1%, in line with a preliminary estimate. Separately, data from the Office for National Statistics showed that the U.K. economy slowed in the second quarter but still expanded, demonstrating resilience in the face of higher U.S. tariffs that weighed on exports and increased business taxes that dampened hiring. In addition, data showed that Eurozone industrial production fell more than expected in June, reflecting the impact of the pullback of tariff front-running. Meanwhile, investors are awaiting Friday’s summit between the U.S. and Russian leaders. U.S. President Donald Trump warned that he would impose “very harsh consequences” if Vladimir Putin failed to agree to a ceasefire in the war with Ukraine. In corporate news, Embracer Group AB (EMBRB.S.DX) plunged over -24% after the gaming company posted weaker-than-expected FQ1 operating profit.

China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed down -0.46%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed down -1.45%.\nChina’s Shanghai Composite Index gave up earlier gains and ended lower today as cautious investors took profits ahead of key economic data from the country. Steel and communication stocks underperformed on Thursday. Data released on Wednesday after the market closed showed that China’s new yuan loans turned negative in July for the first time in two decades, primarily due to the suspension of consumer trade-in programs and weaker property sales. New yuan loans shrank by 50 billion yuan ($6.97 billion) in July, coming in below even the most pessimistic analysts’ forecasts. The data followed China’s announcement earlier this week that it will provide interest subsidies to businesses in eight consumer service sectors, including catering and tourism, in a bid to boost services consumption amid a slowing economy. Barclays economists said in a note, “We think offering interest subsidies in targeted areas, instead of rate cuts, is an indication of the PBOC’s continued reservation to cut rates.” Meanwhile, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday that China is planning to mobilize companies owned by the central government in Beijing to purchase unsold homes from struggling property developers. Regulators plan to ask some of the largest state-owned enterprises and bad debt managers, including China Cinda Asset Management, to help clear the housing glut. In corporate news, Tencent gained about +0.7% in Hong Kong after the internet giant topped estimates in all reporting segments. Investor focus now turns to a flurry of China’s official data, scheduled for release on Friday, which will provide the most comprehensive view yet of the country’s economic momentum in July.\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index ended lower today, retreating from the record high set in the prior session, as the yen strengthened amid concerns that the Bank of Japan may soon raise interest rates. Investors also seemed to take profits amid mounting concerns about the market overheating following the recent rally. Heavy-industry and electronics stocks led the declines on Thursday. Meanwhile, the Japanese currency rose the most in almost two weeks on Thursday after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the BOJ is falling “behind the curve” in tackling inflation and that he expected it to raise rates. Bessent’s comments on the BOJ mark a rare example of criticism of a foreign central bank’s policy decisions. The remarks contrast with those of BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda, who has repeatedly dismissed the notion that the central bank is moving too slowly to raise rates and might be late in forestalling too-high inflation. The BOJ, at its latest meeting in July, left rates unchanged but revised up its inflation projections and presented a more optimistic view of the economy, sustaining market expectations for a rate hike later this year. According to the latest Bloomberg survey of economists tracking the BOJ, about 42% of respondents said they anticipate a hike in October, while one-third expect a move in January. Investors now await Japan’s preliminary second-quarter GDP data, scheduled for release on Friday. The Nikkei Volatility Index, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed up +0.24% to 24.56.\nPre-Market U.S. Stock Movers\nDeere & Company (DE) slid over -7% in pre-market trading after the agricultural and construction equipment maker cut the upper-end of its full-year net income guidance.\nCisco Systems (CSCO) fell more than -1% in pre-market trading after the computer networking company gave a cautious full-year forecast.\nIbotta (IBTA) plummeted over -32% in pre-market trading after the performance marketing platform posted downbeat Q2 results and issued below-consensus Q3 revenue guidance.\nCoherent (COHR) plunged more than -19% in pre-market trading after the optical networking company provided soft FQ1 guidance.\nDow (DOW) rose over +1% in pre-market trading after BofA upgraded the stock to Neutral from Underperform with an unchanged price target of $25.\nYou can see more pre-market stock movers here\nToday’s U.S. Earnings Spotlight: Thursday - August 14th\nApplied Materials (AMAT), Deere&Company (DE), Nu Holdings (NU), Tapestry (TPR), Credicorp (BAP), Applied Industrial Technologies (AIT), Birkenstock Holding (BIRK), Vipshop (VIPS), Energy of Minas Gerais (CIG), First Majestic Silver (AG), Golar (GLNG), Advance Auto Parts (AAP), Globant SA (GLOB), Cellebrite (CLBT), Weibo Corp (WB), Celcuity (CELC), TMC the metals company (TMC), Nano Nuclear Energy (NNE), Afya (AFYA), Evolv Technologies Holdings (EVLV), Acuren (TIC), Jefferson Capital (JCAP), Youdao (DAO), Bit Digital (BTBT), Venu Holding (VENU), AIRO Holdings (AIRO), Gambling.com Group (GAMB), Unusual Machines (UMAC), Canaan (CAN), Allot (ALLT), Innovative Solutions (ISSC), Strattec (STRT), Omeros (OMER), Fennec Pharma (FENC), Digimarc (DMRC), Mediwound (MDWD), SWK Holdings (SWKH), Biostem Tech (BSEM), Profound Medical (PROF), Origin Materials (ORGN), Protalix (PLX), Sunlands Tech (STG), Duos Tech (DUOT), Bragg Gaming (BRAG).\nOn the date of publication, Oleksandr Pylypenko did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

With a record number of acquisitions in 2024 alone and a commitment to increasing dividends, ROL continues to impress and is poised for sustained growth in the future.\nOn Jul. 23, ROL reported its Q2 results, and shares closed up more than 5% in the following trading session. Its adjusted EPS of $0.30 surpassed Wall Street expectations of $0.29. The company’s revenue was $999.5 million, beating Wall Street forecasts of $979.4 million.\nFor the current fiscal year, ending in December, analysts expect ROL’s EPS to grow 12.1% to $1.11 on a diluted basis. The company’s earnings surprise history is mixed. It beat or matched the consensus estimate in three of the last four quarters while missing the forecast on another occasion.\nAmong the 12 analysts covering ROL stock, the consensus is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on six “Strong Buy” ratings, one “Moderate Buy,” and five “Holds.”", "content_hash": "00bf26cf7ad3df3f880b3b4eda4fdac4", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

At least with some companies, though, it's easier to predict better prospects in the next year than they're experiencing now. I can think of one great example off the top of my head. Meet the 3.4% yield dividend stock that could soar in 2026: UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH).\nA blue chip stock that has a case of the blues\nYou could honestly say that UnitedHealth Group is a blue chip stock that has a case of the blues. The healthcare giant's Change Healthcare subsidiary was the victim of a highly publicized cyberattack early last year that affected 190 million people. Brian Thompson, CEO of the company's UnitedHealthcare unit, was killed in December 2024.\nIn UnitedHealth Group's first-quarter update in April 2025, the company reported lower-than-expected earnings and lowered its full-year guidance. The next month, it suspended full-year guidance and announced the unexpected departure of former CEO, Andrew Witty.\nUnitedHealth Group yanked its full-year guidance because it didn't have a good handle on soaring medical costs. The company noted that \"care activity continued to accelerate while also broadening to more types of benefit offerings\" and that Medicare Advantage plans were incurring greater costs than anticipated.\nTo add to the troubles, The Wall Street Journal ran a story in May about a criminal investigation of UnitedHealth Group being conducted by the U.S. Department of Justice. Although the DOJ hadn't notified the company about a probe at the time, UnitedHealth subsequently confirmed it was under investigation in July.\nAs a result of all these issues, UnitedHealth Group's share price has plunged almost 60% below its peak set in late 2024. The health insurance stock is down nearly 50% year to date.\nPoised to soar in 2026\nNow for some good news: UnitedHealth Group stock should be poised to soar in 2026. Is this just wishful thinking that a beaten-down stock will rebound? Nope.\nFor one thing, UnitedHealth Group's management projects a return to growth next year. Executives have solid reasons for this expectation. UnitedHealthcare CEO Tim Noel said in the company's second-quarter update that his unit is implementing \"strongly responsive pricing for 2026.\" Translation: Hefty increases to health insurance premiums will more than offset higher medical costs.", "content_hash": "9a06ef113c1d2575826a6932a24172b8", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Within the crypto realm, early disruptors such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have witnessed substantial price appreciation.\nIn the background, however, a relative newcomer called XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) has entered the spotlight. XRP is a component of Ripple's payments network, a financial services infrastructure designed to disrupt incumbent international payments systems.\nWith the token trading for just $3.20 as of this writing (Aug. 10), could XRP be the next cryptocurrency to break out and experience a Bitcoin-style run for the ages?\nHow cheap is XRP in reality?\nOne of the most common mistakes an investor can make is confusing value with share price. A price of a few dollars doesn't necessarily make an asset cheap, just as a high price doesn't necessarily imply overvaluation. To get a better sense of a company's valuation, investors should look past price per share (or token) and instead analyze market capitalization.\nRight now, XRP boasts a market cap of about $190 billion. As the chart below illustrates, that's more than the combined total for crypto-centric companies Robinhood Markets and Coinbase. Taking this a step further, XRP's market cap is almost triple that of the combined market capitalizations of neobanks SoFi Technologies, Chime, and stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group.\nThese are not trivial details. Even though XRP is trading for significantly less than $5, the market is already attributing greater value to it than to established, revenue-generating businesses with diversified ecosystems that serve customers on a global scale.\nIs XRP a buy right now?\nLast year, the global market value for cross-border transactions was estimated by Grand View Research at $212 trillion. The firm forecast this to grow to $320 trillion by 2030 -- growth that would imply both immense potential and an accelerated need for innovative payments infrastructure.\nThe distinction that I think many investors are misunderstanding is that an expanding cross-border transactions market is likely a more meaningful tailwind for solutions providers like Ripple than for bridge currencies such as XRP. In other words, broader adoption of the Ripple payment network is not necessarily a direct catalyst for XRP.", "content_hash": "c7f06010eb2c8ac247e054c0e7713e69", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

But does that also mean speculation is running rampant without the support of fundamentals?\nA surprising survey from S&P Global Market Intelligence showed risk appetite actually decreased in August, highlighting flagging investor sentiment and a return to levels of risk avoidance last seen during the \"Liberation Day\" doldrums of April.\nBut from the perspective of Wall Street bulls, the languishing mood reflected a moment to regroup and a base from which investors could build the next rally.\nEven with fresh highs, and the idea of the S&P crossing 7,000 back on the table, the current rush hasn't hit a dangerously speculative level, according to analysis by DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas. By using S&P 500 sector correlations to the index as a sign of near-term peaks in investor confidence, Colas accurately called the tops in 2023 and 2024, as well as February 2025. \"History suggests that we are heading towards an unhealthy level of investor optimism but are not there just yet,\" Colas wrote in a note to clients this week.\nGrowth stocks also continue to outperform value stocks by a statistically significant amount. But Big Tech's concentration in the S&P 500's growth variant, accounting for nearly half of the index's gains, makes the recent outsized run understandable, Colas wrote.\nAt the same time, crypto investors are partying like the last winter never happened. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ethereum (ETH-USD) are at or near all-time highs. And a parade of altcoins are rallying alongside them, with Washington cheerleading the industry and Wall Street shedding its reluctance to participate in decentralized finance.

But with a momentous Fed cut on the horizon and a settling of the worst tariff-induced fears, the optimism doesn't seem misplaced.\nStill, other measures have signaled that the new highs could flash as warnings, drawing comparisons to historical market tops that, in retrospect, look like bubbles or were driven by circumstances that necessitated a downfall.\nGoldman Sachs analysts recently observed that their Speculative Trading Indicator has risen sharply during the past few months.

This could prove to be a significant tailwind for crypto, particularly Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC), the world's largest cryptocurrency. Should Bitcoin be in your 401(k)? Let's take a look.\nWidening the pool of investors\nDespite Bitcoin's meteoric rise during the past decade, the digital asset has not been as accessible as, say, a highly liquid blue-chip stock. That's due to a number of reasons ranging from skepticism about cryptocurrencies to regulations that made it difficult for mainstream financial institutions and investors to hold crypto.\nObviously, a lot of that has changed in recent years, and even more so since Trump took office. Trump's administration has removed many of the regulatory barriers standing between the financial industry and crypto, and this latest executive order could release a flurry of new buyers for Bitcoin and other digital assets.\n\"That's a monster pool of capital. What we're seeing ... [is] the aperture of being able to buy crypto being widened and widened, [and] more avenues bringing people into the tent,\" Galaxy Chief Executive Officer Michael Novogratz said during an interview on CNBC. \"When it becomes commonplace -- when you can do it at the place you've already been doing business with, if its Fidelity or T. Rowe Price or whoever it is -- you just pull more people into this ecosystem.\"\nMore than 71 million Americans had access to a 401(k) account at the end of 2023, according to an analysis by Capitalize, a provider of digital rollover solutions for retirement accounts. According to the Investment Company Institute, 401(k) plans held $8.7 trillion of assets at the end of the first quarter of 2025.\nWhile some 401(k) plans can already invest in cryptocurrencies, adoption has been low. The Government Accountability Office in a report at the end of last year said that based on survey data, investments in crypto are \"less than 1 percent of the 401(k) market, whether measured by plans, participants, or assets.\"\nShould Bitcoin be in your 401(k)?\nI certainly think there is a case to be made for owning some Bitcoin in your retirement portfolio. Many investors now view Bitcoin and its finite amount of 21 million coins as a form of digital gold, and therefore a way to hedge inflation and other types of volatility. Whether it's true remains to be seen, but gaining as much widespread acceptance as it has is an accomplishment in its own right. Additionally, Bitcoin stands to benefit as a wider pool of buyers, both institutional and perhaps from 401(k) account holders, is introduced to the coin.\nThat said, I would caution investors from investing too much of their account in Bitcoin or any crypto asset. The sector is still only about 15 years old and there is still a lot we need to learn about digital assets. They are still extremely difficult to value, given that they don't produce cash flow or earnings, meaning they still could continue to be volatile.\nLast year, BlackRock issued a report suggesting that investors could allocate as much as 2% of their capital in a multi-asset portfolio to Bitcoin, which feels about right. The main benefit of owning Bitcoin is that it could potentially offer a unique form of diversification. However, 401(k) investors don't need to be taking on excessive risk, as the power of compounding through long-term investing provides a safe, proven method for accumulating wealth.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

However, unlike the majority of players in the field, it went unnoticed until its large government contract wins and rapid commercial expansion brought it to the spotlight.\nWhile some admire the company’s exponential growth, others criticize it for its unconventional methods. Nonetheless, Palantir has become unstoppable. The stock is up 145% year to date, outperforming the market as a whole, which is up 9.7%. Let’s see if the stock is a buy now.\nValued at $441 billion, Palantir develops advanced data analytics software that assists governments, businesses, and other organizations in collecting, integrating, and analyzing large, complex datasets to make better decisions, detect patterns, and solve problems. Its Gotham, Foundry, and AIP platforms are widely used in industries such as defense, intelligence, healthcare, finance, and supply chains.\nPalantir reported a stellar second quarter. For the first time, the company exceeded $1 billion in quarterly revenue, representing a 48% year-over-year increase. Furthermore, its Rule of 40 score reached 94, indicating a healthy balance of rapid growth and strong profitability, which is a rare combination in the AI sector. The U.S. business remains the growth engine, contributing 73% to total revenue. U.S. commercial revenue surged 93% year-over-year, while U.S. government revenue rose 53% year-over-year. The rate of growth in commercial adoption, which was previously a weaker area for Palantir, indicates a strategic shift that could maintain momentum in the coming years. The company’s remaining performance obligations (RPO) reached $2.4 billion, up 77% year on year. Adjusted EPS was $0.16 per share.\nBig Deals, Bigger Pipeline\nThe second quarter marked a quarter of massive contract wins, with 157 deals worth more than $1 million, 66 deals worth more than $5 million, and 42 deals worth more than $10 million. Total contract value (TCV) reached $2.3 billion, with annual contract value (ACV) at $684 million, both record highs. Notably, Palantir’s top 20 customers now have an average trailing 12-month revenue of $75 million, a 30% increase year over year, indicating that once Palantir acquires a client, its footprint within that organization tends to grow significantly.\nPalantir ended the second quarter with $6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term U.S. Treasury securities, providing a solid foundation for future product investment.\nGovernment: A Deep and Sticky Relationship\nWhile the commercial segment is expanding faster, Palantir’s government business remains a cornerstone and one of the primary reasons why Palantir may be the safest AI play. The U.S. Space Force has awarded a $218 million delivery order for multi-domain warfighting support. The ceiling for its Maven Smart System contract was raised by $795 million to meet increasing AI demand from combatant commands. Most notably, Palantir signed a 10-year, $10 billion enterprise agreement with the U.S. Army, combining 75 separate contracts into one.\nThese long-term, mission-critical government contracts generate recurring revenue, which provides stability, especially in uncertain market conditions. Palantir’s AI platforms are deeply embedded in critical enterprise and defense systems, resulting in high switching costs for clients. Furthermore, unlike many other smaller AI plays, Palantir generates consistent cash flow and margins while balancing growth and profitability.\nFor the full year 2025, the company anticipates 45% year-over-year revenue growth to $4.14 billion to $4.15 billion, with 85% growth in U.S. commercial revenue. The company also anticipates GAAP profitability in all quarters of 2025 and adjusted free cash flow of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. Analysts expect Palantir’s earnings to rise by 58.2% in 2025 and 30.8% in 2026. Palantir's stock is expensive, trading at 220 times 2026 estimated earnings.\nIs PLTR Stock a Buy, Hold, or Sell on Wall Street?\nOverall, on Wall Street, Palantir stock is a “Hold.” Among the 21 analysts that cover the stock, four rate it a “Strong Buy,” 14 say it is a “Hold,” one rates it a “Moderate Sell,” and two say it is a “Strong Sell.” Despite the muted outlook, Palantir stock has skyrocketed this year, surpassing its average target price of $155.78. Its Street-high estimate of $200 implies the stock has upside potential of 7% from current levels.\nThe Bottom Line\nWhile Palantir’s positioning is strong, critics remain skeptical, citing the company’s heavy reliance on U.S. government contracts, which means that political or budgetary changes could impact revenue. Palantir has been working on this by rapidly expanding its commercial business to create a more balanced revenue stream.\nPalantir’s combination of high growth, profitability, established customer relationships, and proven technology may make it one of the safest AI investments available. However, given the premium valuation, risk-averse investors may want to wait for a more favorable entry point.\nOn the date of publication, Sushree Mohanty did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CFO.com newsletter.\nThe finance chief of technical products and services provider Diploma plc is stepping down following a “lapse in judgment” at a recent company event, the London-based company said Thursday.\nChris Davies had been in the company’s CFO seat since November 2022, per his LinkedIn profile. His resignation took effect immediately, Diploma officials said in a Thursday news release.\nDetails on the executive’s actions were sparse as of Thursday morning. Diploma officials said only that his “personal behavior” at an unnamed company event “did not meet the high standards required of the Group's leadership team.”\nThe company said his resignation isn’t related to Diploma’s financial performance and won’t affect its guidance for the remainder of its 2025 fiscal year.\nDiploma in its 2024 fiscal year recorded total revenue of £1.36 billion, up 14% over the prior year, according to earnings reports.\nThe company, which says it employs 3,600 people, sells a wide range of products, including fasteners, cables and surgical instruments. In its 2024 annual report, Davies cited the company’s “diversified portfolio” as a growth driver.\n“Organic growth is our first priority and each of our value-add businesses drives this through end-market expansion, geographic penetration and product extension,” he said at the time. “Our diverse portfolio of businesses means that this growth is both strong and resilient.”\nA media representative for Diploma didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday morning.\nThe incident underscores the fact that executives’ behavior, both on and off the clock, can have major ramifications for businesses.\nIn July, for instance, the tech firm Astronomer faced a leadership crisis after its CEO and chief people officer were caught hugging on a jumbotron during a Coldplay concert in Massachusetts. Both went on to resign from the company.

Should You Buy BLSH Stock?\nSo which way for LCID in 2025: A collapse to $1 or a rebound to $7?\nAbout Lucid Stock\nBased in California, Lucid Group is an electric vehicle maker focused on premium, long-range EVs. Best known for the Lucid Air sedan, the company builds vehicles at its Arizona facility and targets the luxury EV market as a rival to Tesla (TSLA). Recently, Lucid’s growth story has been clouded by production tweaks and tariff-driven margin pressure.\nWith a market cap near $7 billion, Lucid’s shares have lagged the broader market over the past year, falling 22.5%.\nDespite underperforming, LCID faces a challenging valuation landscape. Its trailing EV-sales ratio is 9.4x, significantly higher than the sector median of 1.28x, indicating a very expensive stock compared to its peers. However, the price-book ratio of 2.12x is slightly undervalued compared to the sector median of 2.69x.\nLucid Misses Q2 Earnings Estimate\nLucid Group shares slid 9.7% on Aug. 6 after the EV maker missed Wall Street’s Q2 2025 expectations for both revenue and earnings. The company posted a loss of $0.24 per share, falling short by $0.22, while revenue rose 29% year over year to $259.4 million, missing estimates for $283.2 million.\nDespite delivering a record 3,309 vehicles in the quarter, headwinds from tariffs and a trimmed production outlook weighed heavily on investor sentiment. Tariffs alone shaved $54 million off quarterly results, hitting the gross margin by 21 percentage points and leaving it deeply negative at -105%. Management said these pressures were anticipated and outlined plans to blunt the impact through localized sourcing, vertical integration, and cost optimization.", "content_hash": "b69d2e08ad2e04ecc3982346573ebe0f", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

With the litigation overhang dissipating, it's more likely that companies, governments, and other institutions, for which Ripple developed XRP and the XRP Ledger, may embrace them for their intended purpose.\nTrump also just signed an executive order to open up U.S. 401(k) retirement plans to alternative assets, which would include cryptocurrencies. This likely won't have an immediate effect on demand. Still, it underscores cryptocurrency's progress into the mainstream investing scene, and may increase buying activity in XRP and broader digital assets over the long term.\nA new catalyst on the horizon for XRP\nCryptocurrency prices rely on buyer demand, since they have little or no underlying tangible value. The two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that accumulate the coins. For instance, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF holds more than 180,000 bitcoins alone, so you can see how these institutional funds can have a lot of buying power.", "content_hash": "a5a3447e66dba1224a0765a5d13cd63a", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Here are several ways tax professionals say the middle class can take advantage of the Big Beautiful Bill.\nBigger Tax Refund\n“There is the possibility of receiving greater refunds with enhanced tax credits for dependents and childcare,” Sherman Standberry, certified public accountant (CPA) and managing partner at My CPA Coach, wrote in an email. “If you have children or dependents, check eligibility for the enhanced Child Tax Credit and Dependent Care Credit.”\nUnder the BBB, the maximum child tax credit increased from $2,000 to $2,200 per qualifying child, and increased the child and dependent care credit from 35% to 50% of eligible care expenses. Income thresholds for middle-income families have also been adjusted.\nRead Next: 8 Ways Trump’s ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ Could Offer Tax Relief\nAdditionally, a new announcement from the IRS also points to Americans receiving a higher tax refund next year thanks to tax breaks in the BBB. In the notice, the IRS explained that as part of the BBB’s phased implementation, there will be no changes to certain information returns or withholding tables.\nAccording to Newsweek, this means Americans will continue to pay taxes on tips and overtime, but will receive them back as part of their refund.\nHigher Standard Deduction\n“The standard deduction increases by $750 ($1,500 for married couples) starting in 2025,” explained Miryam Wisnicki, principal at Clifton Larson Allen (CLA). “Most middle-class taxpayers claim the standard deduction, so the increased standard deduction will provide broad relief to the middle class.”\nBecause the standard deduction reduces the amount of income subject to tax, this increase means more earnings are shielded from taxation. For many middle-income households, that translates into a lower overall tax bill without the need to itemize deductions.\n“Taxpayers who claim the standard deduction can deduct up to $1,000 ($2,000 for married couples) for cash contributions to charity starting in 2026,” Wisnicki added. Previously, this was only available to those who itemized.\nLower Tax Rates\n“The reduction of marginal tax rates for some income brackets is another noteworthy change that could translate into higher take-home pay for many households,” according to Standberry.", "content_hash": "004e26cd128cc6dd4b536824224e9e02", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

GOBankingRates spoke to retirees to find out what they wish they knew before they downsized.\nAccount for Inflation\nA lot of retirees base how much they’ll need on the price of goods and services when they retire. Even if they downsize, this can still cause a discrepancy in the budget in a few years time.\nStephanie H. retired at the age of 59 in March 2022. She said she wished she had budgeted in a way that left room for prices to rise.\n“I didn’t figure in how much the cost of everything would increase. My house insurance doubled. My car insurance went up more than 80%,” she said.\nStephanie also noted that her cell phone bill, health insurance, gym membership and groceries also went up. “I was blessed with a pension, however it will never increase,” the retiree added.\nStephanie recommended that retirees really take stock of their expenses before they downsize.\n“Look at your expenses, write down every expense,” she explained. “Are there things where you can change services? Cut down? Cut out? Do it yourself vs paying someone? Are there things you don’t use that you can sell (you’d be surprised) and put that money directly in savings?”\nGood To Know: Savings Needed To Be Rich in America’s Most Popular Retirement Destinations\nLook for Lower Rates\nAs Stephanie pointed out, insurance prices — whether it be health insurance, car insurance, pet insurance or any other type — are sure to rise during the retirement years.\nIvy S. recommended being diligent about looking into lower rates for insurance.\n“I’m glad I changed my car insurance and saved $350 over six months,” she shared.\nIvy also switched her phone service so she could save more money.\nThink About Long-Term Care\nDepending on health, some retirees might need long-term care as soon as they stop working. Even if that’s not the case, it’s an important need to think about.\nIvy remarked that long-term care was something her initial retirement plans didn’t budget for. “I don’t need it yet, but I wish I had long-term care,” she said.\nIt might be wise to save enough money that some can be applied to more extensive care in the future.\nLook for Grocery Stores With Lower Prices\nOne way to save more money is to switch grocery stores.

Sources of passive income include interest paid on savings accounts, rent checks for properties you own and lease out, or from an annuity you purchased that sends you a check every month.\nA particularly great way to get passive income is from dividends, and one of the easiest and most effective ways to invest in dividend-paying stocks is via dividend-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) such as the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT: SPYD).\nDon't underestimate the power of dividends\nMany people assume dividend stocks are mainly for their grandparents. That's not true, though, as plenty of dividend payers have outperformed growth stocks. Check out the table below and prepare to be surprised:\nData source: Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds.\nMeet the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF\nThe SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF tracks the S&P 500 High Dividend index, which aims to deliver meaningful income and the chance of stock price appreciation, too. It encompasses the 80 top-yielding stocks in the S&P 500. Here's how the ETF has performed in recent years:\nSource: Morningstar.com, as of August 7, 2025.\nThe past few years have not been amazing, but the past five years showed solid performance. Remember that this is a dividend-focused ETF, too, with a recent dividend yield of 4.5%. That's quite generous, considering that the S&P 500's overall dividend yield is only around 1.2%.\nA yield like that means that even during market downturns or stagnant periods, you'll be collecting meaningful income from the ETF. Invest $10,000, for example, and you're looking at $450 in annual income. Better still, healthy and growing dividend payers tend to increase their payouts over time. So in the future, you might be collecting $600 or $800 or $1,500 per year.\nThere are fees, too, but low ones. The fund's expense ratio is just 0.07% annually, which means you'll have to cough up $7 for each $10,000 you have invested in the fund.\nWhat's in the SPDR High Dividend ETF?\nThe SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF recently had the following top 10 holdings, which together made up a little over 13% of its total value:\nSource: SSGA.com, as of Aug. 7, 2025.\nThe ETF was recently skewed toward midsized companies (with a median market cap of $23.5 billion), and ones that are considered more value stocks than growth stocks. Some 22% of the fund's assets were in real estate companies and 18% in consumer staples companies. Financials (15%) and utilities (13%) were the next biggest sectors.\nAs part of your overall retirement plan, it can be smart to set up some passive income and, ideally, multiple income streams, so that if one runs into trouble (as perhaps Social Security might), you'll have others to rely on.\nShould you buy stock in SPDR Series Trust - SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF right now?\nBefore you buy stock in SPDR Series Trust - SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SPDR Series Trust - SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF wasn’t one of them.

It also contains new retirement account provisions that could affect how Americans plan for their golden years.\nLearn More: 5 Ways Trump’s ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ Could Impact Your Wallet\nRead Next: Clever Ways To Save Money That Actually Work in 2025\nAs the landmark bill was recently passed, there are a few implications it could have for your retirement savings plan. Here’s a look at what changes are coming your way from the federal government that could change the way you approach your nest egg.\nAs the name would suggest, this is a big bill that just got signed into law and covers a lot of financial ground, especially for retirees and those planning on collecting Social Security benefits. Here are a few quick key takeaways from the new legislation to consider:\n-\nDespite some speculation, the OBBBA does not eliminate the taxation of Social Security benefits, but rather offers a deduction of $6,000 for taxpayers aged 65 or older and $12,000 for joint filers from 2025 to 2028, regardless of whether they receive Social Security benefits. This tax break can lower the taxable income for eligible retirees, potentially resulting in lower taxes on their Social Security benefits for many recipients.\n-\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) now estimates that the tax rate cuts and increased senior deduction in OBBBA could accelerate the insolvency of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, potentially leading to benefit cuts to the tune of 24% in the future if no other solutions are found by 2032.\n-\nIf the expanded senior standard deduction and other temporary measures within the OBBBA are made permanent, the projected benefit cuts could become even larger.\n-\nThere are IRA and 401(k) plan enhancements as the legislation increases contribution limits and provides more flexibility for certain employer-sponsored plans in the form of catch-up contribution allowances or annual contribution limits.\nFind Out: What Trump’s New Tax Law Means for Upper-Middle-Class Families in 2025\nMany Americans will now likely receive a break on their taxes owed. This means they would be able to channel more money into retirement savings accounts such as traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs or 401(k) plans.\n“Retirement planning fundamentally comes down to having sufficient resources to make work optional,” said Brett Horowitz, principal and wealth manager at Evensky & Katz / Foldes Financial Wealth Management. “The Tax Cuts & Jobs Act provisions, combined with new deductions for tip income, overtime pay and seniors over 65, could significantly improve retirement outcomes for Americans.”\nThose who benefited from the cuts in the original Tax Cuts & Jobs Act will continue to enjoy these cuts, allowing them to continue saving the same amount of money for retirement as they had been.\n“Retirement modeling depends on clear inputs and stable variables,” he continued. “The less uncertainty in tax policy, the more accurately we can project success rates. When these changes take effect — pending Senate approval — we’ll be able to deliver much better news to clients about their retirement timeline.”\nHorowitz believes that if Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” hadn’t passed, it could have negatively affected Americans’ abilities to save for retirement.\n“There’s a profound psychological difference between telling someone they can retire earlier than expected versus having to extend their working years,” he said. “The former energizes people about their financial future; the latter can feel overwhelming. These tax provisions create the conditions where more Americans can realistically achieve a comfortable retirement.”\nSavvy long-term investment strategies should always take taxes into account, so changes to tax laws can shift these strategies.\n“Smart investing isn’t actually about chasing the highest gross returns — it’s about maximizing what clients actually keep after taxes and expenses, and this tax bill addresses some issues there,” Horowitz said. “While we can control costs through low-fee funds, tax efficiency requires a more nuanced approach that varies by everyone’s personal circumstances.\n“Higher tax rates push us toward tax-free municipal bonds and tax-efficient ETFs in taxable accounts, while we place tax-inefficient investments in retirement accounts,” he continued. “This ‘tax location’ strategy can significantly impact net returns, even if it means accounts perform differently.”\nNo matter where you plan to retire, it’s good to know that the OBBBA has increased the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap. It has gone up to $40,000, with some limitations for higher earners, which can potentially provide relief for retirees in high-tax states.\n“Two provisions in the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act have created the most anxiety for our clients — the SALT deduction cap and estate tax exemptions,” Horowitz said. “Both are getting significant relief.”\nThe increase in the SALT deduction cap means retirees will face less of a penalty if they choose to spend their golden years in a state with higher income taxes.\n“The SALT deduction increase from $10,000 to $40,000 will reshape where people choose to live and retire,” Horowitz said. “We’ve already seen migration patterns shift dramatically since 2017, with high-tax states losing residents to states like Florida and Texas. This change reduces the penalty for living in high-income-tax states, though it doesn’t eliminate the advantage of no-tax states entirely.”\nEstate planning strategies will also change for many Americans.\n“On the estate side, the current $13.99 million exemption was set to drop to $7.14 million in 2026 — a reduction that had wealthy clients scrambling to implement complex gifting strategies and trust structures,” Horowitz said. “The permanent increase to $15 million per person, or $30 million for couples, provides enormous relief for families in that middle tier.”\nThis is particularly important because of state-level complications, Horowitz continued.\n“Take New York, where you could face no federal estate tax, but still owe state estate taxes on estates between $7.16 million and $13.99 million,” he said. “The interplay between federal and state rules makes domicile planning critical.”\nThe “One Big Beautiful Bill” looks to make estate planning less complex for many people.\n“For clients who’ve already implemented sophisticated estate planning strategies, those structures remain valuable,” Horowitz said. “But for families with estates under the new thresholds, this eliminates the pressure to make rushed gifting decisions or create complex trusts simply to avoid tax cliffs.”\nOverall, Horowitz believes the bill will make retirement planning easier. “The permanent nature of these changes finally gives families the certainty to make long-term decisions about where to live, how to structure their wealth and when to implement estate planning strategies,” he said.\nCaitlyn Moorhead contributed to the reporting for this article.\nEditor’s note on political coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

Some traders are even calling for a 50 bps cut.\nThe euphoria has lifted the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index of largest cryptocurrencies more than 1% in the last 24 hours, and sent bitcoin (BTC) to a record high over $124,000 and ether (ETH) 2.2% higher to $4,750, just below its record.\nHeadline inflation data for July came in cooler than expected, but rising core inflation fed into rate-cut expectations. On Polymarket, traders now weigh an 80% chance of a 25 basis-point cut in September, while chances of a 50 bps cut rose to 8.3%. The CME FedWatch tool shows a 97.8% chance of a 25 bps cut, and a 2.2% chance of a 50 bps cut.\nIn the geopolitical front, President Donald Trump is expected to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin this Friday in Alaska. The meeting comes as the U.S. president ramps up pressure for a ceasefire in Ukraine. A follow-up meeting with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy may also be on the cards. Deescalation measures, including a potential air truce, are currently on the table.\nInstitutional demand has made this the best week for spot ether ETFs net inflows, with $2.27 billion coming in according to SoSoValue data. Meanwhile, corporate accumulation led by BitMine has seen ETH treasures accumulate over 3.5 million ETH.\n“Bitmine’s capital raise to build its ETH treasury has drawn attention, with the market noting that any allocation to ETH has an outsized impact compared with BTC, given ETH’s smaller market cap and marginally thinner liquidity,” analysts at QCP Capital wrote. ”We expect the current momentum in ETH to persist as long as fresh flows continue into ETH DATs.”\nBitcoin treasuries, including ETFs, have grown their holdings by around 3.36% in the past 30 days to 3.64 million BTC. That’s more than 17% of the cryptocurrency’s total supply.\nPut together, the cryptocurrency market is benefiting from four key tailwinds. These are the anticipated rate cuts, a friendlier regulatory climate, easing geopolitical tensions and rising institutional and corporate interest.\nLooking ahead, investors will be closely monitoring today’s Producer Price Index (PPI) data for further clues on what the Fed might do in September.

While investors flee the stock over rising medical costs and regulatory headlines, they're missing a crucial fact -- this is still the most dominant health insurer in America trading at recession-level valuations. At 11.5 times projected 2027 earnings, the pessimism looks overdone.\nThe collapse has been breathtaking. Down 47.6% year to date as of this writing (Aug. 13, 2025) in a market hitting record highs, UnitedHealth faces real challenges: medical costs rising faster than premiums, a potential $1.6 billion settlement over billing practices, and regulatory scrutiny of its Optum unit. These aren't minor headwinds.\nBut excessive pessimism creates opportunity, especially when it involves a company processing $1.7 trillion in medical payments annually with no real competitor matching its scale.\nThe math behind the contrarian play\nTrading in the low $270s, UnitedHealth has fallen more than 57% from its 52-week high of $630.73. At about 11.5 times projected 2027 earnings, the stock is priced as if its profitability will remain permanently impaired. While some large-cap peers such as Elevance Health and Cigna currently trade at lower forward multiples, UnitedHealth's scale, vertical integration, and cash generation give it advantages those competitors cannot match.\nWall Street analysts still project earnings per share reaching $40 by the decade's end. That assumes high single-digit annual growth, hardly aggressive for a company that has compounded earnings at 13% annually over the past decade. Apply even a below-market multiple of 16 times to that $40 earnings figure, and you get a $640 stock price. That's roughly 135% upside from current levels.\nMeanwhile, the healthcare giant pays an $8.84 annual dividend, yielding about 3.38%. UnitedHealth has raised its dividend for 15 consecutive years, including a 5.2% increase last quarter. You're collecting a sizable yield backed by roughly $30 billion in annual operating cash flow, giving you steady income while you wait for the recovery.\nWhy the tide will turn for this top healthcare insurer\nThe recent spike in medical costs is being driven by higher utilization, particularly in Medicare Advantage, and management expects the elevated trend to extend into 2026. While this creates short-term margin pressure, UnitedHealth has begun adjusting premiums for 2026 contracts to reflect the higher cost base.", "content_hash": "8b4dd7077d489390abc8d5bbf4bfd37c", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Cisco Systems, long anchored in its networking hardware business—selling routers, switches, and other infrastructure products—has repositioned itself to meet surging enterprise demand for AI infrastructure. Its new chief financial officer, Mark Patterson, is now at the center of that strategy.\nThe San Jose–based communications giant (No. 83 on the Fortune 500) reported earnings on Wednesday for its fiscal fourth quarter and year that ended on July 26. AI infrastructure orders from webscale customers reached more than $800 million in Q4, bringing fiscal 2025’s total to over $2 billion—more than double the $1 billion target first set in Q4 fiscal 2024.\nQuarterly revenue came in at $14.7 billion, up 8% from a year earlier and slightly ahead of the $14.62 billion analysts expected.\n“In Q4, revenue, gross margin and operating margin were at the high end of our guidance ranges, earnings per share was above the guidance range, and we delivered solid operating cash flow,” Patterson said on Wednesday’s earnings call.\nA 25-year Cisco veteran, Patterson became EVP and CFO on July 27, succeeding Scott Herren, who held the role since December 2020 and retired this summer. Herren is credited with helping shift Cisco’s business mix toward software and recurring revenue.\nIn recent years, particularly since 2024, Cisco has made a strategic pivot to position itself as the networking backbone for AI infrastructure. In 2024, it closed its $28 billion all-cash acquisition of Splunk, a cybersecurity and analytics firm that uses AI and machine learning, and rolled out Hypershield, an AI-native system that embeds security into every software component and application running on networks, from servers to public and private clouds.\nOver his long career at Cisco, Patterson has held leadership roles in finance, strategy, and operations, as well as more than a decade in sales covering every customer segment and geography. Most recently, he served as chief strategy officer before stepping into the CFO position.\n“As I look ahead, we have significant opportunities—whether in AI infrastructure for the webscale space, the nascent but growing enterprise AI market, or the buildout of neo-clouds and sovereign AI,” Patterson said on Wednesday’s earnings call, his first as CFO.\nStrengthening cybersecurity through Splunk, advancing campus modernization, maintaining disciplined financing, and ensuring sustainable growth and shareholder value are also on his agenda.\n“What I really want to do is make sure we’re funded for success,” he said. “You can expect that I will focus on durable, profitable growth.”", "content_hash": "039a7542ae8e45e82bdc5b06da8202b7", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Since taking over as CEO in 1965, Buffett has consistently delivered an incredible annualized return of 20%. Just imagine, a $100 investment back then would have blossomed into over $5 million today.\nBuffett's keen eye for high-quality companies with competitive moats has made him a beacon of inspiration for investors everywhere. While his successful track record speaks volumes, it's important to remember that not every investment hits the mark. With that in mind, here are two Buffett stocks that I would scoop up right now, along with one that I'd steer clear of right now.\nBuy Berkshire Hathaway\nThe first stock I'd buy is Buffett's own Berkshire Hathaway. Investing in Berkshire provides investors with diversification, disciplined capital management, and stellar long-term returns. At its core, Berkshire is a conglomerate of high-quality businesses, including wholly owned subsidiaries like Geico, BNSF Railway, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, as well as a massive equity portfolio featuring blue chip names like Apple, Coca-Cola, and Visa.\nWhat has set Berkshire apart is its capital management and patience across economic cycles. Buffett and his right-hand man, the late Charlie Munger, achieved a stellar track record of investing in high-quality companies going back 60 years. The company has done so by avoiding fads and investing in durable businesses with strong moats and steady cash flows.\nEarlier this year, Warren Buffett announced he was passing the reins of CEO on to Greg Abel. Meanwhile, investing lieutenants Todd Combs and Ted Weschler will help direct Berkshire's massive investment portfolio.\nThe company is in a good spot in terms of capital. Its huge cash pile stands at nearly $340 billion, providing it with dry powder for opportunistic purchases during market dislocations. For long-term investors, Berkshire Hathaway is a well-run conglomerate with a ton of cash on hand, leaving it well positioned even in a post-Buffett era.\nBuy American Express\nThe second Buffett stock to buy is American Express(NYSE: AXP). American Express boasts a strong brand, customer loyalty, and strong credit metrics, making it a solid blue chip stock for long-term investors.\nThe company operates a closed-loop payments network, unlike Visa or Mastercard which only handle transactions. As a result, American Express captures fees from transactions on its network along with interest-earning loans on those credit card balances. Visa and Mastercard earn swipe fees, but credit card loans are held by banking partners that reap the benefits of interest payments.\nWhile this gives American Express interest income, which can help boost earnings, especially when interest rates rise as they did a few years ago, it also opens the company up to credit risk. If its credit card borrowers fail to repay their balances, it could impact its credit quality and ultimately its earnings.\nThis is where American Express' strength becomes evident. The company reduces its credit risk by focusing on a high-spending, high-credit customer base that can be more resilient in economic downturns. As a result, American Express tends to have stellar credit metrics compared to its peers. On top of that, it benefits from growth in travel, luxury spending, and business expenditures as its affluent consumer base helps drive above-average transaction volumes and fee income.\nFor long-term investors seeking quality, resilience, and consistent shareholder returns, American Express is a compelling stock for your diversified portfolio.\nAvoid Ally Financial\nOne Warren Buffett stock I wouldn't buy is Ally Financial(NYSE: ALLY). There is nothing wrong with the company per se, and it could do well if we get interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in the coming years. However, the company has some limitations that could hurt its long-term growth prospects.\nFirst, it operates in a highly cyclical business, with over three-quarters of Ally's revenue coming from automotive lending. This reliance on auto lending makes it sensitive to economic downturns.\nDuring recessions or credit contractions, demand could wane and delinquencies and charge-offs could spike, causing a hit to its profits. This is precisely what happened in recent years, when Ally's revenue and income dropped off amid the rising interest rate environment of 2022 to 2023.\nAdditionally, Ally competes in crowded markets, such as automotive lending, digital banking, and investing. It faces competition from banks, like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Capital One Financial, along with fintech companies like SoFi. It also faces competition in automotive lending from PNC Financial and Upstart, which is gaining a foothold in the space.\nAlly could do well in the near term, especially if credit conditions normalize and the Federal Reserve cuts its benchmark interest rate. While the stock is reasonably priced on a forward basis, I don't see a strong, robust business model with a strong moat, which is why I would avoid this Buffett stock today.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

South Korea and Japan are both having high-level and advanced discussions currently about how those stablecoins should operate. And how the private sector and governments should interact in regulating stablecoins.\nCentral Banks in Korea and Japan differ in their approaches towards stablecoins and CBDCs:\nA CBDC, or a central bank-controlled digital currency, is a blockchain-powered digital currency controlled by a central bank pegged to a real-world currency denomination.\nA stablecoin is typically issued by private enterprises. They are usually designed to have a value identical to real-world currencies.\nJapan: CBDCs can learn from stablecoins\nThe Bank of Japan maintains a firm stance that CBDCs should only be used for interbank settlements. Private banks' issued stablecoins can be used for business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions. The Bank of Japan and the Financial Services Agency have devised a stablecoin regulatory framework with a positive stance on the use of privately regulated stablecoins.\nWhile the Bank of Japan acknowledges the “the potential of stablecoins as an efficient means of payment,” it also envisions co-existence with CBDCs and views the digital Yen as a complementary, rather than competitive, form of cash, with traditional finance.\nThe Governor of the Bank of Japan, Kazuo Ueda, recently said, “Stablecoins increase small international remittances, leading to risk diversification. With more high-frequency micropayments, it will be interesting to explore how CBDCs can play a complementary role.” Suggesting that private stablecoins could provide learnings for a CBDC design in terms of its payment efficiency.\nSouth Korea: Ambivalence but leaning towards private stablecoins\nThis contrasts with the Bank of Korea's current ambivalent stance as to whether or not private stablecoins should be controlled by central banks, considering that they will potentially cause instability in domestic currency value or capital flight. It is crucial to understand that Korea has very tight capital controls on the currency system.\nHowever, South Korea’s National Assembly has led the pro-stablecoin discussions by proposing three different Digital Asset bills to legalize KRW stablecoins. These bills came after President Jae Myung Lee pledged to create domestic stablecoins during the recent election campaign that concluded successfully in June. It is noteworthy that Korea’s CBDC project was halted on 29 June 2025, following these stablecoin discussions.\nImage: Kaia\nAs a result, many competing consortia from Web3, fintech, and the banks are all scrambling for a position to be part of any future stablecoin designs. Kakao and Naver, the largest IT enterprises in South Korea, have begun their stablecoin research task forces, filed trademarks, or formed an alliance group seeking potential partners.\nCircle, the USDC issuer, signed an MOU with Hana Bank, one of Korea’s main banks, to lay the groundwork for a future stablecoin business alliance. Private South Korean banks have already begun positioning themselves as stablecoin businesses; the CBDC project was frozen in June.\nNevertheless, South Korea has maintained a “one bank for one centralized crypto exchange\" regulation, blocking new market entrants. Therefore, many in the industry are keenly awaiting to see which of the three bills is adopted.\nWhy Japan and South Korea’s approaches matter for non-USD stablecoins\nRather than benefiting the South Korean economy, the Bank of Korea and others argue that a Korean-won (KRW) backed stablecoin will not prevent capital flights from South Korea, as those stablecoins will not be widely used in global digital asset transactions like USD stablecoins.\nThe interaction between the private sector and governments in regulating stablecoins, as well as how South Korea and Japan address these issues, particularly in balancing the mass adoption of stablecoins with adherence to Web3 principles, has implications beyond their borders.\nUnknown block type \"divider\", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option\nAsk an Expert\nQ: What is driving the shift in Asia to integrate blockchain technology into traditional financial systems?\nA: Asia's embrace of blockchain is a strategic pivot, moving beyond the speculative aspects of cryptocurrency to its potential as a foundational technology. Policy leaders across the region see that regulatory clarity is essential for sustainable innovation; examples such as Hong Kong's licensing regime for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) and Singapore's regulated DeFi and cross‑border payment pilots show this in action. This proactive approach creates the regulatory clarity and robust infrastructure necessary to facilitate secure on-chain transactions and more efficient cross-border payments, ultimately modernizing financial systems.\nQ: South Korea's new regulatory framework is a significant development. What are the key features, and what do they signal for institutional adoption?\nA: South Korea's new framework, formalized in the Digital Asset Basic Act (DABA), represents a major step toward institutional acceptance. Its key features, including comprehensive guidelines for stablecoins and the introduction of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), are designed to create a more secure and defined environment for digital assets. Furthermore, the launch of a state-supported blockchain network underscores a strategic focus on building institutional-grade infrastructure. These developments collectively signal that South Korea views digital assets not just as a retail product, but as a legitimate part of the financial ecosystem, paving the way for greater institutional participation.\nQ: What are the key takeaways for financial advisors from Asia's evolving blockchain landscape, and what should they be monitoring?\nA: The developments in Asia, particularly in countries like South Korea, provide a clear roadmap for the future of global finance. Advisors should recognize that this trend signals a move toward institutional acceptance and the potential for new, regulated financial products. It is crucial to monitor developments in tokenized securities, which could fundamentally change how assets are issued, traded, and settled. Additionally, keeping an eye on new stablecoin regulations and digital Know Your Customer (KYC) frameworks is essential, as these trends could very well be a preview of the next evolution of capital markets globally.", "content_hash": "40354d37c58188f6b3471f90f28f1ccd", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The current deputy chief and CFO started off as a store manager in Spain in 2001. While Gen Z hopes to make it to the top by job-hopping across companies, Maeztu has proved staying loyal pays off in the long-run. Outgoing Ikea boss Jesper Brodin and Walmart leader Doug McMillon also spent decades of their lives working their way up to the top spot.\nStaying loyal to one company for decades feels like a career strategy of the past—but it’s paid off for Ikea’s incoming CEO Juvencio Maeztu, who stuck with the company for 25 years. He started off as a store manager in his early 30s—and has slowly worked his way up to the coveted throne of the global retail titan.\n“I feel deeply grateful, humble and responsible for the trust and confidence placed in me. Working with [outgoing CEO] Jesper Brodin for the past seven years has been a true privilege,” Maeztu wrote in a recent LinkedIn post. “The future excites me. We have a strong foundation, a clear direction, and nearly 170,000 amazing colleagues around the world.”\nThis November Maeztu will ascend to Ikea’s helm, joining an exclusive cohort of leaders who stuck it out and scaled the ranks of their businesses to the CEO spot. And it includes the Ikea CEO he’s replacing, Brodin, who has served 30 years at the company and worked his way up from being his boss’ assistant. Walmart leader Doug McMillon similarly dedicated 30 years of his life rising from a warehouse worker to the most powerful job at the $765 billion business.\nJust like Brodin and McMillon, Maeztu’s start at the furniture giant that reeled in $52.6 billion in total sales last year was far from glamorous. However, in those moments on the shop floor, he often got to rub shoulders with the late Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad.\n“I have been dozens of times with Ingvar on the shop floor starting at five in the morning in the loading area and finishing at 10 in the evening with a hot dog,” Maeztu told the Financial Times. “The important thing is that we all carry Ingvar’s spirit, and this I feel very loyal to.”\nAfter staying committed for a decade, he finally reached the C-suite in 2012—and in just a few short months, he will have summited the company’s corporate hierarchy.\nFortune reached out to Ikea for comment.\nMaeztu’s career trajectory: climbing the ranks from store manager to CEO\nFrom his 25 years of service at Ikea, Maeztu knows the ins-and-outs of the brand that will be essential in helping him lead the retail giant. The 57-year-old Ikea devotee is the first non-Swede to lead the European retail giant—a leadership leap that showcases that Maeztu is the right fit to helm the company. He earned the top spot due to his “purpose-driven, entrepreneurial leadership” and extensive store experience—garnered through decades of leading Ikea’s international locations, the business says.", "content_hash": "3e5bb1d5bb29fdf75d76b1bc8b689680", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

In our second article on CVOL, we analyze how different skew configurations – negative or positive – might offer nuanced insights into investor expectations.\nBefore that, let’s examine what is CVOL and how it works. CVOL is a suite of implied volatility indices measuring 30-day forward volatility across all option strike prices of key futures markets. It’s based on a simple variance methodology to measure the volatility across all strikes for a given futures market.1\nVolatility indices may be considered a sentiment indicator as they attempt to capture the view of a wide range of options-market participants. The skew ratio is one of CVOL’s five derivative metrics, and what it suggests about a futures market’s sentiment of direction.\nCVOL Skew Ratio\nTo understand the skew ratio, let’s first explain what it may imply and then how it is calculated. The ratio may suggest the option market participants’ perception of an upward or downward direction of its underlying futures market. The skew ratio is either above or below 1.0. There are three possibilities of sentiment.\nIf the ratio is above 1.0 and moving higher, it implies the underlying futures market is perceived by options market participants for the price to more likely increase.\nIf the ratio is below 1.0 and moving lower, it suggests the options participants’ perception of the underlying futures market to more likely decline.\nIf the ratio is moving towards 1.0 from either a higher or lower level, it suggests the underlying futures market might be moving sideways, is in balance, or at least has no suggestion of direction.\nThe skew ratio is calculated by dividing the Up Variance (UpVar) of a futures market’s options by the Down Variance (DnVar) of a futures market’s options. UpVar and DnVar, which are also derivative metrics of the CVOL suite, measure volatility in the individual option wings. UpVar measures the volatility of out-of-the-money call options to determine upside risk. DnVar measures the volatility of out-of-the-money put options to determine the downside risk.2 Skew ratio takes these values and divides one by the other to determine the skewness of the volatility curve, which in this case UpVar being divided by DnVar. This creates a normalized ratio that shows how excess volatility may be in out-of-the-money calls versus puts or vice versa. Also, since it is expressed as a ratio, it is a useful tool for comparing skewness across asset classes.\nSkew Ratio Examples\nFigure 1 notes a seasonal tendency in both natural gas options and CVOL’s skew ratio; during the winter months (the grey bars), the natural gas skew ratio tends to rise as options market participants seek upside protection from sudden cold bursts that could drive up demand for the common source of heating energy. The skew ratio is also suggesting the options participants are expecting higher prices. This is notable in the cold flash of the winter of 2018/2019 when upside volatility quickly rose alongside the skew ratio due to sudden increased demand of heating.\nFigure 1: Natural Gas Futures and CVOL Skew Ratio\nFigure 2 demonstrates how the skew ratio generally tends to move in tandem with the direction of crude oil futures. In early May 2025, crude oil futures fell below $60 per barrel. Simultaneously the skew ratio was below 1, suggesting the crude oil option market perceived the market to trade sideways or perhaps continue its decline since peaking in January.\nFigure 2: Front Month Crude Oil Futures & CVOL Skew Ratio\nHowever, as Middle East tensions increased between May and June, crude oil prices rallied and the skew ratio climbed from below 1 to 1.8, showing market participants sought upside risk protection via options on expectations for the possibility of escalating tensions. Going forward, the skew ratio has maintained a level above 1, thus the options market suggests crude oil futures would maintain an elevated price relative to the April and May prices.\nExamples of the Skew ratio and Convexity occurring simultaneously\nAs the previous examples focused on the skew ratio in isolation of other CVOL metrics, sometimes various CVOL metrics move in tandem, suggesting a more complicated or nuanced market environment. The examples below demonstrate movements in the skew ratio suggesting an options market perspective of market direction, while convexity (see convexity paper) shifts, proposing uncertainty of direction.\nFigure 3 notes that as the Euro futures began to rally against the U.S. dollar in early March, the skew ratio simultaneously shifted quickly from 0.90 to 1.05 and convexity quickly spiked and then declined. As tariffs were introduced, the FX markets were in flux amid questions of how trade policies would be finalized and the implications of those policies/agreements. By April, convexity increased as more variance occurred at the wings of the strike prices versus at-the-money (ATM) strike price. So here, a rising convexity indicated the market was pricing in some sort of a move, with skew ratio indicating the probability of that move being likely to be to the upside in the underlying futures market\nFigure 3: Front Month Euro Futures, CVOL Skew Ratio & Convexity\nAs fighting in Ukraine continued into October 2022, wheat futures prices rallied from about $7.50 per bushel in the summer to just over $9 per bushel by October (Figure 4). Wheat’s skew ratio also increased as a rally developed. Simultaneously, convexity was also increasing, implying the options market’s increasing uncertainty for the future direction of wheat futures. Fundamentally, this related to the Black Sea Grain Initiative agreement with a November 19 deadline to allow Ukraine to continue exporting food and fertilizer through three Black Sea shipping ports.3\nFigure 4: Front Month SRW Wheat Futures, CVOL Skew Ratio & Convexity\nParticularly interesting is the marked increase in convexity in early November while the skew ratio remained steady at elevated levels. This non-parallel move in convexity and skew ratio indicates that the risk premium was continually being purchased in both calls and puts (relative to at-the-money) as reflected by a rising convexity.\nThe skew ratio remaining stable while convexity jumped indicates that risk was being purchased in both out-of-the-money puts and calls as opposed to just calls. If the latter was true (i.e. continual purchase of protection for upside risk with the purchase of out-of-the-money calls), the skew ratio would have risen as well. While the skew ratio has the power of indicating potential directionality in the market, convexity is still an important metric to follow for gauging uncertainty and price of risk in out-of-the-money options.\nFigure 5 shows front-month copper futures’ skew ratio reacting to the back-and-forth news cycle surrounding the proposed copper tariffs in April. This led to market participants seeking upside protection due to concerns of the impact on copper-related supply chains as the metal has a variety of applications including construction, wiring, the energy transition and solar panels. Simultaneously, convexity also increased, suggesting market participants may have conflicting sentiments about copper.\nFigure 5: Front Month High Grade Copper Futures, CVOL Skew Ratio, & Convexity\nSummary\nThe skew ratio is derived from volatility of OTM calls relative to the volatility of OTM puts. It can note market sentiment of a given futures market. Moving above 1.0 implies a bullish sentiment while moving below 1.0 suggests a bearish sentiment. It helps to view the skew ratio in relation with other CVOL metrics. As noted above, it’s possible for the skew ratio to offer directional market sentiment of an underlying futures market, while convexity can also suggest general uncertainty for future direction. This would suggest conflicting views of market sentiment. Examining these metrics in the context of market fundamentals can be helpful.\nAll examples in this report are hypothetical interpretations of situations and are used for explanation purposes only.

Its exposure to major tech clients such as Google and Amazon has left it particularly vulnerable to the slowdown.\nS4 has also been hit by accounting blunders that forced it to delay its financial results twice, while it has issued a string of profit warnings in recent years after failing to meet its own lofty revenue targets.\nShares in the London-listed company have collapsed by more than 90pc with its market value now standing at roughly £135m, down from a peak of £5bn in 2021.\nS4 has embarked on a heavy programme of cost-cutting, including slashing hundreds of roles. The company posted a loss of £307m last year after taking a £280m write-down owing to tough trading conditions.\nIts struggles come amid deep-seated challenges for traditional advertising companies as tech rivals gain a stranglehold over the online market and as artificial intelligence (AI) threatens to upend their business models.\nThis has fuelled speculation of a wave of consolidation across the industry.", "content_hash": "ea913efa39efcb356aeca166acf5a40f", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

We are a touch-and-feel product, especially for consumers who are new to the brand,” Birkenstock chief executive officer Oliver Reichert told investors on the call. “We have over 12,000 high-quality touch points through our B2B partners compared to our own fleet of 90 doors. That is why this shift in consumer behavior favors our B2B channel over DTC.”\nHe said the brand is winning at retail as it gains shelf space and takes market share. “In a flat U.S. market, retail revenue at our top 10 wholesale partners was up 25 percent. As you do your channel checks for back-to-school, you will hear that Birkenstock is the winner with very strong sellout and fast inventory turns,” the CEO said.\nReichert said the same is true for the EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) region. “Retail revenue at our top 10 partners was up 20 percent. Within our B2B channel, over 90 percent of the growth came from within existing doors. We are committed to maintaining relative scarcity and managing tightly our distribution growth,” he explained.\nThe company is on track to reach its goal of 100 stores by the end of the fiscal year. Birkenstock has accelerated the pace of store openings, adding 13 doors thus far. The expectation is a return of CapEx within 12 to 18 months of an opening, helped by higher average selling prices and higher units per transaction from the first day of a store’s opening. Reichert said the store openings allow the brand to capture more in-person shopping demand within its own DTC business since the stores can showcase the brand’s full product assortment.\n“Our brand heat is stronger than before,” Reichert said, noting full-price sell-throughs and Birkenstock’s strong order book. He also cited the emerging youth market as a runway for growth. “Our demand is strong across all product categories and target groups. Sales of our [classic] silhouettes grew by double digits. Demand for our iconic styles, such as the Arizona and Boston remains strong and is accelerating within the younger demographic,” the CEO said, adding that at the same time, “we are growing in expansion categories such as laced-up shoes.” He noted that closed-toe share of revenue increased by 400 basis points year-over-year.\nChief financial officer Ivica Krolo said business-to-business growth outpaced DTC in the quarter, with B2B revenue up 18 percent and DTC up 12 percent, both on a constant-currency basis. DTC share of the business was 38 percent, down 110 basis points versus the same year-ago quarter.\n“B2B has proven to be the most cost-efficient way to target new consumer groups,” he said. “We now expect B2B growth to outpace DTC in both the fourth quarter and for the full year.” As a demand-driven brand, Krolo said the company is strategically allocating product to where the consumer is shopping. “And unlike our peers, we own our supply chain. The B2B order book provides predictability and de-risks our planning,” the CFO noted.\nKrolo also said the company can manage the impact of the baseline 15 percent EU tariff through actions already taken, including targeted price increases. He said in the first quarter that Birkenstock would only need a low-single-digit price increase globally for a full offset of the tariff impact. On Thursday’s call, the CFO elaborated on other tools at Birkenstock’s disposal: “Pricing is not the only lever we have. Given our vertical integration, additional levers include efficiencies in production, vendor negotiations, the optimization of the product mix and the allocation of products between the regions.”\nThe CFO also disclosed that the brand entered 2025 with an effective tariff rate of 11 percent, which at one point went up to 21 percent in April when including the 10 percent reciprocal rate. While noting that the manageability of the new baseline, he also said, “We have some items that are already tariffed at over 15 percent and those higher tariffs, historical tariffs, will remain in place.”\nAs for price increases in the U.S. due to anticipated higher costs connected to tariff increases, David Kahan, president of Americas, said price adjustments for select styles became effective on July 1 and that the brand has “seen no impact whatsoever since we took our pricing increases.”\nWith six weeks past the price actions under its belt, recent channel checks indicate “velocity and sell-through” for the brand from July and into the second week of August, Kahan explained. He said that period includes a significant portion of the U.S. bts season, adding that sales have been “exceptional and it’s escalated even beyond the selling results we had in Q3, which historically was when we would have high spring peak sell-throughs.”\nKahan also that 90 percent of growth is from existing doors due to more styles, stock keeping units and some added depth in inventory.\nAnd EMEA president Mehdi Nico Bouyakhf reiterated growth for the brand in the region, noting that same-store sales in retail rose by double digits and price increases for spring 2025 didn’t see any consumer pushback, resulting in full-price sales at more than 90 percent. Contributing to full-price sales was a structural demand issue in the quarter where consumer appetite for the brand was greater than product availability, Bouyakhf said.\nMembers of the management team have said the brand overall tends to limit production capacity to maintain a level of scarcity in the market.\nFor the three months ended June 30, net income jumped 73.1 percent to 129.2 million euros, or 0.69 euros a diluted share, from 74.6 million euros, or 0.40 euros, a year ago. Revenue for the period rose 12.4 percent to 635.0 million euros from 564.8 million euros a year ago.\nFor the six months, net income rose 82.9 percent to 254.5 million euros, or 1.36 euros a diluted share, from 139.1 million euros, or 0.74 euros, in the same year-ago period. Revenue rose 16.5 percent to 1.57 billion euros from 1.35 billion euros.\nThe company on Thursday reiterated it prior guidance for fiscal 2025, with revenue growth expected at the high end of a 15 to 17 percent range on a constant currency basis.\nMeanwhile, Birkenstock 1774 has been busy reimagining the classics to give consumers a reason to buy the brand’s footwear. April saw the launch of a nylon version of the Arizona sandal — Karl Birkenstock debuted the original silhouette in 1973 — in several monochrome colors. That was followed in May with Birkenstock 1774 and Maharishi teaming up to launch its outdoor Mogami Terra Tech sandal.\nBest of WWD\nSign up for FN's Newsletter.

Covrig Analytics said last Friday that reports of reduced cane yields from Brazil's sugar farmers may knock Brazil's 2025/26 sugarcane production below 600 MMT, much lower than Brazilian government crop forecasting agency Conab's forecast of 663.4 MMT.\nAn excessive short position by funds could exacerbate any short-covering rally in sugar futures. Last Friday's weekly Commitment of Traders (COT) report showed funds increased their net-short positions in NY sugar futures by +25,923 positions to 151,004 short positions in the week ending August 5, the most in almost 6 years.\nLast Tuesday, sugar prices fell to 5-week lows on signs of stronger sugar production in Brazil. On July 31, Unica reported Brazil's Center-South sugar output in the first half of July rose +15% y/y to 3.4 MMT. Also, the amount of sugarcane being crushed for sugar by Brazil's sugar mills has increased to 54% from 50% the same time last year.\nThe outlook for higher sugar exports from India is negative for sugar prices after Bloomberg reported that India may permit local sugar mills to export sugar in the next season, which starts in October, as abundant monsoon rains may produce a bumper sugar crop. India's Meteorological Department reported Tuesday that cumulative monsoon rain in India was 500.8 mm as of August 4, or 4% above normal. Also, the Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association said last Thursday that it will seek permission to export 2 MMT of sugar in 2025/26.\nThe outlook for higher sugar production in India, the world's second-largest producer, is bearish for prices. On June 2, India's National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories projected that India's 2025/26 sugar production would climb +19% y/y to 35 MMT, citing larger planted cane acreage. That would follow a -17.5% y/y decline in India's sugar production in 2024/25 to a 5-year low of 26.2 MMT, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).\nSugar prices retreated through early July, with NY sugar falling to a 4.25-year low and London sugar sliding to a 4-year low, driven by expectations of a sugar surplus in the 2025/26 season. On June 30, commodities trader Czarnikow projected a 7.5 MMT global sugar surplus for the 2025/26 season, the largest surplus in 8 years. On May 22, the USDA, in its biannual report, projected that global 2025/26 sugar production would increase by +4.7% y/y to a record 189.318 MMT, with global sugar ending stocks at 41.188 MMT, up 7.5% y/y.\nSugar prices also have support from reduced sugar production in Brazil. Unica reported last Thursday that the cumulative 2025/26 Brazil Center-South sugar output through mid-July fell by -9.2% y/y to 15.655 MMT. Last month, Conab, Brazil's government crop forecasting agency, said 2024/25 Brazil sugar production fell by -3.4% y/y to 44.118 MMT, citing lower sugarcane yields due to drought and excessive heat.\nThe outlook for higher sugar production in Thailand is bearish for sugar prices. On May 2, Thailand's Office of the Cane and Sugar Board reported that Thailand's 2024/25 sugar production rose +14% y/y to 10.00 MMT. Thailand is the world's third-largest sugar producer and the second-largest exporter of sugar.\nThe International Sugar Organization (ISO) raised its 2024/25 global sugar deficit forecast to a 9-year high of -5.47 MMT on May 15, up from a February forecast of -4.88 MMT. This indicates a tightening market following the 2023/24 global sugar surplus of 1.31 MMT. ISO also cut its 2024/25 global sugar production forecast to 174.8 MMT from a February forecast of 175.5 MMT.\nThe USDA, in its bi-annual report released May 22, projected that global 2025/26 sugar production would climb +4.7% y/y to a record 189.318 MMT and that global 2025/26 human sugar consumption would increase +1.4% y/y to a record 177.921 MMT. The USDA also forecasted that 2025/26 global sugar ending stocks would climb +7.5% y/y to 41.188 MMT. The USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) predicted that Brazil's 2025/26 sugar production would rise +2.3% y/y to a record 44.7 MMT FAS predicted that India's 2025/26 sugar production would rise +25% y/y to 35.3 MMT due to favorable monsoon rains and increased sugar acreage. FAS predicted that Thailand's 2025/26 sugar production will climb +2% y/y to 10.3 MMT.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.
