Updating your insurance policies probably isn't at the top of the list, but, from health insurance to life insurance, you'll need to make changes to keep pace with your new phase of life and ensure your family's security for years to come.
Here are seven updates to make to your policies when you start a family.
Offers in this section are from affiliate partners and selected based on a combination of engagement, product relevance, compensation, and consistent availability.
Amica offers a level term life insurance and whole life insurance policies payable for 20 years or until ages 65 or 100. Both include a terminal illness rider at no extra charge.

1. Update your health insurance
Your health insurance will be crucial to covering your baby's many appointments in their first year of life. If you have health care through work, reach out to human resources or visit your benefits portal to add your baby to your policy.
Giving birth and adopting are both considered ""qualifying life events,"" which means you're entitled to make changes outside of the standard open enrollment period.
""Your baby should automatically be covered for the first 30 days on your existing policy, but you need to officially add them during this period so that they are insured moving forward,"" Regina McCann Hess, a certified financial planner at Forge Wealth Management, told CNBC Select.
If you have a partner who has their own health care, you can pick the one that best suits your needs and budget.
If you get coverage through the ACA Health Insurance Marketplace, you'll need to buy additional coverage. If you have Medicaid, your baby is automatically enrolled for the first year.
2. Buy life insurance
Life insurance is the best way to ensure your family's financial stability if the worst should happen.
No one wants to think about death, especially their own, McCann Hess says, but once you have a family, ""you need to plan for the possibility.""
""It doesn't have to be an elaborate or fancy policy,"" she adds. ""You can use term insurance to get the job done.""
According to McCann Hess, life insurance isn't just necessary to replace a breadwinner's income.
""Some people assume that the caregiving spouse who stays at home doesn't need a policy,"" she said. ""I disagree. You'll have to get someone to watch your kids while you are at work—or maybe full-time. And, unlike your spouse, they aren't going to do it for free.""
There are many different life insurance plans on the market, but term life is a straightforward and affordable option for new parents. It's only in force for a certain number of years, usually between 10 and 30, but it can serve as a safety net during your child's most vulnerable years, when your income caregiving is most critical.
A $250,000 policy for a 30-year-old woman averages about $15 per month, according to Policygenius. For a 30-year-old man, it would be about $18 a month.
A whole life insurance policy, in comparison, would cost upwards of $200 per month.
One of our top picks for term life insurance is Ladder, because it allows you to increase or decrease your death benefit as your life changes. If you own a car or house, Amica has affordable premiums and a healthy discount of up to 30% on auto, home and umbrella policies when you add life insurance.

Ladder is a digital-first life insurance company offering up to $3 million in coverage without an exam. It only offers a single term life insurance policy without riders, but Ladder's policies offer the option to increase or decrease coverage as your needs change.
3. If you have life insurance, make sure it's enough
You might think you're covered if you have group life insurance through your job. Employer-sponsored policies usually only pay out the equivalent of one year's salary, however, and the rule of thumb is to have at least 10 times that amount.
Even if you did take out a policy on your own, it probably doesn't reflect your current needs.
""Consider your current lifestyle, your child's lifetime educational needs, and your spouse's financial needs in case you aren't around,"" says McCann Hess.
If your existing policy has a guaranteed insurability rider, you should be able to increase coverage at life milestones, such as the birth of a child, without undergoing another medical exam.
4. Consider life insurance for the baby
No one wants to think about something terrible happening to their child, but a child's life insurance policy can help cover medical expenses and funeral costs. It also ensures they're eligible for coverage when they're older, even if they develop a disqualifying health condition or take up a risky job or hobby.
Children's whole life insurance policies also have a cash value component that grows over time. Later in life, if they keep the policy current, the cash value can be withdrawn, borrowed against or used to help pay premiums.
You can typically get a policy for a baby 14 days after birth, with the usual medical exam requirement waived. Our top picks for children's life insurance include Aflac, one of the few companies with term life policies for children, and Foresters Financial, which has a Bright Future Children's policy that pays out up to $75,000.

Cons

5. Get disability insurance
While life insurance may be top of mind, it's more likely you'll be disabled during your working years than pass away. According to the Social Security Administration, one in four U.S. workers in their 20s now will become disabled before they reach full retirement.
Disability insurance can help ensure you'll have enough money to keep your household running if you're unable to work for a period. Short-term disability provides income if you're temporarily unable to work due to a covered illness, injury or medical condition. It can last up to six months and is often (but not always) provided by employers.
""Will it fully cover all of your lost income?"" McCann Hess says. ""No, but hopefully it will help you pay some of your household expenses and provide some financial stability while you are disabled.""
If you're self-employed or don't have coverage through work, a short-term disability policy from online marketplace Breeze can replace up to 60% of your weekly income for up to two years.
Breeze Disability Insurance

7. Look into umbrella insurance
Your life is expanding, so make sure your coverage does too. Liability protection pays out if you or someone in your household unintentionally causes damage to someone or their property. An umbrella insurance policy supersedes the limits on your home and auto policies, providing an extra layer of protection.
Travelers offers affordable umbrella insurance policies worth up to $5 million that can also cover attorneys' fees, medical bills and other expenses.
Insurance FAQs
How long after having a baby can you add them to your health insurance?
Having a baby is a qualifying life event, so you'll have 30 days to add your newborn to your plan. If you have a Health Insurance Marketplace plan, your special enrollment period is 60 days from the child's birth.
Does car insurance pay to replace a child's car seat?
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recommends replacing a car seat ""following a moderate or severe crash,"" even if it doesn't seem damaged. If you have collision coverage, most car insurance providers will often cover the cost of a new seat. If there is a theft, fire or natural disaster, the seat would be covered under a comprehensive coverage policy.
Is homeowners insurance more expensive if you have children?
While the presence of a baby won't raise your premiums, you'll need to reevaluate your contents coverage after buying a crib, stroller and a mountain of baby toys. As your child grows and becomes more adventurous, additions like a swimming pool or a trampoline can increase your rates.

Today’s PPI data “could be make or break to cement a 25 basis-point rate cut from the Fed, or even to encourage the possibility of a jumbo cut,” said Andrea Gabellone, head of global equities at KBC Securities.
In yesterday’s trading session, Wall Street’s major indexes ended in the green, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 posting new record highs. Chip stocks climbed amid growing expectations for Fed rate cuts, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) rising over +5% and NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI) gaining more than +4%. Also, Amazon.com (AMZN) advanced over +1% after announcing plans to expand its same-day grocery delivery service to 2,300 cities by the end of the year. In addition, Intapp (INTA) surged more than +15% after the AI cloud company posted upbeat FQ4 results and announced a $150 million stock buyback. On the bearish side, CoreWeave (CRWV) tumbled more than -20% after the AI cloud vendor reported a wider-than-expected Q2 loss.
Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said on Wednesday that the central bank’s meetings this fall will be “live,” as he and his colleagues work to interpret mixed economic data and determine how best to adjust interest rates in response. “As we go into the fall, these are going to be some live meetings and we’re going to have to figure it out,” Goolsbee said. At the same time, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he still considers one interest rate cut appropriate in 2025 if the labor market remains solid.
Meanwhile, U.S. rate futures have priced in a 100% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut at September’s monetary policy meeting.
Today, all eyes are focused on the U.S. Producer Price Index, which is set to be released in a couple of hours. Economists, on average, forecast that the U.S. July PPI will stand at +0.2% m/m and +2.5% y/y, compared to the previous figures of unchanged m/m and +2.3% y/y.
The U.S. Core PPI will also be closely monitored today. Economists expect July figures to be +0.2% m/m and +2.9% y/y, compared to June’s numbers of unchanged m/m and +2.6% y/y.
U.S. Initial Jobless Claims data will be released today as well. Economists estimate this figure will come in at 225K, compared to last week’s number of 226K.
In addition, market participants will be looking toward a speech from Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin.
On the earnings front, notable companies like Applied Materials (AMAT) and Deere & Company (DE) are scheduled to report their quarterly figures today.
In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.209%, down -0.68%.
The Euro Stoxx 50 Index is up +0.22% this morning as investors digest a flurry of regional economic data while keeping their attention on geopolitical developments. Defense stocks rose on Thursday after U.S. officials downplayed the likelihood of a ceasefire deal in Ukraine being reached at Friday’s meeting between Trump and Putin. Insurance stocks also gained ground, supported by solid results from Admiral and Aviva. Eurostat said in an update on Thursday that the Eurozone’s gross domestic product growth for the second quarter stood at 0.1%, in line with a preliminary estimate. Separately, data from the Office for National Statistics showed that the U.K. economy slowed in the second quarter but still expanded, demonstrating resilience in the face of higher U.S. tariffs that weighed on exports and increased business taxes that dampened hiring. In addition, data showed that Eurozone industrial production fell more than expected in June, reflecting the impact of the pullback of tariff front-running. Meanwhile, investors are awaiting Friday’s summit between the U.S. and Russian leaders. U.S. President Donald Trump warned that he would impose “very harsh consequences” if Vladimir Putin failed to agree to a ceasefire in the war with Ukraine. In corporate news, Embracer Group AB (EMBRB.S.DX) plunged over -24% after the gaming company posted weaker-than-expected FQ1 operating profit. Also, Carlsberg AS (CARLB.C.DX) slumped more than -5% after the Danish brewer reported half-year profit and volume that missed estimates.
U.K. GDP (preliminary), France’s CPI, Eurozone’s GDP (second estimate), Eurozone’s Employment Change (preliminary), and Eurozone’s Industrial Production data were released today.
U.K. GDP has been reported at +0.3% q/q and +1.2% y/y in the second quarter, stronger than expectations of +0.1% q/q and +1.0% y/y.
U.K. June GDP stood at +0.4% m/m and +1.4% y/y, stronger than expectations of +0.2% m/m and +1.1% y/y.
The French July CPI rose +0.2% m/m and +1.0% y/y, in line with expectations.
Eurozone GDP came in at +0.1% q/q and +1.4% y/y in the second quarter, in line with expectations.
Eurozone Employment Change arrived at +0.1% q/q and +0.7% y/y in the second quarter, compared to expectations of +0.2% q/q and +0.6% y/y.
Eurozone June Industrial Production stood at -1.3% m/m and +0.2% y/y, weaker than expectations of -0.9% m/m and +1.7% y/y.
Asian stock markets today closed in the red. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed down -0.46%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed down -1.45%.
China’s Shanghai Composite Index gave up earlier gains and ended lower today as cautious investors took profits ahead of key economic data from the country. Steel and communication stocks underperformed on Thursday. Data released on Wednesday after the market closed showed that China’s new yuan loans turned negative in July for the first time in two decades, primarily due to the suspension of consumer trade-in programs and weaker property sales. New yuan loans shrank by 50 billion yuan ($6.97 billion) in July, coming in below even the most pessimistic analysts’ forecasts. The data followed China’s announcement earlier this week that it will provide interest subsidies to businesses in eight consumer service sectors, including catering and tourism, in a bid to boost services consumption amid a slowing economy. Barclays economists said in a note, “We think offering interest subsidies in targeted areas, instead of rate cuts, is an indication of the PBOC’s continued reservation to cut rates.” Meanwhile, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday that China is planning to mobilize companies owned by the central government in Beijing to purchase unsold homes from struggling property developers. Regulators plan to ask some of the largest state-owned enterprises and bad debt managers, including China Cinda Asset Management, to help clear the housing glut. In corporate news, Tencent gained about +0.7% in Hong Kong after the internet giant topped estimates in all reporting segments. Investor focus now turns to a flurry of China’s official data, scheduled for release on Friday, which will provide the most comprehensive view yet of the country’s economic momentum in July.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index ended lower today, retreating from the record high set in the prior session, as the yen strengthened amid concerns that the Bank of Japan may soon raise interest rates. Investors also seemed to take profits amid mounting concerns about the market overheating following the recent rally. Heavy-industry and electronics stocks led the declines on Thursday. Meanwhile, the Japanese currency rose the most in almost two weeks on Thursday after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the BOJ is falling “behind the curve” in tackling inflation and that he expected it to raise rates. Bessent’s comments on the BOJ mark a rare example of criticism of a foreign central bank’s policy decisions. The remarks contrast with those of BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda, who has repeatedly dismissed the notion that the central bank is moving too slowly to raise rates and might be late in forestalling too-high inflation. The BOJ, at its latest meeting in July, left rates unchanged but revised up its inflation projections and presented a more optimistic view of the economy, sustaining market expectations for a rate hike later this year. According to the latest Bloomberg survey of economists tracking the BOJ, about 42% of respondents said they anticipate a hike in October, while one-third expect a move in January. Investors now await Japan’s preliminary second-quarter GDP data, scheduled for release on Friday. The Nikkei Volatility Index, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed up +0.24% to 24.56.

In our second article on CVOL, we analyze how different skew configurations – negative or positive – might offer nuanced insights into investor expectations.
Before that, let’s examine what is CVOL and how it works. CVOL is a suite of implied volatility indices measuring 30-day forward volatility across all option strike prices of key futures markets. It’s based on a simple variance methodology to measure the volatility across all strikes for a given futures market.1
Volatility indices may be considered a sentiment indicator as they attempt to capture the view of a wide range of options-market participants. The skew ratio is one of CVOL’s five derivative metrics, and what it suggests about a futures market’s sentiment of direction.
CVOL Skew Ratio
To understand the skew ratio, let’s first explain what it may imply and then how it is calculated. The ratio may suggest the option market participants’ perception of an upward or downward direction of its underlying futures market. The skew ratio is either above or below 1.0. There are three possibilities of sentiment.
If the ratio is above 1.0 and moving higher, it implies the underlying futures market is perceived by options market participants for the price to more likely increase.
If the ratio is below 1.0 and moving lower, it suggests the options participants’ perception of the underlying futures market to more likely decline.
If the ratio is moving towards 1.0 from either a higher or lower level, it suggests the underlying futures market might be moving sideways, is in balance, or at least has no suggestion of direction.
The skew ratio is calculated by dividing the Up Variance (UpVar) of a futures market’s options by the Down Variance (DnVar) of a futures market’s options. UpVar and DnVar, which are also derivative metrics of the CVOL suite, measure volatility in the individual option wings. UpVar measures the volatility of out-of-the-money call options to determine upside risk. DnVar measures the volatility of out-of-the-money put options to determine the downside risk.2 Skew ratio takes these values and divides one by the other to determine the skewness of the volatility curve, which in this case UpVar being divided by DnVar. This creates a normalized ratio that shows how excess volatility may be in out-of-the-money calls versus puts or vice versa. Also, since it is expressed as a ratio, it is a useful tool for comparing skewness across asset classes.
Skew Ratio Examples
Figure 1 notes a seasonal tendency in both natural gas options and CVOL’s skew ratio; during the winter months (the grey bars), the natural gas skew ratio tends to rise as options market participants seek upside protection from sudden cold bursts that could drive up demand for the common source of heating energy. The skew ratio is also suggesting the options participants are expecting higher prices. This is notable in the cold flash of the winter of 2018/2019 when upside volatility quickly rose alongside the skew ratio due to sudden increased demand of heating.
Figure 1: Natural Gas Futures and CVOL Skew Ratio
Figure 2 demonstrates how the skew ratio generally tends to move in tandem with the direction of crude oil futures. In early May 2025, crude oil futures fell below $60 per barrel. Simultaneously the skew ratio was below 1, suggesting the crude oil option market perceived the market to trade sideways or perhaps continue its decline since peaking in January.
Figure 2: Front Month Crude Oil Futures & CVOL Skew Ratio
However, as Middle East tensions increased between May and June, crude oil prices rallied and the skew ratio climbed from below 1 to 1.8, showing market participants sought upside risk protection via options on expectations for the possibility of escalating tensions. Going forward, the skew ratio has maintained a level above 1, thus the options market suggests crude oil futures would maintain an elevated price relative to the April and May prices.
Examples of the Skew ratio and Convexity occurring simultaneously
As the previous examples focused on the skew ratio in isolation of other CVOL metrics, sometimes various CVOL metrics move in tandem, suggesting a more complicated or nuanced market environment. The examples below demonstrate movements in the skew ratio suggesting an options market perspective of market direction, while convexity (see convexity paper) shifts, proposing uncertainty of direction.
Figure 3 notes that as the Euro futures began to rally against the U.S. dollar in early March, the skew ratio simultaneously shifted quickly from 0.90 to 1.05 and convexity quickly spiked and then declined. As tariffs were introduced, the FX markets were in flux amid questions of how trade policies would be finalized and the implications of those policies/agreements. By April, convexity increased as more variance occurred at the wings of the strike prices versus at-the-money (ATM) strike price. So here, a rising convexity indicated the market was pricing in some sort of a move, with skew ratio indicating the probability of that move being likely to be to the upside in the underlying futures market
Figure 3: Front Month Euro Futures, CVOL Skew Ratio & Convexity
As fighting in Ukraine continued into October 2022, wheat futures prices rallied from about $7.50 per bushel in the summer to just over $9 per bushel by October (Figure 4). Wheat’s skew ratio also increased as a rally developed. Simultaneously, convexity was also increasing, implying the options market’s increasing uncertainty for the future direction of wheat futures. Fundamentally, this related to the Black Sea Grain Initiative agreement with a November 19 deadline to allow Ukraine to continue exporting food and fertilizer through three Black Sea shipping ports.3
Figure 4: Front Month SRW Wheat Futures, CVOL Skew Ratio & Convexity
Particularly interesting is the marked increase in convexity in early November while the skew ratio remained steady at elevated levels. This non-parallel move in convexity and skew ratio indicates that the risk premium was continually being purchased in both calls and puts (relative to at-the-money) as reflected by a rising convexity.
The skew ratio remaining stable while convexity jumped indicates that risk was being purchased in both out-of-the-money puts and calls as opposed to just calls. If the latter was true (i.e. continual purchase of protection for upside risk with the purchase of out-of-the-money calls), the skew ratio would have risen as well. While the skew ratio has the power of indicating potential directionality in the market, convexity is still an important metric to follow for gauging uncertainty and price of risk in out-of-the-money options.
Figure 5 shows front-month copper futures’ skew ratio reacting to the back-and-forth news cycle surrounding the proposed copper tariffs in April. This led to market participants seeking upside protection due to concerns of the impact on copper-related supply chains as the metal has a variety of applications including construction, wiring, the energy transition and solar panels. Simultaneously, convexity also increased, suggesting market participants may have conflicting sentiments about copper.
Figure 5: Front Month High Grade Copper Futures, CVOL Skew Ratio, & Convexity
Summary
The skew ratio is derived from volatility of OTM calls relative to the volatility of OTM puts. It can note market sentiment of a given futures market. Moving above 1.0 implies a bullish sentiment while moving below 1.0 suggests a bearish sentiment. It helps to view the skew ratio in relation with other CVOL metrics. As noted above, it’s possible for the skew ratio to offer directional market sentiment of an underlying futures market, while convexity can also suggest general uncertainty for future direction. This would suggest conflicting views of market sentiment. Examining these metrics in the context of market fundamentals can be helpful.

ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) -TRADING DAY
Making sense of the forces driving global markets
By Jamie McGeever, Markets Columnist
Stocks rose around the world on Wednesday, and bond yields and the dollar fell, as comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent fueled traders' bets that the Fed will cut interest rates next month, perhaps even by half a percentage point.
More on that below. In my column today I suggest that what's giving Fed Chair Jerome Powell his biggest headache right now is not the pressure or attacks from U.S. President Donald Trump, but the inconclusive economic data.
If you have more time to read, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today.
1. Fed cut seen near certain after inflation data, Bessentcomments 2. U.S. embeds trackers in AI chip shipments to catchdiversions to China, sources say 3. Just in time? Manufacturers turn to AI to weather tariffstorm 4. China July bank loans unexpectedly contract for firsttime in 20 years 5. Stablecoins fuel liquidity, not yet money: Mike Dolan
Today's Key Market Moves
* FX: Dollar falls again, lowest in nearly three weeks onindex basis. Biggest G10 FX mover is sterling, up 0.5%. * STOCKS: MSCI All Country, Canada, Japan, S&P 500 andNasdaq hit new highs. Chinese stocks now up 16 of last 20sessions, Wall Street's VIX volatility index falls to 2025 low. * SHARES/SECTORS: Beaten-down healthcare, and basicmaterials sectors lead Wall Street rally, both up around 1.7%. * BONDS: U.S. yields down across the curve, as much as 6bps at the long end. The 'MOVE' implied volatility index fallsto lowest since January 2022. * COMMODITIES: Oil falls to lowest in more than twomonths. Brent crude touches $65/bbl, WTI dips below $62/bbl.
Today's Talking Points:
* Fed policy. In the realms of market pricing, a rate cut next month is now a nailed-on certainty, with traders putting the chances of a quarter point cut at 99.9%.
This wager was strengthened by comments from Bessent, who told Bloomberg News a 50-basis point cut was possible.
Bessent's comments are the latest in a growing list of verbal interventions - or outright political interference - from the Trump administration in the business and economics arena it traditionally steers clear of, like the Fed, non-partisan institutions, and private sector companies and banks.
* Trump's Fed nominations. Bessent said early on Wednesday that no fewer than 11 candidates were being considered to replace Powell, whose term expires in May (or, earlier, if he is fired or resigns).
The president later shortened that list to three or four.
Interestingly, absent from Bessent's list was current Council of Economic Advisers Stephen Miran, nominated to fill an open Fed board seat with a term that ends in January.
* Trump-Putin meeting. The U.S. and Russian leaders are scheduled to meet in Alaska on Friday, a face-to-face which Ukraine's allies hope will see Trump urge Putin to agree a ceasefire without selling out Kyiv's interests or carving up its territory.
Trump, Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskiy and European leaders met in a last-ditch videoconference on Wednesday to lay out Ukraine's red lines, a call Trump said was ""very friendly"".
France's Emmanuel Macron said Trump was ""very clear"" that he wants to achieve a ceasefire in Alaska.
Fed more hamstrung by murky data than Trump interference
It's widely believed that U.S. President Donald Trump's insistence on lower interest rates is what's making life most difficult for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues. But what's causing the biggest headache for Fed officials is, in fact, probably more prosaic: economic data.
The key challenges facing Powell were encapsulated perfectly on Tuesday by the release of an inconclusive U.S. inflation readout followed by Trump's latest verbal attack – and threats of a ""major lawsuit.""
Politics aside, most Fed officials agree that rates will fall this year, with the median ""dot plot"" in the Fed's June Summary of Economic Projections pointing to 50 basis points of easing through December. Traders are betting heavily that the first move will be in September.
But it's tough to justify that confidence based purely on economic data. While some indicators suggest policy should be eased sooner rather than later, others indicate that would be a high-risk move. Looking at the ""totality of the data,"" to borrow a phrase from Powell, there is no clear signal either way.
PLENTY NOISE, FEW SIGNALS
Consider the latest U.S. inflation and employment reports, the two most important data sets. On their own, they don't appear soft enough to warrant the Fed trimming rates right now, but they also aren't firm enough to dispel the notion that policy easing is only a question of ""when"" not ""if.""
Annual headline CPI inflation held steady in July at 2.7%, contrary to an expected rise, with month-on-month increases in line with forecasts. But annual core inflation rose more than expected to 3.1%, the highest level since February and still meaningfully above the Fed's 2% target.
Economists calculate that durable goods prices rose 1.7% in the first six months of the year – the biggest six-month rise since 1987, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic. They warn there is likely more of that to come as Trump's tariffs kick in.
""July's CPI data are probably more worrying under the surface than in the headlines, and we expect the upward pressure to goods inflation to build in the coming months,"" James Pomeroy, a global economist at HSBC, wrote on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, last week's employment report showed job growth in July was much weaker than anticipated, and, more importantly, downward revisions to the previous two months were among the biggest on record.
But these ominous signals were offset by accelerating wage growth, an increase in hours worked, and a meager rise in the unemployment rate. Hardly signs of a shaky labor market.
Nevertheless, markets focused more on the softer elements in the jobs data, suggesting investors think the Fed's bar to easing is much lower than the bar to standing pat. Indeed, the rates market is now pricing in a near-100% chance of a cut at the U.S. central bank's September 16-17 meeting.
RISK MANAGEMENT
But markets may be getting ahead of themselves.
Powell has indicated that a rise in the unemployment rate is needed for the Fed to act. But that rate is potentially being distorted by post-pandemic labor supply issues - employers' reluctance to fire workers and Trump's immigration policies are limiting the number of people looking for work.
Regardless, cutting before seeing a meaningful rise in the unemployment rate would be tough to justify, creating a significant communications problem for Powell.
And on a more fundamental level, as economist Phil Suttle noted on Tuesday, is preparing to cut rates at full employment just as inflation is accelerating good risk management?
This is a particularly apt question when looking at financial markets: the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, gold, and bitcoin are all near record highs, and corporate bond spreads are the tightest in years. This hardly looks like a restrictive policy environment.
In that light, patience and caution would appear justified, especially given the added risk of appearing to buckle under Trump's political pressure. If the Fed wants to cut, Powell could use some cover. Unfortunately for him, he's unlikely to find that in this noisy data.
What could move markets tomorrow?
* Australia unemployment (July) * China's JD.com earnings (Q2) * UK GDP (Q2, preliminary) * UK industrial production (June) * UK trade (June) * Euro zone GDP (Q2, flash estimate) * Euro zone unemployment (Q2) * Euro zone industrial production (June) * U.S. weekly jobless claims * U.S. producer price inflation (July) * U.S. Fed officials on the stump: Richmond Fed PresidentThomas Barkin, St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem * U.S. earnings - Cisco Systems, Deere & Company

But not for every stock. Even some of the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) seemingly safe dividend stocks have been upended, even if only because so many investors would rather own far more exciting growth stocks at this time.
Veteran investors know the time to step into quality names is when they're down. Time will take care of the rest.
With that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of three solid dividend-paying S&P 500 stocks that income-minded investors might want to buy while they're still on sale and hold forever.
1. Merck
There's no denying Merck(NYSE: MRK) has become a bit too dependent on its cancer-fighting wonder drug Keytruda. The immunotherapy now accounts for half of the pharmaceutical company's total revenue. But, with its key U.S. patents set to expire in 2028 while its European patents are slated to expire in 2031, the company's struggle to come up with anything to fully replace these jeopardized sales is a big reason shares are down 39% from last year's peak. Well, that and headwinds for its HPV vaccine Gardasil in China.
The thing is, the stock sellers may have overshot their target, failing to recognize just how promising this pharmaceutical giant's pipeline actually is.
Take MK-1022 as an example. Although the non-small cell lung cancer market it's addressing is a relatively crowded one, according to several analysts, this antibody-drug conjugate capable of delivering chemotherapy directly to diseased cells could, at its peak, produce annual sales of around $5 billion. The company's cholesterol drug MK-0616 could do just as well, and like MK-1022, is showing great promise in late-stage trials.
All told, Merck contends it's got as many as 20 drugs with blockbuster potential in the works that are collectively capable of driving more than $50 billion in annual sales by the mid-2030s. Approval and sales are not guaranteed, but that's more than Keytruda would have ever been able to produce on its own.
There will certainly be some developmental stumbles and setbacks along the way. With shares priced at less than 9 times this year's expected earnings, though -- and with its dividend yield pumped up to 4% -- all of Merck's current and future challenges are already priced in.
2. Target
General merchandise retailer Target(NYSE: TGT) has been out of its element for some time now. In a normal, reasonably healthy economic environment, consumers are willing to pay its sometimes slightly higher prices for a premium experience that rival Walmart can't quite match. Given the inflation-riddled economic lethargy the country (as well as the rest of the world) has suffered since 2022, though, Target's struggled to draw its usual crowd. It's also been caught in the country's DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) fracas. Its first-quarter same-store sales dip of 3.8% extended a long streak of rather persistent weakness. That's why the stock's down 60% from its late-2021 pandemic-prompted peak.
What if, however, the domestic economy was going to defy the apparent odds and ease back into a place of economic strength rather than sliding into a long-expected recession?
Don't rule out the possibility. While plenty of people are lamenting the high cost of everything, the Conference Board said its consumer confidence index rose two points in July. And although accounting firm EY expects the country's GDP growth to cool to a pace of 1.5% this year en route to 1.4% next year, that's still growth. Let's also not forget that the second quarter's initial GDP growth estimate of 3% handily topped estimates of 2.5% even if it was tariff uncertainty behind much of it. Growth is still growth.
The dark cloud of future tariffs and the prices they raise is still in place, but even then it increasingly looks like President Donald Trump is using tariffs as a negotiating tool to get what he wants rather than as a means of raising revenue. Apple's iPhone, for instance, was recently made exempt from semiconductor tariffs in exchange for CEO Tim Cook's promise to invest in more American manufacturing of the device's components.
It's admittedly not the easiest of bets to make at this time. Most factors seems to still be working against Target's unique ""cheap chic"" premium-value approach to merchandising. And maybe the U.S. economy will remain tepid.
As the old adage goes, though, expect it when you least expect. Most people didn't expect 2002's or 2009's economic recoveries either until they were well underway. Time really does eventually heal all wounds. Know that the company is also (finally) making some meaningful strategic changes.
And, priced at about 14 times this year's expected earnings and with a forward-looking dividend yield of 4.3%, investors are being paid pretty well for the minimal amount of risk they are taking with Target.
3. PepsiCo
Finally, add PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) to your list of S&P 500 dividend stocks to buy and hold forever while you can plug into its forward-looking yield of just under 4% as I write this. The 26% setback it's suffered since its 2023 high has likely run its course and is ready to reverse.
The difference between this stock's performance and rival Coca-Cola's is stark, but understandable. Unlike Coke, PepsiCo owns and operates the majority of its own bottling facilities, where much of the cost of the beverage business lies. When the cost of everything ranging from commodities to logistics to utilities started to rise in earnest a couple of years back, it took a sizable bite out of a bottom line that's already built on paper-thin profit margins. And price increases weren't necessarily an easy solution.
Perhaps PepsiCo's bigger challenge over the course of the past three years, however, was on the food front, which is even less fiscally flexible than the beverage business. See, PepsiCo also owns Frito-Lay, which is parent to iconic snack chip brands like Cheetos, Doritos, and, of course, Lay's potato chips. It also owns Quaker Oats, a brand that's about more than just a hot bowl for breakfast. Consumers have been particularly cost-conscious when it comes to these sorts of groceries.
As is the case with Target's business, though, PepsiCo's company-specific headwinds may be about to ease if not outright cease. And not just because of the potentially improving economic backdrop resulting from the waning inflation the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee believes will continue cooling through 2027. PepsiCo's also adapting to the new normal. Just within the past few months PepsiCo has unveiled several healthier snack chip options as well as beverage choices like a prebiotic cola. Meanwhile, the company's embraced technology to tackle tricky tasks like optimizing its supply chain or making its distribution centers more efficient.
None of these will necessarily reignite sales growth in a major way on their own. All of them, however, position PepsiCo for to take advantage of consumers' rekindled splurging and ever-growing healthy-snacking movement.

The cryptocurrency market is rallying again, with total market capitalization climbing to an unprecedented $4.2 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko. That’s a 3% jump in just the last 24 hours and a new record high for crypto.
Naturally, trading volume exploded, climbing 25.73% to $239.35 billion, signaling renewed investor appetite across the board. Even Monero, which tanked yesterday on fears of a 51% network attack, is in the green today.
Bitcoin is, as usual, leading the way, once again rising above $120,000. But it’s altcoins stealing the show today. The Altcoin Season Index on CoinMarketCap has risen to 39, up from 29 last month, which suggests an early-stage rotation into alternative cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin dominance wanes. What are traders rotating into you ask? Within the top 10, it's Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano showing strong signals.
Ethereum (ETH) price: Testing all-time high
Ethereum, which had previously lost a great deal of momentum following its 2021 peak, is now back in the spotlight as the “public company crypto treasury” craze spreads to ETH.
Massive buys from publicly traded companies like the Consensys-linked Sharplink and Tom Lee’s BitMine have buoyed Ethereum prices. ETH is up a whopping 6% today, just shy of its 2021 all-time high above $4,800.
On Myriad—a prediction market developed by Decrypt’s parent company Dastan—predictors are confident that ETH has the strength to top $5K this year. Just last week, the odds were even, but sentiment on Myriad has flipped resoundingly bullish. Users are now placing the odds at 87% that Ethereum hits $5,000 before the end of the year.
A separate market on Myriad shows traders are widely expecting ETH to hit $5K before dipping all the way back down to $3,500 this year, placing those odds at nearly 80%.
Do the charts agree? At the moment, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is demonstrating remarkable strength across multiple technical indicators.
The Average Directional Index, or ADX, for ETH is at 46, which confirms an exceptionally strong uptrend. ADX measures trend strength on a scale from 0 to 100, where readings above 25 indicate a confirmed trend, and above 40 signals powerful directional momentum. At 46, ETH's uptrend has serious conviction.
Ethereum’s exponential moving averages also paint a bullish picture. EMAs take the average price of an asset over a set period of time. ETH’s 50-day and 200-day EMAs are currently providing dynamic support well below current prices. This expanding gap between short and long-term moving averages, known as bullish divergence, typically occurs in strong uptrends and gives buyers multiple support levels during any pullbacks. Traders see this setup as a green light for trend-following strategies, and the bigger the spike gets, the more momentum the trend has.
The Relative Strength Index, or RSI, for ETH is at 79, pushing into overbought territory above 70. That normally triggers caution among traders. But during powerful bull runs, assets can remain overbought for extended periods. This reading suggests short-term profit-taking might emerge without posing an immediate threat to the overall momentum.
And not one to be left out, Solana is turning heads today as well. SOL is up 7% over the past 24 hours, testing the psychologically significant price point of $200.
The ""Ethereum killer,"" as some of its proponents refer to it, is showing strong technical signals that suggest further upside, potentially breaking from the sideways-trading pattern it’s held since its dip in March.
This recent spike has increased the optimism among Myriad traders as well. On Myriad, the odds of Solana hitting a new all-time high above $293 this year have jumped from 30% last week to 50% today. That 20% swing is indicative of the sentiment across the broader market as SOL looks to keep pace with the gains of its biggest competitor in ETH.
And the price data supports the bullish outlook.
Solana’s ADX is now at 23, approaching the crucial 25 threshold that confirms an established trend. Rising ADX during upward price moves validates the trend’s legitimacy. Traders often watch this level closely, since crossing above an ADX of 25 usually marks a transition from choppy trading to sustained trend. With momentum building, SOL could become an appealing trade to those watching the charts.
The EMA configuration supports the bullish view, with the 50-day EMA providing support around $170 while price action trades comfortably above both moving averages. This positive alignment typically indicates sustained buying pressure, with the gap between price and EMAs providing a cushion for any short-term pullbacks.
The coin entered a golden cross formation in mid-July, but the gap between the two moving averages is still small, which means there is not really enough momentum for big price swings in either direction going too far from the averages.
RSI at 64 sits in what traders call the ""power zone""—strong enough to indicate genuine momentum but not yet extended enough to trigger automatic profit-taking. Judging by this indicator alone, there is space for approximately 10-15% additional upside potential before overbought conditions emerge. Of course, this doesn’t mean that will happen, but a technical analysis of the charts would suggest such a price movement would still be healthy and expected.
Strong resistance: $220 (technical target from measured move)
Cardano (ADA) price: Testing resistance
Cardano is showing impressive strength with the ADA token currently trading at $0.868, up 3.09% and actively testing the resistance level marked by the green dotted line on the chart below at around $0.87-$0.90.
This critical level has capped at least three previous rallies, making the current test particularly significant for momentum traders.
The ADX reading at 24 is just below the 25 trend confirmation threshold, suggesting ADA is on the verge of establishing a strong directional move. When ADX crosses above 25, it typically signals the end of consolidation and the beginning of trending behavior—a setup that has traders paying close attention.
However, a weak ADX near a strong resistance is usually not what traders like to see.
The 50-200 EMA spread remains positive with both averages providing support below current prices. The 50-day EMA near $0.75 acts as immediate dynamic support, while the 200-day provides a floor around $0.70. This stacked configuration gives bulls confidence that any pullbacks will find buyers at multiple levels, but there is not really enough of a gap between the two timeframes to notice any strong bullish (or bearish) trend.
RSI at 65 indicates healthy bullish momentum without being overextended. This reading leaves room for continued gains—altcoins can reach very high readings during strong uptrends. The current level suggests the rally has fuel left in the tank, particularly if the resistance break is confirmed.
Overall, indicators point to bullish behavior, however, the readings say this trend is weak. Not bearish, but very prone to corrections along the way.
The resistance near $0.9-$1 will be crucial for the price trend. When it failed to break past that timeline, the coin had a similarly bullish reading.
Key Levels:
Immediate support: $0.83 (recent breakout level)
Strong support: $0.75 (50-day EMA zone)
Immediate resistance: $0.90 (green dotted line - current test)
Next resistance: $1.00 (major psychological target)

It also contains new retirement account provisions that could affect how Americans plan for their golden years.

Read Next: Clever Ways To Save Money That Actually Work in 2025
As the landmark bill was recently passed, there are a few implications it could have for your retirement savings plan. Here’s a look at what changes are coming your way from the federal government that could change the way you approach your nest egg.
As the name would suggest, this is a big bill that just got signed into law and covers a lot of financial ground, especially for retirees and those planning on collecting Social Security benefits. Here are a few quick key takeaways from the new legislation to consider:
-
Despite some speculation, the OBBBA does not eliminate the taxation of Social Security benefits, but rather offers a deduction of $6,000 for taxpayers aged 65 or older and $12,000 for joint filers from 2025 to 2028, regardless of whether they receive Social Security benefits. This tax break can lower the taxable income for eligible retirees, potentially resulting in lower taxes on their Social Security benefits for many recipients.
-
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) now estimates that the tax rate cuts and increased senior deduction in OBBBA could accelerate the insolvency of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, potentially leading to benefit cuts to the tune of 24% in the future if no other solutions are found by 2032.
-
If the expanded senior standard deduction and other temporary measures within the OBBBA are made permanent, the projected benefit cuts could become even larger.
-
There are IRA and 401(k) plan enhancements as the legislation increases contribution limits and provides more flexibility for certain employer-sponsored plans in the form of catch-up contribution allowances or annual contribution limits.
Find Out: What Trump’s New Tax Law Means for Upper-Middle-Class Families in 2025
Many Americans will now likely receive a break on their taxes owed. This means they would be able to channel more money into retirement savings accounts such as traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs or 401(k) plans.
“Retirement planning fundamentally comes down to having sufficient resources to make work optional,” said Brett Horowitz, principal and wealth manager at Evensky & Katz / Foldes Financial Wealth Management. “The Tax Cuts & Jobs Act provisions, combined with new deductions for tip income, overtime pay and seniors over 65, could significantly improve retirement outcomes for Americans.”
Those who benefited from the cuts in the original Tax Cuts & Jobs Act will continue to enjoy these cuts, allowing them to continue saving the same amount of money for retirement as they had been.
“Retirement modeling depends on clear inputs and stable variables,” he continued. “The less uncertainty in tax policy, the more accurately we can project success rates. When these changes take effect — pending Senate approval — we’ll be able to deliver much better news to clients about their retirement timeline.”
Horowitz believes that if Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” hadn’t passed, it could have negatively affected Americans’ abilities to save for retirement.
“There’s a profound psychological difference between telling someone they can retire earlier than expected versus having to extend their working years,” he said. “The former energizes people about their financial future; the latter can feel overwhelming. These tax provisions create the conditions where more Americans can realistically achieve a comfortable retirement.”
Savvy long-term investment strategies should always take taxes into account, so changes to tax laws can shift these strategies.
“Smart investing isn’t actually about chasing the highest gross returns — it’s about maximizing what clients actually keep after taxes and expenses, and this tax bill addresses some issues there,” Horowitz said. “While we can control costs through low-fee funds, tax efficiency requires a more nuanced approach that varies by everyone’s personal circumstances.
“Higher tax rates push us toward tax-free municipal bonds and tax-efficient ETFs in taxable accounts, while we place tax-inefficient investments in retirement accounts,” he continued. “This ‘tax location’ strategy can significantly impact net returns, even if it means accounts perform differently.”
No matter where you plan to retire, it’s good to know that the OBBBA has increased the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap. It has gone up to $40,000, with some limitations for higher earners, which can potentially provide relief for retirees in high-tax states.
“Two provisions in the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act have created the most anxiety for our clients — the SALT deduction cap and estate tax exemptions,” Horowitz said. “Both are getting significant relief.”
The increase in the SALT deduction cap means retirees will face less of a penalty if they choose to spend their golden years in a state with higher income taxes.
“The SALT deduction increase from $10,000 to $40,000 will reshape where people choose to live and retire,” Horowitz said. “We’ve already seen migration patterns shift dramatically since 2017, with high-tax states losing residents to states like Florida and Texas. This change reduces the penalty for living in high-income-tax states, though it doesn’t eliminate the advantage of no-tax states entirely.”
Estate planning strategies will also change for many Americans.
“On the estate side, the current $13.99 million exemption was set to drop to $7.14 million in 2026 — a reduction that had wealthy clients scrambling to implement complex gifting strategies and trust structures,” Horowitz said. “The permanent increase to $15 million per person, or $30 million for couples, provides enormous relief for families in that middle tier.”
This is particularly important because of state-level complications, Horowitz continued.
“Take New York, where you could face no federal estate tax, but still owe state estate taxes on estates between $7.16 million and $13.99 million,” he said. “The interplay between federal and state rules makes domicile planning critical.”
The “One Big Beautiful Bill” looks to make estate planning less complex for many people.
“For clients who’ve already implemented sophisticated estate planning strategies, those structures remain valuable,” Horowitz said. “But for families with estates under the new thresholds, this eliminates the pressure to make rushed gifting decisions or create complex trusts simply to avoid tax cliffs.”
Overall, Horowitz believes the bill will make retirement planning easier. “The permanent nature of these changes finally gives families the certainty to make long-term decisions about where to live, how to structure their wealth and when to implement estate planning strategies,” he said.

That date marks the end of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit under U.S. President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” signed into law in July. The move effectively shortens what was, under the President Joe Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, a generous incentive slated to run through 2032. Now, with the clock ticking, the U.S. EV market is bracing for a major shift.
In this article, we’ll explore what the Sept. 30 deadline means for Tesla, how it could reshape U.S. EV demand, and why investors should mark their calendars for what may be one of the most pivotal dates for TSLA stock in 2025.
Tesla is a prominent innovator dedicated to accelerating the global transition to sustainable energy. The Elon Musk-led powerhouse designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems, and energy storage products. It also offers maintenance, installation, operation, charging, insurance, financial, and various other services related to its products. In addition, the company is increasingly focusing on products and services centered around AI, robotics, and automation. TSLA’s market cap currently stands at $1.1 trillion.
Shares of the EV maker have dropped 15.8%on a year-to-date basis. Tesla shares have been on a steady upward trend since Aug. 5. Several factors have supported the stock’s gains. First of all, there’s risk-on sentiment across markets, driven by Federal Reserve rate-cut expectations, easing global trade tensions, and a strong Q2 earnings season in the U.S. U.S. EV demand also appears strong in the third quarter, though this is likely driven by the impending loss of the $7,500 federal tax credit in September.
Tesla Rides Sales Surge Ahead of Tax Credit Expiration
The third-quarter EV buying frenzy is underway. The main reason is that consumers are rushing to purchase EVs ahead of a looming deadline to claim tax credits of up to $7,500. As a reminder, U.S. President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” signed in July, eliminates the tax credits for new, used, and leased EVs after Sept. 30.
The tax credits, worth up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used ones, are designed to make EV purchases more financially appealing to consumers. The EV tax incentives were among several policies implemented by the Biden administration to help reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, with the transportation sector being the nation’s largest emitter. Notably, under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, the tax credits were initially set to be available to consumers through 2032.
“We’re expecting Q3 may be [a] record for EV sales because of the tax incentives going away,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, a senior analyst at Cox Automotive. The firm’s data revealed that consumers bought nearly 130,100 new EVs in July, marking the second-highest monthly sales on record, trailing only roughly 136,000 sold in December. Streaty said that July’s figures represent a 26.4% jump from June and an increase of nearly 20% compared to the same month last year. In addition, EVs made up roughly 9.1% of total passenger vehicle sales in July, the highest monthly share on record. All of this indicates that the impending expiration of the federal tax credit is fueling a surge in demand this quarter.
Analysts noted that dealers are leveraging the upcoming deadline to create a sense of urgency among consumers and drive sales. Tesla’s homepage now displays the message “$7,500 Federal Tax Credit Ending” in bold lettering. Beneath it, the automaker added, “Limited Inventory — Take Delivery Now.”
Meanwhile, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja stated during the Q2 earnings call that the company is prioritizing building and delivering as many vehicles as possible in the U.S. before the tax credits expire. The company has recently extended the estimated wait time for its best-selling Model Y to four to six weeks, up from the previous one-to-three-week range. It’s an indication of increased order activity.
On the back of higher U.S. demand, Wall Street projects Tesla will deliver 430,000 vehicles globally in the third quarter. That represents an increase from the 384,000 vehicles delivered in the second quarter but remains below the 463,000 sold in Q3 2024.
How Could EV Tax Credit Elimination Impact Tesla?
The federal electric vehicle tax credit program has played a major role in boosting Tesla’s U.S. sales. With the expiration of these credits approaching, Tesla could soon be selling vehicles at effectively higher prices for consumers. And this applies not only to Tesla, but also to other automakers selling EVs, with analysts warning it could trigger a sharp drop in U.S. EV sales in the fourth quarter and beyond. Notably, there are already precedents for how similar policy changes have impacted EV adoption, as seen in Germany, where EV sales dropped sharply following the end of subsidies in late 2023. So, the first obvious implication is a decline in consumer demand.
Of course, automakers could lower prices to help offset the loss of tax subsidies. For instance, Ford (F) cut prices on its Mustang Mach-E after it lost a $3,750 tax credit in January 2024, while General Motors (GM) provided a $7,500 incentive on models that lost the credits at that time. In Tesla’s case, this would impact its unit gross profits, as average vehicle selling prices would have to drop substantially to offset the loss of the EV tax credit. And this comes at a time when its average selling prices have already been under pressure in recent quarters due to intense competition.
With that, regardless of Tesla’s response, the elimination of EV tax credits represents a significant headwind for the company. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, during the Q2 earnings call, warned of tough times ahead for the company as incentives such as the EV tax credit phase out in the U.S. “We probably could have a few rough quarters,” Musk said.
Meanwhile, the company is expected to launch its more affordable vehicle, which Musk described as resembling a Model Y, to the public in the fourth quarter. On the one hand, the vehicle is likely to provide some support to delivery volumes. On the other hand, the affordable model could cannibalize Model Y sales since it is essentially a stripped-down version of the latter. With that, monitoring delivery figures will be key to assessing the potential impact of cannibalization. Anyway, I expect a decline in deliveries, both sequentially and year-over-year, in Q4.
Over the past few months, analysts have gradually reduced their estimates for Tesla’s fourth-quarter top and bottom lines. They currently expect Tesla’s adjusted EPS for Q4 to fall 45.5% year-over-year to $0.36, while revenue is projected to remain largely unchanged at $25.81 billion.
What Do Analysts Expect for TSLA Stock?
Wall Street analysts remain split on Tesla, with the stock carrying a consensus “Hold” rating. Among the 41 analysts covering the stock, 12 rate it as a “Strong Buy,” two as a “Moderate Buy,” 17 recommend holding, and 10 assign a “Strong Sell” rating. TSLA stock is currently trading above its average price target of $299.28.

Overview: HEADLINE
It was a matter of time, with governments racing to clinch the first Mars laurels, that private companies would start offering rides to the red planet.
Italy's Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI) became the first client who's signed on to send scientific experiments aboard SpaceX's first commercial flights to Mars — where Elon Musk's space company has yet to land.
""Italy is going to Mars!"" ASI President Teodoro Valente announced on social media, with Italian news outlet ANSA reporting the agency's payloads will feature a plant growth experiment, a weather surveillance station and a radiation sensor for data collection.
""#MadeinItaly on #Mars,"" Italian Industry Minister Adolfo Urso celebrated, while SpaceX President and COO Gwynne Shotwell declared open season for the company's Mars launch bookings.
""Get on board! We are going to Mars! SpaceX is now offering Starship services to the red planet,"" she said on the X social media platform.
Notably, no timeline was given for the launch dates of these flights — with the odds of short-term travel to Mars increasingly under question.
Both parties to the arrangement have been committed to Mars ventures.
ASI barely just made headlines at the end of last month, when it inked a deal to develop the first human lunar outpost with Thales Alenia Space — building on the Italian space agency's 2020 partnership with NASA to coordinate bringing astronauts back to the Moon under the Artemis Accords. Coming in third after France and Germany, Italy contributed 800 million euros ($935 million) — or 15.8% - to the European Space Agency's 7.68 billion euro adopted budget for 2025. It's also been heavily involved in the ExoMars mission, which seeks to launch the Rosalind Franklin rover around 2028.
It's meanwhile at once surprising and predictable that SpaceX, which made a name for itself out of commercializing space launches, is already leaping to book Mars excursions. A longtime NASA contractor, the firm's also been offering satellite launch services to Eutelsat's OneWeb and AST SpaceMobile.
A few days back, Amazon, whose chief Jeff Bezos owns his own rival rocket company Blue Origin, tapped Musk's company for the second time and launched its fourth batch of Kuiper satellites on SpaceX's 100th mission this year. And Musk has certainly been vocal about his plans to pursue Mars colonization, once echoed by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration.
But there's no escaping one (nearly 400-feet) problem. SpaceX's reusable mammoth rocket Starship — the key to materializing Musk's Mars ambitions — has had a long-storied string of publicized test flight failures this year amid technical and refueling woes. We're about to see during its next attempt later this month if it's overcome these challenges in the three months since its last explosive stint. That's skipping over a June incident when a Starship rocket exploded while being loaded with methane and liquid oxygen propellant ahead of its launch — due, Musk later said, citing preliminary data, to problems in the payload bay.
Critically for our conversation, Starship is not yet rated crew-ready, and Musk himself has now pushed back his initial targets, flagging a ""slight change"" of a crewed flight during the next window in 2026, when Earth and the red planet are optimally aligned for travel to Mars.
""Slight chance of Starship flight to Mars crewed by Optimus in Nov/Dec next year. A lot needs to go right for that,"" he said last week on social media.
""More likely, first flight without humans in ~3.5 years, next flight ~5.5 years with humans. Mars city self-sustaining in 20 to 30 years.""
It may seem too early to start selling tickets to Mars, it's no secret that launch capacity worldwide has been struggling to keep up with demand for space access. Time will tell whether ASI's enthusiasm was ultimately strategic or premature.

Experts warn the changes could significantly impact older Americans who rely on Medicare Advantage — the private coverage sometimes called Medicare Part C — with considerable implications for retirement planning.
Major insurers, including Humana, CVS Health Aetna and UnitedHealthcare, have all announced plans to scale back their Medicare Advantage operations in 2025 and 2026.
Last May, CVS CFO Tom Cowhey said that the insurer could drop 1 in 10 — or roughly 600,000 — of its Medicare Advantage members by the end of 2025 in an effort to improve margins.

""The goal for next year is margin over membership,"" Cowhey said. ""Could we lose up to 10% of our existing Medicare members next year? That's entirely possible. And that's OK, because we need to get this business back on track.""
Humana has followed suit, announcing plans earlier this year to drop approximately 550,000 Medicare Advantage members by the end of 2025.
UnitedHealthcare, which until recently has pushed to expand its Medicare Advantage membership, announced plans last month to drop more than 600,000 members by the end of 2026.
""We are seeing higher-than-expected medical cost increases, particularly in outpatient care,"" UnitedHealthcare CEO Tim Noel said on the company's second-quarter earnings call. ""The American health system's long-standing cost problem is accelerating.""
Together, Humana, CVS Health Aetna and UnitedHealthcare provide coverage to 58% of all Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, nearly 20 million people in total, according to KFF, a nonprofit health policy research, polling and news organization.
Medicare Advantage plans gained popularity through $0 monthly premiums and expanded benefits compared to traditional Medicare. The program appealed to healthy beneficiaries and, until recently, delivered strong profits for insurers through generous government payments and upcoding practices. But rising medical costs and tighter oversight are pressuring margins, prompting some insurers to rethink their approach.
Medicare experts like Melinda Caughill, the co-founder of 65 Incorporated, say that the shift could have major implications for financial advisors and the retirees they serve.
Advisors should understand the two paths that could shape the experience of retirees enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans.
For beneficiaries who remain on Medicare Advantage plans going forward, they're likely to see fewer benefits, higher costs in the form of premiums and copays and greater prior authorization requirements.
""Prior Authorization means your doctor is not in charge of your health care needs,"" Caughill said. ""Your doctor just advocates for you to an insurance company. Ultimately, the insurance company decides what you get or what you don't get.""
Medicare Advantage insurers made nearly 50 million prior authorization determinations in 2023, according to KFF. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, meanwhile, conducted fewer than 400,000 prior authorization reviews for traditional Medicare beneficiaries in that same time period.
Nearly all Medicare Advantage enrollees (99%) must get prior authorization for certain services — typically high-cost care like inpatient hospital stays, skilled nursing facility care and chemotherapy.
Once retirees enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, leaving it isn't always simple. In most cases, beneficiaries can only switch back to traditional Medicare during specific enrollment periods, and doing so often means losing access to certain supplemental coverage options.
Medigap policies, which help cover out-of-pocket costs under original Medicare, may require medical underwriting if purchased after the initial enrollment window — making it more expensive or, in some cases, even impossible for older or less healthy individuals to qualify. For many retirees, that creates a barrier to exiting a Medicare Advantage plan once they're already in it.
For the small number of members who are dropped from their plans, Caughill calls the next step the ""nuclear option.""
""When you are dropped from a Medicare Advantage policy based on no action or choice of your own, you get a Medicare do-over, meaning you can get a Medigap policy with no medical underwriting,"" Caughill said.
While Medigap plans aren't strictly necessary, they can help cover costs that traditional Medicare doesn't.
""You can get original Medicare by itself, but then that means you'll pay 20% of every bill with no spending limit in sight. But astonishingly, the number of people who wind up doing that when they're really sick is so huge that the government wrote a study on it, because they'd rather pay 20% of everything and at least get the care they need than remain on Medicare Advantage,"" Caughill said. ""So people need to understand that these decisions are very often long-lasting. You can't just all of a sudden say, 'Ooh, here comes open enrollment, Oct. 15 through Dec. 7, and now we'll fix everything.' It's a lot more complicated than that. It's a lot more permanent than that.""
For many financial advisors guiding older clients, the advice is clear: Steer clear of Medicare Advantage from the outset.
Carolyn McClanahan, a physician and founder of Life Planning Partners in Jacksonville, Florida, tells clients to think twice before signing up. The allure of Medicare Advantage often comes from lower upfront costs and extra perks — things like gym memberships or dental coverage.
""When you are healthy, you don't have any problem with [Medicare Advantage] because you don't need to access health care often. The insurers are happy with that crowd because they are making money,"" McClanahan said.
The picture changes dramatically when health issues arise. Along with prior authorization requirements, insurers often narrow their networks further as expenses rise, making it harder for patients to find doctors.
""Once you get sick and have to experience the limitations of [Medicare Advantage], you wish you were on traditional Medicare,"" McClanahan said. ""But because you are sick, you will have a problem with the underwriting to get back on a Medigap policy.""
Caughill said it's crucial that advisors educate themselves on Medicare and incorporate it into their retirement planning.
""I'm constantly on a soapbox with financial advisors to try to get them to care,"" Caughill said. ""Because at some point, a financial advisor who doesn't care, who doesn't consider Medicare, … will have conversations with their best clients in 10 or 15 years [and say], 'Oh, you have all these unexpected medical costs now, and this skilled nursing facility stay is not covered. What are we going to do?'""
""I get it. We all want to do just what we signed up for. But Medicare is, unfortunately, a prevalent part of retirement,"" she said. ""You can't do retirement planning without considering the number one cost in retirement, which is health care, which in this country is Medicare.""",6088cae8fac9be5418823de2f554c620,trafilatura,7458,0

Key highlights from executives during its third-quarter earnings conference call include how a shift to in-person shopping will benefit Birkenstock’s wholesale business over direct-to-consumer retail operations, what levers are available to manage the 15 percent U.S.-EU tariffs, and why select price increases so far haven’t slowed consumer demand.

“We continue to see the shift to in-person shopping, which amplifies our brand. We are a touch-and-feel product, especially for consumers who are new to the brand,” Birkenstock chief executive officer Oliver Reichert told investors on the call. “We have over 12,000 high-quality touch points through our B2B partners compared to our own fleet of 90 doors. That is why this shift in consumer behavior favors our B2B channel over DTC.”
He said the brand is winning at retail as it gains shelf space and takes market share. “In a flat U.S. market, retail revenue at our top 10 wholesale partners was up 25 percent. As you do your channel checks for back-to-school, you will hear that Birkenstock is the winner with very strong sellout and fast inventory turns,” the CEO said.
Reichert said the same is true for the EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) region. “Retail revenue at our top 10 partners was up 20 percent. Within our B2B channel, over 90 percent of the growth came from within existing doors. We are committed to maintaining relative scarcity and managing tightly our distribution growth,” he explained.
The company is on track to reach its goal of 100 stores by the end of the fiscal year. Birkenstock has accelerated the pace of store openings, adding 13 doors thus far. The expectation is a return of CapEx within 12 to 18 months of an opening, helped by higher average selling prices and higher units per transaction from the first day of a store’s opening. Reichert said the store openings allow the brand to capture more in-person shopping demand within its own DTC business since the stores can showcase the brand’s full product assortment.
“Our brand heat is stronger than before,” Reichert said, noting full-price sell-throughs and Birkenstock’s strong order book. He also cited the emerging youth market as a runway for growth. “Our demand is strong across all product categories and target groups. Sales of our [classic] silhouettes grew by double digits. Demand for our iconic styles, such as the Arizona and Boston remains strong and is accelerating within the younger demographic,” the CEO said, adding that at the same time, “we are growing in expansion categories such as laced-up shoes.” He noted that closed-toe share of revenue increased by 400 basis points year-over-year.
Chief financial officer Ivica Krolo said business-to-business growth outpaced DTC in the quarter, with B2B revenue up 18 percent and DTC up 12 percent, both on a constant-currency basis. DTC share of the business was 38 percent, down 110 basis points versus the same year-ago quarter.
“B2B has proven to be the most cost-efficient way to target new consumer groups,” he said. “We now expect B2B growth to outpace DTC in both the fourth quarter and for the full year.” As a demand-driven brand, Krolo said the company is strategically allocating product to where the consumer is shopping. “And unlike our peers, we own our supply chain. The B2B order book provides predictability and de-risks our planning,” the CFO noted.
Krolo also said the company can manage the impact of the baseline 15 percent EU tariff through actions already taken, including targeted price increases. He said in the first quarter that Birkenstock would only need a low-single-digit price increase globally for a full offset of the tariff impact. On Thursday’s call, the CFO elaborated on other tools at Birkenstock’s disposal: “Pricing is not the only lever we have. Given our vertical integration, additional levers include efficiencies in production, vendor negotiations, the optimization of the product mix and the allocation of products between the regions.”
The CFO also disclosed that the brand entered 2025 with an effective tariff rate of 11 percent, which at one point went up to 21 percent in April when including the 10 percent reciprocal rate. While noting that the manageability of the new baseline, he also said, “We have some items that are already tariffed at over 15 percent and those higher tariffs, historical tariffs, will remain in place.”
As for price increases in the U.S. due to anticipated higher costs connected to tariff increases, David Kahan, president of Americas, said price adjustments for select styles became effective on July 1 and that the brand has “seen no impact whatsoever since we took our pricing increases.”
With six weeks past the price actions under its belt, recent channel checks indicate “velocity and sell-through” for the brand from July and into the second week of August, Kahan explained. He said that period includes a significant portion of the U.S. bts season, adding that sales have been “exceptional and it’s escalated even beyond the selling results we had in Q3, which historically was when we would have high spring peak sell-throughs.”
Kahan also that 90 percent of growth is from existing doors due to more styles, stock keeping units and some added depth in inventory.
And EMEA president Mehdi Nico Bouyakhf reiterated growth for the brand in the region, noting that same-store sales in retail rose by double digits and price increases for spring 2025 didn’t see any consumer pushback, resulting in full-price sales at more than 90 percent. Contributing to full-price sales was a structural demand issue in the quarter where consumer appetite for the brand was greater than product availability, Bouyakhf said.
Members of the management team have said the brand overall tends to limit production capacity to maintain a level of scarcity in the market.
For the three months ended June 30, net income jumped 73.1 percent to 129.2 million euros, or 0.69 euros a diluted share, from 74.6 million euros, or 0.40 euros, a year ago. Revenue for the period rose 12.4 percent to 635.0 million euros from 564.8 million euros a year ago.
For the six months, net income rose 82.9 percent to 254.5 million euros, or 1.36 euros a diluted share, from 139.1 million euros, or 0.74 euros, in the same year-ago period. Revenue rose 16.5 percent to 1.57 billion euros from 1.35 billion euros.
The company on Thursday reiterated it prior guidance for fiscal 2025, with revenue growth expected at the high end of a 15 to 17 percent range on a constant currency basis.
Meanwhile, Birkenstock 1774 has been busy reimagining the classics to give consumers a reason to buy the brand’s footwear. April saw the launch of a nylon version of the Arizona sandal — Karl Birkenstock debuted the original silhouette in 1973 — in several monochrome colors. That was followed in May with Birkenstock 1774 and Maharishi teaming up to launch its outdoor Mogami Terra Tech sandal.

What Are the Approaches of South Korea and Japan Towards Stablecoins
After the passage of the GENIUS Act in the U.S., stablecoin projects, implementations and regulations are now a major subject of discussion around the world. South Korea and Japan are both having high-level and advanced discussions currently about how those stablecoins should operate. And how the private sector and governments should interact in regulating stablecoins.
Central Banks in Korea and Japan differ in their approaches towards stablecoins and CBDCs:
A CBDC, or a central bank-controlled digital currency, is a blockchain-powered digital currency controlled by a central bank pegged to a real-world currency denomination.
A stablecoin is typically issued by private enterprises. They are usually designed to have a value identical to real-world currencies.
Japan: CBDCs can learn from stablecoins
The Bank of Japan maintains a firm stance that CBDCs should only be used for interbank settlements. Private banks' issued stablecoins can be used for business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions. The Bank of Japan and the Financial Services Agency have devised a stablecoin regulatory framework with a positive stance on the use of privately regulated stablecoins.
While the Bank of Japan acknowledges the “the potential of stablecoins as an efficient means of payment,” it also envisions co-existence with CBDCs and views the digital Yen as a complementary, rather than competitive, form of cash, with traditional finance.
The Governor of the Bank of Japan, Kazuo Ueda, recently said, “Stablecoins increase small international remittances, leading to risk diversification. With more high-frequency micropayments, it will be interesting to explore how CBDCs can play a complementary role.” Suggesting that private stablecoins could provide learnings for a CBDC design in terms of its payment efficiency.
South Korea: Ambivalence but leaning towards private stablecoins
This contrasts with the Bank of Korea's current ambivalent stance as to whether or not private stablecoins should be controlled by central banks, considering that they will potentially cause instability in domestic currency value or capital flight. It is crucial to understand that Korea has very tight capital controls on the currency system.
However, South Korea’s National Assembly has led the pro-stablecoin discussions by proposing three different Digital Asset bills to legalize KRW stablecoins. These bills came after President Jae Myung Lee pledged to create domestic stablecoins during the recent election campaign that concluded successfully in June. It is noteworthy that Korea’s CBDC project was halted on 29 June 2025, following these stablecoin discussions.

As a result, many competing consortia from Web3, fintech, and the banks are all scrambling for a position to be part of any future stablecoin designs. Kakao and Naver, the largest IT enterprises in South Korea, have begun their stablecoin research task forces, filed trademarks, or formed an alliance group seeking potential partners.
Circle, the USDC issuer, signed an MOU with Hana Bank, one of Korea’s main banks, to lay the groundwork for a future stablecoin business alliance. Private South Korean banks have already begun positioning themselves as stablecoin businesses; the CBDC project was frozen in June.
Nevertheless, South Korea has maintained a “one bank for one centralized crypto exchange"" regulation, blocking new market entrants. Therefore, many in the industry are keenly awaiting to see which of the three bills is adopted.
Why Japan and South Korea’s approaches matter for non-USD stablecoins
Rather than benefiting the South Korean economy, the Bank of Korea and others argue that a Korean-won (KRW) backed stablecoin will not prevent capital flights from South Korea, as those stablecoins will not be widely used in global digital asset transactions like USD stablecoins.
The interaction between the private sector and governments in regulating stablecoins, as well as how South Korea and Japan address these issues, particularly in balancing the mass adoption of stablecoins with adherence to Web3 principles, has implications beyond their borders.

Ask an Expert
Q: What is driving the shift in Asia to integrate blockchain technology into traditional financial systems?
A: Asia's embrace of blockchain is a strategic pivot, moving beyond the speculative aspects of cryptocurrency to its potential as a foundational technology. Policy leaders across the region see that regulatory clarity is essential for sustainable innovation; examples such as Hong Kong's licensing regime for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) and Singapore's regulated DeFi and cross‑border payment pilots show this in action. This proactive approach creates the regulatory clarity and robust infrastructure necessary to facilitate secure on-chain transactions and more efficient cross-border payments, ultimately modernizing financial systems.
Q: South Korea's new regulatory framework is a significant development. What are the key features, and what do they signal for institutional adoption?
A: South Korea's new framework, formalized in the Digital Asset Basic Act (DABA), represents a major step toward institutional acceptance. Its key features, including comprehensive guidelines for stablecoins and the introduction of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), are designed to create a more secure and defined environment for digital assets. Furthermore, the launch of a state-supported blockchain network underscores a strategic focus on building institutional-grade infrastructure. These developments collectively signal that South Korea views digital assets not just as a retail product, but as a legitimate part of the financial ecosystem, paving the way for greater institutional participation.
Q: What are the key takeaways for financial advisors from Asia's evolving blockchain landscape, and what should they be monitoring?
A: The developments in Asia, particularly in countries like South Korea, provide a clear roadmap for the future of global finance. Advisors should recognize that this trend signals a move toward institutional acceptance and the potential for new, regulated financial products. It is crucial to monitor developments in tokenized securities, which could fundamentally change how assets are issued, traded, and settled. Additionally, keeping an eye on new stablecoin regulations and digital Know Your Customer (KYC) frameworks is essential, as these trends could very well be a preview of the next evolution of capital markets globally.",40354d37c58188f6b3471f90f28f1ccd,trafilatura,7260,0
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/michael-saylor-bets-100-billion-133948716.html,06802550b706a23babe59920b264a024,Michael Saylor Bets on a $100 Billion Bitcoin  Credit  Dream,Michael Saylor Bets on a $100 Billion Bitcoin  Credit  Dream,2025-08-15 14:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"(Bloomberg) -- Michael Saylor has built a career on testing how far conviction can bend markets — part financier, part preacher. Now the Strategy Inc. chairman is betting that same belief on what may be his riskiest financing experiment yet.
Over the years, Saylor has urged followers to pour their savings into Bitcoin, mortgage their homes, even “sell a kidney.” To admirers, he’s a prophet with a balance sheet; to skeptics, a showman with an obsession. Either way, he’s turned a once-obscure software company into the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, playing the markets with a conviction most executives would never dare.
Now, Saylor is asking for a different kind of leap of faith: embracing an unorthodox financing instrument — perpetual preferred stock — to shift away from common stock sales and convertible bonds that helped build a $75 billion Bitcoin war chest. The twist: these securities never mature and some can skip dividend payments, making them flexible for the issuer but unnerving for investors.
Branded “Stretch,” the latest issuance pays dividends with a variable rate and offers no voting rights. This kind of security is neither debt nor common equity, but Saylor hopes it combines advantages of both, giving him fresh cash to keep buying Bitcoin without heavily diluting shareholders. Over the next four years, he plans to retire billions in convertible notes, curtail common stock sales, and issue more preferred offerings as his main funding source.
The gamble is audacious: to create, as the firm puts it, a “BTC Credit Model,” where a volatile asset underpins a stream of income securities. If there’s big demand, he speculates it could even raise “$100 billion… even $200 billion” in theory. If not, Strategy, as MicroStrategy now calls itself, could be left juggling payouts with no buyers. Selling Bitcoin is a near-taboo, given Saylor’s ‘hold on for dear life’ gospel that coins are sacred. Supporters see the preferreds as a clever way to keep crypto buying; critics warn that the payouts are costly and could become a burden if Bitcoin’s price turns.
So far this year, the company has raised around $6 billion across four perpetual preferred offerings. The latest, a $2.5 billion “Stretch” tranche, ranked among the largest crypto capital raises this year, eclipsing Circle’s high-profile IPO. Nearly a quarter of the sale went to retail buyers, per a firm presentation, cementing Saylor’s devoted following as a key funding source.
“I have no past knowledge of any company doing this the way that MicroStrategy has just to capitalize on the retail fervor,” said Michael Youngworth, head of global convertibles and preferred strategy at Bank of America.
That retail tilt stands out in the corporate preferred market, dominated by investment-grade utilities and banks. Strategy is unrated, making its preferreds junior in the structure and outside the comfort zone of many fixed-income investors. If retail appetite fades, Saylor would need to win over insurers and pensions — the buyers he says he hopes to attract — or risk falling short of his blockbuster-fundraising ambitions.
Since the start of 2024, Saylor has raised over $40 billion through a mix of stock and bonds — $27 billion from common equity sales, $13.8 billion from fixed-income securities — transforming Strategy into a Bitcoin proxy for Wall Street. Part of the pivot is practical: the convertibles market excludes retail.
Strategy CEO Phong Le framed the shift as a way to build a more resilient capital structure — a contrast to 2022’s “crypto winter,” when the company was burdened by a Bitcoin-backed loan from Silvergate and other debt. “Over time, we may not have convertible notes,” he said, “we will be relying on perpetual preferred notes that don’t ever come due.”
Yet the plan depends on paying large, ongoing dividends in perpetuity, using an asset — Bitcoin — that produces no income and has historically lost half its value in months. If Bitcoin prices fall and investors lose interest, the company could be stuck with big bills and no easy way to raise fresh cash.
Perpetual preferreds don’t mature, and in some cases, dividends can be deferred without triggering default. Under current terms, Strategy can pay some obligations in cash or shares and certain payouts are non-cumulative, meaning missed payments don’t have to be made up. For now, payouts are financed largely by selling common stock through its at-the-market program — a stream Saylor has vowed to slow, but not shut off entirely. Still, the company has said it could sell shares even below its typical 2.5 net asset-value threshold, if needed to cover debt interest or preferred dividends.
Perpetual preferreds never have to be repaid, unlike convertibles, which either dilute shareholders if they convert or must be repaid in cash if they don’t. That matters because one of Strategy’s quietest advantages has been its ability to sell stock at prices well above the value of its Bitcoin holdings. It’s a gap Saylor himself dubbed the “mNAV premium” - a multiple of net asset value, helping Saylor raise cash and buy Bitcoin at a discount.
“With their mNAV premium compressing in recent weeks, I think management is rightfully concerned about creating too much dilution,” said Brian Dobson, managing director for Disruptive Technology Equity Research at Clear Street.
Still, the funding model brings its own hazards. “These are high-yielding instruments,” said Youngworth. “Paying coupons of 8% to 10% in perpetuity could be quite challenging.” Liquidity, a concern for any company with little operating revenue beyond security sales, could tighten sharply in a Bitcoin downturn.
To short seller Jim Chanos, the non-cumulative variety of preferreds are “crazy” for institutions to buy — perpetual, non-redeemable, with dividends paid only at the issuer’s discretion. “If I don’t pay the dividends, they are not cumulative. I don’t have to pay them back,” he told Bloomberg TV in June. Chanos says Strategy’s effective leverage has plateaued and sees the preferred push as another way to juice it. He’s suggested shorting the stock while long Bitcoin, betting the premium will collapse.
In Strategy’s capital structure, these units sit above common stock but are subordinate to convertible bonds, lacking the protections of regular debt. Wall Street managers have tended to favor those convertible bonds, which are easier to hedge through market-neutral trades. The preferreds are typically harder to hedge, and retiring convertibles would remove a popular arbitrage vehicle.
The whole approach works only if Bitcoin stays valuable and investor confidence holds. If he’s right, Bitcoin could inch closer to being treated as mainstream financial collateral. If he’s wrong, his balance sheet will be a cautionary tale: what happens when you try to turn a volatile asset into an income stream — and the market stops believing.
Still, the danger may come from the broader market as digital-asset treasury companies pile on risk.
“I think there are some indications of a bubble in crypto treasury companies,” said Yuliya Guseva, who directs Rutgers Law School’s Blockchain and Fintech Program. “If the market appetite dries up, then the model will no longer persist.”",72c37f09fc3ed55626ec06ca9ddaf6db,trafilatura,7258,0

By Mike Dolan, Editor-At-Large, Finance and Markets
Even if you don't think tariffs are feeding price rises yet, the sharp jump in U.S. producer prices in July - driven by the biggest jump in retail and wholesale margins in two years - was a shot across the bow that tempers heady interest rate cut speculation.
Lifting Treasury yields, buoying the dollar and stalling Wall Street stocks at record highs, the PPI report scotched any thought of a half point rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month and sowed a sliver of doubt it would ease at all.
Attention now switches to retail sales and industry updates on Friday, while next week's Fed conference in Jackson Hole comes onto the radar too.
* With some of the heat taken out of effervescent risk markets, U.S. retail sales are expected to show a brisk 0.5% gain last month but industrial production growth is forecast to have stalled, with import prices flat. June inventory readings and a consumer sentiment survey for August add to a busy diary. Fed officials threw cold water on talk of a 50 basis point cut in September, an idea that had been stoked by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent the previous day.
* As hopes of a Ukraine ceasefire stirred with the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska due to get under way, European stocks and the euro advanced on Friday, while the European defence sector fell back 1.5%, crude oil slipped about 0.6% and gold prices remained subdued. Chinese stocks rallied despite another poor set of industry, retail and housing reports as speculation about some further stimulus there resurfaced, with reports of government support for troubled property developers in the mix. The yen firmed as Japan's Q2 GDP came in more than twice expectations at +1.0% annualised.
* Shares of Intel surged almost 5% in pre-market trading after Bloomberg reported the Trump administration was in talks with the struggling chipmaker on the U.S. government taking a stake in the company. The reported discussions follow a meeting this week between Trump and Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan - just days after Trump called for Tan's resignation over alleged China-linked investments.
Today's Market Minute:
* Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin hold talks in Alaska on Friday, with the U.S. president's hopes of sealing a ceasefire agreement on Ukraine uncertain but with a last gasp offer from Putin of a possible nuclear deal that could help both men save face.
* The talks in Alaska mark the potential beginnings of a return of Russia - and its commodities - to the global arena following Moscow's recent international isolation. ROI columnist Gavin Maguire provides a guide on the potential market impacts should global relations with Russia return to normal.
* China's factory output growth slumped to an eight-month low in July, while retail sales slowed sharply, raising pressure on policymakers to roll out more stimulus to revive domestic demand and ward off external shocks to the $19 trillion economy.
* Wall Street's largest hedge funds, Bridgewater Associates, Tiger Global Management and Discovery Capital, increased their exposure to Big Tech in the second quarter amid a generational boom in the growth of artificial intelligence.
* The U.S. economy seems to be chugging along fairly smoothly, but ROI columnist Jamie McGeever discusses five charts that indicate the foundations of the resilient U.S. economy and booming stock market may be much shakier than they appear.
Chart of the day:
China's factory output growth slumped to an eight-month low in July, while retail sales slowed sharply, raising pressure on policymakers to roll out more stimulus to revive domestic demand and ward off U.S. tariff-related pressures. While reports of more official support for ailing property firms emerged, the housing sector remains a running sore. New home prices fell 2.8% in July year-on-year, versus a 3.2% drop in June.
Weekly reads:
* INDEPENDENCE AND LOYALISM: Pushing back on a view that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell should resign to clear the air over Trump's repeated attacks on him, former Fed Vice Chair Roger Ferguson gives a stout defense of Fed Independence. ""For the stability of the dollar and the entire U.S. financial system, it is critical that Powell does not resign prematurely,"" Ferguson wrote in a piece for the Council on Foreign Relations. ""Equally important is that the next chair not be seen as a political loyalist of President Trump.""
* WHO ARE 'BOND VIGILANTES'?: European Central Bank economists look at the role of investment funds, who they say hold up to a quarter of outstanding euro government debt in some countries, as the prime 'vigilantes' in times of stress. Foreign funds are the most jumpy and 'procyclical' of that grouping in offloading bonds due to credit, stability or interest rate concerns - while domestic households and insurance firms tend to buy the bonds investment funds sell, they explain.
* DEBT BURDENS LIFT RATES: As some puzzle over the relatively calm U.S. bond markets despite rising sovereign deficits and debts, IMF economists re-examine the links between debt burdens and higher borrowing rates and term premiums in a paper published on CEPR's VoxEU site. Updating the dataset from earlier studies, they conclude that a 10% of GDP increase in expected debt is associated with an increase in long-term rates of between 20 and 30 basis points, while a 1% of GDP increase in the fiscal and primary deficit has a similar impact.
* INVESTMENT SPENDING NOT ENOUGH: Using Japan's experience as a example, Daniel Gros at the Institute for European Policymaking at Bocconi argues that Europe just upping billions in investment spending may not be the spur to the economy that many assume. Ensuring the money is better spent on start-ups and its ""innovation ecosystem"" rather than via big companies alone would yield better results, he wrote on Project Syndicate.
* DARK SIDE OF AI CHATBOTS: Internal guidelines at Facebook owner Meta Platforms explicitly permitted its artificial intelligence chatbots to ""engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual"", according to a Reuters special report. Reuters' Jeff Horwitz illustrates some of the darker side of the AI revolution now sweeping tech and the broader business world.

Veteran statesman Putin is likely to be aiming to extract as many concessions and benefits for Russia as he can in return for a ceasefire that's coveted by Trump.
Close followers of Moscow say Russia is not looking to end the war yet, however, given its advantageous position on the battlefield in Ukraine, where its forces occupy swathes of territory in the south and east.
Trump has played down expectations for the summit, describing them as a listening exercise ahead of potential further talks. Yet he has also threatened ""very severe consequences"" if Putin doesn't agree to a ceasefire. It's a warning Trump has proposed before, and yet has resisted pulling the trigger on further sanctions.
Ukraine and its European allies, not invited to the summit, warned Trump this week that Putin is bluffing about wanting peace. Kyiv has even said Russia is preparing for new offensives although Moscow has not commented on that claim.
The talks could nonetheless be a watershed moment for stakeholders in the Ukraine war which has been raging for three and a half years, as well as a catalyst for geopolitical changes.
CNBC takes a look at five major factors at stake in Friday's talks:
Ceasefire
Trump's central aim on Friday is to press Putin into a ceasefire but what form this might take, what promises could be made and what ""red lines"" might have to be crossed — particularly territorial concessions and security guarantees — to reach a deal will be key.
""Ending the Russia-Ukraine war remains one of President Trump's signature foreign policy goals, and Friday's Anchorage talks with Putin have raised expectations of a major diplomatic breakthrough,"" Helima Croft, head of Global Commodity Strategy and MENA Research at RBC Capital Markets, said Wednesday.
""The purported deal discussion points are broadly similar to what has been previously floated; In return for halting its military offensive, Russia is apparently seeking to retain Crimea and the entire eastern Donbas region of Ukraine as well as secure a definitive end to Kyiv's NATO ambitions"" she said, in emailed comments.
Ukraine's territorial integrity
Ukraine and Europe have vehemently pushed back against the ""maximalist"" territorial concessions that Russia could seek in return for acquiescing to a ceasefire deal.
Trump has sewn confusion and concern by vacillating over the thorny issue in the last week, talking about potential ""land swapping"" by Ukraine while also pledging to get as much territory back for it as possible.
Ukraine and European leaders on Wednesday urged Trump not to agree to any demands from Putin regarding peace for land, following an emergency virtual summit.
For his part, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine's territorial integrity is enshrined in its constitution. Any changes to this would have to be approved by a referendum, which would have to be authorized by the Ukrainian parliament, making the process a potentially fraught one.
There is another option: that Ukraine accepts de facto Russian control of the four regions it broadly occupies, rather than a de jure (legal and official) recognition. But again, how a ""just and lasting"" peace could then be maintained in Ukraine, and who would police it, would likely be a bone of contention.
Europe's security
The fate of Ukraine's territorial integrity doesn't just affect Ukraine but the rest of Europe, regional leaders say. They argue that giving Putin a slice of its neighbor's territory effectively redraws the borders of Europe.
Ukraine aspires to membership of the European Union (as sell as NATO, although this is seen as an ambition too far) and both Kyiv and the EU argue that if Russia is given a slice of Ukrainian territory, he will regroup his forces and use the territory as a launchpad for a future wholesale invasion of Ukraine. That could mean Europe has war at its border.
EU leaders want to be involved in any ceasefire deal and have offered to oversee keeping the peace. Russia has rejected that idea, and euroskeptic Trump might not have the region's concerns in the forefront of his mind come Friday.
""What the Europeans are trying to frame as non-negotiable preconditions for a deal with Russia (a ceasefire, a monitoring mission, ""ironclad"" security guarantees) might catch up with them after the U.S.-Russia summit,"" Carsten Nickel, deputy director of Research at Teneo, said in a note Wednesday.
""Regardless of the outcome, Trump could dare the Europeans to deliver much more of the required military capabilities and financing afterward. This would create difficult trade-offs in transatlantic relations,"" he said.
Russia's economy
Although Putin appears to be entering the talks from a position of strength rather than weakness, he could arguably look for an off-ramp from the war that has damaged Russia's economy, which is seeing slowing growth, labor shortages and rampant inflation which even Putin described as ""alarming.""
″[Putin] starts from a relatively strong position on the battlefield. They're advancing,"" Richard Portes, head of the economics faculty at the London Business School, told CNBC.
""On the other hand, from the economic point of view, he starts from a weak position. The Russian economy is not in very good shape. They're running a significant fiscal deficit, partly because oil revenues are down very substantially, oil and gas [are down] because of the oil price. And ... this is a weak economy,"" Portes told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Monday.
Geopolitical impact
After three and a half years of war, there's certainly a desire that the fighting in Ukraine comes to an end. Hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost, according to estimates, while millions of Ukrainians have been displaced. The global economy and supply chains have also been upended and redrawn as a result of the conflict.
Russia, meanwhile, has reasonably effectively circumvented international sanctions and has buyers of its oil that funds its war machine, with the likes of China and India refusing to isolate their ally. As such, one of the key questions Friday will be, is Putin willing to play ball when it comes to ending the war, and to what extent does he need to?
""From Putin's point of view, the task is quite prosaic: to simply sit and wait for the desired result. Putin sees himself as a 'long power' and historical figure, in contrast with the 'short power' of Western fleeting political figures,"" Alexander Baunov, senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, commented Thursday.
Putin's position on the eve of the meeting looks more advantageous, Baunov concluded: ""By conceding to hold a one-on-one meeting with Putin before any ceasefire, Trump is taking a bigger risk than Putin,"" he said.
""In diplomacy, the aggressor has nothing to lose. By offering to lower the temperature without having suffered a military defeat, that same aggressor begins to look like a peacemaker.""",32e93af619c31221fe33da8344363df2,trafilatura,7129,0

An acceleration in AI software and services spending has led to an improvement in the growth rate of cloud communications specialist Twilio.
A lot of money is being spent on artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software now as organizations and governments across the globe look to benefit from the efficiency and productivity gains that this technology can deliver.
Market research firm Gartner expects spending on generative AI will jump by 76% in 2025 to a whopping $644 billion. That's why it is a good time to take a closer look at two names that are benefiting from the rapid growth in AI spending in different areas. These companies are already delivering healthy growth and are trading at attractive valuations, so buying them right now could be a smart move.
1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM) is right in the middle of the AI revolution as it fabricates the high-end chips that go into devices ranging from data centers to smartphones to personal computers to cars. It's the largest third-party chip foundry in the world by far. Gartner points out that 80% of generative AI spending this year will be on hardware products, including both devices and servers.
TSMC is already benefiting from this opportunity. The foundry giant's revenue in the first seven months of 2025 increased by 38% year over year. That impressive growth can be attributed to robust chip demand from top customers such as Nvidia, Apple, AMD, and Broadcom.
The strong end-market demand led TSMC to increase its 2025 revenue growth guidance to 30% from its earlier expectation of growth in the mid-20% range. However, don't be surprised to see the Taiwan-based company exceeding even that upgraded target thanks to its AI-related catalysts.
For instance, Counterpoint Research is expecting a 68% spike in sales of generative AI-capable smartphones in 2025. Apple, which is one of TSMC's largest customers, reported a 13.5% jump in its iPhone revenue in its most recently reported fiscal quarter. Importantly, Apple is expecting sales growth in the mid to high single-digit percentages in the current quarter, suggesting that it could witness another period of robust iPhone sales ahead of the holiday season.
Moreover, TSMC's relationship with smartphone processor giant Qualcomm should pave the way for the company to grow its footprint in the smartphone market. On the other hand, TSMC's relationships with the leading AI chip designers and its focus on expanding its manufacturing capacity to serve this fast-growing market will set the stage for further healthy sales growth.
The diversity of its customer base helps explain why the foundry's revenue is anticipated to increase at healthy double-digit percentages over the next couple of years as well.
However, TSMC could end up doing better than that over the long run thanks to its improving share of the Foundry 2.0 market, which is expected to generate $298 billion in revenue this year. IDC expects Foundry 2.0 to grow at an annualized rate of 10% through 2029, and TSMC has been able to expand its market share in the space thanks to its focus on advanced chip packaging.
As such, TSMC seems capable of outperforming expectations in the long run, and that's why buying the stock while it is trading at an attractive 24 times forward earnings (a discount to the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 index's multiple of 30) looks like the right thing to do.
2. Twilio
Spending on generative AI services and software is also taking off as organizations and people adopt more applications to automate processes and increase productivity. According to estimates from Gartner, in 2025, total spending on AI services and software could jump by 119% to almost $65 billion. Twilio(NYSE: TWLO), a cloud communications specialist, is witnessing a healthy acceleration in growth thanks to the adoption of AI tools in its industry.
Twilio's application programming interfaces (APIs) enable its clients to stay in touch with their customers through multiple channels such as text, voice, email, chat, and video. The company offers AI tools that allow its clients to build voice AI solutions such as AI agents to elevate the customer service experience, along with AI-powered marketing tools to improve conversion.
The company's AI tools are helping it close bigger deals with customers. Twilio says that it saw a 57% year-over-year increase in the number of communications deals valued at $500,000 or more in the second quarter of 2025. The company's active customer accounts increased by 10% from the year-ago period, compared to a 4% increase in the same period last year.
Spending by Twilio's established customers improved as well. This is evident from an increase of 5 percentage points in its dollar-based net expansion rate to 108%. (That metric compares the spending of active customers in a quarter to the same cohort's spending in the year-ago period.) Not surprisingly, Twilio has increased its organic revenue growth estimate for 2025 by 1.5 percentage points.
It could, however, end up doing better than that thanks to its accelerating customer base growth as well as the cross-selling opportunities that its AI solutions are creating. Analysts covering the company are encouraged by its improving growth profile, and have raised their expectations for it.
Finally, this cloud stock is trading at just 3 times sales, a slight discount to the S&P 500's sales multiple. Investors, therefore, can get a good deal on an AI stock that seems capable of flying higher in the long run.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-warren-buffett-stocks-buy-111500937.html,2fb239767a8b355714b2d8fae1520839,2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist and 1 to Avoid,2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist and 1 to Avoid,2025-08-15 21:15:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"For decades, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) has captured the attention of investors with its long track record of stellar returns. Since taking over as CEO in 1965, Buffett has consistently delivered an incredible annualized return of 20%. Just imagine, a $100 investment back then would have blossomed into over $5 million today.
Buffett's keen eye for high-quality companies with competitive moats has made him a beacon of inspiration for investors everywhere. While his successful track record speaks volumes, it's important to remember that not every investment hits the mark. With that in mind, here are two Buffett stocks that I would scoop up right now, along with one that I'd steer clear of right now.
Buy Berkshire Hathaway
The first stock I'd buy is Buffett's own Berkshire Hathaway. Investing in Berkshire provides investors with diversification, disciplined capital management, and stellar long-term returns. At its core, Berkshire is a conglomerate of high-quality businesses, including wholly owned subsidiaries like Geico, BNSF Railway, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, as well as a massive equity portfolio featuring blue chip names like Apple, Coca-Cola, and Visa.
What has set Berkshire apart is its capital management and patience across economic cycles. Buffett and his right-hand man, the late Charlie Munger, achieved a stellar track record of investing in high-quality companies going back 60 years. The company has done so by avoiding fads and investing in durable businesses with strong moats and steady cash flows.
Earlier this year, Warren Buffett announced he was passing the reins of CEO on to Greg Abel. Meanwhile, investing lieutenants Todd Combs and Ted Weschler will help direct Berkshire's massive investment portfolio.
The company is in a good spot in terms of capital. Its huge cash pile stands at nearly $340 billion, providing it with dry powder for opportunistic purchases during market dislocations. For long-term investors, Berkshire Hathaway is a well-run conglomerate with a ton of cash on hand, leaving it well positioned even in a post-Buffett era.
Buy American Express
The second Buffett stock to buy is American Express(NYSE: AXP). American Express boasts a strong brand, customer loyalty, and strong credit metrics, making it a solid blue chip stock for long-term investors.
The company operates a closed-loop payments network, unlike Visa or Mastercard which only handle transactions. As a result, American Express captures fees from transactions on its network along with interest-earning loans on those credit card balances. Visa and Mastercard earn swipe fees, but credit card loans are held by banking partners that reap the benefits of interest payments.
While this gives American Express interest income, which can help boost earnings, especially when interest rates rise as they did a few years ago, it also opens the company up to credit risk. If its credit card borrowers fail to repay their balances, it could impact its credit quality and ultimately its earnings.
This is where American Express' strength becomes evident. The company reduces its credit risk by focusing on a high-spending, high-credit customer base that can be more resilient in economic downturns. As a result, American Express tends to have stellar credit metrics compared to its peers. On top of that, it benefits from growth in travel, luxury spending, and business expenditures as its affluent consumer base helps drive above-average transaction volumes and fee income.
For long-term investors seeking quality, resilience, and consistent shareholder returns, American Express is a compelling stock for your diversified portfolio.
Avoid Ally Financial
One Warren Buffett stock I wouldn't buy is Ally Financial(NYSE: ALLY). There is nothing wrong with the company per se, and it could do well if we get interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in the coming years. However, the company has some limitations that could hurt its long-term growth prospects.
First, it operates in a highly cyclical business, with over three-quarters of Ally's revenue coming from automotive lending. This reliance on auto lending makes it sensitive to economic downturns.
During recessions or credit contractions, demand could wane and delinquencies and charge-offs could spike, causing a hit to its profits. This is precisely what happened in recent years, when Ally's revenue and income dropped off amid the rising interest rate environment of 2022 to 2023.
Additionally, Ally competes in crowded markets, such as automotive lending, digital banking, and investing. It faces competition from banks, like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Capital One Financial, along with fintech companies like SoFi. It also faces competition in automotive lending from PNC Financial and Upstart, which is gaining a foothold in the space.
Ally could do well in the near term, especially if credit conditions normalize and the Federal Reserve cuts its benchmark interest rate. While the stock is reasonably priced on a forward basis, I don't see a strong, robust business model with a strong moat, which is why I would avoid this Buffett stock today.

All the major indices have hit new highs recently, but most of the focus among investors is concentrated on companies benefiting from artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, valuations for companies in other sectors are looking attractive.
Some top brands in the consumer goods sector are starting to look interesting from a value perspective. Here are two stocks that have fallen out of favor on Wall Street but could see a rebound over the next few years.
1. Lululemon Athletica
Shares of Lululemon Athletica(NASDAQ: LULU) have plummeted to new 52-week lows in the past month and are down by more than 60% from their peak, but there seems to be a growing discrepancy between the company's brand strength and its stock price. There are customers of the brand who swear by the product quality, and this is echoed in growing search interest on Google Trends. Wall Street obviously has cooled toward companies dependent on a cautious consumer, but Lululemon stock offers incredible value at under $200.
Lululemon has had an amazing growth story. Over the last 10 years, revenue and earnings grew at a compound annual rate of 19% and 24%, respectively. Those are impressive numbers for a company that must vie for market share with powerhouses like Nike and Adidas. They also show how much room there is in the athletic apparel industry for new brands to stand out with differentiated product designs.
Further, Lululemon's successes highlight how fragmented this part of the apparel industry is, and the opportunity for a rising tide to lift all boats. After five decades of growth, Nike is the largest brand, but it only reaps a minor portion of consumers' activewear spending. Overall, the athletic apparel market was worth $406 billion in 2024, according to Grand View Research, which expects it to grow at an annualized rate of 9% through 2030.
Lululemon reported a 7% year-over-year revenue increase in the first quarter, which is relatively strong considering the weak consumer spending backdrop across the apparel industry. It still has a lot of potential in international markets, which provide only a small portion of annual revenue now, and it continues to see strong customer responses to new releases. I believe it will grow sales much faster in a stronger economy.
The stock looks undervalued at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 13. This might be a fair multiple for a company growing sales and earnings at low rates, but if Lululemon returns to double-digit percentage sales growth over the next year, the stock could rocket higher. Just returning to its previous peak of $516 would more than double an investment made at today's price.
2. Roku
Roku(NASDAQ: ROKU) stock also has underperformed the past few years, which doesn't match the growth of its streaming platform. Its key product is a smart TV operating system that aggregates content from all the major streaming services, which is part of the value proposition for consumers who feel increasingly swamped by too many streaming options. While Apple TV is a top competitor, not everyone needs to be locked into the Apple ecosystem, especially at the premium prices the tech giant charges for its devices. Roku has a large and growing customer base thanks to its position as a budget-friendly alternative with an ad-supported revenue strategy.
The stock's current $84 price is well off the $490 high it reached during the pandemic. A slowing advertising market weighed on revenue growth, and the company is still recovering from that slump. However, management has made a lot of investments into ad technology and partnerships with third-party demand-side platforms like Amazon, and this strategy is paying off.
Platform revenue, gross profit, and streaming hours all grew by double-digit percentages in the second quarter. Roku's active accounts consistently grew at double-digit rates over the past few years. Roku says it now serves over half of all U.S. broadband households. Overall, these users spent more than 35 billion hours watching content on Roku last quarter, up from 30 billion in the prior-year period.
Advertising dollars ultimately flow to where the viewers are, and this is why I think Roku stock could deliver strong returns from its currently depressed level. The growth rate in video advertising on its platform during Q2 was greater than the growth of the broader U.S. digital ad market, signaling that Roku is taking advantage of its opportunity to capture a greater amount of the ad spending that is shifting to digital media.
Management expressed optimism about Roku's prospects in 2026. It cited execution in monetization initiatives and pointed to improvements in its EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margins. Adjusted EBITDA grew 79% year over year in Q2, with trailing-12-month free cash flow up 23%, and the company expects further margin expansion next year.
Wall Street is not too hot on the stock due to Roku's history of weak profitability. The company needs to prove it can profitably benefit from growth in digital advertising, but that is the outlook management is offering for 2026. Assuming the company succeeds in improving margins, the stock should move higher over the next 18 months or so.

Experts predict that the global cybersecurity market will grow from $218.9 billion in 2025 to $562.8 billion by 2032, exhibiting a steady 14.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the forecast period.
Moreover, as cyberattacks become increasingly sophisticated, the demand for advanced, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered protection is also surging, creating fertile ground for market leaders like CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD). The cybersecurity giant’s success story hinges on strong demand for its AI-driven Falcon platform, which is designed to detect, prevent, and neutralize threats with real-time speed and precision.
Multi-year contracts, growing demand for Falcon Flex deals, and a robust pipeline of enhancements are further solidifying its position as a cybersecurity heavyweight. That said, as the calendar inches closer to August 27, when CrowdStrike is set to unveil its fiscal 2026 second-quarter results, anticipation is running high. So, here’s a fresh look at this digital defense giant before its next big reveal.
About CrowdStrike and CRWD Stock
Valued at roughly $108.6 billion by market capitalization, Texas-based CrowdStrike is a global leader in cybersecurity, offering a cloud-native platform that helps protect some of the most critical areas of enterprise risk, including endpoints, cloud workloads, identities, and sensitive data. Its Falcon platform leverages the power of the CrowdStrike Security Cloud and AI to identify threats in real-time.
By analyzing attack indicators, threat intelligence, and hacker tactics, along with data from across an organization, it delivers accurate threat detection, automated protection, and quick response times. Built in the cloud with a single lightweight-agent design, Falcon enables quick deployment at scale, strong protection with minimal complexity, and the ability for organizations to see results right away.
Following last year’s high-profile outage incident in July that shook investors confidence, when a flawed update to CrowdStrike’s Falcon Sensor security software crashed approximately 8.5 million Microsoft (MSFT) Windows systems worldwide and sent the stock tumbling to a low of $242.25 in September, the company has demonstrated remarkable resilience, staging an impressive rebound of nearly 81.4% from that level.
And while CRWD stock has experienced some turbulence over the past month due to macroeconomic and business-related factors, its longer-term trajectory remains strong. Year-to-date (YTD), shares of the cybersecurity leader have surged nearly 27.4%, outpacing the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) 9.6% gain.
CrowdStrike’s Q1 Earnings Snapshot
CrowdStrike kicked off fiscal 2026 with a mixed bag, posting first-quarter results on June 3. For the quarter ended April 30, 2025, the cybersecurity leader reported revenue of $1.10 billion, up 20% year-over-year (YOY) and in line with Wall Street estimates. Subscription revenue matched that pace, also rising 20% annually to $1.05 billion, underscoring the strength of its recurring revenue engine.
Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) grew 22% YOY to $4.44 billion, with net new ARR coming in at about $194 million. The company also ended the quarter with a record $4.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, reinforcing its strong financial position. Profitability, however, told a different story. Non-GAAP net income slipped to $0.73 per share from $0.79 a year earlier, though it still comfortably topped expectations of $0.66.
On a GAAP basis, the company reported a $110.2 million net loss, compared to a $42.8 million profit in the same period last year, as spending increased across sales, marketing, R&D, and administration, partly due to last summer’s widespread software outage. Still, in a show of confidence in its long-term outlook, CrowdStrike’s board approved a share repurchase program of up to $1 billion, reinforcing its commitment to driving shareholder value.
Strategically, CrowdStrike continued to build momentum around Falcon Flex deals, which saw total deal value soar more than sixfold to $3.2 billion YOY. Product innovation remained front and center, with the launch of Falcon Privileged Access, Charlotte AI Agentic Response and Workflows, and advanced AI-powered capabilities in model scanning, Shadow AI detection, and Falcon Exposure Management, positioning the platform for broader enterprise adoption.
CrowdStrike Investors, Mark Your Calendars for August 27
CrowdStrike is set to release its fiscal 2026 second-quarter earnings after the market closes on Wednesday, August 27, and anticipation is building. For the quarter, the cybersecurity leader projects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.82 to $0.84, with revenue expected between $1.14 billion and $1.15 billion.
Showing increased confidence, management has raised its full-year earnings guidance to $3.44–$3.56 per share, while holding its revenue outlook steady at $4.74–$4.81 billion. That said, analysts remain watchful, projecting that CrowdStrike will continue to post a loss on a GAAP basis, with Q2 losses forecast at $0.19 per share, reflecting higher operating expenses tied to growth initiatives and innovation investments.
Even so, the company’s expanding Falcon platform, accelerating recurring revenue streams, and steady rollout of advanced AI-driven capabilities are reinforcing its competitive edge in a rapidly growing market, giving investors plenty of reason to keep a close eye on its earnings.
What Do Analysts Think About CrowdStrike Stock?
As the company gears up for its next big reveal, Wall Street appears optimistic about CRWD stock, maintaining a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating overall. Of the 47 analysts covering the stock, a majority of 27 analysts have rated it a “Strong Buy,” three suggest a “Moderate Buy,” 15 analysts are playing it safe with a “Hold,” and the remaining two give a “Strong Sell” rating.
CRWD stock’s average analyst price target of $483.65 signals 11% potential upside from current levels, while the Street-high target of $575 indicates that it can rally as much as 32% from here.

But for some, the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) recent advisory opinion on state's legal obligations in the face of climate change could emerge as a watershed moment for financial markets.
Günther Thallinger, a board member at Allianz, one of the world's biggest insurers, said that close watchers of the ICJ's July 23 ruling described it as perhaps the most significant climate development since the 2015 Paris Agreement.
At the time, the pronouncement marked the ICJ's first-ever opinion on climate change and laid out that climate action is not optional.
The court said in a unanimous ruling that governments and countries have a legal obligation to protect the environment from greenhouse gas emissions, protect present and future generations from the climate crisis and to cooperate internationally.
Notably, the ICJ also found that fossil fuel production, including licensing and subsidies, ""may constitute an internationally wrongful act which is attributable to that State.""
This opinion for investors, for capital market participants, really means something.Günther ThallingerBoard member at Allianz
The ruling, which was the brainchild of young law students in low-lying Pacific island states and championed by the government of Vanuatu, is widely expected to have far-reaching legal and political consequences.
Speaking in a personal capacity, Thallinger said that while the ICJ's opinion is based on existing law and conventions, the ruling could yet have meaningful ramifications for a vast range of assets — whether one cares about climate change or not.
""If one takes as an investor what the International Court of Justice just said, then a revaluation of these assets needs to happen. Every prudent investor must do this now,"" Thallinger told CNBC by video call.
""Even if they don't like the discussion around climate change, even if they would say they denigrate the Court of Justice completely, they must expect that, in some countries, some governments, some courts are going to follow this opinion,"" Thallinger said.
""If they follow this opinion, it has asset valuation implications, quite clearly. So, this opinion for investors, for capital market participants, really means something.""
Licensing and subsidies
On the issue of licensing and subsidies, Thallinger said the ICJ's ruling could prove to be a significant development.
That's because licensing and permitting for the mining sector, for example, and government subsidies for fossil fuels could be at risk following the court opinion. The burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas is the chief driver of the climate crisis.
""If subsides are unlawful, then one should expect that subsidies are somehow stopped at a certain point in time,"" Thallinger said.
""Now, certain business processes live on these subsidies or at least benefit to a certain degree on these subsidies. And, as always for an investor, usually you look simply at the cashflow, and if the cashflow part is missing or all of a sudden becomes much smaller then that means another valuation,"" he added.
The U.S. and China, the world's two biggest carbon emitters, provided a mixed response to the ICJ's ruling.
""As always, President Trump and the entire administration is committed to putting America first and prioritizing the interests of everyday Americans,"" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in response to the court opinion, Reuters reported.
A spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, said the ruling has a ""positive significance"" for advancing international climate cooperation and sought to reaffirm the Asian country's status as a developing country.
Mixed signals
Not everyone is as concerned about the ICJ's ruling from an investor standpoint.
""I feel like the wide spectrum of views that exist in the investor community on climate change, and the action that investors are supposed to take, will probably mean that the decision is a bit of a Rorschach test,"" Lindsey Stewart, director of institutional insights for Morningstar, told CNBC by video call.
""People are just going to see things that kind of confirm their existing view,"" he added.
A Rorschach test refers to a psychological assessment during which a person is asked to describe what they see in a series of inkblots.
Ida Kassa Johannesen, head of commercial ESG at Saxo Bank, said the ICJ's intervention is a non-binding advisory opinion, rather than a ruling, ""and this distinction is crucial.""

Companies with significant environmental footprints, such as those in the oil and gas, mining and heavy industry sectors, are likely to face increased litigation risk, which could affect their costs, valuation and reputation, Johannesen told CNBC by email.
""As a result, investors and particular large institutional investors may begin to reallocate capital away from high-risk sectors to manage exposure to climate-related legal and reputational risks,"" she added.
Saxo Bank's Johannesen pointed out that the U.S. and China both expressed reservations about the ICJ's opinion, emphasizing its non-binding nature and calling for flexibility in climate action.
The Trump administration also recently signed into law the U.S. president's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a package that is favorable to mining and oil and gas companies.
""All this sends mixed signals which would probably lead to fragmented market responses between the world's 2 largest economies and the [rest of the world], slow down global regulatory convergence and ultimately limit the (short-term) impact on markets and investor behavior,"" Johannesen said.
A spokesperson at ABP, one of Europe's largest pension funds, welcomed what they billed as ""the spirit"" of the court's opinion, but said they do not anticipate any short-term ramifications for financial markets.
""The ICJ's advisory opinion sends a signal that climate inaction may constitute a breach of international law. However, given its non-binding nature, we don't expect immediate changes in national policies or financial markets,"" an ABP spokesperson told CNBC by email.
The Dutch pension fund, which doesn't invest in fossil fuels and says it actively supports climate solutions, highlighted that Europe, for example, already has a lot of climate legislation in place.",d89d36bdf938b107c3828a55f66064d2,trafilatura,6450,0

When shares of the Peter Thiel-backed cryptocurrency exchange more than doubled out of the gate on Wednesday before finishing the day up 84%, it was the latest sign that the tech IPO bulls are back in business.
In July, design software vendor Figma more than tripled in its New York Stock Exchange debut, and a month earlier shares of crypto firm Circle soared 168% in their first day on the Big Board.
Wall Street has been waiting a long time for this.
Three years ago, steep inflation and soaring interest effectively closed the market for public offerings. Tech stocks tanked and private capital dried up, forcing cash-burning startups to turn their attention away from growth and toward efficiency and profitability.
The roadblock appeared to be loosening earlier this year, when companies like StubHub and Klarna filed their prospectuses, but then President Donald Trump roiled the markets in April with his plans for sweeping tariffs. Roadshows were put on indefinite hold.
The president's tariff agenda has since stabilized a bit, and investor money is pouring into tech, pushing the Nasdaq to record levels, up more than 40% from this year's low in April. Optimism is growing that the hefty backlog of high-valued startups will continue to clear as CEOs and venture capitalists gain confidence that the public markets will welcome their top-tier companies.
Ahead of Figma's debut, NYSE president Lynn Martin told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" that immense demand for that offering could ""open the floodgates"" for the rest of the market. And earlier this week, Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman told ""Fast Money"" that there's a ""very healthy list"" of companies looking to IPO in the second half of this year, ahead of the holiday season.
""I've been meeting a lot of CEOs, getting them prepared to think about what they want in the public markets and where they're going,"" Friedman said.
There are more than two-dozen venture-backed U.S. tech companies valued at $10 billion or more, according to CB Insights. StubHub has updated its prospectus, suggesting an offering is coming soon.
""The IPO window is open,"" said Rick Heitzmann, a partner at venture firm FirstMark, in an interview with CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" this week. ""You've seen across industry, broad-based support for IPOs, and therefore, we're advising companies we're investing in to get ready and go public.""
Another big topic among VCs and bankers is the regulatory environment.
The Biden administration took heat from startup investors for cracking down on big acquisitions, mostly attributable to Lina Khan's perceived heavy hand at the Federal Trade Commission, while also failing to ease restrictions that they say make it less appealing for companies to go public than to stay private.
Paul Atkins, the new head of the SEC, said in July he wants to ""make IPOs great again,"" by removing some of the impediments around the complexity of disclosures and litigation risk. He hasn't offered many specific recommendations.
Friedman told CNBC that the first conversation she had with Atkins after he took the job was about making it easier and more attractive for companies to go public.
""The conversation was constructive along many fronts, looking at disclosure requirements, the proxy process, other things that really make it harder for companies to be public and navigate the public markets,"" Friedman said. ""He's as interested as we are, so hopefully we'll turn that into great action.""
In addition to the big gains notched by Bullish, Figma and Circle, the public markets welcomed online banking provider Chime with a 37% gain last month and trading app eToro with a 29% pop in May. The health-tech market has seen two IPOs: Hinge Health and Omada Health.
But it was the roaring debuts of Circle and Figma that sparked chatter of a new bull market for IPOs. Figma jumped 250% on IPO day after pricing shares a dollar ahead of an updated range. Circle's value more than doubled after the stablecoin issuer also priced above the expected range.
That sort of price action reignited a debate ahead of the last IPO boom in 2020 and 2021, when venture capitalist Bill Gurley made the case that big first-day pops suggest intentionally mispriced offerings that hurt the company and hand easy money to new investors. Gurley has advocated for direct listings, where companies list shares at a price that effectively matches demand.
As Figma was hitting the market, Gurley was back at it, referring to the big gains as an ""expected & fully intentional"" outcome benefitting clients of major investment banks
""They bought it at $33 last night and can sell it today for over $90,"" he wrote. In a follow-up post, he said, ""I would have loved to see DLs replace IPOs — it just makes sense to match supply/demand. But Wall Street may just be too addicted to the massive customer give-aways.""
Lise Buyer, founder of IPO advisory firm Class V Group, wrote on LinkedIn that the company gets to make the call on where it prices the stock and that plenty of thought gets put into the process. Also, in the IPO, companies are selling only a small percentage of outstanding shares — in Figma's case roughly 7% — so if they deliver on results, ""there will very likely be plenty of future opportunities to sell more shares at higher prices.""
That's already happening.
Circle said this week that it's offering another 10 million shares in a secondary offering. And on Friday's, CNBC's Leslie Picker reported that bankers for CoreWeave, which is up 150% since its March IPO, orchestrated some block trades this week.
But Buyer warns that tech markets have a history of overheating. While there's always a difference between what institutions are willing to pay in an IPO and what exuberant retail investors will pay, it's currently ""a gap like we haven't really seen since 1999, 2000,"" Buyer told CNBC, adding ""and, of course, we know how that ended.""
Compared to the dot-com bubble, businesses that are going public now have sizable revenue and actual fundamentals, but that doesn't mean the IPO pops are sustainable, she said.
""It's almost like we had several years of Prohibition,"" Buyer said, referring to a period a century ago when alcohol was banned in the U.S. ""Folks, in some cases, are drinking to excess in the IPO market.""",5a1e683d963e784e5014c881294b22b2,trafilatura,6364,0

The U.K. index — home to some of the world's most renowned companies, including AstraZeneca , Shell , Unilever and Rolls-Royce — briefly climbed to an all-time intraday high on Friday, following four consecutive days of gains. It has since erased gains for the session, trading 0.2% lower by 1:53 p.m. in London (8:53 a.m. ET). .FTSE YTD line FTSE 100 price So far this year, the FTSE 100 has jumped 12.4%. In comparison, Wall Street's S & P 500 is up by just under 10% since the beginning of 2025, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen by 5.6%. America's tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up 12.4%. Compared to other major regional markets, the FTSE 100 has performed relatively well this year. While it hasn't recorded the blockbuster returns of the German DAX – which is up 22.6% year-to-date – or Spain's IBEX 35 – which has surged almost 32% higher this year – it has outperformed the Swiss SMI index, Sweden's OMX Stockholm 30 , the French CAC 40 and the pan-European Stoxx 600 . Can the FTSE 100 go higher? ""The decent yield and ongoing wave of takeovers both suggest there may still be value to be had in the UK market, given consensus forecasts for earnings and dividend growth,"" Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, told CNBC in an email on Friday. ""No-one seemed interested in the U.K. equity market at the start of the year, other than to bash it for failing to attract more new flotations and the defection of some companies to other exchanges, but what is unloved can also be undervalued. And valuation is the ultimate arbiter of investment return."" While the U.K. index is currently on track for its fifth consecutive year of gains, questions over London's appeal have been circulating for some time, with companies opting to list in alternative markets . Concerns about the U.K.'s economy and competitive edge post-Brexit have also weighed on sentiment. Meanwhile, the FTSE 100's tilt toward traditional industries like mining, energy, banks and consumer staples have also raised questions about growth potential in recent years – but many of those sectors, particularly European lenders, have outperformed this year . ""The U.K.'s exposure to sectors like miners, oils and financials means it may also be an option for investors to consider if the Trump administration gets U.S. growth to run hot and inflation does the same as a result,"" Mould said. ""Under such circumstances, long duration assets like technology, where America's indices are heavily represented, could look less attractive, and this would only be an action replay of 2021-22 when value had a go at outperforming growth, if only relatively briefly."" ‘Anywhere But The USA’ Paul Surguy, managing director and head of investment management and proposition at London-based investment manager Kingswood Group, labeled the U.K. stock market as ""the market that everyone loved to hate for some time."" But like Mould, Surguy told CNBC that the tide could be turning for British equity markets, thanks to falling interest rates and the U.K.'s uniquely positive relationship with the White House. ""This [negative sentiment] led valuations to be extremely cheap, especially relative to the U.S. which has its own problems,"" Surguy said Friday by email. Earlier this year, the U.K. became the first country in the world to sign a trade agreement with Washington following U.S. President Donald Trump's unveiling of his so-called ""reciprocal"" tariffs. While Britain wasn't fully spared from new import duties on its goods, the deal significantly softened the blow in comparison to America's other trading partners . Surguy said that the U.K.-U.S. trade deal had helped buoy the investment case for London-listed equities. ""The U.K. is less exposed to U.S. tariff hikes than most countries, with exports of goods to the U.S. only making up 2% of GDP,"" he said. ""And the recent limited trade deal generally sees US tariff increase to 10% – lower than for most other countries."" AJ Bell's Mould said the U.K. was now well positioned to benefit from a trend among investors that has seen a widespread desire to diversify assets to markets outside of the U.S., in light of unpredictable policy changes from the current administration. Some have described this trend the "" Sell America "" or "" Anywhere But the USA "" movement. ""The U.K. could also be benefiting from some investors' desire to at least hedge, if not decrease, their exposure to U.S. dollar-denominated assets, given how well they have done for the last decade and how America's federal debts, style of government and trade policies do not necessarily sit well with all and or the post-1947-GATT-deal consensus that has done so much to lift so many boats on the globalisation tide,"" Mould said. Cashing out Conversely, Iain Barnes, chief investment officer at London-based wealth manager Netwealth, told CNBC on Friday that he was starting to look at markets outside of the U.K. for further opportunities, although he wasn't completely shunning the British market. ""The FTSE has had a cracking year so far, but it's interesting to see the drivers of returns,"" Barnes said. ""More than half of the index's 15% return in 2025 has come from the banks, Rolls Royce and BAE, so it hasn't been based on optimism around UK plc."" Barnes noted that broadly, conditions continue to look favorable for the large banking sector, which should be supportive of further growth in the FTSE 100. ""Despite the FTSE's lacklustre long-term earnings growth, we do like the U.K. market's role in wider equity portfolios thanks to its complementary characteristics with other, faster growing markets,"" Barnes said. ""Yield generation, and bigger energy and materials allocations mean the FTSE often does well when other markets are struggling. However, our latest move has been to reduce the FTSE after its strong performance, targeting more clear yield generation and better value in the U.K. commercial property sector on a cyclical view, as well as seeking more exciting performance potential in Japan and across emerging markets.""",9c70b47bb63a99104bcef4d29a872bbe,trafilatura,6323,0

According to Bank of America Institute’s latest report, Consumer Checkpoint: Gains and Gaps, higher-income households are enjoying accelerating wage growth and increased spending, while lower-income households face slowing pay gains and flat expenditure—marking the widest such divide in more than four years.
The institute’s research, based on aggregated and anonymized deposit and transaction data, reveals that after-tax wages for the lowest-income tercile grew just 1.3% year over year (YOY) in July, down from 1.6% in June. In contrast, higher-income wage growth accelerated to 3.2% YOY—its third consecutive monthly increase.
The result is the biggest gap between top and bottom earners’ wage growth since February 2021—a warning sign for the economy despite a strong overall spending picture. Bank of America Institute senior economist David Tinsley told Fortune in an interview: “In some sense, we had an improvement in lower-income wage growth since the pandemic, and now that’s gone into reverse.”
Coming out of the pandemic was a “very unusual situation,” Tinsley added, and lower-income households genuinely did see stronger wage growth than other areas of the economy.
“There was a narrowing of wealth inequality, and now it’s widening,” Tinsley said, though cautioned it was “early days.” Still, when he looks at what’s happening to higher- and lower-income Americans, he says, “the divergence is quite stark.”
Overall consumer activity picks up
Tinsley emphasized the overall consumer picture is “fairly healthy,” and his team’s research on the latest data shows total credit and debit card spending per household rose 1.8% YOY in July, the fastest pace since January. On a seasonally adjusted basis, spending climbed 0.6% month over month (MOM), following a 0.4% gain in June.
Notably, the rebound was broad-based, as services spending surged 0.9% month over month, the strongest increase since April 2024, after three straight months of declines. Retail spending (excluding gasoline and restaurants) also edged higher, though part of the lift came from temporary factors such as extended Prime Day–style online promotions and a late surge in back-to-school shopping.
Tinsley and his team cautioned these boosts may fade. Some of July’s uptick may reflect “buy-ahead” behavior linked to the Aug. 1 trade-deal deadline, as consumers sought to avoid potential tariff-related price hikes. Overall, temporary promotional spikes and inflation pass-through from tariffs complicate the picture. Retail transaction volumes rose more modestly than spending values, hinting higher prices, rather than greater quantities, may have driven part of the increase.
The widening wage gap tracks closely with labor market shifts. Recent Bureau of Labor Statistics revisions show a sharp slowdown in payroll growth in the second quarter of 2025, with the biggest step-downs in low-wage industries such as retail, wholesale, leisure, and hospitality.
Bank of America deposit data indicates only a modest 4% year-over-year rise in the number of lower-income households receiving unemployment payments, compared with 10% increases among middle- and higher-income households. This suggests low-wage workers are not losing jobs in large numbers, but are instead facing reduced hours or muted pay growth.
Spending divergence now clear-cut
The spending data mirrors the pay trends. “Lower-income households aren’t really spending,” Tinsley told Fortune, finding that their spending growth was flat (0% year over year) in the three months to July. Higher-income households posted 1.8% year-over-year growth, with middle-income households up 1.0%.
While the lowest-income 30% of households account for less than 15% of total U.S. consumer spending, their purchases matter for sectors dependent on high transaction volumes, such as discount retail, quick-service restaurants, and budget travel. More important, Bank of America’s internal data shows the share of lower-income spending devoted to discretionary categories has barely changed since last year, suggesting they have not yet resorted to cutting nonessentials—but their capacity for future cutbacks remains small.
No early signs of consumer distress—yet
One potentially reassuring takeaway is the absence of typical distress indicators. Retail returns are not rising—the downtrend that began in 2022 has merely flattened, while deposit balances remain above 2019 levels even after adjusting for inflation, and credit card borrowing habits remain healthier than pre-pandemic. However, beneath these broad measures are hints of strain: Among lower-income households that do carry month-to-month card balances, credit card utilization rates have risen faster than in other groups since 2019.
Even with slower wage growth at the bottom, the institute concludes household finances overall remain “sound.” Continued elevated savings, relatively low revolving credit usage, and stable borrowing capacity suggest consumers still possess spending firepower—a key factor supporting the economy’s resilience so far this year.
That said, the report notes middle- and higher-income households are doing much of the heavy lifting.
As Tinsley’s team observed: “From a macroeconomic perspective, it is reassuring that middle- and higher-income households’ spending growth does not appear to be weakening like it has for lower-income households,” noting the lowest 30% of households by income account for less than 15% of overall U.S. consumer spending. Still, the team added, “there are broader socioeconomic concerns around any slowdown in lower-income households’ wages and spending.”
When asked by Fortune to expand on these broader socioeconomic concerns, Tinsley said: “There’s some time to go before this becomes really telling.” He estimated the economy is at least a year or maybe as much as 18 months away from truly reversing all the progress on wealth inequality that was seen coming out of the pandemic, but he said there’s no doubt about it. The widening wealth inequality picture “creates complexities going forward.”

It’s not every day the sitting president warns of a looming economic disaster in his own country — but that’s exactly what U.S. President Donald Trump just did.
“If a Radical Left Court ruled against us at this late date, in an attempt to bring down or disturb the largest amount of money, wealth creation and influence the U.S.A. has ever seen, it would be impossible to ever recover, or pay back, these massive sums of money and honor. It would be 1929 all over again, a GREAT DEPRESSION!” Trump wrote in a recent post on Truth Social.
The warning comes as a federal appeals court hears arguments on the legality of his tariff policy. Trump added that if the court were to rule against him, “they should have done so LONG AGO,” claiming, “there is no way America could recover from such a judicial tragedy.”
He also credited tariffs for the U.S. stock market’s recent performance. “Tariffs are having a huge positive impact on the Stock Market. Almost every day, new records are set,” he wrote.
It’s true stocks have been on a tear, with the S&P 500 recently hitting fresh highs. But back in April — when Trump first unveiled his sweeping tariffs — markets plunged. They only began to rebound after he softened his stance and scaled back some measures.
Many experts disagree with Trump’s view that striking down tariffs would be an economic blow. Even economist Peter Schiff, who backed Trump in the 2024 election, argues the tariffs are hurting Americans, not foreign countries.
“The media is helping Trump deceive the public by reporting that he's hitting other countries with tariffs. In reality, he's hitting American consumers who buy imports from those countries with tariffs,” Schiff said in a recent post on X. “We are being taxed, and our freedom to choose what we buy is being abridged.”
Others see a court ruling against tariffs as a potential boost.
“If courts shoot down the tariffs, it would be complicated — but a huge positive. There would be a massive celebration,” Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, told CNN.
While the outcome of the court battle remains uncertain, Trump’s stark warning underscores a broader concern: how quickly political and geopolitical events can rattle markets. For investors, it’s a reminder that safeguarding wealth often means turning to assets that can hold their value in times of turmoil — from global trade tensions to the threat of a severe economic downturn.
A safe haven shines again
When uncertainty looms, gold has a way of reclaiming the spotlight.
Long seen as the ultimate safe haven, gold isn’t tied to any single country, currency or economy. It can’t be created at will by central banks like fiat money, and in times of economic turmoil or geopolitical uncertainty, investors tend to pile in — driving up its value.
Over the past 12 months, the price of gold has surged more than 35%.

Ray Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, recently highlighted gold’s importance in a resilient portfolio.
“People don't have, typically, an adequate amount of gold in their portfolio,” Dalio told CNBC earlier this year. “When bad times come, gold is a very effective diversifier.”
One way to invest in gold that also provides significant tax advantages is to open a gold IRA with the help of Thor Metals.
Gold IRAs allow investors to hold physical gold or gold-related assets within a retirement account, which combines the tax advantages of an IRA with the protective benefits of investing in gold, making it an attractive option for those looking to potentially hedge their retirement funds against economic uncertainties.

The asset that made Trump rich
If gold is the common go-to hedge for moments of chaos, real estate is the long game — and no one knows that better than Trump himself.
Before politics, Trump made his fortune in real estate — and the asset class remains a powerful tool for building and preserving wealth, especially during inflationary times. That’s because property values and rental income tend to rise along with the cost of living.
Unlike some other investments, real estate doesn’t need a roaring stock market to deliver returns. Even during downturns, high-quality properties can generate rental income — offering a dependable stream of passive cash flow.
As Trump told Steve Forbes back in 2011, “I just notice that when you have that right piece of property, whatever it might be, including location, it tends to work well in good times and in bad times.”
Today, you don’t need to buy a property outright to benefit from real estate investing. Crowdfunding platforms like Arrived offer an easier way to get exposure to this income-generating asset class.
The process is simple: browse a curated selection of homes that have been vetted for their appreciation and income potential. Once you find a property you like, select the number of shares you’d like to purchase, and then sit back as you start receiving any positive rental income distributions from your investment.
Another option is First National Realty Partners (FNRP), which allows accredited investors to diversify their portfolio through grocery-anchored commercial properties without taking on the responsibilities of being a landlord.
With a minimum investment of $50,000, investors can own a share of properties leased by national brands like Whole Foods, Kroger and Walmart, which provide essential goods to their communities. Thanks to Triple Net (NNN) leases, where the tenant covers property expenses such as property taxes and insurance, accredited investors are able to invest in these properties without worrying about such costs cutting into their potential returns.

Starbucks, they argued, should have smaller stores, employ fewer people and cut prices, according to people familiar with a stake sale process that kicked off in May who asked not to be identified for discussing private matters. These proposals resemble the very model that enabled Luckin Coffee Inc. to overtake Starbucks as China’s biggest coffee chain two years ago by selling coffee at one-third of its price.
Most of the prospective investors want a controlling stake of the Seattle-based company’s Chinese business. And while Starbucks has said it’ll only partner with an investor aligned with its vision, the process has put its local Chinese management team on tenterhooks, worried that a brand they’ve spent decades building will become just another low-price, trend-following chain, said people familiar with the matter.
The stake sale exercise is underscoring Starbucks’ identity crisis in China as it tries to salvage a flagging legacy business amid fierce domestic competition — a problem that has afflicted other foreign brands as China’s economy undergoes major shifts. What Starbucks chooses to do in China will decide whether it ends up successful like McDonald’s Corp., or faltering like Apple Inc.
Starbucks is “in a tough position,” said Mark Tanner, managing director of consultancy China Skinny in Shanghai. “Many cost-conscious consumers are opting for cheaper alternatives, but trying to compete on price will be a race to the bottom, destroying any margins they currently hold.”
A spokeswoman for Starbucks declined to comment but referred to comments regarding its China business recovery and stake sale process in its most recent earnings.
Starbucks brought the cafe experience to China in the 1990s, and as China’s economic growth soared, its footprint expanded in tandem to bring its total number of stores there to over 7,800. In recent years, however, Western brands have been losing ground to local names amid rising nationalism and reluctance to pay premiums for brands.
The very few American brands that still thrive in China’s great consumer pullback made successful adaptations to their business. Yum China Holdings Inc.’s KFC incorporated street food and local delicacies into its menu and offers cost-conscious consumers meal deals all year long. Walmart Inc.’s Sam’s Club taps into the middle class’s craving for exclusivity and growing health consciousness with high-quality private label snacks and premium meat cuts.
Starbucks seems stuck in between those models. While its “third place” store format is expensive to upkeep, customers have become less willing to pay higher prices for its drinks since the Covid pandemic and ongoing economic downturn. Compounding the problem was previous China Chief Executive Officer Belinda Wong’s tendency to hew more closely to the company’s strategy in developed Western markets, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Wong rejected ideas like a lower-price spinoff chain before Covid, as well as more localized campaigns during the pandemic, the people said, citing a belief that they conflicted with Starbucks’ brand.
New initiatives have been launched rapidly since new CEO Molly Liu took over in late 2024. These included a cheaper line of tea-based drinks and sugar-free options, and tie-ups with the movie and Taiwanese rock band Mayday, all under the aegis of a new chief growth officer. Liu’s understanding of the Chinese market enables different ideas to be discussed and approved more easily, the people said.
“Starbucks’ new product innovation and marketing campaigns this year show it’s digging deeper to explore the demand of Chinese consumers,” said Roolee Lu, Shanghai-based director of consultancy Mintel Group Ltd. “They want new products, they want emotional connection with brands, they need some comprehensive, immersive experiences.”
There are signs of a turnaround. Based on conversations with three store managers in Shanghai, drinks co-branded with Mayday drove their May sales by as much as 20% in their stores. Overall, the most recent quarter showed sales returning to growth since late 2023 in China, with Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol attributing the success in an earnings call last month to “beverage innovation” and changes to “non-coffee pricing.”
Yet the lack of a clear strategy endures, especially around its stores which, depending on who you ask, are either a vaunted part of brand identity or an expensive cost overhang. The Chinese management team is now experimenting with different ways to bring people in. These include making more stores pet-friendly, providing free-to-use study rooms and targeting store openings in heritage or scenic sites, such as a recent one in Yunnan’s Yulong Snow Mountain.
From the potential investors’ perspective, it isn’t necessary to have large stores if Starbucks aims to capture the needs of busy professionals who are unlikely to linger, though some shops should maintain in-store experiences, said people familiar with the proposals. Cutting the number of staff in stores is also an option, the people said, as many local chains only have one employee as orders are mostly taken online.
Jessica Gleeson, a former Starbucks China executive who now runs her own retail consultancy in Shanghai, said the risk is that the new investor doesn’t understand Starbucks’ positioning in China and turns it into just another “transactional” coffee chain.
“The low-end of the market is already crowded,” she said.
Whichever direction Starbucks China takes, one thing is clear: It’ll regain past glory only if consumers like Jelly Li can be persuaded to become regular customers again.
The 32-year-old musician from Guangzhou was recently at a Starbucks in Shanghai with a view of the Oriental Pearl Tower. She was unimpressed by the orange-flavored ice-shaken espresso she ordered, noting: “Starbucks taught me how to enjoy coffee when I was in college. Now I need coffee every day but no longer pay for Starbucks.”",59e72213414cae4047986241db683a72,trafilatura,6254,0

The real artificial intelligence (AI) opportunity lies in owning the companies supplying the chips, cloud platforms, and enterprise software powering today's AI gold rush.
With $300 billion in infrastructure spending from tech giants this year alone, modern prospectors are investing in computing and networking. The companies selling that infrastructure are the ones striking gold.
For investors who prefer to avoid single-stock risk, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) provides exposure to the AI technology supply chain. Read on to find out more about this top AI vehicle.
The accidental AI fund
This exchange-traded fund (ETF) wasn't designed as an AI play when it was launched in 2004, years before deep learning went mainstream. But through market-cap weighting and technology's winner-take-all dynamics, it has become a strong proxy for the AI build-out.
Nvidia commands 16.7% of the fund, reflecting its stranglehold on the GPU market that powers AI training. Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) represents 14.9%, with its Azure cloud platform hosting everything from OpenAI's ChatGPT to thousands of enterprise AI applications. Apple rounds out the top three at 13%, preparing to push AI features to over 2.35 billion active devices.
The concentration gets more interesting further down. Broadcom, at 4.6%, designs custom AI chips for hyperscalers and supplies the networking gear that keeps data flowing between thousands of processors. Oracle, at 2%, has reinvented itself as an AI cloud provider, winning customers with specialized infrastructure for training large models.
These aren't speculative bets. Microsoft's cloud revenue hit $40.9 billion last quarter, up 21% year over year. Nvidia's data center revenue reached $39.1 billion in its most recent quarter, up 73% relative to the same period a year ago. The AI gold rush is generating real revenue, and this fund captures the companies mining the most gold.
Beyond the mega-caps and long-term performance
The ETF's reach extends beyond its mega-cap holdings, with 319 stocks providing AI exposure across the technology stack. Palantir Technologies (1.6%) delivers AI solutions to government agencies and Fortune 500 clients. Cisco Systems (1.6%) supplies the networking hardware that links together vast AI computing clusters. IBM (1.6%) deploys its Watson AI platform to help enterprises integrate advanced analytics and automation into their operations.
Over the past 15 years, the fund has delivered 19.7% annual total returns (including distributions), turning $10,000 into roughly $155,000. That's about 9 percentage points per year ahead of the benchmark S&P 500 over the same period. That's the power of owning the leaders in the most important technological innovation of our time.
Upside potential, fees, and risk profile
Analysts remain optimistic about the ETF's largest holdings, thanks to AI spending. Morgan Stanley estimates that Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms will invest about $300 billion in AI infrastructure in 2025. That level of investment should directly benefit the ETF's hardware and semiconductor holdings.
On the fee front, investors get this exposure for just $9 per year on a $10,000 investment -- a fraction of what most actively managed tech funds charge.
The ETF has some blind spots. As a fund in the information technology sector, it excludes Amazon and Alphabet entirely, leaving out Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud despite their dominant role in AI. It is also heavily weighted toward Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, so weakness in any of these companies could weigh on performance.
Moreover, technology-sector drawdowns can be severe. The fund declined more than 50% in 2008 and 30% in 2022. Even so, decades of compounding have more than offset the occasional sharp downturn.
The innovation premium

Estimates suggest between 90 and 100 million Indians have owned or used cryptocurrency — roughly 6 to 7% of the country’s 1.4 billion people. The only country to see higher crypto trading volumes over that period? The United States.
On paper, India looks like a crypto powerhouse. In reality, the market is suffocating. Trading volumes on Indian exchanges have cratered since the government introduced a punishing tax regime in 2022: a flat 30% tax on gains, no offsetting losses, and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on every trade.
The industry operates in a gray zone — not banned, but not officially recognized as legal tender — with the Reserve Bank of India maintaining a skeptical stance, as per CNBC TV18.
The result is a curious paradox: millions of Indians hold crypto, but much of the real trading action has gone offshore. Those who remain in the domestic market often find themselves trapped between enthusiasm and exhaustion.
And if there was ever a project to bridge India’s pop culture dominance with its crypto curiosity, it was BollyCoin.
Bollywood meets the blockchain
In 2021, filmmaker Atul Agnihotri — with none other than Salman Khan as the face of the brand — launched BollyCoin with the promise to “bring Bollywood to the blockchain.”
The concept was irresistible: digital collectibles from classic Hindi films, official partnerships with production houses like Salman Khan Films and Arbaaz Khan Productions, and the megastar himself posting, “Kya aap excited ho? [Are you excited] Salman Khan Static NFTs coming on @bollycoin”.
Fans were. Reports show BollyCoin sold its entire pre-sale of 20 million tokens in just 30 days, raising about $2 million. Its first NFT drop featured scenes and assets from the Dabangg franchise, one of Salman’s biggest hits.
The token (BOLLY) ran on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard and later bridged to Polygon for lower transaction fees. The total supply was set at 100 million, and holders could use BOLLY tokens to buy NFTs on the platform.
In 2022, the team introduced a “lock-in” staking scheme where holders could lock tokens for up to 24 months in exchange for monthly USDT payouts. They even launched a “Bolly Council” governance system, allowing the community to vote on project direction.
For a while, it worked. BollyCoin was the perfect storm of Bollywood glamor and blockchain hype.
Until it wasn’t.
At press time, BollyCoin’s official website was defunct. The last post made by the project on their Instagram account dates back to July 2024.
Fade to black
Within a year, marketplace trading volumes collapsed, and the BOLLY token lost more than 90% of its value. By late 2022, the dream of Bollywood’s NFT empire had evaporated.
It wasn’t alone. In the same year, the cricket-themed NFT platform Rario, backed by cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar, was riding high on fan engagement.
Players like Arshdeep Singh even launched their own digital collectibles on Rario. But with the NFT market’s global cooldown and India’s domestic tax squeeze, momentum faded fast.
Other Indian crypto ventures met a similar fate. NanoHealthCare Token (NHCT), launched in 2018 to revolutionize healthcare with blockchain, was abandoned by April 2020. By 2023, dozens of play-to-earn gaming projects had shuttered after failing to sustain token economies.
TheStreet Roundtable reached out to both Rario and BollyCoin for comment but had not received a response by the time of publication.
The failures aren’t just about bad business models — they’re about operating in an environment designed to discourage crypto innovation.
The regulatory squeeze
Since April 2022, every crypto transaction in India — even swapping one coin for another — has attracted a 1% TDS. The 30% tax on profits mirrors the highest slab rate for gambling winnings. Losses can’t be offset against gains, meaning one bad trade can erase the benefit of several good ones for tax purposes.
The government defends these rules as necessary for transparency and tracking, but industry leaders warn they’re killing the domestic market. According to the Esya Centre, a Delhi-based policy think tank, Indian exchanges lost over 81% of their trading volumes in the months after TDS was introduced. Many traders simply moved to offshore platforms that don’t enforce Indian tax rules.
Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India maintains its stance that cryptocurrencies pose risks to financial stability. There’s no roadmap for regulation that might legitimize the industry, leaving projects like BollyCoin in limbo.
India’s 30% tax on crypto gains pulled in about $32.4 million in financial year 2022 to 2023 and $52.7 million in financial year 2023 to 2024, despite no clear regulations for the sector. Data for 2024 to 2025 isn’t available yet, as filings are still underway.
Bollywood couldn’t beat the blockade
BollyCoin’s collapse says as much about India’s crypto climate as it does about the fickle nature of NFT hype cycles. From 2021 to 2025, the trading volume of the NFT market decreased by 93%.
Even with Salman Khan’s star power and a built-in Bollywood fanbase, the project couldn’t escape the gravity of declining NFT interest, low domestic liquidity, and high barriers to participation.
When India’s grassroots adoption numbers are so high, you’d expect more homegrown crypto success stories. But the few that have tried — from Bollywood NFTs to cricket collectibles — have mostly fizzled. Not because Indians aren’t interested, but because the environment doesn’t reward sticking around.
The irony is sharp: India is a global leader in Web3 talent, with its developers powering major projects abroad, yet its domestic crypto economy is locked in survival mode.
And it’s also a reminder: mass adoption doesn’t always mean mass participation. Tens of millions of Indians may own crypto, but until the rules change, the country’s biggest crypto plays will keep premiering somewhere else.
After all, if even Salman Khan couldn’t keep the cameras rolling, what chance does anyone else have?",844668da8e7c4aa02926a35deb633cbd,trafilatura,6111,0

But the figures also underscore anxiety among Americans: all the uncertainty around the expansive duties appears to be pushing them to step up their purchases of furniture and other items ahead of the expected price increases, analysts said.
Retail sales rose a solid 0.5% last month from the previous month, and June spending was stronger than expected, according to the Commerce Department's report released Friday. June's retail sales were revised upward to 0.9% from the original 0.6% increase, the agency said. The pace in July matched economists' estimates.
The increases followed two consecutive months of spending declines in April and May.
Excluding auto sales, which have been volatile since Trump imposed tariffs on many foreign-made cares, retail sales rose 0.3% in July.
Auto sales rose 1.6%. They appear to have returned roughly to normalized spending after a surge in March and April as Americans attempted to get ahead of Trump’s 25% duty on imported cars and parts and then a slump after that, according to Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
The data showed solid spending across various stores. Business at clothing stores and online retailers saw increases. Business at home furnishings and furniture stores had strong sales gains.
However, at electronics stores, sales were down. And business at restaurants, the lone services component within the Census Bureau report and a barometer of discretionary spending, also fell, as shoppers eat at home to save money.
A category of sales that excludes volatile sectors such as gas, cars, and restaurants rose last month by 0.5% from the previous month. The figure feeds into the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s consumption estimate and is sign that consumers are still spending on some discretionary items.
Tuan Nguyen, an economist at RSM US, noted the difficulty of attributing the entire July gain to resilient American shoppers given so much uncertainty surrounding the economy and tariffs. A sizable portion of the gain likely came from rising prices of imported goods under the impact of tariffs, he said.
Nguyen also noted he can't dismiss the possibility that consumers once again pulled forward their spending ahead of the August tariff deadline, taking advantage of Amazon Prime Day sales as well as competing sales from the likes of Walmart and Target.
In fact, Nguyen noted the sharp rise in furniture sales, for example, appeared to indicate shoppers were trying to get ahead of the duties.
“There is nothing fundamentally wrong with American households that would suggest a spending recession given that shoppers are in a strong enough financial position to accelerate purchases,” he wrote. ""With so much noise in the data, the rest of the year promises to be a wild and bumpy ride.”
Earlier this month, the Labor Department reported that U.S. hiring is slowing sharply as Trump’s trade policies paralyze businesses and raise concerns about the outlook for the world’s largest economy. U.S. employers added just 73,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department reported, well short of the 115,000 expected.
Another government report, issued Tuesday, on U.S. inflation showed that inflation was unchanged in July as rising prices for some imported goods were offset by declining gas and grocery prices, leaving overall prices modestly higher than a year ago.
Consumer prices rose 2.7% in July from a year earlier, the same as the previous month and up from a post-pandemic low of 2.3% in April. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.2% in July, down from 0.3% the previous month, while core prices ticked up 0.3%, a bit faster than the 0.2% in June.
The new numbers suggest that slowing rent increases and cheaper gas are offsetting some impacts of Trump’s sweeping tariffs.
Many businesses are also likely still absorbing much of the cost of the duties. The consumer price figures likely reflect some impact from the 10% universal tariff Trump imposed in April, as well as higher duties on countries such as China and Canada.
The Labor Department reported Thursday that its producer price index — which measures inflation before it hits consumers— rose 0.9% last month from June, biggest jump in more than three years.
The report comes as major retailers like Walmart and Target are slated to report their fiscal second-quarter earnings reports starting next week. Analysts will study the reports to get insight into the state of consumer behavior. But they will also monitor how much stores are passing on the tariffs costs to shoppers.
In May, Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, warned t hat it had increased prices on bananas imported from Costa Rica from 50 cents per pound to 54 cents, but it noted that a large sting for shoppers wouldn't start to appear until June and July.
But a growing list of companies including Procter & Gamble, e.lf. Cosmetics, Black & Decker and Ralph Lauren told investors in recent weeks that they plan to or have already raised prices.
Some are trying to be selective and focusing on raising prices on just their premium products as a way to offset the higher costs from tariffs.
Warby Parker, which has been shifting their sourcing away from China, told analysts last Thursday that it plans to keep its $95 option. But it’s increasing prices on select lens types. It also wants to cater more to older shoppers who need more expensive progressive lens. Warby Parker said that progressives, trifocals and bifocals make up roughly 40% of all prescription units sold industrywide.
But just 23% of Warby Parker’s business now is made up of progressives, its highest priced offering and offer the highest profit margins.
“We were able to quickly roll out select strategic price increases that have benefited our growth,” Neil Blumenthal, co-chairman and co-founder and co-CEO of Warby Parker, told analysts last week.",2f2c2766e66d7be02c7bca67096297cf,trafilatura,6057,0

These are the businesses that are making money from AI right now as AI hyperscalers and cloud infrastructure providers are rapidly building out their capacity to support AI training and inference.
Even though many chip stocks have undergone massive growth over the past few years, I think their futures are still incredibly bright. In particular, I think these three are still no-brainer buys right now.
Nvidia
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is a fabless chip company -- it designs chips, but doesn't fabricate them internally. Instead, it farms out the manufacturing work. Its most in-demand products are its graphics processing units (GPUs), which have become the primary computing unit for AI, primarily because, as parallel processors, they are ideally suited to handle the types of computing tasks AI systems perform. Further, GPUs can be connected in clusters to amplify this effect.
Over the past few years, Nvidia has delivered impressive and fairly steady sales growth on a dollar basis, although on a percentage basis, that growth rate has naturally moderated a bit lately.
Still, 69% revenue growth is nothing to be disappointed about, and the 50% growth that management is projecting for Q2 is also impressive considering Nvidia's sheer size.
Some investors may be worried that demand for its chips may slow, but projections from the AI hyperscalers -- its largest customers -- indicate that 2026 will be another record year for capital expenditures, which bodes well for Nvidia. Additionally, under a deal President Trump announced Monday, Nvidia will receive a license to export its H20 chips to China, in exchange for which the company will pay the U.S. government 15% of the revenues from those chips. With the U.S. imposing restrictions on the sales of top-of-the-line, cutting-edge chips to China, the H20 was designed specifically to be somewhat less powerful, and thus exportable without running afoul of Washington's trade policy.
Although over the long term, Nvidia has been one of the best-performing stocks of all time, it still has plenty of room to continue growing at a rapid pace, making it a great stock to buy now.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) is Nvidia's chip fabricator, but it also produces chips for other tech giants like AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Its manufacturing technology is second to none, and it has become the leading semiconductor foundry worldwide.
While some may be concerned that its headquarters are so close to mainland China, on an island that the government in Beijing still lays claim to, Taiwan Semiconductor is working to diversify its production away from Taiwan by building fabrication facilities worldwide. Its biggest investments of this type are in the U.S., where it plans to spend $165 billion on expanding its facilities in Arizona.
Management sees strong growth in demand for its services for the foreseeable future: It expects its AI revenue will grow at a 45% compound annual rate over the next five years, and projects that total revenue will increase at a 20% compound annual rate. Strong growth like that should allow Taiwan Semiconductor to remain a market-beating stock.
ASML
ASML(NASDAQ: ASML) is a critical supplier of tools for the chip industry. It has a technological monopoly on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, which are irreplaceable in the production of cutting-edge chips. These machines lay the microscopic electrical traces on chips, and ASML's technology allows fabricators to make smaller transistors and other components -- and thus denser, more powerful chips.
With ASML being the only company in the world able to build EUV lithography machines, any time you hear about new production facilities for high-end chips being built, you can assume that ASML is benefiting. However, because it's based in the Netherlands, any ASML machine coming into the U.S. will be subject to tariffs, which management noted is making it difficult to make sales and earnings forecasts for 2026. However, on its second-quarter earnings call, management reaffirmed its longer-term 2030 guidance for revenues of 44 billion euros to 60 billion euros, indicating it expects the turbulence to be a short-term phenomenon.
ASML's technological moat is currently unassailable, and the company is a key partner for chip producers worldwide. As long as demand for cutting-edge silicon continues to rise over the long term, so will ASML's stock, making it a no-brainer buy today.

President Trump’s plan to repay the debt centers on tariffs, cost-cutting, and growth programs. Critics argue the impact is likely to be minimal. Meanwhile, White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai told Fortune the debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen under Trump and will keep improving with pro-growth policies and record tariff revenues.
President Trump has got plenty of ideas about how he’ll address national debt: He’ll pay it down through tariffs, or offset some of the borrowing thanks to proceeds from his “golden visa” program.
He’s also said he’ll rebalance the debt-to-GDP ratio by growing the economy, and would reduce the need for as much borrowing thanks to initiatives like the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
This month, America’s national debt surpassed $37 trillion—a record milestone that the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) had previously believed would be hit by 2030. But one pandemic later, the gargantuan spending the government undertook to steer the economy through the crisis is making its mark.
Uncle Sam is adding a trillion more dollars to the debt burden every five months, noted Michael A. Peterson, CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, an organization that works with policymakers, economists, and the public to advocate for a more sustainable fiscal outlook.
“During a time of economic growth, it is highly irresponsible to run deficits this large … At this pace, we will run through the recent $5 trillion debt limit increase—the largest in history—in just two years. We are no longer in a Great Recession or a global pandemic, but our fiscal policy keeps acting like we are,” Peterson said.
“As our debt continues to rise,” he noted, “at some point the financial markets will lose confidence in our ability to overcome the politics to solve this problem. International lenders are watching, and all three ratings agencies have now downgraded U.S. credit. The question is, How many more trillions will we add before we decide to stop? Despite today’s unfortunate milestone, it’s not too late to act. We should reform our budget before the damage is made even worse. Policymakers have many well-known options to stabilize our debt and put us on a stronger path for the next generation.”
White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai countered to Fortune: “America’s debt-to-GDP ratio has actually declined since President Trump took office—and as the administration’s pro-growth policies of tax cuts, rapid deregulation, more efficient government spending, and fair trade deals continue taking effect and America’s economic resurgence accelerates, that ratio will continue trending in the right direction.
“That’s on top of the record revenue that President Trump’s tariff policies are bringing in for the federal government.”
Peterson isn’t alone in his concern. Over the past few years, alarm bells are increasingly being rung by some of the most notable names in finance and economics. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon believes it is the “most predictable crisis” in history. Ray Dalio believes it will trigger an “economic heart attack,” and the usually neutral Jerome Powell says it’s past time for an “adult conversation” about the issue.
Trump’s national debt policies
Thus far, the White House’s cost-cutting and revenue-raising initiatives haven’t been without success. At the time of writing, DOGE’s savings calculator claims to have axed $202 billion from the government’s bottom line.
That figure equates to $1,254.66 in savings per taxpayer. However, given the fact that debt per capita, at the time of writing, sits at a little over $108,000 per person in America, the organization formerly headed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk still has a long way to go.
Likewise, President Trump’s tariffs have generated significant returns in the past few months. This week the CRFB reported tariff revenue into the U.S. has more than tripled from approximately $7 billion last year to approximately $25 billion in late July.
Such figures are not to be sniffed at (wherever you come down in the debate about whether American consumers or foreign counterparts will be paying the price), and revenues are expected to continue rising.
That said, $25 billion still equates to less than 0.07% of the national debt at the time of writing. If the U.S. continued to plow every penny of its current tariff revenue into national debt as it stands, it would still take nearly 120 years to pay off.
And of course, that figure and its respective interest payment is going up by the minute.
All of the above comes ahead of the issue of President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which the Congressional Budget Office estimates will add $3 trillion to the deficit between 2025 and 2034.
The White House counters that the act will rebalance the all-important debt-to-GDP ratio, which is the fundamental concern of economists. The ratio is key because it signals to foreign investors whether the growth and size of America’s economy is enough to balance its debts. If the ratio falls too out of balance, foreign buyers of American debt may fear they won’t receive their returns, or demand higher interest rates to offset the risk.
The government can take action on either side of the ratio to rebalance the books. It can either increase growth to bring down the disparity, or cut spending to reduce the debt.
The current ratio is at 121%, the St. Louis Fed reports (down from Q4 of 2024 at 122%), and the White House insists this will fall further to 94% because the OBBBA will generate economic activity. “President Trump is supersizing hardworking Americans’ paychecks and restoring fiscal sanity, helping solve our debt crisis for the long run,” the White House wrote in June.",3f6c47724d3b69b1d91e75d9642cf5a2,trafilatura,5830,0

Danish jewelry brand Pandora on Friday posted a slightly weaker-than-expected rise in second-quarter sales and maintained its full-year outlook despite flagging continued weakness in China.
Revenues rose 8% on an organic basis to 7.08 billion Danish kroner ($1.10 billion) in the three-month period, just shy of the 7.12 billion Danish kroner forecast by LSEG analysts.
China recorded the largest decline in organic sales, down 15%, while the U.S. accelerated 12%. Pandora said performance in China ""continues to be challenged"" and announced an anticipated doubling of store closures in the country to 100 this year.
The company nevertheless reiterated its full-year forecast for organic sales growth of 7% to 8% and an operating profit margin of at least 24%, including the impact of U.S. tariffs.

Micron's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) suits the technical needs of AI accelerator graphics processing units (GPUs) because they are capable of moving huge amounts of data with low lag, and are more energy efficient than conventional memory chips. And given the high demand for AI chips, demand for Micron's HBM chips has also been robust, which explains why its growth has been remarkable in recent quarters.
Importantly, it appears Micron's terrific growth will persist thanks to its lucrative opportunity in the HBM space -- and its latest guidance update provides further evidence to that effect.
Micron Technology's AI-fueled growth is just getting started
On Monday, Micron increased its guidance for its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter. For the period, which will end Aug. 28, it now expects revenues of $11.1 billion to $11.3 billion, up from a range of $10.4 billion to $11 billion previously. At the midpoint, that's a boost of $500 million. Additionally, management bumped up its non-GAAP earnings guidance from $2.50 per share to $2.85 per share. Those figures would equate to a year-over-year increase of 44% in revenue and a 141% jump in adjusted earnings per share.
Micron management says that ""improved pricing, particularly in DRAM, and strong execution"" are the reasons behind its improved guidance. Booming demand for HBM is a key factor that's allowing memory makers to increase prices. According to one estimate, the HBM market's revenue could double in 2024 to $34 billion, driven by a combination of higher shipments and increased pricing.
Specifically, production capacity constraints are expected to push up the price of HBM by 15% to 20% in the calendar third quarter, which would be sharper than the 5% to 10% growth seen in the previous quarter. At the same time, the next iterations of AI graphics cards designed by Nvidia and AMD will be equipped with bigger HBM chips.
Nvidia, for instance, is packing 288 gigabytes (GB) of HBM into its Blackwell Ultra B300 GPU, up from the 192GB configuration of the B200. Similarly, AMD is bumping up the HBM capacity of its MI355X and MI350X accelerators to 288GB; the previous generation MI325X had 256GB.
What's more, AMD is planning to increase the HBM capacity of its next-generation MI400X GPUs to a whopping 432GB.
Given all that, demand for HBM is likely to remain solid. Micron's peer SK Hynix is forecasting annualized increases of 30% in the HBM market through 2030. AI, therefore, can be expected to remain a solid long-term growth driver for Micron, especially considering the company's improving share of this market.
The memory specialist says it's supplying HBM chips ""in high volume"" to four major customers, which indicates that custom AI chipmakers such as Broadcom and Marvell Technology are also among its big clients. Not surprisingly, Micron's HBM market share is expected to jump to 24% by the end of 2025 as compared to around 20% earlier this year.
That potential improvement in Micron's market share, along with the outstanding growth of the HBM market, explains why analysts have increased their revenue growth expectations from the company.
Even better, Micron's healthy top-line growth will drive a big jump in the company's bottom line since demand for HBM is outpacing supply. The favorable supply-and-demand dynamic should lift memory prices and supercharge Micron's earnings, which is why buying the stock right now is a no-brainer.
Micron stock is too cheap to ignore
Micron reported $1.30 per share in earnings in its fiscal 2024. The following chart makes it clear that its earnings are on track to grow significantly in the current fiscal year and beyond.
The best part for investors is that Micron stock is trading at just 10 times forward earnings, which is dirt cheap considering the earnings growth that it's projected to deliver. Its forward earnings multiple is significantly lower than the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 index's multiple of 30.
Ideally, the market will reward the AI-fueled growth that this chipmaker is set to deliver with a higher earnings multiple. For instance, an earnings multiple of even 20 after a year could send its stock price to $244 (based on its fiscal 2026 earnings estimate of $12.22 per share). That would be nearly double its current stock price.
So, investors should consider buying this AI stock hand over fist as it has the potential to fly higher, even after recording a 52% gain so far in 2025.

Asia-Pacific markets rose as investors assessed Japan's GDP and the flurry of Chinese economic data.
Japan's Nikkei 225 rose to a record high close after the country's second-quarter GDP grew 0.3%, outpacing forecasts despite tariff headwinds.
Shein's U.K. arm generated £2.05 billion ($2.77 billion) in sales in 2024, up 32.3% from 2023, according to a filing released on Friday.
The online fast-fashion retailer's pre-tax profit rose to £38.25 million in 2024 from £24.43 million in 2023.
The company highlighted several milestones during the year, including the opening of new offices in King's Cross and Manchester, a pop-up shop in Liverpool and a Christmas bus tour across 12 U.K. cities.
Shein flagged risks such as potential supply chain delays, higher costs from currency fluctuations and freight charges, IT system outages, and shifting UK regulations that could require it to alter or withdraw products.

China's economy lost momentum in July, with growth faltering across the board, as weak domestic demand persisted and Beijing intensified efforts to curb excess capacity.
Retail sales last month rose 3.7% from a year earlier, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Friday, sharply missing analysts' estimates for a 4.6% growth in a Reuters poll and slowing from June's 4.8% growth.
Industrial output rose 5.7% from a year ago in July, its weakest level since November last year, according to LSEG data, and weaker than analysts' expectations for a 5.9% rise.
Fixed-asset investment in July expanded 1.6% for the year-to-date, undershooting economists' forecasts for a 2.7% growth and slowing from 2.8% in the first six months. Within that segment, the contraction in property investment worsened, slumping 12% in the first seven months, government data showed.

Japan's economy expanded 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, compared to the first three months of the year, as the country grappled with the volatile tariff policy out of the United States.
This was compared to the revised 0.1% growth seen in the first quarter, and was higher than the 0.1% increase expected by economists polled by Reuters.
On a year-over-year basis, Japan's GDP expanded 1.2% in the second quarter, falling short of the first quarter's 1.8% growth.
The GDP reading comes as Japan struggled to cope with an uncertain trade environment in the second quarter, with the country only reaching a trade deal with the U.S. on July 23.
The deal sees Japan face a 15% blanket tariff on all exports to the U.S., including automobiles.

In a Thursday interview with CNBC, economist Marc Sumerlin confirmed that he's in the running to be the next Federal Reserve chair.
""I got a call last Wednesday that said there was going to be a list [and] I was going to be on it. That's as much as I know right now,"" he said. ""I'm waiting for more guidance on where we go from here.""
Sumerlin also voiced his support for a big interest rate cut. The former senior economist under then-President George W. Bush said that a 50 basis-point rate cut ""seems like pretty much a no-brainer to me.""
One basis point equals 0.01%, so a 50 basis-point cut would be half a percentage point.

Equities may have further upside from here, but investors should still be mindful of elevated volatility going forward, according to UBS.
""While the VIX index of implied stock volatility has fallen to the lowest level since December last year, market swings could pick up quickly if trade tensions escalate significantly, economic data weakens faster than expected, or if geopolitical risks worsen,"" the bank wrote in a Wednesday note to clients. ""Investors who are already allocated to equities in line with their strategic benchmarks should consider structured strategies with capital preservation features, while those underallocated should prepare to add exposure on potential market dips or consider a disciplined approach to phasing into stocks.""
UBS added that a ""well-diversified portfolio"" is suited for helping investors hedge against volatility while also setting them up for future gains.

The market sure thinks so,2025-08-15 20:00:00+00:00,gdelt_cnbc_com,cnbc.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Shares of Salesforce rallied Friday as Wall Street bets that activist pressure may again help revive an otherwise dragging stock. Jeff Smith's Starboard Value increased its stake in Salesforce by 47% during the second quarter, according to a securities filing , ending the month of June with a position worth $341.5 million. Starboard also added to its Salesforce holdings in the first quarter. The market is taking note Friday, sending shares up 4%, because Starboard was the first activist hedge fund to start publicly pushing for changes at Salesforce in late 2022 and into 2023. Multiple other activist firms swarmed around Salesforce and echoed Starboard's calls for greater efficiency and profitability, among other demands. It proved to be a wildly successful activist campaign, with shares of Salesforce almost doubling in 2023 after losing nearly half their value in 2022. Starboard had sold down a large chunk of its stake before beginning to buy this year. Starboard's increased stake in Salesforce could once more positively influence the company's direction, according to D.A. Davidson analysts led by Gil Luria. ""We believe this is a signal there will be another round of investor activism and increased pressure on management to refocus on growth of the core business, additional margin expansion, and hold off on dilutive M & A,"" Luria wrote to clients Friday. In the same note, D.A. Davidson upgraded the stock to a hold-equivalent rating from sell, arguing the company's challenges have been appropriately priced in. Indeed, Salesforce entered Friday having lost more than a third of its value after closing at a record of $368 a share on Dec. 4. CRM 1Y mountain Salesforce's stock performance over the past 12 months. Among Salesforce's issues is a belief that artificial intelligence is threatening the business model of enterprise software companies that count on their customers growing their headcount, thereby paying for more software licenses. It's often called the seat-based model, and earlier this week, its perceived shortcomings in the generative AI era was the subject of a note from Melius Research. There is ""some truth"" to Melius Research's idea that AI is eating software, Jim Cramer acknowledged during the August Monthly Meeting on Thursday. At the same time, the Club hasn't been ready to cut bait on its long-held position in the stock. Starboard's intentions this time around aren't clear — the firm didn't respond to CNBC's request for comment — but its maneuvering nevertheless represents a glimmer of hope. In October 2024, Smith of Starboard complimented Salesforce's profitability improvements but said he still believed ""there's a lot more to go."" ""If they execute on this plan, the stock could turn around in the same way it did last time Starboard helped CRM steer the ship,"" D.A. Davidson's Luria wrote to CNBC in an email Friday. Luria kept his price target unchanged at $225 a share, which is below where the stock is trading Friday. Luria had been among those on the Street worried that Salesforce was neglecting its core business for a premature bet on Agentforce, its agentic AI product suite. It was at the heart of D.A. Davidson's decision in April to initially downgrade Salesforce to a sell rating. Jim disagreed with the sentiment at the time, saying he believed CEO Marc Benioff was backing Agentforce because the Salesforce's core business was performing in line with expectations. That wasn't the last of Salesforce's woes. Its decision in late May to buy data management firm Informatica for $8 billion faced some skepticism, and its quarterly results released around the same time failed to quiet the doubters. RBC Capital Markets analysts, for example, downgraded the stock and expressed concerns that Benioff was slipping back into his old habit of relying on acquisitions to stoke topline growth — a big topic of conversation during the activist battle of 2022-23. At the time, Jim pushed back on the notion that Salesforce was out of innovative ideas and lent support to Benioff's Agentforce push. Salesforce said in May that Agentforce generates over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and has secured 8,000 deals since its launch last fall, with half of them being paid deals. The Club recognizes that Salesforce has been painful to own lately. ""I keep coming back to the fact that [Benioff] says business is really strong,"" said Jim when asked by a Club member about Salesforce during the August Monthly Meeting. And yet, the stock chart is ugly. ""What happens when [business is] not strong?"" Jim asked rhetorically. A few important events loom that will help shape our thinking. On Sept. 3, Salesforce reports its fiscal 2026 second quarter. Then, in mid-October, its annual Dreamforce conference is on the schedule. ""We have to make a decision around"" Salesforce by the time of Dreamforce, Jim said. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long CRM. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-debanking-order-limited-impact-194304156.html,12688eb39af9d71449bdd91c3fdd7c2e,"Trump debanking order will have limited impact on crypto , experts say","Trump debanking order will have limited impact on crypto , experts say",2025-08-15 08:00:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Last week, US President Donald Trump issued an executive order directing bank regulators to rescind guidance that could lead to “politicised or unlawful debanking.”
Crypto businesses, and even some prominent conservatives — including the president himself — have alleged they were denied or lost access to bank accounts at the behest of politically-motivated, Biden-era regulators.
But last week’s executive order, entitled, “Guaranteeing Fair Banking for All Americans,” won’t do much for crypto businesses that fear they’ve been locked out of the traditional financial system, according to experts who spoke to DL News.
That’s because the order does little to root out “reputation risk.” The term refers to regulators’ ability to dissuade banks from engaging supposedly controversial customers, such as pornographers, firearms manufacturers, payday lenders, and crypto companies.
Critics of the practice say that banks should only consider objective criteria, such as a customer’s financial risk, when deciding whether to offer someone a checking account.
Guidance documents and manuals
“This is going to make people happy who have been asking for it, but it’s not clear how much good it’s going to do them,” Dru Stevenson, a professor at South Texas College of Law Houston, told DL News.
The executive order directs bank regulators to remove the use of reputation risk “or equivalent concepts” that could result in “politicized or unlawful debanking” from their “guidance documents, manuals, and other materials.”
But it isn’t clear that examples of debanking were motivated by politics, according to Stevenson.
“It’s not clear to me that they couldn’t still allow for reputational risk that would apply to, say, an AI company, because that’s not exactly a political issue or something that’s unlawful,” he said.
And reputation risk can have a downstream effect on banks’ profits.
“If you have risk averse investors at one of the gigantic pension funds, or mutual funds, and they find out that Wachovia has gone gung ho about crypto, that might be a reason for them to switch to a more conservative bank,” Stevenson said.
Moreover, banks were always free to ignore guidance documents and manuals according to Stevenson. As such, removing references to reputation risk from such documents will likely have little practical effect.
“If you’re an agency, you can’t go into court and say, ‘This person violated our guidance document,’” he said.
“You have to show that they violated the statute or that they violated a codified regulation that went through notice and comment rulemaking.”
Management reports
Julie Hill, the dean of the University of Wyoming’s law school, noted that Trump-appointed bank regulators have already said they will stop using reputation risk.
While the regulators have new leadership, they are largely staffed by the same people who served under the Biden administration, Hill added. And reputation risk isn’t the only tool regulators can use to pressure banks to reject certain customers.
Anti-money laundering laws are one reason banks often reject customers, according to Hill.
“The vast, vast majority of suspicious activity reports don’t lead to any sort of follow up, let alone any sort of enforcement,” she told DL News.
Moreover, banks are not allowed to tell customers that their account was flagged for suspicious activity.
“We have a situation where banks had to file one or more SARs, and they decided it’s just not worth it, we should debank, because we don’t want our regulators upset with us, and it’s getting expensive to file all these SARs.”
Another tool at regulators’ disposal: management reports.
“If a regulator suggests to a bank, ‘We think this is risky, maybe you want to stop doing it’ [but] it’s not really that risky, banks might do it anyway,” Hill said, “because their management rating will get downgraded and then that impacts all sorts of things, including their capital requirements.”
Those ratings are also secret, according to Hill.
“Anytime you see a really broad authority with very little limit, and then also a lot of secrecy or lack of transparency about how regulators or banks implement that, you’re likely to set up claims for debanking,” she said.
Banks’ responsibility
The executive order also directs the regulators to identify financial institutions that had any “past or current, formal or informal, policies or practices that require, encourage, or otherwise influence … politicized or unlawful debanking.”
Finding examples of politically-motivated debanking could be straightforward if the orders came from federal regulators, according to Hill.
“It’s a much harder thing if what you think happened is the banks, for whatever reason, just decided to debank people for political reasons, unconnected with risk or profit or whatever,” she said.
“There’s a real question about how we think regulators are going to figure that out and whether we think there’s any duty on the bank to voluntarily disclose it.”
Whatever the effect of the executive order, both professors agreed that a new administration could reinstate the use of reputation risk unilaterally.
“It kind of highlights how unsticky changes made by the executive branch are when it comes to discretionary enforcement,” Hill said. “This is one of those things that can change from administration to administration.”
Stevenson agreed.
“If we ever get to have other presidents, the next president can just do another executive order and put it all back, like, overnight,” Stevenson said.

However, rather than opting to sell Allied Bakeries after ABF said in April that the division was facing a “very challenging market”, the London-listed company is combining it with Hovis to “create a profitable UK bread business that is sustainable over the long term”.
Those comments came from ABF’s CEO George Weston, who added in a statement: “Supporting the Hovis and Kingsmill brands with well-invested and efficient operations will also enable innovation and growth.
“This solution will create value for shareholders, provide greater choice for consumers and increase efficiencies for customers.”
Financial terms for the transaction were not disclosed by ABF as it said it had “reached an agreement to acquire Hovis”, subject to regulatory approval. Endless bought the business in 2020.
At the time, Hovis was 51%-owned by US investment firm The Gores Group and UK food company Premier Foods, the owner of the Mr Kipling cakes brand. Jefferies International estimated the deal value at £75m ($101.6m at today’s exchange rate) in terms of what it deemed in 2020 as “implied gross proceeds”.
Endless provided a statement in response to Just Food’s request for comment, noting the deal will need to be approved by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).
Aidan Robson, a managing partner of Endless, said: “We are proud of the journey we’ve shared with Hovis to date, supporting this historic brand in a highly competitive and challenging market. The transaction with ABF represents an opportunity to create a platform for long-term sustainability in the bakery sector for the benefit of retailers and consumers.
""While we work towards achieving CMA clearance of the transaction, our focus remains on Hovis to continue delivering exceptional products and service to its customers.”
When ABF revealed the review of Allied Bakeries in April in its financial results briefing for the 24 weeks to 1 March, the Primark clothing stores owner said the bakery division had added to the group’s operating losses amid “lower” volumes and sales.
ABF added more commentary today: “Profitability at Allied Bakeries has been increasingly challenged in recent years by a decline in demand for pre-sliced, packaged bread and a loss of scale in Allied Bakeries’ nationwide distribution network serving the major retailers with daily delivery of bread and bakery goods.”
However, it added: “The acquisition [Hovis] will combine the production and distribution activities of the two businesses, driving significant costs synergies and efficiencies…
“The combined business will be better placed to compete effectively and to establish a stable platform for product innovation in the segments of the UK bakery category that are growing as a result of changing consumer tastes and needs.”
James Watson, a UK partner at consultancy Argon & Co., said: “The Hovis-Kingsmill merger is a clear sign of the pressures facing the UK bakery sector. With inflation driving up costs and bread consumption in steady decline, consolidation was always a question of when, not if.
“The deal gives ABF a new market leader with 41% share, overtaking Warburtons’ 34%. But behind the headline is a tough reality: both businesses have been making unsustainable losses. The real prize here is efficiency – rationalising overlapping bakery networks and cutting costs in procurement, logistics, and manufacturing.”
ABF said the forward plans for the combined business include the “improvement in existing products and expansion into new product ranges”.
Allied Bakeries also produces the Allinson’s bread and flours brand. The division of ABF also supplies UK retailers and supermarkets with private-label bread products.
ABF does not break down the financial performance of Allied Bakeries or for other food brands within its grocery reporting unit, which includes Twinings tea and the Patak’s and Blue Dragon sauces lines.
Group results for the 24 weeks to 1 March showed a 2% decline in sales to £9.51bn, while adjusted operating profit dropped 12% to £835m. Profit before tax fell 21% to £692m with an EPS decrease of 8% to 83.6 pence.
Shares in ABF were little changed at 2,270 pence in London today following the Hovis announcement.
Watson at Argon added: “Execution will be everything. Disrupting existing customer relationships now, while both brands are losing share, would risk compounding the problem.
“Longer term, the challenge is to stop managing decline and start building momentum. That means addressing structural issues in the bread market and responding faster to shifting consumer trends - whether that’s health, speciality products, or premium lines.”

Time to Buy the Dip or Run for the Hills ? ,Pinterest Shares Just Sank . Time to Buy the Dip or Run for the Hills ? ,2025-08-15 19:15:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Share prices of Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) sank last week after the visual pin-board operator's second-quarter earnings missed expectations. However, revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) came in above expectations, and guidance was strong.
Let's take a closer look at Pinterest's most recent results and prospects to see if the dip is a buying opportunity.
Accelerating growth
The transformation of Pinterest under CEO Bill Ready continued to bear fruit in the second quarter, with the company reporting solid revenue and user growth. Ready has invested heavily to make Pinterest's platform more attractive to both users and advertisers through the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
This includes developing proprietary multimodal large language models (LLMs) that can handle visual searches, improve its search recommendation algorithm, and better handle conversational search queries.
The company has also worked to make its platform more shoppable, and on this front, it announced a new partnership with Instacart. Pinterest will now have ads that are directly shoppable via Instacart. This will include items in the food and beverage category, as the company looks to attract more consumer packaged goods advertisers to its platform.
Pinterest once again saw solid average revenue per user (ARPU) and user growth in the quarter, especially in international markets. Monthly active users (MAUs) increased by 11% to 578 million, led by a 14% rise in ""rest of world"" users to 329 million. U.S. and Canada MAUs rose by 4% to 102 million, while European users grew by 7% to 146 million.
Its overall ARPU climbed by 6% year over year to $1.74. However, due to the big regional difference, it's best to look at the metric on a regional basis. ARPU rose by 6% to $7.29 in the U.S. and Canada, while European ARPU surged by 26% to $1.30. ""Rest of world"" ARPU soared 44% to $0.19.
Pinterest said it was starting to narrow the gap between U.S. and international ARPU, but that there was a lot more room to go. For most ad platforms, the U.S. has the best monetization levels, but Pinterest has always lagged its competitors in international markets. It noted that it was seeing strong success with lower funnel and performance ad budgets in Europe with retailers, while reseller partners and its Google partnership were helping it in emerging markets.
Overall revenue for Pinterest climbed 17% year over year to $988 million, ahead of the $975 million consensus estimate compiled by data analytics provider LSEG. U.S. and Canada revenue rose by 11% to $745 million, while European revenue jumped 34% to $191 million. Revenue from its ""rest of world"" segment soared 65% to $63 million.
Turning to profitability, Pinterest saw its adjusted EBITDA climb 25% year over year to $251 million. Meanwhile, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) jumped by 38% to $0.33. Analysts at LSEG were looking for adjusted EPS of $0.35, and adjusted EBITDA of $233 million, according to business news tracker StreetAccount.
Pinterest forecasts third-quarter revenue to be between $1.033 billion and $1.053 billion, representing 15% to 17% growth year over year. That midpoint is solidly ahead of the $1.025 billion analyst consensus.
The company said it is seeing some effects from tariffs, with some Asia-based e-commerce retailers lowering spending. However, it said its geographical diversification has helped mitigate the impact. And management says it has been seeing strong growth among younger users, with 50% of its user base now Gen Zers.
Should investors buy the dip?
Pinterest's second-quarter results were arguably better than its first-quarter results, when the stock rallied. Both its revenue and EPS growth accelerated, and its international metrics were also better. In addition, its future guidance was also stronger.
The company's upgrades to its platform appear to be resonating with younger users, who are now using its multimodal search. Meanwhile, advertisers are also benefiting from the improving functionality, automation, and effectiveness of its Performance Plus ad platform
Turning to valuation, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of about 19 based on 2025 analyst estimates and 16 based on the 2026 consensus. Given its revenue and profitability growth, I would view that as cheap.
With Pinterest continuing to transform its business and seeing strong momentum in its international segment, I would be a buyer of the stock on this dip.

Trump met Putin on the tarmac of Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage shortly after the Russian leader's plane landed at around 10:50 a.m. local time. Trump arrived earlier.
Both men deplaned at the same time and walked down respective red carpets toward each other, meeting where those carpets intersected. Trump clapped as Putin approached him.
They greeted each other with apparent warmth, smiling, exchanging words, and patting each others' arms while shaking hands. They then walked to a riser to watch a flyover of military aircraft.
The two leaders then got into Trump's armored vehicle, ""The Beast,"" and drove off. They did not respond to reporters' shouted questions before departing.
The talks come as Europe — including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was not invited — watches with bated breath.
Rubio, Witkoff joining Trump
Trump and Putin, who were initially expected to meet one-on-one, will now each be accompanied by two senior officials for their meeting, a White House official confirmed earlier Friday.
Trump will be joined by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Steve Witkoff, the president's special envoy to the Middle East.
There will then be a working lunch for both delegations, before the presidents hold a joint news conference to summarize their talks.
Trump will be joined at the lunch by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, as well as Rubio and Witkoff, a White House official said.
Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, told Russian state media earlier Friday that the entire summit could last ""at least"" six or seven hours.
Zelenskyy: 'Indeed, high stakes'
The presser will undoubtedly be one of the most closely watched events of this year, revealing just how near, or far, the end of the war in Ukraine is — a conflict that has spanned more than 3½ years.
""The president wants to exhaust all options to try to bring this war to a peaceful resolution,"" the White House stated ahead of the Alaska summit.
It remains to be seen whether those ""options"" will ultimately be good or bad for Ukraine.
While on Air Force One, Trump suggested his yardstick for the summit's success is whether or not he can secure a ceasefire.
""I want to see a ceasefire rapidly, I don't know if it's going to be today, but I'm not going to be happy if it's not today,"" he said.
At the same time, Trump appeared to be tempering expectations. ""I can't tell you that. I don't know. It's - there's nothing set in stone,"" he said.
That noncommittal language echoes how Trump has talked about the meeting in the days leading up to it.
For instance, Trump suggested earlier this week that the summit would merely be a ""feel-out meeting,"" before later warning that Russia would face ""severe consequences"" if he determines that Putin does not plan to end the war.
Not only is a ceasefire at stake — if Trump can persuade Putin to agree to one — but so too are Ukraine's territorial integrity, Europe's security, Russia's economy and geopolitical alliances.

Zelenskyy, who has a checkered relationship with Trump, will be nervous as the talks get underway.
""Indeed, high stakes,"" Zelenskyy wrote on X earlier Friday ahead of the Alaska summit.
""The key thing is that this meeting should open up a real path toward a just peace and a substantive discussion between leaders in a trilateral format – Ukraine, the United States, and the Russian side.""
""It is time to end the war, and the necessary steps must be taken by Russia. We are counting on America,"" he added.
The risks for Ukraine and Europe
Both he and his European allies fear the U.S. leader could capitulate to skilled negotiator Putin's likely demands for Moscow to retain occupied Ukrainian territory and cut short Ukraine's NATO membership aspirations, in return for halting its military offensive.
As he headed off to Alaska on Air Force One, Trump told reporters that ""something is going to come of it [the meeting]."" When asked about Russia's ongoing attacks on Ukraine, the president said Putin ""thinks that gives him strength in talks, I think it hurts him,"" in comments reported by Reuters.
Trump also insisted that Ukraine has to decide about its territory and that security guarantees were ""possible along with Europe,"" without giving further details.
Russia's delegation includes only a few members of Putin's inner circle, with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and Kirill Dmitriev, Russia's investment and trade envoy, as well as Ushakov.
The presidential aide commented that ""it is obvious to everyone that the central topic will be the settlement of the Ukrainian crisis,"" including the ""broader tasks of ensuring peace and security,"" as well as pressing international and regional issues.
Signaling that Russia will be looking to extol the economic benefits of a rapprochement with the U.S., Ushakov added that ""an exchange of views is expected regarding the further development of bilateral cooperation, including in the trade and economic area,"" noting that ""this cooperation has enormous and, unfortunately, untapped potential.""",3e160ec92f007ab0b748626cbdd1f50b,trafilatura,5399,0

While the compact hurricane's center wasn't expected to strike land, it threatened to dump flooding rains on the northeast Caribbean as it continued to grow larger.
The first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, Erin ramped up from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane in a mere 24 hours. By late Saturday morning, its maximum sustained winds more than doubled to 160 mph (255 kph).
Mike Brennen, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami, said Erin had grown into a ""very powerful hurricane."" He said its winds gained 60 mph (96 kph) in intensity within about nine hours Saturday.
""We expect to see Erin peak here in intensity relatively soon,"" Brennan said in an online briefing.
The Hurricane Center said Erin should weaken somewhat late Saturday or early Sunday as the storm encounters increased wind shear and possibly takes in more dry air. However, forecasters predict it will remain a major hurricane until midweek.
Erin close enough to trigger flooding, landslides
The hurricane was located 110 miles (180 kilometers) north of Anguilla at 2 p.m. Saturday, moving west at 16 mph (26 kph). The storm's center was forecast to remain at sea, passing 145 miles (233 kilometers) north of Puerto Rico, according to the National Weather Service.
Erin was close enough to affect nearby islands. Tropical storm watches were issued for St. Martin, St. Barts and St. Maarten. The Hurricane Center warned that heavy rain in some areas could trigger flash flooding, landslides and mudslides.
Tropical-storm force wind gusts are possible in the Turks and Caicos Islands and southeast Bahamas.
Though compact in size, with hurricane-force winds extending 30 miles (45 km) from its center, the Hurricane Center said Erin was expected to double or even triple in size in the coming days.
Erin could create powerful rip currents off the U.S. East Coast from Florida to the mid-Atlantic next week, even with its eye forecast to remain far offshore, Brennan said.
'Incredible' race from tropical storm to Category 5
Hurricane specialist and storm surge expert Michael Lowry said Erin gained strength at a pace that was ""incredible for any time of year, let alone August 16th.""
Lowry said only four other Category 5 hurricanes have been recorded in the Atlantic on or before Aug
The most powerful storms tend to form later in the year, with the hurricane season typically peaking in mid-September.
In October 2005, Hurricane Wilma rocketed from a tropical storm to a Category 5 storm in less than 24 hours, according to National Hurricane Center advisories from that time. Wilma weakened to a Category 3 hurricane before striking Florida.
Including Erin, there have been 43 hurricanes that have reached Category 5 status on record in the Atlantic, said Dan Pydynowski, senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, a private forecasting company.
""They're certainly rare, although this would mark the fourth year in a row that we've had one in the Atlantic basin,"" Pydynowski said about Category 5 hurricanes. Conditions needed for hurricanes to reach this strength include very warm ocean water, little to no wind shear, and being far from land, he said.
Warming climate linked to storms strengthening faster
Scientists have linked rapid intensification of hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean to climate change. Global warming is causing the atmosphere to hold more water vapor and is spiking ocean temperatures. The warmer waters give hurricanes fuel to unleash more rain and strengthen more quickly.
Storms that ramp up so quickly complicate forecasting for meteorologists and make it harder for government agencies to plan for emergencies. Hurricane Erick, a Pacific storm that made landfall June 19 in Oaxaca, Mexico, also strengthened rapidly, doubling in intensity in less than a day.
Erin is the fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. It's the first to become a hurricane.
The 2025 hurricane season is expected to be unusually busy. The forecast calls for six to 10 hurricanes, with three to five reaching major status with winds of more than 110 mph (177 kph).
In San Juan, locals and tourists walked, exercised and shopped on Saturday as usual. Restaurants were busy, and despite warnings to avoid the beaches, people could be seen in the water at Ultimo Trolley and Ocean Park beaches. Puerto Rican parents, however, kept their children from swimming.
Sarahí Torres and Joanna Cornejo, visiting San Juan from California for a Bad Bunny concert, said they decided to go to the beach and wade into the water because the skies appeared calm.
""The weather looked fine, so we came out,"" Torres said.
The U.S. government deployed more than 200 employees from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other agencies to Puerto Rico as a precaution. Puerto Rico Housing Secretary Ciary Pérez Peña said 367 shelters were inspected and ready to open if needed.
Meanwhile, officials in the Bahamas said they prepared some public shelters as a precaution as they urged people to track the hurricane.
""These storms are very volatile and can make sudden shifts in movement,"" said Aarone Sargent, managing director for the Bahamas' disaster risk management authority.",62e4cabc5c7114a7edb3bad81dafebdb,trafilatura,5376,0

However, unlike the majority of players in the field, it went unnoticed until its large government contract wins and rapid commercial expansion brought it to the spotlight.
While some admire the company’s exponential growth, others criticize it for its unconventional methods. Nonetheless, Palantir has become unstoppable. The stock is up 145% year to date, outperforming the market as a whole, which is up 9.7%. Let’s see if the stock is a buy now.
Valued at $441 billion, Palantir develops advanced data analytics software that assists governments, businesses, and other organizations in collecting, integrating, and analyzing large, complex datasets to make better decisions, detect patterns, and solve problems. Its Gotham, Foundry, and AIP platforms are widely used in industries such as defense, intelligence, healthcare, finance, and supply chains.
Palantir reported a stellar second quarter. For the first time, the company exceeded $1 billion in quarterly revenue, representing a 48% year-over-year increase. Furthermore, its Rule of 40 score reached 94, indicating a healthy balance of rapid growth and strong profitability, which is a rare combination in the AI sector. The U.S. business remains the growth engine, contributing 73% to total revenue. U.S. commercial revenue surged 93% year-over-year, while U.S. government revenue rose 53% year-over-year. The rate of growth in commercial adoption, which was previously a weaker area for Palantir, indicates a strategic shift that could maintain momentum in the coming years. The company’s remaining performance obligations (RPO) reached $2.4 billion, up 77% year on year. Adjusted EPS was $0.16 per share.
Big Deals, Bigger Pipeline
The second quarter marked a quarter of massive contract wins, with 157 deals worth more than $1 million, 66 deals worth more than $5 million, and 42 deals worth more than $10 million. Total contract value (TCV) reached $2.3 billion, with annual contract value (ACV) at $684 million, both record highs. Notably, Palantir’s top 20 customers now have an average trailing 12-month revenue of $75 million, a 30% increase year over year, indicating that once Palantir acquires a client, its footprint within that organization tends to grow significantly.
Palantir ended the second quarter with $6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term U.S. Treasury securities, providing a solid foundation for future product investment.
Government: A Deep and Sticky Relationship
While the commercial segment is expanding faster, Palantir’s government business remains a cornerstone and one of the primary reasons why Palantir may be the safest AI play. The U.S. Space Force has awarded a $218 million delivery order for multi-domain warfighting support. The ceiling for its Maven Smart System contract was raised by $795 million to meet increasing AI demand from combatant commands. Most notably, Palantir signed a 10-year, $10 billion enterprise agreement with the U.S. Army, combining 75 separate contracts into one.
These long-term, mission-critical government contracts generate recurring revenue, which provides stability, especially in uncertain market conditions. Palantir’s AI platforms are deeply embedded in critical enterprise and defense systems, resulting in high switching costs for clients. Furthermore, unlike many other smaller AI plays, Palantir generates consistent cash flow and margins while balancing growth and profitability.
For the full year 2025, the company anticipates 45% year-over-year revenue growth to $4.14 billion to $4.15 billion, with 85% growth in U.S. commercial revenue. The company also anticipates GAAP profitability in all quarters of 2025 and adjusted free cash flow of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. Analysts expect Palantir’s earnings to rise by 58.2% in 2025 and 30.8% in 2026. Palantir's stock is expensive, trading at 220 times 2026 estimated earnings.
Is PLTR Stock a Buy, Hold, or Sell on Wall Street?
Overall, on Wall Street, Palantir stock is a “Hold.” Among the 21 analysts that cover the stock, four rate it a “Strong Buy,” 14 say it is a “Hold,” one rates it a “Moderate Sell,” and two say it is a “Strong Sell.” Despite the muted outlook, Palantir stock has skyrocketed this year, surpassing its average target price of $155.78. Its Street-high estimate of $200 implies the stock has upside potential of 7% from current levels.
The Bottom Line
While Palantir’s positioning is strong, critics remain skeptical, citing the company’s heavy reliance on U.S. government contracts, which means that political or budgetary changes could impact revenue. Palantir has been working on this by rapidly expanding its commercial business to create a more balanced revenue stream.
Palantir’s combination of high growth, profitability, established customer relationships, and proven technology may make it one of the safest AI investments available. However, given the premium valuation, risk-averse investors may want to wait for a more favorable entry point.

Is This a Positive Sign for Investors ? ,Asian Markets Are Scrambling to Update Their Stablecoin Rules . Is This a Positive Sign for Investors ? ,2025-08-15 19:15:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Imagine a neat row of dominoes, each one stamped with the crest of a major Asian financial hub. Every tile is a consultation paper, draft bill, or regulatory speech about stablecoins, and once the first domino topples, nobody wants to be the last one standing.
That chain reaction is now well underway. Fresh legislation from Singapore to South Korea aims to corral fiat currency‑backed tokens, and the jurisdictions that move fastest could siphon a torrent of digital cash. That cash will tend to spill into assets like Ethereum(CRYPTO: ETH), among others.
If clear rules really do lure capital, investors need to know which domino falls next.
Asia's many rulebooks are being rewritten quickly
Across the region, officials are shifting from white-paper promises to binding statutes, each with its own flavor.
Singapore started it in late 2023, when its Monetary Authority finalized a framework that forces stablecoin issuers to keep reserve assets at all times. As of this June, the city-state will be tightening the licensing requirements on crypto companies and asset issuers, so the landscape there is still evolving.
Japan's Liberal Democratic Party Web3 Project Team took a different tack this May, proposing to fold fiat-backed tokens into the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act so banks can distribute them like electronic money.
Starting in June, South Korea is betting on a homegrown won-based stablecoin. A draft Digital Asset Basic Act slated for debate next week would make issuers hold at least $38 million in core capital and exempt swap transactions from value added tax (VAT) to keep liquidity onshore. Hong Kong issued its Stablecoins Ordinance on July 29, requiring every issuer to hold a license and carefully hold client funds.
As of early August, even China is considering sidelining its digital yuan-based central bank digital currency (CBDC) and dipping a cautious toe into renminbi-denominated stablecoins, supposedly in an attempt to challenge the dollar's global dominance in the asset class thus far. If its initiative gains traction, it should lead to a lot of capital being onboarded into the crypto sector.
Are these moves bullish for crypto?
Regulation may sound dull, but it unlocks growth. Total stablecoin market cap already sits near $258 billion. Stablecoins add new rails that shuttle fiat currency onto blockchains at the click of a button. The bigger the float, the faster value can rotate into cryptoassets.
So, new stablecoin regulations are indeed very unambiguously positive for crypto. The richer the country that creates stablecoin frameworks, the more capital there will be onboarded, generally speaking. But where will that capital rest?
Today, Ethereum currently processes roughly half of all stablecoin transactions, and $140.5 billion in value is parked in stables on its chain. Therefore, it's likely that it'll capture a lot of the inflows. Every additional token minted under the new Asian regimes could fuel demand for more gas fees, and history shows that network activity often tracks the coin's price. The picture is thus quite bullish, even if other chains ultimately benefit as well.
Still, nothing is written in stone in terms of this trend's winners as of right now, and that will remain the case until well after the regulations are mostly settled. Moreover, reserve mandates in Singapore and South Korea could thin profit margins for smaller issuers, slowing supply growth. And China's ambivalence means that abrupt policy shifts remain a tail risk.
Nonetheless, another beneficiary might be Tron, which hosts 51% of Tether's supply thanks to its rock-bottom fees, and a compliant Hong Kong license might entice issuers to broaden their chain footprint.
Assuming frameworks land roughly as drafted, the likely near-term outcome is a bigger, safer stablecoin pool coupled with fiercer competition among blockchains to host it. That is textbook bullish for Ethereum today, but investors should keep an eye on how quickly rival chains adapt. Low-fee layer-2 (L2) networks or specialty compliance-ready ledgers like XRP could siphon capital share if issuers decide costs or legal risks outweigh Ethereum's liquidity advantages as they are today.
Asia's regulatory sprint is just starting. For investors willing to think in years rather than days, clearer rules that invite more digital dollars onto blockchains tip the risk-reward balance just a bit further in crypto's favor. For a highly risky asset class, that could make a big difference in the long run.

BBB Foods(NYSE: TBBB) isn't a name that most investors are familiar with, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Toiling away in obscurity can often be a ground floor opportunity, as long as the floor doesn't buckle and dump you into the basement.
BBB Foods operates in a sleepy and low-margin industry. It's also based in a North American country that isn't exactly a hotbed for investors. BBB Foods is the parent company of Tiendas 3B, a chain of discount grocery stores that is expanding its small-box empire across Mexico.
You might not expect your next potential growth stock to be a retailer in Mexico trying to drive prices in an industry with already razor-thin markups even lower. BBB Foods went public with little fanfare last year. However, then you start seeing the accelerating growth, the market share gains, and the upside.
Grab a cart. Let's go shopping.
It checks out
If you're familiar with Aldi or Trader Joe's, you can start to picture what one of the 3,031 Tiendas 3B locations looks like. However, you would have to shrink it down to the size of a large convenience store. There are sometimes as few as three employees working at a time.
Resist the urge to compare this to a bodega. There are a lot more products stocked at a BBB Foods location, and at rock-bottom prices with a heavy flow of shopper traffic. Unlike a bodega, where customers pay a premium for convenience and to cover the stiff overhead relative to the store's modest sales, BBB Foods has volume turnover and scalability on its side. All of an average store's operating costs was just 10.5% of the revenue it generated in its latest quarter.
The three Bs don't stand for the company's credit rating. The moniker is short for Bueno, Bonito, and Barato, Spanish for ""nice, attractive, and affordable."" It's not just a catchy mantra. Private-label sales accounted for 54% of its sales last year. Aldi and Trader Joe's shoppers know that game, as private labels account for an even larger percentage of those businesses. The beauty of private-label sales is that a growing chain can leverage that strength to negotiate lower prices from different suppliers. In many cases, a Tiendas 3B store will also carry a popular brand-name alternative. Its own label will sell for a 20% to 30% discount.
BBB Foods went public early last year, the first Mexican company to hit a U.S. exchange in six years. If this is your first time hearing about it, you're in for a surprise. The hard discounter hit the market at $17.50. It closed just above $28 on Tuesday after another blowout quarter, beating the market with a 60% gain since its IPO.
Price check
Revenue rose 38% to the U.S. equivalent of $995 million in the second quarter that it reported this week. It's the strongest growth of BBB Foods' five quarters as a public company. Expansion is a big part of that story. It opened 142 new stores during the quarter, and 528 over the past year. However, the store-level performance is even more impressive.
Comparable-store sales soared 17.7% in the second quarter. This isn't a fluke. It's not coming off of depressed results a year earlier. Comps shot 10.7% higher for the same period last year. This is a concept that is resonating with the hyperlocal communities it serves.
It wasn't a perfect quarter as you work your way down the income statement. Margins narrowed slightly, partly on a boost in logistics overhead related to four new regions that it will hit in the second half of this year. History shows that these bumps in administrative costs can be temporary, but for now it ends a streak of four consecutive quarters of positive adjusted earnings.
This isn't a bottom-line story right now. Working capital remains negative, as there is an empire to build out here. A chain that topped 3,000 locations during the quarter may seem like a lot, but analysts see room for as many as 15,000 Tiendas 3B stores. With a long runway for top-line growth and analysts targeting reported and adjusted profitability for next year, this is a stock story still early in the telling.

Under the leadership of Lisa Su, it overtook longtime rival Intel in the PC market. Although Nvidia's success with the artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator market initially took AMD by surprise, AMD's efforts to catch up have made it an increasingly important company in that market.
Such innovations have also made AMD a prime candidate to join the 10 companies that now have a market cap above $1 trillion. Here's how it can reach that milestone, and why the path might be easier to achieve than many investors might assume.
Where AMD stands now
At first glance, AMD might appear far away from that milestone since its $280 billion market cap means it is only 28% of the way toward that goal.
However, that is not as far away from $1 trillion as it might appear. At the current market cap, it has to double in value less than two times to reach that point.
Moreover, a simple increase in popularity could get AMD to that point. Although its 99 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio might make it appear pricey, it currently sells at a forward P/E ratio of 44. Thus, if it achieves some of the popularity that has boosted Palantir, a stock that sells at 623 times its earnings, multiple expansion alone could take it there.
Reaching $1 trillion through business growth
More importantly, AMD is in a strong position to reach a $1 trillion market cap even if such hype does not materialize. The company's data center segment, which designs AI accelerators, generated just over $6.9 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, around 46% of AMD's total. In comparison, Nvidia's data center segment made up 89% of the company's revenue in its most recent quarter.
Admittedly, AMD is significantly behind Nvidia in the AI accelerator market, and while AMD's MI350 chip has generated some interest due to its lower cost, it is hardly a threat to Nvidia's dominance.
However, AMD plans to release the MI400 next year. With its integration with AMD's upcoming Helios rack-scale solution, some analysts believe it can become a competitive threat to Nvidia's upcoming Vera Rubin platform. Nvidia's CUDA software, which has previously cemented its dominance, also faces increased competitive threats. Such conditions could mean AMD is on the way to becoming a full-fledged competitor in the AI market.
Additionally, Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29% through 2030, taking the market's size to an estimated $323 billion. If that prediction comes to pass, AMD will almost certainly benefit from that industry growth.
Even if data center revenue becomes AMD's dominant revenue source, investors should not forget about the client, embedded, and gaming segments. Fortune Business Insights forecasts a CAGR of 15% for the semiconductor industry through 2032. That seems to affirm Grand View's findings, and the market rising above $2 trillion presents AMD with a massive tailwind.
Finally, as conditions stand now, Nvidia has reached a market cap of just under $4.5 trillion, making AMD approximately 6% of its size. Hence, even if AMD grew to slightly less than one-fourth of Nvidia's size, its market cap would presumably reach $1 trillion or higher.
AMD at $1 trillion (and beyond)
Ultimately, AMD is on track to benefit from numerous catalysts that will likely take its market cap to $1 trillion and beyond.
The company is less than two doubles away from reaching $1 trillion, meaning hype alone could take it to that milestone. Still, the growth of the semiconductor industry in general puts it on track to spark massive growth.
Additionally, even though all four of AMD's segments will probably contribute to the company's growth, the path to $1 trillion will most likely hinge on the AI accelerator market, particularly with the upcoming release of the MI400. Even if it falls somewhat short of expectations, investors should remember that AMD can reach $1 trillion even if it grows to less than one-fourth of Nvidia's size. Such conditions make reaching a $1 trillion market cap easier than most investors are likely assuming.

It's up more than 40% on the year, more than any of the other top 10 coins. XRP has also passed a price of $3 multiple times this year, a level it hadn't reached since a brief period in January 2018.
The next significant milestone would be $4, about a 22% increase from XRP's current price of $3.28 (as of Aug. 12). Is that a realistic target for the end of the year? Let's look at what could help XRP take off during the last five months of 2025.
No more legal issues with the SEC
Ripple, the issuer of XRP, spent nearly five years locked in a legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple in 2020, alleging that the initial sale of XRP was an unregistered securities offering. Most of the major crypto exchanges subsequently delisted XRP, making it much more difficult to buy.
Last week, Ripple and the SEC agreed to dismiss their appeals. A 2023 ruling by a New York federal judge is now final, and Ripple will pay $125 million in fines, much less than the $2 billion the SEC was seeking.
The end of the lawsuit is great news for Ripple because it no longer needs to spend time and money fighting the SEC in court. The crypto market reacted quickly, with XRP's price initially surging more than 10%. But that initial surge may be the only impact we see here.
Since the U.S. elected Donald Trump as president amid promises of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, investors have been expecting a conclusion to the SEC's lawsuit against Ripple. XRP's value has skyrocketed since the presidential election largely for that reason. While the lawsuit ending is still a big deal, it probably won't continue to move the needle price-wise for XRP.
Potential spot ETF approval in October
A development that could move the needle for XRP is approval of exchange-traded funds that invest in it and sponsor ETFs. The SEC approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last year. Several asset managers, including Grayscale, Bitwise, and 21Shares, have submitted applications for XRP ETFs.
The SEC is reviewing these applications and it has set approval deadlines between Oct. 18 and Oct. 25 for all of them. Polymarket puts the odds of XRP ETF approval this year at 84%. That seems fair, considering the SEC has already approved ETFs for the two largest cryptocurrencies and isn't involved in a lawsuit with Ripple anymore.
Cryptocurrency ETFs are important because they're regulated and accessible to hedge funds, banks, and other institutional investors. Bitcoin ETFs and Ethereum ETFs have seen inflows of about $54 billion and $10 billion, respectively, since they started trading, demonstrating the kind of impact this can have.
ETF approval is a growth catalyst that could push XRP past $4. However, it wouldn't necessarily happen overnight -- Ethereum's price didn't move much after ETF approval, and it only recently started seeing heavy inflows. There's also the possibility that the SEC doesn't approve XRP ETFs, which would be a serious headwind.
$4 may be out of reach this year for XRP
XRP is hot right now, and to its credit, it's not just some meme coin that briefly caught fire. It has a legitimate use case, facilitating transactions on Ripple's cross-border payment network. However, many financial institutions only use the Ripple payment network and not XRP, one of the potential problems with it as an investment.
It could continue to grow, especially if Ripple is able to find more ways to integrate XRP into the payment services it offers. That said, I think the most likely scenario during the rest of this year is that XRP doesn't hit $4 or even a new all-time high (currently $3.84 on Jan. 4, 2018).
Much of the good news surrounding XRP is already priced in, and other cryptocurrencies are starting to take the spotlight. Case in point, in July it was Ethereum, and not XRP, that delivered the highest returns among the top coins.
If you're optimistic about Ripple's payments technology and XRP's role in that, then a small investment is reasonable. Just keep in mind that XRP is extremely volatile. It may or may not reach $4 by December, but as long as you're a long-term investor, what really matters is where XRP ends up during the rest of the decade.

Overall revenue jumped 18% to $76.4 billion, paced by exceptionally strong growth in Azure, its cloud infrastructure unit, which reported 39% growth, driving revenue from its Intelligent Cloud unit up 26% to $29.9 billion. Bottom-line results were also strong with net income up 24% to $27.2 million, or $2.65 per share.
However, one comment stood out in the company's earnings report, especially for investors in quantum computing stocks like Quantum Computing Inc. (NASDAQ: QUBT), IonQ (NYSE: IONQ), D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS), and Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI).
Quantum computing stocks have attracted attention, soaring since Alphabet unveiled a new milestone with its Willow quantum computing chip, and now Microsoft appears to be jumping on the bandwagon.
CEO Satya Nadella made a bold statement on the earnings call, saying, ""The next big accelerator in the cloud will be quantum, and I'm excited about progress. In fact, earlier this month, we announced the world's first operational deployment of a level two quantum computer with Atom Computing.""
What Microsoft is doing with quantum computing
Following in the footsteps of Alphabet, Microsoft announced its new Majorana 1 quantum chip in February, saying it's powered by a new Topological Core architecture, which will help create computers that can solve large-scale problems in years, not decades.
Microsoft's focus on topological qubits separates it from its competitors, though the company says that it's theoretically more stable than any other qubit engineered to date. Its quantum computing strategy will be driven by Azure, which will allow it to scale up its capabilities. Eventually, Microsoft says, its quantum computer will be able to handle bandwidths over 10-100 terabits per second and complete operations in less than a microsecond.
Microsoft's partnership with Atom Computing on quantum computers appears to be progressing rapidly, as in July, the company received an 80 million euro investment from a new Nordic quantum initiative, QuNorth, to build one of the very first Level 2 quantum computers.
What it means for quantum computing stocks
Quantum computing stocks didn't get the same boost from the announcement of Majorana that they did from Willow, but that may be because Alphabet's announcement took the industry by surprise, essentially kicking off a race for what may be the next disruptive technology after AI.
Microsoft is working with many of the top quantum computing stocks, so its success in quantum could be their success.
Some of these quantum computing companies also use Azure Quantum to power their operations and give customers access to their programs. For example, IonQ can reconfigure trapped-ion quantum computers for up to 11 fully connected qubits, and Rigetti's systems also operate on Azure Quantum and are known for fast gate times, low-latency conditional logic, and fast program execution.
However, the whole sector should benefit from improving visibility for quantum computing as tech leaders like Nadella tout its proximity and potential.
Nadella recognized the potential in AI early on and partnered with OpenAI to establish itself as a leader in generative AI. He also recognized the opportunity in cloud computing and has built Azure into a force that can soon topple Amazon Web Services as the biggest cloud infrastructure platform.
Now, Microsoft is aiming to do the same thing with quantum computing. While quantum seems unlikely to have its ""ChatGPT moment"" the way AI did, we could see it generating meaningful revenue in the next few years for some of the companies above.
If Microsoft gets more bullish on the technology, that should be a clear signal for the industry as a whole. While not every quantum stock will be a winner, any progress for the technology at this point is a win for the sector.

However, it is still better than the 0.1pc expected by analysts and a figure that will be welcomed by Rachel Reeves, with GDP per person – a proxy for living standards – also seeing growth in the first half of this year.
However, scratch below the surface and it’s clear that the factors behind this growth are unsustainable.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the expansion over the past quarter was driven by “government consumption”. This includes health and defence, as Labour pours billions of pounds into the NHS and ramps up its pledge to spend more on the military.
Statisticians added that public sector administration costs had also climbed in the three months to June. By contrast, business investment declined and household spending barely grew.
At the same time, private sector businesses saw a massive increase in costs – with the Chancellor’s record National Insurance raid on employers coming alongside a big jump in the minimum wage at the start of April.
Reeves’s decision to boost public spending for the rest of the parliament while taxing private sector businesses will only cement these trends.
The Chancellor hailed the “strong start to the year”, adding: “I know that the British economy has the key ingredients for success but has felt stuck for too long.”
However, Anna Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: “It is good to see a stronger growth outturn than many feared.
“But it is striking that momentum is coming from the public sector, with consumer spending slowing and business investment contracting. Private sector growth is being held back by both global and domestic policy uncertainty, with speculation over forthcoming tax increases adding to the headwinds.”
With this speculation of further tax rises likely to create more uncertainty and hold back vital investment, the Chancellor faces becoming even more reliant on the public sector to fuel growth.
The trend didn’t just start under Labour. The Bank of England has previously highlighted that public sector output has been driving growth for almost two years now while private sector growth has lagged behind.
This is dangerous for two reasons. Public sector productivity is barely above levels seen in 1997, meaning that despite all the technological advances over the past few decades, for every £1 spent on schools, hospitals and teachers, it still gets about the same amount out.
By contrast, output per hour in the private sector is about 32pc higher than its 1997 level, which is still not much to celebrate. Productivity tells us how much the economy can grow without generating too much inflation. When productivity grows, so do company profits and staff wages. This leads to stronger growth, a bigger economy, rising tax revenues and smaller borrowing bills.
As Andrew Bailey, the Governor of the Bank of England, put it earlier this year: “It is fair to say we have seen an increase in public sector employment. We haven’t seen a commensurate increase in measured public sector output.”
Measurement issues play a role. After all, it is difficult to quantify what an hour of teaching is worth.
Britain’s older and sicker population also suggests the state will only get bigger, relying on ever higher taxes on the private sector to pay for it all.
Analysis by the Resolution Foundation, a think tank, shows that Reeves has put health spending on course to gobble up half of all the money spent on day-to-day services by the end of the decade. This is up from a third in 2010 and roughly a quarter in 1999.
With public sector employment on the rise and demands for ever higher pay getting louder, there is a risk that the trend of dire public sector productivity continues.
For this reason, Reeves’s allies say she will focus on driving up productivity in the Budget. She needs to if Labour is to achieve a pledge of raising living standards across the country.
ONS data showed real GDP per head grew by 0.2pc in the three months to July, following growth of 0.6pc in the first quarter. The UK is also holding its own on the international stage, with overall growth of 0.3pc compared to a contraction of 0.1pc in Germany and Italy, two of Europe’s biggest economies.
It’s not all gloomy, with net trade confounding all expectations by contributing positively to growth.
The UK has emerged relatively unscathed from Donald Trump’s trade war, with exports actually rising in the second quarter by 1.6pc. Pharmaceutical manufacturing also ramped up over the quarter, with the sector still fearful of being hit by higher tariffs.
Sanjay Raja at Deutsche Bank said the strong momentum at the end of the quarter suggested annual growth could be revised up in “a welcome sign for the Chancellor and the Office for Budget Responsibility”.
However, he also cautioned that a strong private sector was the key to sustainable growth.
“To be sure, the economy is growing,” Raja said. “Positive momentum is brewing. But animal spirits remain tepid.
While the Chancellor is poised to focus her Budget on improving productivity – a very welcome focus for the UK – Number 11 should also prioritise lifting household and business confidence to sustain the UK’s outperformance.”",4467a9393438e38f2f80e251612e088e,trafilatura,5320,0

As part of its ""global security strategy"", the bank plans a four-fold increase in the number of cameras at its new building in the City of London, a site about half the size of its existing office in Canary Wharf, an internal presentation by the bank's protective security team dated May 2025, seen by Reuters, shows. According to the presentation, the new London building is expected to have an estimated 1,754 cameras, up from about 444 devices installed in its current global headquarters in Canary Wharf in London.
It also plans to double its biometric readers to access the new building to 779 from 350.
Under the plan, reported here for the first time, access to HSBC's top-tier buildings, including in Britain and the U.S., should be based on biometric verification, including full-hand recognition.
Access can also be ""digital"", with employees expected to use their own mobile phones to badge in, the presentation document shows.
HSBC, Europe's biggest bank by assets, employs more than 210,000 people globally, including more than 31,000 across the UK.
Most employees are expected to use personal mobile phones with a firm-installed software on them to gain access. This has met with some resistance from staff, a person with knowledge of the policies said.
As of the end of last year, most of the UK staff had yet to adhere to the biometric and digital access policy which the bank started to implement in 2022, in part because of opposition, according to the person.
""The safety and security of our people is at the forefront of everything HSBC does,"" an HSBC representative told Reuters.
""We regularly risk assess every building and dependant on the identified risk and vulnerabilities, we continue to invest in the latest cutting-edge technology to safeguard our colleagues, customers and visitors in line with industry standards,"" the bank added.
Companies have increased surveillance of staff amid a shift to hybrid working, while advances in technology allow for more sophisticated controls.
Banks in particular have stepped up monitoring to ensure the parts of their businesses that are heavily regulated comply with conduct rules. National privacy laws determine what companies can monitor.
The extensive surveillance enabled by new technologies is raising concerns about risks to workers’ rights and wellbeing, according to a May report by the Institute for Public Policy Research, a London-based think tank.
In July, HSBC requested that senior staff globally report to the office at least four days a week, starting from October, a bank spokesperson said. Previously, the bank had no global policy on the matter, with approaches varying depending on the country, they said.
As demands for office space grow again, the bank has decided to add to its planned City of London HQ, with a new smaller presence in Canary Wharf, Reuters reported.
The documents seen by Reuters do not include references to the new Canary Wharf office space.
The bank's security project is overseen by Diane Marchena, global head of protective security, who reports to Chief Operating Officer Suzy White, the person with knowledge of the matter said.
Marchena and White declined to comment for this article.
ISRAELI SURVEILLANCE TOOLS
HSBC has been working with Israeli firm Octopus since at least 2024, adopting some of its tools for surveillance in the UK and Hong Kong and is planning more rollouts for monitoring, other documents outlining HSBC's global strategy seen by Reuters show.
HSBC plans the deployment of Octopus tools in other countries such as India and Mexico this year, the documents, which are undated, show.
Israel is one of the world’s leading exporters of surveillance. Octopus says it sells its tools to buyers in 28 countries. Its technology has been reportedly used by entities, including the Israeli government to monitor some Israeli cities and a European Union-funded refugee camp on the Greek island of Samos.
A representative for Octopus did not take Reuters calls seeking comment and the company did not respond to a Reuters email seeking comment.
An HSBC spokesperson said the bank does not comment on vendors or suppliers.
TRADING FLOORS
In HSBC's new London building, the increased video surveillance will include cameras at entry and exit points of trading floors, the May 2025 presentation shows, and the use of artificial intelligence analytics.
HSBC's budget for the initial rollout of the new London building surveillance was recently tripled to about $15 million, the person familiar with the matter said.
According to the presentation, ""theft incidents"" in its Canary Wharf building ""point to the need for increased CCTV capabilities on working floors,"" and that recent ""crime data"" showed an increase of incidents, including burglary, within a one-mile radius of the new office.
The person familiar with the matter said that theft events on HSBC premises were mostly minor.

The company showed strong free cash flow, implying its value could be higher.
AAL is at $13.05 in midday trading today. This is higher than $11.46 on July 24, when it released earnings. Investors may have turned bullish. This article will look into why that might be.
Today's Barchart Unusual Stock Options Activity Report shows that over 35,000 call options contracts at the $14.00 strike price have traded for the expiry period ending Sept. 26. That is 44 days from now, or a month and a half in the future.
This huge number of call option contracts is over 285x more than the prior number of outstanding contracts at the $14.00 exercise price for expiry on Sept. 26. That implies heavy trading by institutional investors initiating contracts on both sides of the trade.
For example, investors who are buying these calls believe that AAL will rise over $14.45, or +10.6% from today over the next month and a half in order for the intrinsic value of the calls to rise over cost:
$14.45 - $14.00 cost = $0.45 (i.e., the ask side today of the call option premium)
However, it's likely that if this occurs in the next two to three weeks, the price of the options will be significantly higher than 45 cents. That way, the investor won't have to wait until expiration to make a profit.
That is due to the extrinsic value that is left in the premium, as there is time left for the stock to rise further.
On the other hand, sellers of these calls believe that they are getting a good deal as well. They may be long AAL stock today or bought shares at today's price. That way, selling covered calls brings them an immediate yield of 3.37%:
$0.44 premium received / $13.06 cost of 100 shares = 0.03369 = 3.369% for just 44 days
That works out to an annualized expected return (ER) of at least 26.95% (i.e., 3.369% x 8x). This, of course, assumes that the same yield could be made by a trader repeating this play 8 times in a year (which may not be the case).
Let's look at why investors may be bullish on AAL stock.
Strong Cash Flow and Forecasts
American Airlines reported $14.392 billion in Q2 revenue, up slightly from last year's $14.332 billion (i.e., +0.4% Y/Y). Its first-half revenue was up slightly (+0.14%) to $26.943 billion.
Moreover, the airline was able to squeeze out more cash flow from this revenue.
For example, its operating cash flow (OCF) was $3.419 billion for the first half, compared to $3.308 billion last year (according to Stock Analysis quarterly cash flow data), a +3.35% growth rate in OCF.
That also means that its operating cash flow margin (i.e., OCF/revenue) rose to 12.7% (i.e. $14.392b/$26.943b) from 12.3% last year ($3.308b/$26.904b).
This increase was also reflected in its free cash flow (after lower capex spending this H1). For example, FCF in H1 was $2.096 billion (according to Stock Analysis) vs. $1.833 billion last year (H1 2024).
That means the airline generated stronger FCF margins (i.e., 7.78% FCF margin in H1 2025 vs. 6.81% last year's H1). (Note the company talks about adj. FCF in its report, but we have not adjusted the FCF figures).
Forecasts. As a result, we can forecast significantly higher FCF going forward.
For example, analysts now project revenue between $54.408 billion in 2025 and $57.8 billion in 2026. So, using the next 12-month (NTM) revenue forecast of $56.1 billion with a 7.7% FCF margin, we can forecast FCF:
$56.1 b revenue NTM x 0.077 = $4.32 billion in FCF
That would be well over the $1.563 billion in FCF American Airlines has generated in the last 12 months, according to Stock Analysis. It could push AAL stock significantly higher over the next 12 months (NTM).
Price Targets for AAL Stock
For example, even though American Airlines does not now pay a dividend, let's assume it eventually paid out less than half (33%) of the $4.3 billion forecast free cash flow. Let's also assume the market gives AAL stock a 10% dividend yield.
Here is how that would value AAL stock:
$4.32 billion x 33% = $1.43 billion dividend payments
$1.43 billion / 0.10 = $14.33 billion market value
That is still +66% higher than AAL stock's current market cap of $8.617 billion, according to Yahoo! Finance. That is, AAL stock is potentially worth +66% more or $21.66 per share.
Just as a double check, let's assume that its H1 FCF of $2.096 billion doubles to $4.192 billion. If it paid out 1/3rd of that amount or $1.4 billion, and the market gave it a 10% yield, the value would be:
$1.4b / 0.1 = $14.0 billion, i.e., +62.5% upside
That could be why analysts now have higher price targets. For example, AnaChart.com says 17 analysts now have an average price target of $16.35 per share.
The bottom line is that AAL stock looks cheap today. That could be why there is so much interest in its call options for expiry on Sept. 26.

But shortly after Buffett announced he would retire from his CEO role at the end of 2025, Berkshire Hathaway shares started to deflate. They are now down around 15%, and its class B shares are trading below $470. Is this a good opportunity to buy the stock?
What is Berkshire Hathaway, anyway?
Berkshire Hathaway is classified as a finance sector company largely because it has significant insurance operations. And that isn't a bad label to put on it -- every company has to be categorized somewhere -- but it doesn't do justice to the actual businesses owned by the diversified conglomerate. Berkshire Hathaway's corporate umbrella covers more than 180 wholly owned companies. It also holds a massive portfolio of publicly traded stocks.
The variety of businesses in the Berkshire Hathaway empire includes everything from insurance companies to manufacturers, from utilities to retailers, and from railroads to candy makers. And that's far from a complete list -- I could keep going, but you probably get the idea. What investors in Berkshire Hathaway are really buying is more akin to a mutual fund than a traditional company. And that means that when you buy Berkshire Hathaway, what you are really doing is investing alongside Buffett.
This is why the leadership transition from Buffett to his hand-picked successor, Greg Abel, is such a big deal. And it is why investors are selling the stock even as the market rises. The conglomerate's incredible long-term performance, which was based on Buffett's unique investment approach, likely contributed to the stock's premium valuation.
Is it time to jump ship or jump aboard?
For investors who only own shares of Berkshire Hathaway because of Buffett, it makes some sense to sell in the wake of his retirement announcement. There is no way to know what Abel will do at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, and he has big shoes to fill. However, there are some things you ought to consider before making a buy or sell decision about the stock.
For starters, Buffett is retiring as CEO, but he is not completely leaving the company just yet. He will stay on as the chairman of the board of directors. That means that he will remain Greg Abel's boss. Although Buffett famously has a hands-off management style, when a Berkshire subsidiary needs an assist, he steps in. So we can expect that Abel won't be left adrift. He will still have access to the sage wisdom of the Oracle of Omaha to help him out as needed.
Then there's the important fact that Abel has worked for Buffett for decades. He is steeped in his mentor's investment approach and has played an important role in the conglomerate's investment process for several years, too. So when he's in the CEO seat, his investment approach will be based on Buffett's approach. Sure, Abel is a different person, so his style won't be identical to Buffett's. But they are highly likely to rhyme.
All in all, the CEO transition will be a huge deal for Berkshire Hathaway. But it may not be as dramatic a change as some fear when it comes to how the giant conglomerate operates. That said, Buffett is leaving Abel with a huge cash stockpile -- Berkshire had over $340 billion of cash on its balance sheet at the end of the second quarter. That will be a drag on near-term performance, but could also allow Abel the chance to hit the ground running since it could fund some sizable acquisitions.
The future is unknowable, but Berkshire isn't likely to change much
The recent slide in Berkshire Hathaway's share price is likely related to Buffett's impending retirement. That event is a big deal, but given Abel's long history with Buffett, it may not be as big a deal as some investors fear. If you only have Berkshire in your portfolio because of Buffett, selling could make sense. But if you simply want to be a long-term investor in a Buffett-like investment approach, then there's literally no better option than Berkshire Hathaway. And the stock's decline below $470 could make this a smart moment for you to get on board.

Even though the fashion industry’s bigwigs have gone to great pains to project calm in the midst of President Donald Trump’s trade war — the reality of 35 percent tariffs from many markets can only be “mitigated” away for so long.
And even though Chinese and American trade negotiators have given themselves another three months to cut a deal, there has already been more than enough disruption to push big pieces of the apparel world — including Gildan and HanesBrands — into action.
Glenn Chamandy, president and chief executive officer of Gildan, told analysts on a conference call on Wednesday that the deal will let the company “achieve a scale that distinctly sets us apart.”
“The acquisition effectively doubles our revenues to about $6.9 billion on a last-12-month pro forma basis and builds on industry-leading margins,” Chamandy crowed. “Our expanded scale will enhance Gildan’s position in basic apparel as one of the largest global apparel players by number of units sold with strong innovation from yarn spinning to end product and great supply chain capabilities to support customers.”
Gildan already makes the bulk of its goods in Central America and the Caribbean and is doubling down with HanesBrands, which has two large facilities in the region that Chamandy said could be “modernized.”
The trade war might even be kind of good for Gildan.
“Tariffs are creating an opportunity,” said Jay Sole, an equity analyst at UBS, pointing to the potential for nearshoring.
While tariff rates are still up in the air, and given Trump’s negotiating style could remain in flux, Gildan would benefit if Central America ultimately faces lower costs at the border than shipments from Southeast Asia.
The company is also building a bigger, theoretically more stable base for a world in flux.
“Gildan might be looking to scale the business in order to just build the kind of capabilities they need to really absorb a lot more business and add capacity, which allows them to take share in this new world with all these new tariffs,” Sole said.
“This is not them playing defense,” he said. “I think this is them playing offense. The combined company is definitely a stronger company than it was as they were separately.”
Investors certainly saw the potential and traded shares of Gildan up 11.8 percent to $54.93 on Wednesday, leaving the company with a market capitalization of $8.2 million as it is set up to add branded staples Hanes, Bali, Maidenform, Wonderbra and more.
Gildan is ponying up just 13 percent, or $290 million, of the deal price in cash, with the rest of the company being bought for stock.
That cash purchase price will be covered quickly as the deal is expected to be “immediately accretive” to Gildan’s adjusted earnings and produce $200 million in annual cost synergies within three years.
Gildan is leaning forward and, except for the people impacted by those $200 million in cost savings, HanesBrands is in a much more protected position.
More brands might well be looking for a port in the storm.
“There is a massive amount of disruption that’s coming,” said Michael Prendergast, managing director in Alvarez & Marsal’s Consumer and Retail Group.
“Everyone is saying, ‘We’ve got it, we’ve adjusted our pricing, we’ve got concessions from our vendors and we have already optimized our supply chain,’ and then it kind of stops,” Prendergast said. “If you kind of get beneath the surface of what they’re really doing, the response is not strong enough to offset the tariffs that are actually coming.”
The tariff pauses have helped and a lot of retailers can live off of inventories they already own and use them to cushion the blow of higher prices, but Prendergast said the tone in the industry is starting to change.
“People sort of punted and got through second-quarter earnings calls, got through kind of the beginning of third quarter, but it’s going to be disruptive as we go forward,” he said.
The fashion world has been too optimistic that consumers are going to be OK with higher costs and that companies can figure out how to manage, he said.
“That is a very flawed approach because everything is pointing towards consumers are struggling with elevated prices and even a 5 to 10 percent increase in price from where we are today,” he said. “Consumers are going to react to that. If you really step back and look at it, there is an incremental 25 to 35 percent tariff coming.
“People are kind of missing the plot,” he said. “It’s sort of this waiting to actually address the problem reactively versus proactively getting in front of it.”
Gildan, for one, is stepping up.
“It’s an accretive move to strip expenses out of a business and then keep the revenue base,” Prendergast said. “I actually love this move.”
It’s a move that more CEOs might start looking at and wondering, is it my turn next?

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/corn-market-buy-133742529.html,8fedf9b0602bf4c064d23e2003ee05a3,Is the Corn Market a Buy ? ,Is the Corn Market a Buy ? ,2025-08-15 14:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"The question comes to fundamentals, where the market is not, nor has it been, as bearish as USDA's latest round of guesses.
As you know, when it comes to long-term investments, my go-to market is Corn. When dealing with the futures market, I prefer to track the more heavily traded December contract (ZCZ25) only, rolling positions forward and back based on the long-time investor favorite Dec-Dec corn futures spread. As I talked about in late July, I had the opportunity to take part in Barchart’s Grain Merchandising and Technology meeting in Ames, Iowa and Manhattan, Kansas. The consistent theme in both discussions, with Thomas Call of Mid-Co Commodities and Guy Allen of Kansas State University, was that Dec25 corn was drawing near to a bullish turning point.
I agreed at the time and do even more so given Dec25 has posted new contract lows the past two weeks. That would seem bearish, based on both the economic law of Supply and Demand and the idea that bullish markets don’t make new lows. However, if we apply my Market Rules to December corn futures, what answer do we come up with to the question of the day: Is the Corn Market a Buy?
Market Rule #1: Don’t get crossways with the trend.
The last few years have been an interesting ride after the Dec22 issue completed a bearish spike reversal[i] during May 2022, telling us the major (long-term) trend had turned down. This downtrend was in place until a year ago when the Dec24 issue completed a bullish spike reversal, leading to a Wave 1 rally peaking this past February and the ongoing Wave 2 selloff[ii].
As usual, at least from my point of view, the long-term trend has been driven by noncommercial activity. A look at the chart for the noncommercial futures-only position as reported weekly by the CFTC and we see funds started seriously liquidating long futures in mid-to-late May 2022 while adding short futures. The net-short futures position bottomed out at 266,067 contracts the week of February 20, 2024. By the time we reached late July 2024, Watson began covering its short futures positions.
Approaching late August 2024, and we see the noncommercial net-short futures position is being trimmed again, a result of both short covering and new buying interest. All while Dec25 has held the August 2024 of $3.85 posted by Dec24, as is characteristic of Wave 2.
Market Rule #2: Let the market dictate your actions.
With all the hullabaloo surrounding USDA’s ridiculous August supply and demand numbers, as well as the upcoming clueless Midwest crop tour, one would think corn fundamentals are tanking.
A funny thing about that, though, as our reads on REAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND, most notably new crop futures spreads, have stabilized of late. The Dec-March spread increased its coverage of calculated full commercial carry to 57% through the end of July – about the time I was attending the Barchart programs – but then stabilized through mid-August. At the close of Thursday, August 14, the Dec-March futures spread covered roughly 55% while the Dec-July spread (the 2025-2026 market as a whole) was covering 48%. These are neutral reads rather than bearish.
Market Rule #6: Fundamentals win in the end.
If I can see the 2025-2026 corn market is not fundamentally bearish, so can Watson. Given this, it would make sense for funds to cover short futures positions over the coming weeks.
And if Watson is covering short futures, or buying, and funds set the trend of a market, as I’ve argued for decades, then the logical conclusion is the trend should remain up.
Market Rule #3: Use filters to manage risk. (The filters I use are Seasonal and Price Distribution Analysis, along with market volatility.)
Seasonally, December corn futures tend to post a low weekly close the fourth week of August. This after falling roughly 12% from the normal high weekly close the third week of June. Dec25 is priced near $4.00 early Friday morning (August 15), a drop of 16% from its high weekly close of $4.75 posted the third week of February. The bottom line is Dec25 has fulfilled both the time and space components of its normal seasonal tendencies.
As for price, Dec25 sitting near $4.00 puts it in the lower 15% of its distribution range based on weekly closes only back through the 2020 contract. Using classic Price Distribution analysis, this tells us the contract doesn’t spend much time at or below this price level. Given funds are already short futures and producers aren’t in a hurry to sell, there is little incentive for Watson to continue to add put pressure on the market. This could lead to a round of short-covering as funds move money to markets with better return opportunities.
[i] A bearish spike reversal pattern is when the contract extends its previous uptrend before closing lower for the timeframe being studied.
[ii] Part of an Elliott Wave 5-wave uptrend pattern.

Ever considered investing in real estate? You might already have a big piece of what you need. ""House hacking"" is a new strategy homeowners are using to kick-start their rental portfolios.
In today's big story, the latest inflation data gave investors a reason to feel upbeat about what's coming next.
Not too hot, not too cold — this was just right. The latest inflation report struck a good balance, delivering a best-case scenario for the stock market.
The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Tuesday, while the Nasdaq rose over 1% and the Dow spiked nearly 500 points. US stock futures are continuing the climb this morning.
The consumer price index rose 2.7% year-over-year in July, below economists' expectations of 2.8%. The figures may seem marginal, but for markets, this was the sweet spot.
That's largely because it was likely low enough to allow the Federal Reserve to cut rates at its September meeting, BI's William Edwards writes.
At the same time, the inflation reading was high enough to ease recession fears that had flared after the disappointing July jobs report, which included significant downward revisions to previous data.
Meanwhile, the latest inflation report opens up more positive possibilities. The CME FedWatch Tool now shows markets seeing 92% odds the Fed cuts rates by 25 basis points next month, up from about 80% on Monday. Higher odds are also now being priced in for cuts in October and December.
For Trump, rate cuts can't come soon enough.
""Jerome 'Too Late' Powell must NOW lower the rate. Steve 'Manouychin' really gave me a 'beauty' when he pushed this loser. The damage he has done by always being Too Late is incalculable.""
Writing in a Truth Social post early Tuesday, Trump said that he is also ""considering allowing a major lawsuit against Powell to proceed"" over the ""grossly incompetent"" job he's done renovating the Federal Reserve.
This is the latest twist in Trump's feud with the Fed Chair, which seems to remain in an uncomfortable phase. The markets, at least, may be entering a brighter one.
3 things in markets
1. America's biggest bank is about to open its new headquarters. JPMorgan Chase's new 60-story skyscraper at 270 Park Avenue is full of high-end perks and amenities. The building includes a ""state-of-the-art"" gym — which the bank said employees will have to pay a membership fee to access — an Irish pub, AI tech systems, and more. Take a look.
2. A September showdown may be looming. Day traders outperformed professional money managers this summer, but their dominance might not last long. A historically seasonal pullback in retail trading and other headwinds threaten to upend the summer-long rally.
3. Trump's pick for Bureau of Labor Statistics chief suggested pausing US jobs reports. E.J. Antoni, Trump's nominee and chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, floated the idea on Fox News Digital earlier this month, citing accuracy concerns. Economists and market strategists told BI that such a move would be damaging for investors and economic planners.
3 things in tech
1. Microsoft has Meta AI talent in its sights. The software giant has a list of its most-wanted researchers and engineers from Meta and has already begun offering multimillion-dollar pay packages, documents viewed by BI's Ashley Stewart reveal. It's a step to compete with the eye-popping comp Microsoft's rivals are offering in the AI talent wars.
2. AI coding startups have an inference whale problem. Anthropic and Cursor are facing surging costs from a handful of heavy users, which is eating into their business models. As a result, they're introducing tiers or rate limits to what was formerly a basic fixed-price monthly subscription plan.
3. Baconator with a side of AI? Michael Chorey, the executive responsible for building out the AI automation for Wendy's drive-thru, which he says can take orders faster than a human in a headset, is leaving after five years. Chorey exclusively told BI that he is joining Presto, a tech company developing AI-first drive-thrus, which he believes is the next era of fast-food hospitality.
3 things in business
1. To solve the housing crisis, think outside the bounds. Outside the city bounds, that is. Ned Resnikoff argues that connecting cities, towns, and suburbs into large regional governances would make it easier and cheaper to buy a home in the US. Taxes from exclusive enclaves, like Greenwich, Connecticut, or Sausalito, California, would help support nearby cities.

","Apple Stock Is Gaining Momentum , Is AAPL Stock a Buy ? ",2025-08-15 05:00:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Apple’s (AAPL) stock performance this year hasn’t been worth noticing. For much of the year, the iPhone maker lagged behind the broader market, weighed down by trade disputes and tariff-related uncertainties. Year-to-date, AAPL shares are still down roughly 7%, while the S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has climbed about 9.7%. However, the stock is gaining momentum. Apple has risen more than 9% in the last five trading days.
The turnaround has been driven by two key developments. First, Apple delivered a solid third-quarter performance, showing resilience and the capacity to generate growth even in a challenging environment. Second, the company expanded its U.S. investment and announced a new American manufacturing program, a move widely interpreted as a step to ease tariff concerns. By boosting its U.S.-based production, Apple is addressing tariff risks and aligning itself more closely with domestic policy priorities. This is particularly important given President Donald Trump’s past criticism of Apple’s reliance on overseas manufacturing.
Apple’s recent steps have been seen as a careful balancing act, strengthening its manufacturing footprint in the U.S. while maintaining a global supply chain that has been key to its margins. The market’s positive reaction suggests investors are encouraged by Apple’s ability to adapt to political and economic pressures.
With market sentiment improving for Apple stock, will the momentum sustain?
Apple’s Growth Drivers Remain Intact
Despite the macro challenges, Apple’s products see solid demand, and its services business continues to post robust growth. This is evident from its latest quarterly results. Apple reported a record June quarter revenue of $94 billion, up 10% from a year ago, with growth in every geographic region.
On the hardware front, product sales climbed to $66.6 billion, an 8% year-over-year increase, powered by robust demand for the iPhone and Mac. The company’s ecosystem remains a key strength, with the active installed base of devices hitting all-time highs across every product category and region.
The iPhone generated $44.6 billion in revenue, 13% higher than last year, reflecting strong sales of the iPhone 16 lineup. Growth was broad-based, with every region contributing and many emerging markets posting double-digit increases. The number of iPhones in active use set a new record, and Apple achieved its best-ever June quarter for customer upgrades.
Mac sales also impressed, surging 15% to $8 billion. The segment witnessed gains across every region, with particularly strong growth in Greater China, Europe, and the rest of the Asia Pacific. Like the iPhone, the Mac installed base is now at its highest level ever, supported by strong demand from both new and upgrading customers.
Not every category was in growth mode. iPad revenue came in at $6.6 billion, down 8% due to tough comparisons with last year’s product launches. Still, the iPad’s installed base reached another record, and more than half of buyers were first-time customers, which is a promising sign for future growth. Wearables, Home, and Accessories saw a 9% decline to $7.4 billion, also reflecting difficult year-ago comparisons. But here too, Apple continues to expand its reach, with the Apple Watch installed base hitting a new high and more than half of new watch buyers coming from outside the existing customer base.
The services segment was once again a star performer, delivering revenue of $27.4 billion, up 13% year-over-year. This growth was broad-based, with significant gains in cloud services, thanks to rising iCloud subscriptions. Customer engagement remains on an upward trajectory, with both transacting and paid accounts hitting all-time highs, and paid subscriptions growing at a double-digit pace to surpass 1 billion across Apple’s platforms.
Looking ahead, Apple expects momentum to continue into the current quarter. Management projects total company revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits year-over-year, with services likely to sustain their double-digit growth pace.
Is Apple Stock a Buy Right Now?
Apple’s iPhone and Mac remain highly desirable, setting the stage for solid growth. Moreover, Apple’s tight-knit ecosystem and the rising contribution of its services division provide a solid base for revenue growth that can help in navigating the broader economic uncertainty. However, trade tensions and tariffs remain a potential headwind and could continue to impact its margins in the short term.
On Wall Street, sentiment toward the stock is cautiously optimistic, with analysts maintaining a “Moderate Buy” consensus rating. However, with shares trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 31x and earnings growth projected at just 6.7% for fiscal 2026, much of the positives are already reflected in its current price.

The days of landlords knocking on doors for monthly rent checks, or tenants going after landlords to fix a leaky toilet are slowly coming to an end. Technology has been stepping in to address the needs of tenants, landlords and large multifamily operators, and now artificial intelligence is turning that slow progress into a rental revolution.
Work orders, lease renewals, tours and even investor due diligence are being taken over by software and AI. As with the start of any technology, it has been largely fragmented among a multitude of vendors. The integration of all that technology is a huge opportunity for startups and the venture capitalists backing them.
Rent tech
One of the more mature categories for AI in the apartment space is virtual agents talking to prospective residents. This is where agentic AI comes in — meaning AI that can act autonomously and make its own decisions depending on what the consumer asks. There are still, however, just a handful of companies using that advanced level of machine learning.
AI is also proving useful on the investment side of the multifamily business, specifically underwriting and acquisitions. For example, investors looking to purchase a large property have to go through all the leases and load those into a rent roll.
""If you're buying a property that hasn't been professionally managed, where those aren't all loaded into some market-leading software product, somebody may have to manually go through all those leases and capture all the information. Well, AI is great for that, right?"" said John Helm, founder and partner at RET Ventures, a fund focusing on AI in both real estate and rent tech.
Instead, according to Helm, you can feed leases into an AI model, and it will spit out a summary of all the data the investor needs. They can then load that directly into an underwriting model and value the property.
RET Ventures said it doesn't rely on endowments or pension funds for its capital, but instead the consumers of the products of the companies they invest in — so-called strategic limited partners.
""We have 60 multifamily operators that have about over 3 million units in our fund,"" he said.
Property management
AI can also help with property development and accounts payable. Multifamily developers will often have multiple vendors, from landscaping to plumbing to heating. Many still use paper invoices.
One of RET's portfolio companies is PredictAP. It takes all those invoices, reads them and then repopulates all the necessary data into the company's payables system to make the process and payments more efficient. None of it needs to be manually coded by a human.
Funnel
Tyler Christiansen likens the multifamily industry to car dealerships. Every renter interaction was siloed to an individual property. As CEO of Funnel, which is backed by RET Ventures, his aim is to streamline the apartment marketing and leasing process, ""enabling multifamily professionals to generate more profits, efficiency, and insight across their portfolios,"" according to the company website.
Funnel works with large apartment real estate investment trusts such as Camden Property Trust, MAA and Essex Property Trust, as well as Cortland, which owns 90,000 apartments. Christiansen said that rather than the renter's relationship being with the community, the renter's relationship is really with the brand. He calls that ""centralization"" in the industry.
""And then AI, what makes it unique within Funnel is that rather than automating interactions simply at a community level, we're really opening up automations across the portfolio,"" said Christiansen.
One example would be if a tenant is not renewing a lease at one community because they are moving to a different market, Funnel's AI system would open up the possibility of cross-selling that person into another client community.
Headwinds
Despite the progress, the technology is still in its infancy, and it's expensive. Apartment operators and investors are in the experimental phase. It remains to be seen how much they will invest.
Plus, the multifamily industry is highly fragmented. There are close to 50 million rental units in the U.S., the majority owned by small, often mom-and-pop landlords. The largest apartment REITs own roughly between 50,000 and 100,000 units each, with a few larger private operators, like Blackstone and Greystar.
""I guess the challenge is going to be, probably in the next several years, really sifting through everything and understanding where there are real businesses that could grow into this. You're still seeing a lot of these tools just starting to get deployed,"" said Helm.",91b9821e01765a58ffda16beba4b5f96,trafilatura,5004,0

This $589 Trillion Problem Stands in the Way,2025-08-15 18:45:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"The Shiba Inu(CRYPTO: SHIB) cryptocurrency was created by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi in 2020. Investors piled into it hoping it would have similar success to the industry's original meme token, Dogecoin, which was soaring in value at the time.
Shiba Inu rocketed higher by 45,278,000% in 2021, which remains one of the best annual returns for any asset in the history of the financial markets. It would have been enough to turn a perfectly timed investment of just $3 into more than $1 million.
However, the incredible move was fueled by speculation that inevitably fizzled out, and Shiba Inu has since lost 84% of its peak value. It's struggling to build sustainable momentum because it lacks fundamental catalysts, but a series of pro-crypto policies from President Donald Trump's administration is driving some positive sentiment across the industry right now.
Could 2025 be the year it stages another historic run, this time reaching the $1 milestone? There might be a $589 trillion problem standing in the way.
Shiba Inu might not benefit from crypto-friendly policies
Shiba Inu doesn't have much utility in the real world. It's too volatile to be considered a legitimate store of value, and according to crypto directory Cryptwerk, just 1,074 businesses worldwide are willing to accept it as payment for goods and services.
Trump is making it easier for cryptocurrencies to find new ways to create value by introducing supportive government policies and by relaxing regulations, but it's unclear whether these moves will help speculative tokens like Shiba Inu.
For example, the president created a digital assets stockpile to store a variety of cryptocurrencies that the U.S. government seizes as a result of criminal activity, but Shiba Inu isn't one of them. He also appointed crypto advocate Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, but a lighter regulatory touch won't solve the meme token's volatile nature or its lack of adoption among businesses and consumers.
The $589 trillion problem preventing a run to $1
The crypto's plentiful supply is perhaps the biggest hurdle on the path to $1. There are 589.5 trillion tokens in circulation, so at the current price of $0.000014 per token, it has a market capitalization of $8.1 billion.
Simple math dictates that a price of $1 would result in a market cap of $589.5 trillion, which would make it 137 times more valuable than the world's largest company, Nvidia. The token would also be five times bigger than the annual output of the entire global economy, which was $111 trillion last year.
In other words, there is simply no way Shiba Inu will ever trade at $1 in its current state. But the community is trying to carve another pathway to $1 by burning tokens, which removes them from circulation forever. Basically, when tokens are sent to a dead wallet where they can never be retrieved, the price of each remaining token should rise organically to account for the reduction in supply.
Burning enough tokens will take thousands of years
Based on Shiba Inu's current market cap of $8.1 billion, burning 99.99998% of the 589.5 trillion tokens to leave just 8.1 billion in circulation would, theoretically, result in a price of $1. But it would require participation from almost every holder, meaning nobody would actually make any money.
To put it another way, even though each Shiba Inu token would be worth $1, every investor would have 99.99998% fewer tokens, so their net financial position would remain exactly the same.
Besides, just 1.7 billion tokens were burned last month, which translates to an annualized rate of 20.4 billion. It would take 28,882 years to burn enough tokens to warrant a price of $1 at the current pace. That's a long time to wait to make no money!
In summary, reaching $1 is completely out of the question for Shiba Inu in 2025. In fact, it's unlikely to happen at any point in our lifetime.

Thousands of Air Canada flight attendants walked off the job after months of negotiations over a new contract just before 1 a.m. EDT (0500 GMT). In anticipation of the stoppage, the airline canceled nearly all of its 700 daily flights, forcing more than 100,000 travelers to scramble for alternatives or stay put.
Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu said at a news conference she had asked the Canada Industrial Relations Board to impose binding arbitration on both sides and order an immediate end to the strike.
""This is not a decision that I've taken lightly, but the potential for immediate negative impact on Canadians and our economy is simply too great,"" she said.
Air Canada had asked Prime Minister Mark Carney's minority Liberal government to act, but the Canadian Union of Public Employees said it wanted a negotiated solution, as binding arbitration would take pressure off the airline.
Minutes after the announcement, CUPE blasted the government's decision.
""The Liberal government is rewarding Air Canada's refusal to negotiate fairly by giving them exactly what they wanted,"" it said in a statement posted on X. Air Canada did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
While passengers have generally voiced support for the flight attendants on social media, Canadian businesses — already reeling from a trade dispute with the U.S. — have urged the federal government to impose binding arbitration and cut short the strike.
""With both parties declaring an impasse in negotiations, with valuable cargo grounded and passengers stranded, the government made the right decision to refer the two sides to binding arbitration,"" Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy for the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement.
Air Canada indicated it would take four to five days to resume full operations, Hajdu said, assuming the board granted the government's request, which it usually does.
Wage dispute
The carrier had offered a 38% increase in total compensation for flight attendants over four years, with a 25% raise in the first year, which CUPE said was insufficient.
But the most contentious issue has been the union's demand for compensation for time spent on the ground between flights and when helping passengers board. Attendants are currently paid only when their plane is moving.
The union has said Air Canada offered to compensate flight attendants for some work that is now unpaid at 50% of their hourly rate.
A source close to the negotiations told Reuters the union was looking for parity on wages with Canadian leisure carrier Air Transat. Its flight attendants approved a contract last year that provided for total compounded increases of 30% over five years, making them the highest paid in the industry in Canada.
Air Canada did not confirm if such a proposal had been put forth by the union.
Wesley Lesosky, president of the Air Canada component of CUPE, said in a press conference in Toronto earlier on Saturday that there were no bargaining sessions scheduled between the two sides, which have held on-and-off negotiations for months.
Earlier in the day outside Toronto Pearson International Airport — the country's busiest — hundreds of cabin crew waved flags, banners and picket signs. Union officials called on members to assemble outside all of the country's major airports, including in Toronto, Montreal, Calgary and Vancouver.
Montreal-based Air Canada had said the suspended flights included those operated by its budget arm, Air Canada Rouge. The stoppage would affect about 130,000 customers a day, the carrier said in a statement. Flights by Air Canada's regional affiliates — Air Canada Jazz and PAL Airlines — were operating as usual.
Hajdu told reporters she had also asked the country's industrial relations board to extend the terms of the existing collective agreement until a new one is determined by the arbitrator.
The minister said the government preferred negotiated settlements to labor disputes, but the current impasse showed the two sides would not find a solution soon enough to spare the economy further damage.
She said Canada had already experienced ""unprecedented attacks on trade,"" referring to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on U.S.-bound shipments.
The Canada Labour Code gives the government the right to ask the industrial relations board to impose binding arbitration in the interests of protecting the economy.
Under Justin Trudeau, Carney's predecessor, the government intervened quickly last year to head off rail and dock strikes that threatened to cripple the economy.",a2d707ec36927e63f411cd9ba3dfa3ed,trafilatura,4807,0

NY cocoa prices today stabilized and moved a bit higher after the sharp sell-off from Monday's 2-month high. Cocoa prices rallied to that high due to recent dry weather in West Africa, but forecasts have since emerged for some rain in some cocoa-growing areas of West Africa.
Cocoa prices saw strength through Monday from concern about dry weather in West Africa that threatened the region's cocoa crops. There has been little to no precipitation over the past few weeks in the cocoa-growing areas of the Ivory Coast and Ghana, which could negatively impact the development of cocoa plants. According to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, rainfall in the Ivory Coast and Ghana this season remains below the 30-year average, and combined with high temperatures, risks hurting cocoa pod development for the main crop harvest that starts in October.
Cocoa prices have support from tighter inventories. ICE-monitored cocoa inventories held in US ports fell to a 2-month low of 2,234,877 bags on Thursday.
Cocoa has support from the slowdown in the pace of cocoa exports from the Ivory Coast. Monday's government data showed that Ivory Coast farmers shipped 1.78 MMT of cocoa to ports this marketing year from October 1 to August 10, up +6.6% from last year but down from the much larger +35% increase seen in December.
Quality concerns regarding the Ivory Coast's mid-crop cocoa, which is currently being harvested through September, are supportive of prices. Cocoa processors are complaining about the quality of the crop and have rejected truckloads of Ivory Coast cocoa beans. Processors reported that about 5% to 6% of the mid-crop cocoa in each truckload is of poor quality, compared with 1% during the main crop. According to Rabobank, the poor quality of the Ivory Coast's mid-crop is partly attributed to late-arriving rain in the region, which limited crop growth. The mid-crop is the smaller of the two annual cocoa harvests, which typically starts in April. The average estimate for this year's Ivory Coast mid-crop is 400,000 MT, down -9% from last year's 440,000 MT.
Another supportive factor for cocoa is smaller cocoa production in Nigeria, the world's fifth-largest cocoa producer. Nigeria's Cocoa Association projects Nigeria's 2025/25 cocoa production will fall -11% y/y to 305,000 MT from a projected 344,000 MT for the 2024/25 crop year. In related news, Nigeria's Jun cocoa exports rose +0.9% y/y to 14,597 MT.
Weakness in chocolate demand is a negative factor for cocoa prices. Chocolate maker Lindt & Spruengli AG in July lowered its margin guidance for the year due to a larger-than-expected decline in first-half chocolate sales. Also, chocolate maker Barry Callebaut AG in July reduced its sales volume guidance for a second time in three months, citing persistently high cocoa prices. The company projects a decline in full-year sales volume and reported a -9.5% drop in its sales volume for the March-May period, the largest quarterly decline in a decade.
Weakness in global cocoa demand has been a bearish factor for cocoa prices. The European Cocoa Association reported on July 17 that Q2 European cocoa grindings fell by -7.2% y/y to 331,762 MT, a bigger decline than expectations of -5% y/y. Also, the Cocoa Association of Asia reported that Q2 Asian cocoa grindings fell -16.3% y/y to 176,644 MT, the smallest amount for a Q2 in 8 years. North American Q2 cocoa grindings fell -2.8% y/y to 101,865 MT, which was a smaller decline than the declines seen in Asia and Europe.
Higher cocoa production by Ghana is bearish for cocoa prices. On July 1, the Ghana Cocoa Board projected the 2025/26 Ghana cocoa crop would increase by +8.3% y/y to 650,000 from 600,000 MT in 2024/25. Ghana is the world's second-largest cocoa producer.
On May 30, the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) revised its 2023/24 global cocoa deficit to -494,000 MT from a February estimate of -441,000 MT, the largest deficit in over 60 years. ICCO said 2023/24 cocoa production fell by 13.1% y/y to 4.380 MMT. ICCO stated that the 2023/24 global cocoa stocks-to-grindings ratio declined to a 46-year low of 27.0%. Looking ahead to 2024/25, ICCO on February 28 forecasted a global cocoa surplus of 142,000 MT for 2024/25, the first surplus in four years. ICCO also projected that 2024/25 global cocoa production will rise +7.8% y/y to 4.84 MMT.

We can't offer personal investing advice. We will only consider more general questions about the investment process or stocks in the portfolio or related industries. This week's question: I would like to start a position in Meta and Microsoft, but am unsure how, when the stocks are up this high. Is it too late? If I have to wait for a pullback, how much of a pullback should I wait for? – Ann S. It's not too late to start positions in Meta Platforms and Microsoft because, from a fundamental perspective, we think both stocks are solid long-term investments. Nonetheless, as indicated by our 2 ratings on both names, we do think waiting for a slight pullback before buying would be prudent. Looking at their charts below for buy levels from a technical standpoint, we tend to start our analysis by looking at the 50-day and 200-day moving average – represented by the maroon and green lines, respectively. From there, we look for long-term support and resistance levels – represented by the horizontal black lines. But, more than the exact prices, we want to show investors how to spot the moving averages and long-term trends. At the Club, we are first and foremost fundamental investors, but we do look to technical analysis as another tool to help out. Meta buy levels: $738, $722, $638 Starting with Meta Platforms, the first level of interest would be around $738 per share, a level that proved to be resistance twice over the past year before the stock broke above it on the back of a strong earnings report. A move to $738 would represent a pullback of roughly 6% from current levels around $788 and put shares at just under a price-to-earnings valuation of 25 times 2026 earnings estimates. The next level down would be the 50-day moving day at around $722. Given that we are above that average, we would look to it for support per the polarity principle – past resistance, once broken, typically becomes support. A move to $722 would be a pullback of just under 8%. The 200-day moving average at $638 is well below the 50-day, typical of a stock that has been on a run like Meta. That would be a pretty significant decline of about 19% and put shares at just over 21 times 2026 estimates. The $638 level would only come into play if the 50-day were breached. Microsoft buy levels: $502, $455, $438 Jumping to Microsoft, the 50-day is currently at around $502, about 4% below current levels around $524 and just over 6% off the stock's all-time closing high. That's a decent-sized pullback to start a position. From there, however, we don't see much in terms of support until we get to around $455, a level that previously served as resistance earlier this year before it was breached in late May. A move to this level would put shares at under 30 times fiscal year 2026 earnings estimates, about the midpoint of the P/E range seen over the past five years. From there, the 200-day moving average is around $438, a roughly 16% decline from current levels. Bottom line While the 200-day moving averages are pretty far down for both Microsoft and Meta, those levels are not out of the question if there were a broad-based market pullback. The 200-day moving average is usually a solid level to hold your nose and do some buying, assuming that there's no change to your longer-term investment thesis. That said, we don't foresee a major correction as the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates next month and possibly two more times before year-end. The Fed cut rates three times at the end of 2024 but has kept them steady ever since. We also don't think that trying to play a correction is in the best interest of those looking to make money. In the words of famed investor Peter Lynch, ""Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in the corrections themselves.""

Covrig Analytics said last Friday that reports of smaller cane yields from Brazil's sugar farmers may knock Brazil's 2025/26 sugarcane production below 600 MMT, much lower than Brazilian government crop forecasting agency Conab's forecast of 663.4 MMT.
An excessive short position by funds could exacerbate any short-covering rally in sugar futures. Last Friday's weekly Commitment of Traders (COT) report showed funds increased their net-short positions in NY sugar futures by +25,923 positions to 151,004 short positions in the week ending August 5, the most in almost 6 years.
Last Tuesday, sugar prices fell to 5-week lows on signs of stronger sugar production in Brazil. On July 31, Unica reported Brazil's Center-South sugar output in the first half of July rose +15% y/y to 3.4 MMT. Also, the amount of sugarcane being crushed for sugar by Brazil's sugar mills has increased to 54% from 50% the same time last year.
The outlook for higher sugar exports from India is negative for sugar prices after Bloomberg reported that India may permit local sugar mills to export sugar in the next season, which starts in October, as abundant monsoon rains may produce a bumper sugar crop. India's Meteorological Department reported Tuesday that cumulative monsoon rain in India was 500.8 mm as of August 4, or 4% above normal. Also, the Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association said last Thursday that it will seek permission to export 2 MMT of sugar in 2025/26.
The outlook for higher sugar production in India, the world's second-largest producer, is bearish for prices. On June 2, India's National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories projected that India's 2025/26 sugar production would climb +19% y/y to 35 MMT, citing larger planted cane acreage. That would follow a -17.5% y/y decline in India's sugar production in 2024/25 to a 5-year low of 26.2 MMT, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).
Sugar prices retreated through early July, with NY sugar falling to a 4.25-year low and London sugar sliding to a 4-year low, driven by expectations of a sugar surplus in the 2025/26 season. On June 30, commodities trader Czarnikow projected a 7.5 MMT global sugar surplus for the 2025/26 season, the largest surplus in 8 years. On May 22, the USDA, in its biannual report, projected that global 2025/26 sugar production would increase by +4.7% y/y to a record 189.318 MMT, with global sugar ending stocks at 41.188 MMT, up 7.5% y/y.
Sugar prices also have support from reduced sugar production in Brazil. Unica reported last Thursday that the cumulative 2025/26 Brazil Center-South sugar output through mid-July fell by -9.2% y/y to 15.655 MMT. Last month, Conab, Brazil's government crop forecasting agency, said 2024/25 Brazil sugar production fell by -3.4% y/y to 44.118 MMT, citing lower sugarcane yields due to drought and excessive heat.
The outlook for higher sugar production in Thailand is bearish for sugar prices. On May 2, Thailand's Office of the Cane and Sugar Board reported that Thailand's 2024/25 sugar production rose +14% y/y to 10.00 MMT. Thailand is the world's third-largest sugar producer and the second-largest exporter of sugar.
The International Sugar Organization (ISO) raised its 2024/25 global sugar deficit forecast to a 9-year high of -5.47 MMT on May 15, up from a February forecast of -4.88 MMT.

ISO also cut its 2024/25 global sugar production forecast to 174.8 MMT from a February forecast of 175.5 MMT.
The USDA, in its bi-annual report released May 22, projected that global 2025/26 sugar production would climb +4.7% y/y to a record 189.318 MMT and that global 2025/26 human sugar consumption would increase +1.4% y/y to a record 177.921 MMT.

President Trump Is About to Make It a Possibility . ,Should Bitcoin Be in Your 401 ( k )? President Trump Is About to Make It a Possibility . ,2025-08-15 19:45:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"As if President Donald Trump's administration hasn't been supportive enough of the crypto sector, Trump recently signed an executive order that would let 401(k) accounts invest in alternative investments including real estate, cryptocurrencies, and private equity. This could prove to be a significant tailwind for crypto, particularly Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC), the world's largest cryptocurrency. Should Bitcoin be in your 401(k)? Let's take a look.
Widening the pool of investors
Despite Bitcoin's meteoric rise during the past decade, the digital asset has not been as accessible as, say, a highly liquid blue-chip stock. That's due to a number of reasons ranging from skepticism about cryptocurrencies to regulations that made it difficult for mainstream financial institutions and investors to hold crypto.
Obviously, a lot of that has changed in recent years, and even more so since Trump took office. Trump's administration has removed many of the regulatory barriers standing between the financial industry and crypto, and this latest executive order could release a flurry of new buyers for Bitcoin and other digital assets.
""That's a monster pool of capital. What we're seeing ... [is] the aperture of being able to buy crypto being widened and widened, [and] more avenues bringing people into the tent,"" Galaxy Chief Executive Officer Michael Novogratz said during an interview on CNBC. ""When it becomes commonplace -- when you can do it at the place you've already been doing business with, if its Fidelity or T. Rowe Price or whoever it is -- you just pull more people into this ecosystem.""
More than 71 million Americans had access to a 401(k) account at the end of 2023, according to an analysis by Capitalize, a provider of digital rollover solutions for retirement accounts. According to the Investment Company Institute, 401(k) plans held $8.7 trillion of assets at the end of the first quarter of 2025.
While some 401(k) plans can already invest in cryptocurrencies, adoption has been low. The Government Accountability Office in a report at the end of last year said that based on survey data, investments in crypto are ""less than 1 percent of the 401(k) market, whether measured by plans, participants, or assets.""
Should Bitcoin be in your 401(k)?
I certainly think there is a case to be made for owning some Bitcoin in your retirement portfolio. Many investors now view Bitcoin and its finite amount of 21 million coins as a form of digital gold, and therefore a way to hedge inflation and other types of volatility. Whether it's true remains to be seen, but gaining as much widespread acceptance as it has is an accomplishment in its own right. Additionally, Bitcoin stands to benefit as a wider pool of buyers, both institutional and perhaps from 401(k) account holders, is introduced to the coin.
That said, I would caution investors from investing too much of their account in Bitcoin or any crypto asset. The sector is still only about 15 years old and there is still a lot we need to learn about digital assets. They are still extremely difficult to value, given that they don't produce cash flow or earnings, meaning they still could continue to be volatile.
Last year, BlackRock issued a report suggesting that investors could allocate as much as 2% of their capital in a multi-asset portfolio to Bitcoin, which feels about right. The main benefit of owning Bitcoin is that it could potentially offer a unique form of diversification. However, 401(k) investors don't need to be taking on excessive risk, as the power of compounding through long-term investing provides a safe, proven method for accumulating wealth.
Should you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?
Before you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:
The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.

The cryptocurrency market is still enjoying a rally on the back of Tuesday's higher-than-expected core inflation reading that boosted chances of a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut next month. Some traders are even calling for a 50 bps cut.
The euphoria has lifted the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index of largest cryptocurrencies more than 1% in the last 24 hours, and sent bitcoin (BTC) to a record high over $124,000 and ether (ETH) 2.2% higher to $4,750, just below its record.
Headline inflation data for July came in cooler than expected, but rising core inflation fed into rate-cut expectations. On Polymarket, traders now weigh an 80% chance of a 25 basis-point cut in September, while chances of a 50 bps cut rose to 8.3%. The CME FedWatch tool shows a 97.8% chance of a 25 bps cut, and a 2.2% chance of a 50 bps cut.
In the geopolitical front, President Donald Trump is expected to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin this Friday in Alaska. The meeting comes as the U.S. president ramps up pressure for a ceasefire in Ukraine. A follow-up meeting with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy may also be on the cards. Deescalation measures, including a potential air truce, are currently on the table.
Institutional demand has made this the best week for spot ether ETFs net inflows, with $2.27 billion coming in according to SoSoValue data. Meanwhile, corporate accumulation led by BitMine has seen ETH treasures accumulate over 3.5 million ETH.
“Bitmine’s capital raise to build its ETH treasury has drawn attention, with the market noting that any allocation to ETH has an outsized impact compared with BTC, given ETH’s smaller market cap and marginally thinner liquidity,” analysts at QCP Capital wrote. ”We expect the current momentum in ETH to persist as long as fresh flows continue into ETH DATs.”
Bitcoin treasuries, including ETFs, have grown their holdings by around 3.36% in the past 30 days to 3.64 million BTC. That’s more than 17% of the cryptocurrency’s total supply.
Put together, the cryptocurrency market is benefiting from four key tailwinds. These are the anticipated rate cuts, a friendlier regulatory climate, easing geopolitical tensions and rising institutional and corporate interest.
Looking ahead, investors will be closely monitoring today’s Producer Price Index (PPI) data for further clues on what the Fed might do in September. Stay alert!

Sources of passive income include interest paid on savings accounts, rent checks for properties you own and lease out, or from an annuity you purchased that sends you a check every month.
A particularly great way to get passive income is from dividends, and one of the easiest and most effective ways to invest in dividend-paying stocks is via dividend-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) such as the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT: SPYD).
Don't underestimate the power of dividends
Many people assume dividend stocks are mainly for their grandparents. That's not true, though, as plenty of dividend payers have outperformed growth stocks. Check out the table below and prepare to be surprised:
Data source: Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds.
Meet the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF
The SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF tracks the S&P 500 High Dividend index, which aims to deliver meaningful income and the chance of stock price appreciation, too. It encompasses the 80 top-yielding stocks in the S&P 500. Here's how the ETF has performed in recent years:
Source: Morningstar.com, as of August 7, 2025.
The past few years have not been amazing, but the past five years showed solid performance. Remember that this is a dividend-focused ETF, too, with a recent dividend yield of 4.5%. That's quite generous, considering that the S&P 500's overall dividend yield is only around 1.2%.
A yield like that means that even during market downturns or stagnant periods, you'll be collecting meaningful income from the ETF. Invest $10,000, for example, and you're looking at $450 in annual income. Better still, healthy and growing dividend payers tend to increase their payouts over time. So in the future, you might be collecting $600 or $800 or $1,500 per year.
There are fees, too, but low ones. The fund's expense ratio is just 0.07% annually, which means you'll have to cough up $7 for each $10,000 you have invested in the fund.
What's in the SPDR High Dividend ETF?
The SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF recently had the following top 10 holdings, which together made up a little over 13% of its total value:
Source: SSGA.com, as of Aug. 7, 2025.
The ETF was recently skewed toward midsized companies (with a median market cap of $23.5 billion), and ones that are considered more value stocks than growth stocks. Some 22% of the fund's assets were in real estate companies and 18% in consumer staples companies. Financials (15%) and utilities (13%) were the next biggest sectors.
As part of your overall retirement plan, it can be smart to set up some passive income and, ideally, multiple income streams, so that if one runs into trouble (as perhaps Social Security might), you'll have others to rely on.

Years later, workers are still seeking alternatives to being glued to a desk in the company office, says Dr. Laura Madrid Sartoretto, research lead at the Global Citizen Solutions Global Intelligence Unit.
Growth rates have slowed down compared to the pandemic peak, but the total number of digital nomads is still 150% higher than in 2019, according to Global Citizen Solutions.
""Remote work is steadily growing, so we think digital nomadism is something that is here to stay. It's not going to grow as it grew during the pandemic, but we see that people like millennials and Gen Zers are more likely to travel and keep traveling and with their families now too,"" Madrid Sartoretto tells CNBC Make It.
""People are thinking about education for their kids when they are in this digital nomad life.""
A digital nomad visa is a short-term permit that allows individuals to stay in a country for an extended period and work remotely. The length of time a nomad can stay varies from place to place but most countries allow for six months to a year—unless you have your eye on Croatia.
Recently, the Balkan country announced it an update its digital nomad visa, which will allow non-EU residents to stay for up to three years. The visa also permits close family members of a digital nomad to join them.
Croatia's digital nomad visa website states that close family members also include partners or non-married couples who have been together for longer than three years without children, or for less time if they do have children together.
Madrid Sartoretto believes that Croatia's expansion of its digital nomad program is a sign that the country is trying to attract more talent and compete with neighboring countries and their offerings.
""I think they are competing with other countries that are in the same region, like Estonia and Romania, that also attract a lot of digital nomads. If you give more benefits to people to come to your country, then you attract more talent. It's all about competition now,"" she adds.
For those looking to apply for Croatia's digital nomad visa, Dr. Madrid Sartoretto says the country offers a low cost of living but still needs to improve its infrastructure, like more reliable internet speeds.
""If you compare internet speed and reliability to countries like Romania, which has one of the fastest speeds in the world, Croatia needs to improve its infrastructure,"" she adds.
To apply for Croatia's digital nomad visa online, applicants must provide proof that they work outside of Croatia. Additionally, they must provide a copy of a valid travel document, proof of health insurance, proof of address in Croatia, and a minimum monthly income of 3,295 euros or $3,855 USD.
For proof of income, applicants can submit a bank statement showing the total amount required, a bank statement demonstrating regular income, or pay slips for at least six months. Applicants must also send evidence that they have not been convicted of criminal offences in their home country or the country in which they have resided for more than a year immediately before arriving in Croatia.

Last year, the insurance giant expanded its internship program to offer positions to pro athletes, giving them a pathway to prepare for life after sports. In return, Gallagher discovered the stars also tend to shine off the field.
""They know what it's like to work hard and how long that path is to get to success,"" said Chris Mead, Gallagher's chief marketing officer. ""They know what it's like to be part of a team and how to lead one.""
This year Gallagher opened the program to eight members of the National Women's Soccer League's Chicago Stars. Leilanni Nesbeth and Chardonnay Curran, a current and former midfielder with the team, respectively, jumped at the opportunity for a paid internship.
""It means a lot for us to be able to get our foot in the door,"" Nesbeth said in an interview with CNBC.
""I've never had a job outside of soccer,"" said Curran. ""Being a pro soccer player was my first career, and I've never been in a corporate setting.""
Gallagher started its Partnership Intern Program for athletes in 2024, piloted with four players from the NFL's Atlanta Falcons.
Over six weeks, participants gain business experience, professional skill development and career mentorship, while also learning the ins and outs of insurance brokerage, sales and corporate culture.
Gallagher, a sponsor of the Chicago NWSL team, tailors its internship program for the athlete participants to accommodate their demanding schedules.
For many, that support is crucial. Pro sports careers can be short and unpredictable, and earnings can vary widely. The average NWSL salary is about $125,000 per season, according to the league.
Gallagher's goal is to prepare athletes for what comes next.
""We went in there knowing nothing about insurance, and now I could probably bore your head off about RPS,"" Nesbeth joked, referencing an industry term meaning ""risk placement services.""
For Curran, it was about changing preconceived notions about the insurance industry.
""After doing the internship, everything I thought about insurance was the exact opposite,"" she said.
Curran and the Chicago Stars mutually agreed to part ways days after she spoke with CNBC.
Mead said Gallagher has gone on to hire some of the athlete interns as employees when their playing careers are over.
He said in Europe, the company employs a professional rugby player who is one of its star salesmen.
""There's a time when the light bulb goes off and they see how celebrating a win on the pitch is no different than celebrating a win after a sale or doing something wonderful for a customer,"" Mead told CNBC.
Coverage off the field
Ties between insurance and professional sports are not new.
For years, State Farm has run catchy commercials featuring former New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning, former Indiana Pacers shooting guard Reggie Miller, Kansas City Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes, Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark of the WNBA and a host of others.
On Monday, AIG announced it was becoming the first Fortune 500 company to take a stake in an EFL League Two club, with an investment in Salford City Football Club in the U.K.
Nationwide, an NWSL partner, also runs a similar internship program with league players, offering them a professional development program at the insurance company's headquarters in Columbus, Ohio.
""Our hope is that the players walk away with new skills and experiences that may serve them now and in their post-playing careers, perhaps back at Nationwide,"" said Jim McCoy, vice president of sports marketing for Nationwide.",0dec84c548e4c3a334dc8619b2cf1e89,trafilatura,3612,0

Retail sales last month rose 3.7% from a year earlier, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Friday, sharply missing analysts' estimates for a 4.6% growth in a Reuters poll and slowing from June's 4.8% growth.
Industrial output rose 5.7% from a year ago in July, its weakest level since November last year, according to LSEG data, and weaker than analysts' expectations for a 5.9% rise.
Fixed-asset investment expanded 1.6% in the January to July period, undershooting economists' forecasts for a 2.7% growth and slowing from 2.8% in the first six months. Within that segment, the contraction in property investment worsened, slumping 12% in the first seven months, government data showed.
The statistics bureau attributed the disappointing economic performance to the ""ongoing challenges from the complex and unpredictable external environment"" and extreme weather. High temperatures, heavy rains and flooding hit several regions across the country last month, forcing factories and construction sites to suspend operations.
According to Goldman Sachs' estimates, in July alone, investments in fixed assets dropped 5.2% year-over-year, the sharpest decline since March 2020 when the country grappled with the pandemic outbreak.
The government appears ""less pressured to step up spending"" given the solid growth in the first half-year, said Lisheng Wang, China economist at Goldman. The ""contractionary effect"" of the ongoing 'anti-involution' policies may have gradually kicked in,"" Wang added, referring to Beijing's recent push to rein in the excessive and unsustainable price wars among businesses.
This year, Chinese authorities intensified scrutiny over excessive production in sectors like steel and coal in a bid to curb cutthroat competition that has weighed on businesses' profitability and worsened deflation.
Separately, China's survey-based urban unemployment rate in July came in at 5.2%, edging higher after remaining at 5% in May and June. Unemployment rate for those aged between 16 and 24, excluding college students, however, has remained above 14% for a year.
The latest slowdown was expected, as major contributors to the outperformance in the first half of the year, such as government stimulus and pre-emptive trade, are fading out, said Tianchen Xu, senior economist at Economist Intelligence Unit.
China's economy expanded 5.3% in the first half of the year, on track to meet Beijing's growth target of 5%. However, economists warned that risks of full-year growth undershooting its target remain, calling for fresh policy support in the second half of the year.
Beijing and Washington on Monday announced that they would extend the tariff pause for another 90 days until mid-November, averting the steep tariffs and allowing more time for both sides to negotiate a durable deal.
Despite the temporary truce, ""core disputes — from tech access and critical minerals to industrial policy and geopolitical alignments — remain unresolved,"" said Jing Qian, co-founder and managing director of the Center for China Analysis at the Asia Society Policy Institute.
Qian, who advised both governments during the ongoing negotiations, said the ""big political trade-offs"" are being reserved for a potential summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in the coming months.",821b372965f17f12b1b45c7351066a04,trafilatura,3506,0

Don't mix business with pleasure — or the music of the spheres might eject you from the skies even if you are an astronomer — but it seems, in the current milieu, there are no such restrictions between business and politics.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is eyeing a stake in struggling chipmaker Intel, according to a Bloomberg report on Thursday. That consideration is primarily attributable to Intel's status as the only born-and-bred American company that can manufacture the fastest chips on U.S. soil.
While some firms such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung, both of which can produce 3-nanometer chips — the most advanced semiconductors so far — have factories in the U.S., they are Taiwanese and South Korean companies, respectively, and probably do not enjoy apple pies on the Fourth of July.
In combination with the news that Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government a 15% share of their revenue from chip sales in China, as well as Apple committing to make more chips in America, the Trump administration seems to be consolidating a chip empire with the White House as its capital.

The Trump administration is reportedly considering a stake in Intel. The chipmaker is the only U.S. company that can manufacture the most advanced semiconductors in America. Intel's shares soared 7.4% after Bloomberg reported the news.
Wholesale prices in the U.S. heat up. The producer price index for July shot up 0.9% on the month, higher than the Dow Jones estimate of a 0.2% gain. It was the biggest monthly rise since 2022. The annual figure came in at 3.3%, the highest since February.
Potential Fed chair David Zervos backs an aggressive rate cut. The Jefferies chief market strategist told CNBC that reaccelerating wholesale prices in July should not deter the central bank from cutting its ""restrictive"" monetary policy by 50 basis points.
U.S. stocks flirt with the flatline. The S&P 500's barest 0.03% gain, however, means it closed at another high on Thursday. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index added 0.55%. Meanwhile, the U.K. economy expanded by a better-than-expected 0.3% in the second quarter.

Drinkers are increasingly bypassing once-loved core beer brands and instead opting for premium or economy alternatives, Danish brewer Carlsberg said Thursday, as beermakers confront wider pressures on the drinks sector.
""We do see a continued bifurcation in terms of preferences,"" CEO Aarup-Andersen told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday.
""People look either for the premium brand or the economy brand. So what will get squeezed a little bit in an environment like this is actually the core brands in the middle,"" he added.
Beermakers have been battling several consecutive quarters of declining volume growth, as consumers have pushed back against higher prices and veered toward alternatives.
Carlsberg, the world's third-largest brewer, on Thursday became the latest to report lower second-quarter volume growth. Organic volumes dipped 1.7% over the three-month period, including the recent loss of its San Miguel brand, even as demand for its premium and alcohol-free products grew.
That comes after Budweiser-maker AB InBev, the world's largest brewer, last month posted a worse-than-feared 1.9% year-on-year decline in second-quarter volumes and Heineken's volumes dipped 0.4% over the period.
""The global consumer is having a bit of a spending pause … so the volumes do not flow in the way they did a couple of years ago,"" Aarup-Andersen noted.
AB InBev's CEO Michel Doukeris nevertheless said last month that the company's continued revenue and operating profit growth pointed to the ""resilience of the beer category,"" and Heineken's CEO Dolf van den Brink cited resilience in its geographical footprint.
Drinking habits splinter
Beermakers have been somewhat sheltered from recent pressures on the drinks industry, particularly a downturn in spirits consumption and ongoing U.S. tariff headwinds.
Brewers, which typically rely on local production, are under less pressure to relocate their manufacturing stateside — even as they face higher aluminum levies on beer cans.
Still, broader macroeconomic headwinds threaten to hurt drinking habits and wider consumer spending.
Carlsberg's CEO said Thursday that the group's core brands — which include its namesake Danish brew as well as Tuborg and Kronenbourg — are being most hit by ""a consumer that is holding back.""
He said he does not expect those economic headwinds to dissipate this year, but nevertheless noted a willingness among consumers to spend selectively on high-end treat products.
""It's core beer that's going backwards while our growth categories are actually showing growth,"" he said.
Meantime, the CEO added that at-home consumption is gaining more ground as ongoing hikes in the price of a pint are making boozing in bars and restaurants less palatable.
""What we have been seeing over a number of quarters is that the on-trade, so bars and restaurants, are suffering right now,"" he said.
""It's the off-trade — supermarkets and retail — that's winning at the expense of on-trade. It's not dramatic but it's been a sliding scale.""",525f970b883acb663890e18919afaf99,trafilatura,3146,0

-
AI is minting billion-dollar startups faster than the dot-com era, with 100 unicorns born in the last two years, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Scale AI. They join a total of nearly 500 AI companies with valuations of $1 billion or more, according to CB Insights. And the gold rush is far from over.
No longer do business leaders need to spend decades building the next big thing to join the ranks of Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos at the top of the billionaires club; they just need to build an AI company.
There are now some 498 AI unicorns, or private AI companies, valued at $1 billion or more, with a combined value of $2.7 trillion, according to CB Insights.
A complete 100 of them were founded since 2023. There are more than 1,300 AI startups with valuations of over $100 million.
Take Mira Murati, the former CTO of OpenAI, for example. Her startup, Thinking Machines Lab, has just closed a $2 billion seed round at a $12 billion valuation.
We’ve not seen a tech boom like this since the late 90s and early 2000s, which propelled many of the tech giants of today, from eBay to Google, into the mainstream. While the dot-com boom can’t be directly compared because the “unicorn” label didn’t exist then and billion-dollar private valuations weren’t tracked, AI is creating billionaires at a record pace—and could even ring in an era of trillionaires.
The AI billionaire boom
With a boom in company valuation also comes hefty paydays for its founders, investors, and C-suite.
In March, Bloomberg reported that four of the largest private AI companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Safe Superintelligence, and Anysphere, have created at least 15 billionaires with a combined net worth of $38 billion. More than a dozen unicorns have been crowned since then.
AI startups are receiving massive investments, resulting in high valuations and wealth for founders and early investors. According to data from Crunchbase, global venture funding in 2024 edged above 2023’s totals, with AI showing the biggest leap in amounts year-to-year.
For the founders of Anthropic, including CEO Dario Amodei, reports indicate the Claude chatbot maker is in talks to raise $5 billion at a valuation of $170 billion. Amodei’s net worth is now over the billion-dollar mark.
Also joining the billionaire club is Liang Wenfeng. The founder and CEO of Chinese AI company DeepSeek is likely worth over $1 billion based on the estimated value of the low-cost AI company.
And as investments into AI continue to boom, so do the net worths of billionaires working in them. Nvidia’s CFO Colette Kress and EVP Jay Puri have become billionaires, joining its CEO Jensen Huang after its market cap surpassed $4 trillion. Similarly, Palantir’s first billion-dollar quarter is dramatically increasing the wealth of the company’s cofounders and C-suite. Peter Thiel and Alex Karp have each seen their net worth jump by $17 billion collectively.

Juvencio Maeztu will become Ikea’s new CEO this November after climbing the company’s corporate ladder for 25 years. The current deputy chief and CFO started off as a store manager in Spain in 2001. While Gen Z hopes to make it to the top by job-hopping across companies, Maeztu has proved staying loyal pays off in the long-run. Outgoing Ikea boss Jesper Brodin and Walmart leader Doug McMillon also spent decades of their lives working their way up to the top spot.
Staying loyal to one company for decades feels like a career strategy of the past—but it’s paid off for Ikea’s incoming CEO Juvencio Maeztu, who stuck with the company for 25 years. He started off as a store manager in his early 30s—and has slowly worked his way up to the coveted throne of the global retail titan.
“I feel deeply grateful, humble and responsible for the trust and confidence placed in me. Working with [outgoing CEO] Jesper Brodin for the past seven years has been a true privilege,” Maeztu wrote in a recent LinkedIn post. “The future excites me. We have a strong foundation, a clear direction, and nearly 170,000 amazing colleagues around the world.”
This November Maeztu will ascend to Ikea’s helm, joining an exclusive cohort of leaders who stuck it out and scaled the ranks of their businesses to the CEO spot. And it includes the Ikea CEO he’s replacing, Brodin, who has served 30 years at the company and worked his way up from being his boss’ assistant. Walmart leader Doug McMillon similarly dedicated 30 years of his life rising from a warehouse worker to the most powerful job at the $765 billion business.
Just like Brodin and McMillon, Maeztu’s start at the furniture giant that reeled in $52.6 billion in total sales last year was far from glamorous. However, in those moments on the shop floor, he often got to rub shoulders with the late Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad.
“I have been dozens of times with Ingvar on the shop floor starting at five in the morning in the loading area and finishing at 10 in the evening with a hot dog,” Maeztu told the Financial Times. “The important thing is that we all carry Ingvar’s spirit, and this I feel very loyal to.”
After staying committed for a decade, he finally reached the C-suite in 2012—and in just a few short months, he will have summited the company’s corporate hierarchy.
Fortune reached out to Ikea for comment.
Maeztu’s career trajectory: climbing the ranks from store manager to CEO
From his 25 years of service at Ikea, Maeztu knows the ins-and-outs of the brand that will be essential in helping him lead the retail giant. The 57-year-old Ikea devotee is the first non-Swede to lead the European retail giant—a leadership leap that showcases that Maeztu is the right fit to helm the company. He earned the top spot due to his “purpose-driven, entrepreneurial leadership” and extensive store experience—garnered through decades of leading Ikea’s international locations, the business says.",3e5bb1d5bb29fdf75d76b1bc8b689680,trafilatura,3088,0

He added, ""There's a very good chance of a 50 basis point cut. We could go into a series of rate cuts here, starting with a 50 basis point rate cut in September."" The Fed is currently targeting the federal funds rate in the range of 4.25%-4.50% and the effective rate is currently at 4.33%.
More News from Barchart
The markets have started to think about the chances for a -50 basis point rate cut in September, based on Monday's largely benign CPI report and the fact that the US labor market is slowing, with average monthly payroll growth in May-July of only +35,000. On a year-on-year basis, Tuesday's July headline CPI of +2.7% y/y was slightly weaker than expected, but the core CPI of +3.1% y/y was slightly stronger than expected.
The federal funds futures market on Wednesday boosted the odds to 100% for a -25 bp rate cut in September and a slight 7% chance of a -50 bp rate cut. Those expectations were more dovish than the 96% chance for a -25 bp rate seen Tuesday and the 40% chance seen before the July payroll report was released on August 1. The federal funds futures market is currently discounting an overall -64 bp rate cut by the end of this year to 3.69%, and an overall -134 bp rate cut to 2.99% by the end of 2026.
The markets are awaiting this Friday's Trump-Putin summit in Alaska for any progress in ending the Russian-Ukrainian war. President Trump on Monday downplayed expectations of a breakthrough, saying the summit is a ""feel-out meeting"" to end the war in Ukraine. Also, recent comments from Ukrainian President Zelenskiy dampened hopes for a quick end to the war when he rejected any talk of Ukraine ceding territory to Russia.
In recent tariff news, President Trump early Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. Last Wednesday, Mr. Trump announced that he will impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. Still, companies would be eligible for exemptions if they demonstrate a commitment to building their products in the US. However, the US will levy a separate tax on imports of electronic products that employ semiconductors. Also, Mr. Trump announced last Wednesday that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil. Last Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced ""within the next week or so."" According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.",e8e8cb1245592f1d7fd0c62fa84e619c,trafilatura,3084,0

Derivatives Positioning
-
ADA and SOL have seen the largest increases in futures open interest among the top 10 tokens in the past 24 hours.
-
Even though BTC rose to record highs above $124K, positioning in futures remains relatively light. Open interest is currently at 687K BTC, well below the July peak of 742K BTC.
-
Meanwhile, on the CME, the three-month annualized premium in BTC futures remains below 10%.
-
The 24-hour open interest-adjusted cumulative volume delta for most tokens except TRX is negative, implying seller dominance. This raises a question over the sustainability of price gains.
-
The markets for FART and FLR appear overheated, with annualized perpetual funding rates exceeding 100%, a sign of overcrowding in bullish long bets. Such a scenario can lead to a long squeeze, resulting in a sharp price slide.
-
On Deribit, August and September expiry BTC options are exhibiting only a slight call bias. That's likely due to persistent OTM call selling by long-term holders and indicates that the rally has yet to trigger a speculative frenzy. Meanwhile, call bias is more pronounced in ether options across all time frames.
-
Flows over the OTC network Paradigm featured demand for BTC calls and short call spreads in ETH December expiry options.
Token Talk
-
SHIB’s burn rate exploded 48,244% in the past 24 hours, with nearly 88 million tokens permanently removed from supply.
-
“Burning” means sending coins to a wallet no one can access, taking them out of circulation forever.
-
The biggest single burn was 69,420 tokens in one hour, part of a series of transactions tracked by Shibburn, a community-run monitoring site.
-
Prices are holding firm above the $0.000010 support level, which traders see as a key floor for keeping bullish momentum intact.
-
If buying pressure continues, analysts say SHIB could attempt a move toward $0.000020, double the current price.
-
Activity on Shibarium, SHIB’s layer-2 blockchain, remains robust, clocking 1.51 billion total transactions and about 4.69 million daily.
-
Burn-driven supply cuts can, in theory, make each remaining token more valuable, but sustained price gains depend on demand matching or outpacing the shrinking supply",6e73db1ea72e54423cc1c8d65946cf10,trafilatura,3034,0

Gold boomed this year as a safe haven from a lackluster bond market and a stock market shaken by Liberation Day jitters. But quietly, silver was also gaining momentum, with prices now up roughly 30% this year versus gold’s 28% rise. Silver’s role as an inflation hedge and its industrial uses, combined with a supply deficit, have created strong tailwinds for the precious metal.
“Gold sometimes steals the spotlight as an inflation hedge, especially given the tariffs, but silver has been benefiting from that, too, as a store of value,” said Nate Miller, vice president of product development at Amplify.

I’ve Got One More Silver Dollar
Unlike gold, which is primarily an investment or jewelry component, silver has broad industrial applications driving demand. “Silver is second to oil when it comes to industrial application,” Miller told Advisor Upside. “Solar panels are the most common use, but it’s in smartphones, AI, semiconductors, data centers, so there’s a structural tailwind from all that.” Supply constraints are also in play. HSBC projects a deficit of 206 million ounces this year, up from 167 million in 2024.
That combination has powered strong returns from silver ETFs:
-
There are only five silver-focused ETFs trading in the US, and they have $21.5 billion in assets, with the iShares Silver Trust (SLV) accounting for 85% of the total, according to CFRA data.
-
The ProShares Ultra Silver (AGQ) is the best performing this year at 53%; the ProShares UltraShort Silver (ZSL), an inverse fund, is down almost as much at 45%. The rest — the Abrdn Physical Silver Shares ETF (SIVR), the Sprott Physical Silver Trust (PSLV) and SLV — are all up more than 30%.
-
Separately, funds that track silver mining companies are performing even better, with the Global X Silver Miners ETF (SIL), the Amplify Junior Silver Miners ETF (SILJ) and the iShares MSCI Global Silver Miners ETF (SLVP) all up roughly 70% or more this year.
Silver Lining. Still, silver funds haven’t seen the same investor inflows as gold or copper. Silver ETFs have attracted $1.15 billion in 2025 — about 6% of current assets — while gold ETFs and copper funds are up 12% and 17% in flows, respectively, according to CFRA data.
Silver’s lag may stem from macro and geopolitical factors, with central banks favoring gold to hedge against US Treasuries, said Aniket Ullal, head of ETF research and analytics at CFRA. “Flows tend to lag performance, so if silver returns continue to be strong in 2H 2025, ETF flows could pick up further,” he told Advisor Upside. “Price momentum will be sustained if there is demand from sectors like electronics and renewable energy.”

But while the rails are evolving, current models for tokenized equities remain fragmented, opaque and misaligned with the safeguards that define the traditional securities markets.
Today, two dominant approaches exist:
The wrapper model involves tokenized IOUs that provide synthetic exposure to existing equities rather than direct ownership. These tokens do not grant holders any governance rights or enforceable claims to the underlying shares. Transferability is typically restricted to closed ecosystems, liquidity is siloed across issuer-controlled platforms and regulation can be murky, with many products not available to U.S. persons.
The on-chain issuance model means creating a native digital share class issued via blockchain. While this approach aligns more closely with the legal definition of security, it introduces operational complexities and scalability challenges. Active issuer participation is mandatory, liquidity remains fragmented between the on-chain tokens and traditional securities and broker-dealer standards are inconsistent, complicating participation for regulated financial institutions and investors.
What’s missing is a tokenization model that combines the speed, accessibility and composability of tokenization with the structure, safeguards and clarity of traditional capital markets. Fortunately, that model already exists elsewhere: depository receipts (DRs).
In many ways, DRs were the original form of tokenization. For over a century, American depository receipts (ADRs) have enabled foreign equities to trade in the U.S. through a regulated, custody-backed structure. Today, this framework can also bridge traditional securities with tokenized infrastructure, offering a scalable and legally sound foundation for modern equities.
The case for tokenized DRs
By combining blockchain rails with the legal and operational framework of DRs, market participants can unlock broader participation and real-time asset servicing without compromising on investor protections or operational standards.
Other benefits include:
-
Preservation of shareholder rights
Unlike synthetic wrappers, the ADR structure perfects shareholder rights, enabling them to be passed along to token holders. This includes economic entities, such as dividends and other corporate actions, as well as governance rights such as voting.
-
Clear segregation of duties
A regulated custodian bank safekeeps the underlying shares in a segregated, bankruptcy-remote structure, held solely for the benefit of ADR holders. An independent, market-neutral depositary facilitates DR issuances and cancellations, maintains accurate records using an SEC-registered transfer agent and performs daily reconciliation with the underlying assets. The depositary has no ownership claim on the underlying shares themselves.",b0ecf332340bdbb5ed90594d5906aae6,trafilatura,2998,0

Bas Padberg, the managing director for Arla in the UK, had a warning - potential food shortages on shelf and higher prices - unless resolutions are taken.
“Farmers are responsible for feeding a nation with over 98% of people having milk in their fridge. What we’re seeing, is the real impact of these workforce shortages on our farming industry, whether that’s in higher costs or lower milk production,"" Padberg said today (13 August).
“The effect of this is ultimately going to be seen in the price and availability of products on the supermarket shelves, affecting the millions of people that rely on dairy as a source of nutrition in their diet.""
According to figures from the annual Arla on-farm workforce survey, which was conducted across the cooperative's 1,900 British farmers, one in six farmers trying to fill vacancies got few or no responses from qualified applicants.
As a result of the ongoing labour shortages, 13% of farmers said they will leave farming altogether in the next 12 months if the situation does not improve.
Furthermore, as the largest dairy company in the UK, Arla said “much more urgent action is needed to meet the scale of the challenge”.
Now in its fifth year, the Arla on-farm workforce survey also found that the challenge of recruiting and retaining skilled staff is “just as prevalent” now as it was five years ago.
More than 47% of farmers are aged 55 and over, and only 3% of farmers are first-generation, whilst more than 66% have passed their farms down over at least four generations.
Padberg added: ""We know the government has acknowledged the problem and welcome a focus on talent and development as part of the forthcoming food strategy.”
He stressed there is a need to “act quickly”, and to put in place “practical steps that the industry, the education sector and government can take together to support more opportunities for inclusion and growth”.
Padberg continued: “We really see a bright future for UK food manufacturing, and this is signalled in the £390m ($529.1m) investment we are making in our sites.
“But as with farming, we have to look at what is impacting our ability to recruit skilled workers and find ways of working together with the government to protect the security of our food.""

FedEx Corp. on Tuesday named Vishal Talwar, who until recently was chief growth officer of Accenture Technology, to be chief digital and information officer and president of FedEx Dataworks, effective Aug. 15. He will replace Sriram Krishnasamy, who stepped down in mid-July.
The hiring announcement came one day before FreightWaves published a commentary from parcel industry guru Satish Jindel, who argued Dataworks hasn’t made money because potential customers don’t view it as a neutral data analytics provider for optimizing e-commerce logistics. He recommended FedEx (NYSE: FDX) sell Dataworks to a fulfillment company, e-tailer or other party that can win the trust of interested users and fully harness its promise.
Talwar was at Accenture for nearly 11 years. Before that, he held executive and management positions at Wipro, Dell Services and IBM. For nearly two years, he has been heavily engaged with FedEx’s digital transformation efforts through his advisory work at Accenture.
FedEx said Talwar brings deep expertise in data science, digital infrastructure, and enterprise-scale transformation. In his roles, he helped businesses leverage technologies to increase business resiliency and accelerate digital adoption.
Talwar will be responsible for developing digital solutions powered by data and AI, advanced technology, robust enterprise architecture, and comprehensive cybersecurity measures.
“As a seasoned leader in the technology sector, Vishal has a proven track record in accelerating business growth through forward-thinking strategies and transformative digital solutions. His institutional knowledge and industry expertise will be instrumental as we continue to advance our long-term strategy and harness the full potential of FedEx intelligence to deliver even greater value to our customers and stockholders,” said CEO Raj Subramaniam.
Krishnasamy also held the title of chief transformation officer and played a key role in the Drive strategy that eliminated $4 billion in structural costs over two years. It’s unclear who has taken that responsibility.
Tech simplification
Management has said that a key part of its Network 2.0 strategy, which involves integrating its express and ground networks, is simplifying the technology applications.
“We’re moving everything to a data-first technology stack, but we are simplifying the entire operational IT infrastructure. That is a big part of what will be the next wave of Drive. There will be some cost savings there but more importantly, speed to market because previously, every time we built a product around the world or had a change, picture proof of delivery, we had to interface with regional and operating company systems. It was not as efficient as it could be,” Chief Commercial Officer Brie Carere said on an earnings call in June. “That’s a big part of what Sriram is working on,” as well as digital twins and other innovations.",a92ed52e5857b75d6d5ce1a4cf11ac85,trafilatura,2937,0

Ivy League schools are joining the institutional Bitcoin rush.
Harvard Management Company, which manages the university’s $53.2 billion endowment, has reported purchasing 1.9 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ:IBIT) in Q2. The shares were worth nearly $117 million as of June 30, Harvard Management's quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission said last week.
The purchase makes Harvard the 29th-largest IBIT holder, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas said last week on X.

According to the filing, IBIT is now Harvard’s fifth-largest public equity investment ahead of tech giants Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, GOOG)) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
But Harvard is not alone. Last week, Brown University reported that it held 212,500 IBIT shares worth over $13 million as of June 30 through its $7.2 billion endowment. The figure increased over 100% from Q1, when the university reported holding 105,000 IBIT shares worth $4.9 million.
Harvard Management Company Communications Director Patrick McKiernan told Benzinga that the firm did not comment on individual investments. Meanwhile, Brown does not publicly discuss its investments, according to Deputy Director for News and Editorial Development Amanda McGregor.

Balchunas said in a two–part X post that the allocations from the universities were remarkable because endowments rarely invest in ETFs.
""IMO Endowments are the hardest institution to hook, they rarely bite on ETFs,"" he said. ""To be sure, this is sizable from an ETF perspective but microscopic from Harvard’s perspective. and plus we don’t know if they [sic] doing some larger trade or arb with it, Still tho I’m telling you endowments are notably anti-ETF (too much The Yale Model wannabe-ism).""
On the other hand, Bitwise Senior Investment Strategist Juan Leon suggested that the allocations from the universities could lead to greater inflows in the future.
""The combined endowments of these two universities exceeds $60B, and could result in significant more inflows as they ramp up their crypto allocations,"" he said on X. ""Moreover, as leading institutions, their adoption of crypto provides strong signaling for other endowments to follow.""",1fa105524e07bcc8daa5e2076b1d849f,trafilatura,2879,0

(NYSE:OKLO) closed at $77.42 on Wednesday, down 1.34% — a brief stall in one of the clean-energy sector's most dramatic uptrends this year.
Yet, that’s a speed bump in an otherwise extraordinary rally. For ETF investors, the move may represent a cooling-off period rather than a reversal, especially given the company's regulatory momentum and role in addressing the growing intersection of clean energy and AI infrastructure.
Investors are tracking this stock as they could benefit from the company's long-term growth story.
Oklo has seen meteoric rise in the past year. Check its prices live here.
The nuclear power stock play spiked more than 900% in the last 12 months. Investors are optimistic about nuclear technology, AI-powered electricity demand, and the U.S. government’s backing of next-generation energy solutions.
Despite today’s fall, investors are optimistic. Wedbush recently raised its price target for Oklo to $80 from $75, putting it close to the high end of Wall Street’s range of $14 to $86, according to Investing.com. The company had an Outperform rating, which it maintained based on regulatory milestones, strategic alliances, and the firm’s ability to serve hyperscale data centers.

Why The Dip?
Today’s decline is likely motivated by profit-taking rather than any underlying setback. Still, it comes after Oklo’s second-quarter earnings miss. The Santa Clara, California-based company lost 18 cents per share (analysts expected it to lose 12 cents per share).
Despite the miss, Oklo finished Phase 1 of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission readiness assessment for its Aurora-INL combined license application, without significant findings, on schedule to apply early fourth quarter 2025.
ETF Implications
Oklo’s surge, and its mini dip, resonates outside the company itself. The stock’s advance has been followed intently by shareholders in nuclear, uranium, and clean-energy ETFs. Although most funds do not yet own Oklo outright due to its modest size and recent public listing, its strength (or weakness) tends to be tied to the sentiment for the group as a whole.
-
Nuclear Energy ETFs: Funds such as the VanEck Uranium+Nuclear Energy ETF (NYSE:NLR), Global X Uranium ETF (NYSE:URA), and Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (NYSE:URNM) are indirectly set to gain from Oklo’s advancement. Traction in next-generation nuclear tends to fuel demand in the overall space, particularly when associated with high-profile AI infrastructure initiatives.
-
Clean-Energy ETFs: The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (NASDAQ:ICLN), Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF (NYSE:PBW), and First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index Fund (NYSE:QCLN) can also experience increased investor attention if nuclear continues to gain popularity as a component of the green-energy landscape.",9b083dc2649b6a7058478176c2379dba,trafilatura,2875,0

-
XRP and Shiba Inu are two of the more popular cryptocurrencies to watch.
-
Many investors believe XRP has the potential to disrupt the international payments system.
-
Shiba Inu is a meme token but now has a Layer-2 blockchain solution.
All in all, the crypto market is having a good year. There have certainly been ups and downs, given some of the volatility, but if you look back to Donald Trump's presidential election victory last November, many of the big cryptocurrencies are up significantly since then, although not all.
Trump's new regulatory regime has ushered in a more welcoming environment for cryptocurrencies and businesses focused on the sector. This has made many investors more bullish on crypto's future than ever.
Two of the more popular cryptocurrencies, XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) and Shiba Inu (CRYPTO: SHIB), have been on different paths, with XRP soaring since Trump's election win and Shiba Inu struggling to gain traction. Which cryptocurrency is more likely to be a millionaire maker: XRP or Shiba Inu?
XRP: Can it take a share of international payments?
XRP has been one of the best-performing cryptos since Trump's win -- if not the best. The token has clearly benefited from a change in leadership at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which led the agency to drop an appeal in a long-standing lawsuit against Ripple, the company behind XRP. That had clearly been an overhang on the token. And the SEC is likely to eventually approve a spot-XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) this year.
Investors looking ahead to what's next for XRP should pay attention to its network and its ability to participate in international payment transactions. It can process up to 1,500 transactions per second at minimal cost.
It's also part of a broadening ecosystem that includes Ripple and its more traditional financial clients, Ripple's stablecoin RLUSD, and the company's recent acquisitions of the prime broker Hidden Road, and more recently the stablecoin platform Rail.
Ripple Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse is confident that XRP can attract traditional international payments from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), which lets financial institutions all over the world send payment instructions to one another. Garlinghouse has made comments on what he believes to be a high error rate at SWIFT, and he thinks there is a prime opportunity for XRP to gobble up 14% of its payment volume during the next five years.
Shiba Inu: Where is the token heading?
Shiba Inu has had an interesting run since its huge ascent that started in 2020. First launched as another meme token and basically a joke that's a play on Dogecoin, the token has begun to move in another direction. Sure, it's still a meme token with a powerful social following, but in 2023, the Shiba Inu team launched Shibarium.",48db61a86911723352d4bda9ef6e277c,trafilatura,2866,0

That report cut right to the chase, with no fluff. Just bullet points on bullish and bearish elements presently impacting the cocoa futures market. So here goes on my effort to replicate that report but focusing on gold (GCZ25) and silver (SIU25) markets. At the end I’ll give you my biases on price direction.
The Bull Case for Gold and Silver
-
Lower U.S. interest rates are likely coming, and lower rates are also likely to come in other major economies. That suggests better global economic growth and in turn, better consumer and commercial demand for raw commodities, including precious metals. Lower interest rates mean lower bond yields, which are also bullish for gold and silver.
-
Near-term technicals remain firmly overall bullish for both gold and silver markets. Price action recently has been sideways and choppy for both metals, but at still historically elevated levels. Longer-term charts show gold and silver still in solid price uptrends, dating back to 2016 for gold and back to 2022 for silver.
-
The U.S. dollar index ($DXY) has backed down from its August high and is starting to trend down on the daily bar chart. The weakening U.S. dollar index is friendly for the metals, as the USDX is an important outside-market element for gold and silver markets’ daily price direction.
-
A move by BRICS countries away from the U.S. dollar for their global financing. That’s bearish for the U.S. dollar, which is in turn friendly for the metals, as a weaker USDX is a friendly daily outside-market element for gold and silver. Also, some countries are replacing their U.S. dollar reserves in part with gold reserves.

Geopolitical tensions are never far away from the front burner of the marketplace, and any new development that creates uncertainty would prompt keener safe-haven buying of gold and silver.
The Bear Case for Gold and Silver
-
Both gold and silver are in mature, or perhaps very mature, bull market runs. The bulls may be running low on fuel to extend the price uptrends. History shows raw commodity markets are cyclical, meaning going through cycles of boom and bust. The metals are in a boom cycle now, but a bust cycle is coming. We just don’t know when.
-
Gold and silver markets have seen their near-term price uptrends stall out as prices grind sideways on the daily bar charts. There are stiff overhead technical resistance levels in gold and silver, at this year’s highs, which must be overcome for the bulls to gain fresh energy to extend the price uptrends.

It turned out to be the right call.
Since then, US stocks have virtually ignored the economic risks sowed by President Donald Trump’s trade war to march back to record highs, pushed up by bets on artificial intelligence advances and lower-than-feared tariff rates. The latest leg higher was driven by an inflation report that cemented bets the Federal Reserve will resume cutting interest rates next month.
That 30% jump in the S&P 500 Index from its April lows has now forced sell-side strategists who capitulated on their bullish views in April to U-turn once again by lifting their predictions to keep up with the furious momentum that few of them saw coming.
“It’s tempting to flinch when the news flow turns negative, but that’s often when discipline matters most,” said Dave Mazza, chief executive officer at Roundhill Investments. “A good strategist trusts their process, not the whims of the market. And right now, that discipline is looking very smart for those who didn’t flinch.”
Wilson stuck to his 12-month S&P 500 target of 6,500 — just above where the index is now — and advised clients to buy the dip. And Harvey retained his year-end forecast of 7,007, one of the highest among Wall Street prognosticators, in anticipation that rate-cut bets and deregulation would propel stocks.
“We had seen Trump 1.0. We know his style — it’s to go out to the nth degree and then to come back in,” Harvey said in an interview last month with , before he left Wells Fargo. “Furthermore, the underlying fundamentals were still fine,” he added, largely due to the outsized strength of the big technology companies.
Meanwhile, Wilson attributed his bullishness to a Morgan Stanley sentiment indicator that showed “clear capitulation” on April 7, as well as the sharp recovery in what’s known as earnings-per-share revisions breadth — a measure of the number of analysts increasing versus downgrading their EPS estimates.
“Combined, these two indicators suggested the rebound back would be sharp,” Wilson said in an email on Wednesday. “We also expected this selloff in our original forecast for 2025 — we thought the new administration would ‘kitchen sink’ the first half of the year. They did, it just happened even faster and more violently than we expected.”",737d8946c9e4061b3e493d6919c47804,trafilatura,2832,0

In the latest edition of its annual look at dollar-weighted and time-weighted returns of over 25,000 individual U.S. open-end funds and ETFs, Morningstar found that investors continue to miss out on around 15% of aggregate total returns due to the timing and magnitude of their purchases and sales over a 10-year period.
Overall, Morningstar found that over the decade ended Dec. 31, 2024, the average dollar invested in funds and ETFs earned around 7.0% per year vs. the overall performance of 8.2% for those funds—a gap of 1.2 percentage points, a figure roughly in line with previous editions of the report.
“One of the things we try to underscore as a potential lesson is that it’s a persistent cost. People should approach that in a way that’s not unlike how they approach fund expense ratios,” said Jeffrey Ptak, a managing director at Morningstar and the report’s lead author. “You should be deliberate about the necessity, timing and nature of transactions and put yourself in a position where you do as little trading as possible. If that’s the case, you’re in a better position to capture as much of a fund’s returns as possible.”
[[scm-embed type=""everviz"" src=""https://app.everviz.com/inject/geF9f5vn1/?v=5""]]
Relatedly, the analysis found that funds in which investors are committed to staying for the long-term—such as target-date funds and other vehicles held in retirement plans—the gap between investor and fund performance is smaller. For example, investors in allocation funds posted 6.3% per year dollar-weighted return compared with 6.5% for the funds’ aggregate annual total return, capturing nearly 97% of the funds’ performance.
At the other end of the spectrum, taxable-bond and municipal-bond fund investors captured 1.2% returns out of 2.2% total returns—just slightly more than half.
Morningstar also added new wrinkles to this year’s report by gauging investor and fund performance relative to tracking errors (i.e., how funds that performed relative to benchmarks) and cash flow. The analysis found that investors in funds with larger tracking errors tended to have wider gaps than those in funds that hewed more closely to benchmarks. It also found that investors in funds with more volatile cashflows had bigger gaps than those in ones with more consistent flows.
“It’s the nature of investing that when a fund diverges in a notable way from the rest of the pack, if it works in your favor, you stick with it. However, if it goes the other way and you feel like that difference is working to your detriment, you may be more likely to sell that fund,” Ptak said. “That may hurt you because that shortfall you are seeing could be fleeting, and if the performance perks up, you miss out.”",7eee12cbf3288beefc9163aa80b1fbd6,trafilatura,2827,0

The stock has crashed 47.6% year to date despite maintaining its position as America's largest health insurer.

Trading at just 11.5 times 2027 projected earnings, the stock’s current valuation implies permanent damage that seems overdone.

A 3.38% dividend yield pays investors to wait while medical costs normalize and margins recover.
The market has abandoned UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH), and that's exactly why I'm buying it. While investors flee the stock over rising medical costs and regulatory headlines, they're missing a crucial fact -- this is still the most dominant health insurer in America trading at recession-level valuations. At 11.5 times projected 2027 earnings, the pessimism looks overdone.
The collapse has been breathtaking. Down 47.6% year to date as of this writing (Aug. 13, 2025) in a market hitting record highs, UnitedHealth faces real challenges: medical costs rising faster than premiums, a potential $1.6 billion settlement over billing practices, and regulatory scrutiny of its Optum unit. These aren't minor headwinds.
But excessive pessimism creates opportunity, especially when it involves a company processing $1.7 trillion in medical payments annually with no real competitor matching its scale.
The math behind the contrarian play
Trading in the low $270s, UnitedHealth has fallen more than 57% from its 52-week high of $630.73. At about 11.5 times projected 2027 earnings, the stock is priced as if its profitability will remain permanently impaired. While some large-cap peers such as Elevance Health and Cigna currently trade at lower forward multiples, UnitedHealth's scale, vertical integration, and cash generation give it advantages those competitors cannot match.
Wall Street analysts still project earnings per share reaching $40 by the decade's end. That assumes high single-digit annual growth, hardly aggressive for a company that has compounded earnings at 13% annually over the past decade. Apply even a below-market multiple of 16 times to that $40 earnings figure, and you get a $640 stock price. That's roughly 135% upside from current levels.
Meanwhile, the healthcare giant pays an $8.84 annual dividend, yielding about 3.38%. UnitedHealth has raised its dividend for 15 consecutive years, including a 5.2% increase last quarter. You're collecting a sizable yield backed by roughly $30 billion in annual operating cash flow, giving you steady income while you wait for the recovery.
Why the tide will turn for this top healthcare insurer
The recent spike in medical costs is being driven by higher utilization, particularly in Medicare Advantage, and management expects the elevated trend to extend into 2026. While this creates short-term margin pressure, UnitedHealth has begun adjusting premiums for 2026 contracts to reflect the higher cost base.",8b4dd7077d489390abc8d5bbf4bfd37c,trafilatura,2827,0

But a market bubble can materialize even when most investors are worried about one. Like now. A recent Bank of America fund-manager survey found that a record 91% of survey participants believe the stock market is overvalued, and Google Trends shows a sizable increase in recent weeks in the number of finance-related searches focusing on bubbles, as you can see from the chart below.

When it comes to bubbles, contrarian analysis typically gets it wrong. An analysis of past bubbles suggests not only that widespread concern about bubbles is consistent with one forming — such worry actually plays a central role in a bubble’s latter stages. Consider the definition of bubbles from Robert Shiller, the Yale University finance professor who won a Nobel prize in large part because of his research into stock-market bubbles.
Irrational exuberance
In his 2000 book “Irrational Exuberance,” Shiller wrote that a bubble is self-perpetuating: “News of price increases spurs investor enthusiasm, which spreads by psychological contagion from person to person, in the process amplifying stories that might justify the price increases and bringing in a larger and larger class of investors.”
Shiller added that these newcomers, “despite doubts about the real value of an investment, are drawn to it partly through envy of others’ successes and partly through a gambler’s excitement.”
Notice from Shiller’s description that bubbles involve a high degree of cognitive dissonance: Despite concern about stocks’ overvaluation, investors bet heavily on equities. This dissonance is readily apparent in the Bank of America survey, for example: Even though 91% of survey respondents say that stocks are overvalued, they on balance are more bullish than they’ve been in months.
Investors resolve the dissonance by telling themselves they will know when the bubble is about to burst and get out in time. But the history of bubbles teaches us that this belief represents a triumph of hope over experience. It’s simply the greater-fool theory in disguise.
C3.ai AI illustrates how quickly a bubble can burst. Earlier this week the company reported preliminary results for its July quarter that fell far short of analyst expectations, and its stock plunged almost 26% in a single session.",717320d8b6aba3d649dcb8178727d5aa,trafilatura,2822,0

Shares of the stock look cheap if you believe in a margin expansion story.
Shares of project management software company Monday.com (NASDAQ: MNDY) fell close to 30% this week, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. It reported earnings for the second quarter, posting strong revenue growth but still disappointing investors.
As of 12:23 p.m. ET on Friday, Aug. 15, Monday.com stock is down 28.8%. It is currently off 60% from all-time highs set in 2021.
Strong growth, high expectations
On Aug. 11, Monday.com reported its quarterly results for the three months ending in June. Revenue grew 27% year over year to $299 million, as more and more customers adopt its project management software. However, this is a slowdown from previous quarters, where Monday.com was growing sales at north of 30% a year.
Getting more granular, Monday.com reports some figures that are important for an enterprise software provider. Customers with more than $100,000 in annual spending with Monday.com hit 1,472 in Q2, up 46% year over year. This is an important figure because of how durable and reliable software revenue can be from large businesses. If they choose Monday.com for workflow management, it is likely that they will stick with the company for a long time.
So why did Monday.com stock fall? Likely due to continued slowing revenue growth and negative operating earnings. Investors have high expectations for this company, given its valuation, and would like to see it generate a profit. The company had a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) operating loss of $11.6 million in the period due to high levels of stock-based compensation.
Should you buy Monday.com stock?
In a 60% drawdown, Monday.com stock is cheaper but not overly cheap for investors interested in buying today. In order to value the software company, we can use the price-to-sales ratio (P/S) to help estimate future profitability versus the current market capitalization.
Today, Monday.com trades at close to a record low P/S of 8.4. It has 90% gross margins, meaning that the company will likely be able to convert a ton of its revenue into operating earnings as it stops aggressively spending on marketing and product development. It is still growing rather quickly, even if the revenue growth rate has begun to slow down a bit.
With $1.1 billion in trailing-12-month revenue, let's assume that at scale, Monday.com would have a net income margin of 30%. That equates to $330 million in annual net income. Compared to a market cap of $9 billion, that is a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 27, which does not look expensive for a company growing this quickly.",86c3f2a5835a00daf50de2dcf57290ef,trafilatura,2820,0

Healthy investor demand for cryptocurrencies has XRP pushing toward its all-time high.
-
Potential spot XRP ETFs are yet another catalyst on the way.
-
However, XRP is likely to remain a risky investment.
Cryptocurrency investors are enjoying a huge bull market right now. Ironically, it's not Bitcoin stealing the show (though the flagship crypto's price has doubled during the past year), but XRP (CRYPTO: XRP), which has seen its price rise by almost 500%.
XRP is now more than $3.25 per share (as of Aug. 12), leaving investors wondering whether the token is ready to surpass $4 for the first time.
The Trump administration's pro-crypto stance and policies have been game-changers for XRP and the broader sector, and XRP specifically has another exciting catalyst on the horizon.
Here is what you need to know, and whether XRP is a buy for less than $4.
XRP and other cryptocurrencies have a lot of momentum right now
There are many positive developments in the cryptocurrency landscape.
Donald Trump campaigned on supporting cryptocurrencies, and his administration has largely followed through since assuming office in January. Trump announced an executive order to establish a better regulatory framework for the crypto industry, as well as strategic reserves for Bitcoin and other digital assets.
XRP's developer, Ripple, had been engaged in a lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) since late 2020 over the company's sale of XRP tokens to exchanges and institutional investors. A judge issued a mixed ruling in the summer of 2023, but the two sides had appealed and cross-appealed the verdict. Both parties have moved to drop their appeals, ending the litigation.
Ripple developed the XRP ledger for cross-border transactions. XRP is the native token for the XRP ledger. With the litigation overhang dissipating, it's more likely that companies, governments, and other institutions, for which Ripple developed XRP and the XRP Ledger, may embrace them for their intended purpose.
Trump also just signed an executive order to open up U.S. 401(k) retirement plans to alternative assets, which would include cryptocurrencies. This likely won't have an immediate effect on demand. Still, it underscores cryptocurrency's progress into the mainstream investing scene, and may increase buying activity in XRP and broader digital assets over the long term.
A new catalyst on the horizon for XRP
Cryptocurrency prices rely on buyer demand, since they have little or no underlying tangible value. The two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that accumulate the coins. For instance, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF holds more than 180,000 bitcoins alone, so you can see how these institutional funds can have a lot of buying power.",a5a3447e66dba1224a0765a5d13cd63a,trafilatura,2811,0

Norges Bank kept the key deposit rate at 4.25% on Thursday — matching the forecast of all economists surveyed by Bloomberg. It repeated that the key rate would be lowered further “in the course of 2025,” with no new projections or interest-rate outlook produced for the interim meeting.

“With a cautious normalization of the policy rate we will get inflation back to target without causing a large increase in unemployment,” Governor Ida Wolden Bache said in an interview in Arendal, southern Norway.
Norges Bank has aligned more with its developed-world peers since June, when it pivoted earlier than expected to reducing restraint on the energy-exporting economy from the highest level in more than 16 years.
With core inflation remaining stubbornly high and the krone giving up recent gains, the bar was seen as too high for Norwegian officials to resume rate reductions already this month. The central bank said recent developments were in line with its outlook in June when policymakers predicted as many as two more rate cuts this year and further easing to a terminal level of 3% “towards the end of 2028.”
“Although September remains the main expectation, it is not a done deal,” Karine Alsvik Nelson, senior economist in Norway at Svenska Handelsbanken AB, said in a note. “We expect the key policy rate to be cut in September, but remain doubtful about the likelihood of two more cuts this year.”
The krone, the third-worst performer over the last month among G-10 currencies, erased most of its earlier gains, trading about 0.1% higher at 11.9195 versus the euro at 1:07 p.m. in Oslo.
The currency “has been slightly on the weak side since our June forecast,” Wolden Bache said. “We had expected some of that because the interest rate decision was surprising, and we also saw a further depreciation coinciding with the decline in the oil price.”
Traders in overnight swaps now price in 23 basis points of rate cuts at September’s meeting, with 44 basis points of loosening seen by year-end.
Norway’s move comes as the Riksbank in neighboring Sweden is also seen keeping rates on hold next week while signaling more cutting to come. The Bank of England decreased its benchmark rate by 25 basis points to 4% this month, while the European Central Bank is expected to wait until at least December to deliver another reduction.",eb3c91d385e30054e5954de2933da301,trafilatura,2809,0

The problem, though, is most of those early investors haven’t been able to cash in.
That changes Friday for holders of more than 80% of CoreWeave’s Class A shares, with the IPO lockup expiring two days after its second earnings release as a public company. The stock plunged 33% in those two days, in part, analysts say, in anticipation of a flood of selling.
“It’s a challenging, even confusing setup,” said Dave Mazza, chief executive officer at Roundhill Investments, which holds CoreWeave. “It’s reasonable to expect there could be significant selling, which is already weighing on shares. Over the long run, it opens up the stock to have greater float.”
CoreWeave’s shares available to trade currently stand at less than 15% of those outstanding, compared to an average of roughly 95% for stocks in the S&P 500 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. CoreWeave stock fell as much as 4.8% in early trading Friday in New York, extending losses into a third consecutive day.
The Livingston, New Jersey-based company has become a popular way to bet on soaring spending for AI computing and counts Microsoft Corp. as its biggest customer.

But the shares have slumped amid concerns about CoreWeave’s money-losing operations as well as a proposed all-stock acquisition of data-center operator Core Scientific Inc.
CoreWeave closed on Thursday with a market value of about $49 billion, down 46% from the June 20 peak.
Analysts expect the end of the lockup to at best cap near-term advances in the shares, as early investors lock in some gains. At worst, they see the stock falling even further. D.A. Davidson’s Gil Luria, who is one of the three analysts tracked by Bloomberg with a sell rating on the stock, sees downside of more than 60%, based on his $36 price target.
One owner that probably won’t be selling: Nvidia Corp. The company, which dominates the market for AI chips that it supplies to CoreWeave, has about a 6.5% stake after slightly boosting its holdings in the quarter that ended in June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Wall Street's consensus 12-month price target reflects an upside potential of 25%.
People have sung Fleetwood Mac's lyrics for decades: ""Don't stop thinking about tomorrow."" But investors might want to focus on a different timeline.
No one knows what tomorrow holds. At least with some companies, though, it's easier to predict better prospects in the next year than they're experiencing now. I can think of one great example off the top of my head. Meet the 3.4% yield dividend stock that could soar in 2026: UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH).
A blue chip stock that has a case of the blues
You could honestly say that UnitedHealth Group is a blue chip stock that has a case of the blues. The healthcare giant's Change Healthcare subsidiary was the victim of a highly publicized cyberattack early last year that affected 190 million people. Brian Thompson, CEO of the company's UnitedHealthcare unit, was killed in December 2024.
In UnitedHealth Group's first-quarter update in April 2025, the company reported lower-than-expected earnings and lowered its full-year guidance. The next month, it suspended full-year guidance and announced the unexpected departure of former CEO, Andrew Witty.
UnitedHealth Group yanked its full-year guidance because it didn't have a good handle on soaring medical costs. The company noted that ""care activity continued to accelerate while also broadening to more types of benefit offerings"" and that Medicare Advantage plans were incurring greater costs than anticipated.
To add to the troubles, The Wall Street Journal ran a story in May about a criminal investigation of UnitedHealth Group being conducted by the U.S. Department of Justice. Although the DOJ hadn't notified the company about a probe at the time, UnitedHealth subsequently confirmed it was under investigation in July.
As a result of all these issues, UnitedHealth Group's share price has plunged almost 60% below its peak set in late 2024. The health insurance stock is down nearly 50% year to date.
Poised to soar in 2026
Now for some good news: UnitedHealth Group stock should be poised to soar in 2026. Is this just wishful thinking that a beaten-down stock will rebound? Nope.
For one thing, UnitedHealth Group's management projects a return to growth next year. Executives have solid reasons for this expectation. UnitedHealthcare CEO Tim Noel said in the company's second-quarter update that his unit is implementing ""strongly responsive pricing for 2026."" Translation: Hefty increases to health insurance premiums will more than offset higher medical costs.",9a06ef113c1d2575826a6932a24172b8,trafilatura,2776,0

The White House had played down the talks — initially seen as an attempt at securing a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine — with spokesperson Karoline Leavitt calling the summit, ""a listening exercise for the president.""
Following the Friday meeting Trump said, ""There's no deal until there's a deal.""
Ukraine was not part of the discussions, stoking concerns that a potential deal could have compromised the country's sovereignty. ""Ukraine is ready to work as productively as possible to bring the war to an end, and we count on a strong position from America … A meeting of leaders is needed – at the very least, Ukraine, America, and the Russian side,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on X prior to the summit.
This was Putin's first visit to the U.S. in about a decade, with the Russian president stressing that it was a ""hard time"" for bilateral relations. The meeting was held in Alaska, which was once Russian territory.
""There were many, many points that we agreed on … I would say a couple of big ones that we haven't quite got there, but we've made some headway,"" Trump said at a joint press conference with Putin. The leaders did not take any questions from the press.
Putin called the talks a ""starting point,"" both for the resolution of the conflict with Kyiv as well as for improving relations with Washington, which he said had ""fallen to the lowest point since the Cold War.""
Trump said Putin's observations were ""profound,"" and added that he would talk to NATO and Zelenskyy to update them about the discussions with Russia. ""It's ultimately up to them,"" he said.
""Many points were agreed to. There are just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant. One is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there,"" Trump said, without elaborating.
Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, multiple rounds of peace negotiations have taken place, but there has not been a breakthrough on ending hostilities.
In an interview with Fox News following the Friday summit, Trump asked Zelenskyy to make a deal to end the war in Ukraine. ""Gotta make a deal. Yeah. Look, Russia is a very big power, and they're not. They're great soldiers,"" he said.
Russian media outlets were upbeat Friday ahead of Putin's meeting with Trump, with the summit being seen as a win for Moscow. Commentary across Russian state news sites characterized the talks as a positive for Russia. The mood in Ukraine was somber amid apprehensions of the country losing some territory as part of a Trump-brokered deal.",0c6e757af539eb0cac9b049a03a0b1e2,trafilatura,2775,0

Personal finance expert Dave Ramsey recently shared an intriguing story about a friend who bought thousands worth of cryptocurrency solely to irritate him.
Ramsey Says Friend ‘Wasted’ $10,000
On a July 29 episode of ""The Ramsey Show,"" the popular radio personality revealed he had a friend who invested $10,000 in cryptocurrency to ""get a rise out of him.
""And I’m like, you’re an idiot,"" Ramsey said with a poker face. ""He wanted me to call him an idiot and I did.""
Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.
As amusing as that sounds, Ramsey said he would have called his friend an idiot for simply talking about cryptocurrency investments and that he didn’t have to “waste” $10,000.
Ramsey Remains A Hardliner
The anecdote came in response to a caller’s question on whether Ramsey had softened his stance on cryptocurrency.
""I haven’t softened on that at all,"" he said emphatically. ""You’re speculating, you’re gambling, then that’s up to you. But don’t call it an investment.""
He previously said that assets like Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) are not investment strategies but rather “things that you can jump into or jump out of.""
Ramsey added that for Bitcoin to become a ""legitimate"" currency in his books, it'd require a ""longer track record that is stable.""

Bitcoin’s Evolution
Bitcoin has skyrocketed a whopping 910% in the last five years, and 46,421% in the last ten years, far exceeding the returns of S&P 500 and gold.
Moreover, traditional investors now have exposure to the asset through spot exchange-traded funds and companies such as Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR), underlining its growing institutional interest.
Earlier this year, President Donald Trump famously said that BTC is helping relieve pressure on the U.S. dollar and that it’s “great” for the country.

Another major IPO kicked off today as shares of the crypto exchange Bullish began trading.
-
Last week, President Trump gave his approval for cryptocurrencies to be included in retirement plans.
-
Dogecoin is still a meme coin and should be treated by investors as a risky asset.
The cryptocurrency Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) is moving higher today, up 4.2% in the last 24 hours as of 3:18 p.m. ET. The jump comes as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were relatively flat, while many cryptos trade higher.
Dogecoin is rising amid broad positive sentiment for crypto as a major crypto exchange had its initial public offering (IPO) today.
Bullish IPO fuels positive sentiment
The Peter Thiel–backed crypto exchange Bullish made its public debut today at $37 per share, raising $1.1 billion. Shares quickly more than doubled, climbing to roughly $90 within hours. Bullish targets institutional clients and focuses on Bitcoin and Ethereum trading, but its blockbuster debut added to the upbeat tone, lifting altcoins across the board.

Trump is boosting the crypto market
President Trump signed an executive order last week authorizing the inclusion of cryptocurrencies and other ""alternative assets"" in retirement plans in 401(k)s. This is helping to fuel optimism in the market and enthusiasm for Dogecoin.
Traditionally, the performance of crypto has diverged from the stock market, and adding it to a retirement plan could help investors diversify. However, in recent years, the two have become much more closely tied as institutional exposure to crypto grows. It's not clear whether this relationship will hold moving forward, especially if a major market downturn comes.
https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/08/crypto-options-in-401k-plans-heres-what-you-need-to-know.html
Verdict: Still a speculative meme coin
While Dogecoin has outlasted most meme coins, it remains an inflationary asset with no fundamental utility. The recent rally reflects sentiment more than substance, and I'd avoid adding it to your retirement assets or treating it as a long-term investment.

Sapiens is known for its software-as-a-service-based solutions that incorporate AI and automation to aid insurers.
The company's product suite serves various sectors such as property and casualty, workers' compensation and life insurance, along with tools for reinsurance, compliance, data analytics, digital engagement and decision management.
Under the agreed terms, shareholders of Sapiens will receive $43.50 per share, marking a premium of around 64% on the company's last closing price on 8 August 2025.
Post-acquisition, Sapiens will operate as a private entity, with its shares to be delisted.
Formula Systems, a current shareholder in Sapiens, will continue to hold a minority interest in the business after the acquisition.
The acquisition will support Sapien’s expansion on a global scale with the resources and expertise provided by Advent, the insurtech company said in a press release.
Advent has secured committed debt and equity financing.
Funds advised by Advent have pledged an aggregate equity contribution of $1.3bn.
The deal's completion is expected between the fourth quarter of 2025 (Q4 2025) and Q1 2026, contingent upon standard closing conditions.
Sapiens CEO Roni Al-Dor said: “This transaction marks a significant milestone in Sapiens’ journey, reinforces the success of our strategy, our commitment to delivering exceptional value to our customers and the strength of our global team.
“Following a deliberate process, the Board of Directors approved this transaction, which delivers an excellent outcome for Sapiens’ shareholders, providing them a substantial cash value at an attractive premium.”
Advent director Douglas Hallstrom stated: “We are delighted to partner with Sapiens to support its next phase of innovation.
Hallstrom added: “We will work with the company to accelerate investment into technology innovation, AI and customer centricity. This transaction comes at a critical time of market change, and we believe Sapiens will more effectively be able to navigate this in a private setting.”

A Wednesday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission said a Texas jury found Landstar Ranger acted as a broker, not a motor carrier in a 2021 “tragic vehicular accident.” The verdict assigned 15% of the $22.8 million in total monetary damages to Landstar. The remaining 85% of the damages were attributed to truckload carrier MyUniverse, the motor carrier hauling the brokered load.
Landstar (NASDAQ: LSTR) previously disclosed the accident in its second-quarter report at the end of July. The company noted the shipment was conducted under “a non-exclusive truck brokerage contractual arrangement,” and didn’t involve one of its business capacity owners, who haul almost exclusively for Landstar.
The company said it had already included an “immaterial accrual” for the accident on its balance sheet in the second quarter and that there is “no anticipated change to the previously recorded immaterial accrual.”
Landstar said all parties are expected to file post-trial motions and that a potential appeals process looms.
“No assurances can be provided as to the probability of success with respect to any potential post-trial motions or appeals relating to the Verdict or the ultimate outcome of any such appeals,” the filing stated.
The company also said the decision is unlikely to impact a $12 million “no claims bonus” program it has in place with third-party insurers. It received the remaining $3 million of the bonus allotment at the beginning of the third quarter “due to favorable loss experience.”
Landstar also disclosed on Wednesday other charges that will be incurred in the third quarter following an annual strategic review.
It plans to sell or otherwise dispose of its Mexican subsidiary, Landstar Metro, as the unit “has not been able to meet the Company’s strategic or operational goals and expectations.” It formed the unit in 2017 in conjunction with the acquisition of Fletes Avella. An initial investment of $8.5 million, along with additional investments, pushed the unit’s carrying value to approximately $26 million at the close of the 2025 second quarter.
Landstar expects to record a noncash impairment charge of $13 million to $17 million, or 28 cents to 37 cents per share, in the third quarter. However, it said the disposition won’t adversely affect its cross-border offering.
Landstar will also see a $9 million noncash impairment charge (20 cents per share) as it unwinds its Blue TMS platform. The company has decided to conduct TL brokerage services exclusively through its Landstar TMS.",cf555dab2ac0ff4c34b624aad5b51a2f,trafilatura,2744,0

Major U.S. equities indexes gained ground Wednesday as consensus solidified around the likelihood of the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates at its next meeting.
The growing confidence in rate cuts followed Tuesday's release of soft inflation data, which likely gave policymakers more leeway to loosen monetary policy.
The S&P 500 advanced 0.3% to secure an all-time closing high for the second straight session.

Paramount Skydance (PSKY) shares skyrocketed 37%, extending gains posted in the prior session and logging the S&P 500's top daily performance. The newly minted media giant, which began trading as a combined entity last week following a prolonged merger process between Skydance Media and the former Paramount Global, grabbed headlines Monday with the announcement of a $7.7 billion, seven-year agreement to acquire the exclusive broadcasting rights for Ultimate Fighting Championship events. Its comparatively small float led commentator Jim Cramer to call it a meme stock today, likely fueling the fire.

This significant rally is supported by the solid demand for the company’s products, increased investments in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, its improving leverage profile, and improved profitability.
Seagate is seeing surging demand for its mass-capacity storage products. As cloud computing expands and data centers scale up to support AI applications, the demand for high-capacity hard drives continues to soar. Seagate is well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. Its products have become essential for hyperscale cloud providers and enterprises alike, making it a natural beneficiary of the AI-driven data explosion.

The company’s financials reflect the solid demand trends. Seagate recently closed fiscal 2025 on a solid note. Revenue surged 39% in fiscal 2025, adjusted gross profit nearly doubled, and operating profit more than tripled. This solid performance is driven by its supply-demand alignment, tight cost controls, and a focus on high-value products.
Quarterly performance has been just as impressive. In the most recent fiscal fourth quarter, revenue jumped 30% year-over-year, while adjusted gross margin expanded 170 basis points sequentially. This sustained improvement reflects the company’s shift toward a build-to-order (BTO) manufacturing model, supply discipline, and dynamic pricing strategies, all of which have helped the company maintain profitability even in competitive markets.
Seagate Is in a Solid Growth Phase
Seagate is in a solid growth phase, with no signs of losing momentum. It continues to see strong demand for its products, a trend that is expected to drive both its financials and share price higher. Management is optimistic about margin expansion, thanks to the accelerating adoption of its next-generation Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR)–based Mozaic drives.
Looking ahead, mass capacity storage remains a key growth driver. Seagate is ramping production of its HAMR-based Mozaic products and gaining traction with customers at an impressive pace. Three major cloud service providers have already qualified these drives, with more customers moving through the qualification process smoothly. Demand from cloud providers is surging, and even the enterprise OEM market is showing signs of life, with nearline sales posting modest sequential gains.

Check Out: The 5 Car Brands Named the Least Reliable of 2025
Higher refunds, lower tax rates and expanded deductions and credits are all on the table. Here are several ways tax professionals say the middle class can take advantage of the Big Beautiful Bill.
Bigger Tax Refund
“There is the possibility of receiving greater refunds with enhanced tax credits for dependents and childcare,” Sherman Standberry, certified public accountant (CPA) and managing partner at My CPA Coach, wrote in an email. “If you have children or dependents, check eligibility for the enhanced Child Tax Credit and Dependent Care Credit.”
Under the BBB, the maximum child tax credit increased from $2,000 to $2,200 per qualifying child, and increased the child and dependent care credit from 35% to 50% of eligible care expenses. Income thresholds for middle-income families have also been adjusted.

Additionally, a new announcement from the IRS also points to Americans receiving a higher tax refund next year thanks to tax breaks in the BBB. In the notice, the IRS explained that as part of the BBB’s phased implementation, there will be no changes to certain information returns or withholding tables.
According to Newsweek, this means Americans will continue to pay taxes on tips and overtime, but will receive them back as part of their refund.
Higher Standard Deduction
“The standard deduction increases by $750 ($1,500 for married couples) starting in 2025,” explained Miryam Wisnicki, principal at Clifton Larson Allen (CLA). “Most middle-class taxpayers claim the standard deduction, so the increased standard deduction will provide broad relief to the middle class.”
Because the standard deduction reduces the amount of income subject to tax, this increase means more earnings are shielded from taxation. For many middle-income households, that translates into a lower overall tax bill without the need to itemize deductions.
“Taxpayers who claim the standard deduction can deduct up to $1,000 ($2,000 for married couples) for cash contributions to charity starting in 2026,” Wisnicki added. Previously, this was only available to those who itemized.
Lower Tax Rates
“The reduction of marginal tax rates for some income brackets is another noteworthy change that could translate into higher take-home pay for many households,” according to Standberry.",004e26cd128cc6dd4b536824224e9e02,trafilatura,2739,0

Dive Brief:
-
Vicarious Surgical CEO Stephen From, who started his job last week, said Tuesday the company no longer expects to begin a clinical trial for its surgical robot by the end of this year and will instead focus on completing the design for the commercial version of the system. The company’s shares slid more than 24% to end at $7.83 on Wednesday, according to Yahoo Finance.
-
The clinical trial’s timing will determine when the robot developer submits its de novo filing to the Food and Drug Administration, From said on Vicarious’ second-quarter earnings call. Vicarious had planned to make its FDA submission in late 2026, after delaying the start of the trial.
-
The company plans to conduct an assessment over about four to six weeks to gauge readiness for verification of the system, From said, adding he would work with Vicarious’ board and investor base to evaluate the capital strategy for supporting its goals.
Dive Insight:
Vicarious, which counts large for-profit hospital operator HCA Healthcare and Bill Gates among its investors, is developing a single-port robotic system for abdominal procedures that will vie for market share with robot industry leader Intuitive Surgical. Vicarious is initially targeting hernia, gallbladder, gastrointestinal and gynecology procedures.
From, who joined Vicarious as co-founder Adam Sachs moved into the role of president, said the single-port robotic market is still in its early stages, and he believes the company’s differentiated platform and strong technical foundation will advance minimally invasive surgery.
“I see an industry here, which is dominated by one player, and I see a lot of others that are trying to copy what they're doing, and I saw this team wasn't,” said From. “This is a project and this is a system and a company that is worth investing in for the long term, because this is a system that isn't just a copycat. This is a system that deserves market share.”
Vicarious ended the second quarter with about $24 million in cash and expects its cash burn to be about $50 million for fiscal 2025. The company will likely need to seek non-dilutive financing to maintain operations or meaningfully cut expenses, BTIG analyst Ryan Zimmerman said in a note to clients Tuesday.
“It's clear that the company is undergoing a pause until further notice and [management] does not have a clear answer as to how this may impact longer-term timelines,” Zimmerman wrote. “We think the potential likely path is that insiders may help support the company in order to give it some breathing room to get towards the finish line.”",ac57980046537f3bab26337b7418d941,trafilatura,2736,0

John Delony expressed his frustration at a caller during an episode of The Ramsey Show who shares tens of thousands of dollars in debt with her husband despite having minimal expenses.

Want an extra $1,300,000 when you retire? Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it
Phoebe from Jacksonville, Florida, called into the show to ask co-hosts Delony and George Kamel to weigh in on her dilemma. She asked whether it would be best to continue working her two jobs to pay down the couple’s debt, or should she take up her husband’s offer to use his military benefits to attend college for free?
Delony and Kamel quickly realized that Phoebe could achieve both goals, and the only thing stopping her was herself.
The answer is right there
Phoebe described her financial situation with her husband. They live on a military base while her husband serves, meaning that his pay is low, but most of their living expenses are taken care of. He takes home around $4,500 per month, while she pulls down $50,000 per year between her two jobs. However, the couple owe $70,000 in consumer debt, including two car loans.
Kamel and Delony advised the couple to get rid of the husband's expensive truck, which was a major drag on their budget. They also figured that if the couple was frugal, they might find a way to pay off most of all of their debt in less than a year, especially considering their living expenses are so low.
“You’re sitting on a solution and you won’t use it,” Delony said. “If you sold your cars and you worked really hard for six months … you could be debt-free.”
He added: “As a taxpayer, I am all about veterans and their dependents going to college. I think that’s an amazing use of my tax dollars.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Wall Street's main indexes were mixed on Thursday with S&P 500 edging up to a closing high, while the Dow Jones and Nasdaq were flat, after a hotter-than-expected producer prices report dampened expectations of potential interest-rate cuts.
A Labor Department report showed producer prices increased the most in three years in July due to a surge in the costs of goods and services, suggesting a broad pickup in inflation was imminent.
Traders trimmed their Fed rate-cut expectations for the rest of the year to about 56.7 basis points, according to data compiled by LSEG, compared with around 63 bps before the report.
But they are still fully pricing in a quarter-percentage-point cut in September.
""The implication is that the Fed is going to offer a 25-(basis point) cut in September. But it will be a hawkish cut. It's way too early still for the Fed to wish to guide the market towards an extended easing cycle,"" said Thierry Wizman, global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie Group.
""The next important thing will be the Expenditures Price Index later this month. If there are signals that there's inflation broadly in services, the market will take that adversely.""
A separate report on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new applications for jobless benefits fell last week.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 11.01 points, or 0.02%, down to 44,911.26, the S&P 500 gained 1.96 points, or 0.03%, to 6,468.54 - a new closing high - and the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.47 points, or 0.01%, to 21,710.67.
On Thursday, seven of the 11 S&P 500 sectors declined.
Recent data reflecting labor market weakness and a moderate rise in consumer prices had strengthened expectations that the central bank will potentially lower interest rates next month.
However, Thursday's report fanned concerns that U.S. tariffs on imports could start to impact prices in the coming months and dampen a rally in U.S. stocks that had helped the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq log record highs over the past two sessions.
""U.S. stocks are pricy,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist CFRA Research.
The S&P 500 index is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 23 based on forward estimates, or a near-40% premium to its 20-year average, he said.
The hotter-than-expected PPI report now has investors pulling petals from a daisy saying ""They (the Fed) will cut rates, they won’t cut rates,"" he added.

-
Small-cap stocks continued to climb on Wednesday, extending the previous session's gains following a better-than-feared consumer price index report.
-
Tuesday's inflation data raised Wall Street's expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its next policy meeting in September, which would be a boon for rate-sensitive small caps.
-
Bank of America analysts expect small caps to benefit long term from modest valuations relative to large caps, light investor positioning, and President Trump's reshoring agenda.
Small-cap stocks continued their march higher as investors doubled down on bets that interest rate cuts are imminent.
The Russell 2000 (RUT)—the benchmark small-cap equity index—rose 2% on Wednesday, hitting its highest level since December. Small caps built on yesterday's 3% gain, which was fueled by a better-than-feared report on consumer prices. The data showed that Inflation held steady at 2.7% in July, surprising Wall Street, which was braced for tariffs to cause prices to rise faster.
Morgan Stanley analysts on Monday predicted that the odds of a rate cut in September—around 90% at the time—would rise if yesterday’s report showed few signs that tariffs were materially affecting consumer prices. “This has the potential to catalyze a more durable rotation to small caps and lower quality stocks,” the firm said.
Tuesday's data appears to have convinced investors that the Federal Reserve will look through tariff-driven inflation at its policy meeting next month. As of late Wednesday, traders saw a 96% chance of a quarter percentage point cut in the benchmark interest rate, according to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool.
“The prospect of rate cuts bodes well for many of the traditional value sectors and small cap stocks that we have recommended clients should overweight,” said Eric Teal, Chief Investment Officer at Comerica Wealth Management, on Wednesday. “These areas have lagged the technology and growth sectors and are primed to lead the market higher as breadth expands.”
Rate Cuts Could Give Small Caps a Big Boost
Small-cap stocks benefit disproportionately from lower interest rates because they are more likely than large companies to rely on credit to fund growth, and are more likely to have floating-rate loans. They also tend to operate more domestic businesses, and thus benefit more than multinationals from the stimulative effects—boosted consumer and business spending—of lower rates.
A rate cut next month would come at an opportune time for small-cap investors. Small caps grew earnings for the first time in more than a year last quarter, and are expected to outpace mid and large caps throughout the second half, according to Bank of America.",a2cc9f49faf9d952cdf912742641e43a,trafilatura,2728,0

-
Investors often make the mistake of relying purely on price to determine the value of a company or asset.
-
XRP is often perceived as cheaper than other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum because of its low token price.
-
Smart investors understand that XRP's market capitalization is a better indication of its value relative to peers.
In recent years, growth investors and large financial institutions alike have warmed up to volatile, speculative asset classes such as cryptocurrency. Within the crypto realm, early disruptors such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have witnessed substantial price appreciation.
In the background, however, a relative newcomer called XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) has entered the spotlight. XRP is a component of Ripple's payments network, a financial services infrastructure designed to disrupt incumbent international payments systems.
With the token trading for just $3.20 as of this writing (Aug. 10), could XRP be the next cryptocurrency to break out and experience a Bitcoin-style run for the ages?
How cheap is XRP in reality?
One of the most common mistakes an investor can make is confusing value with share price. A price of a few dollars doesn't necessarily make an asset cheap, just as a high price doesn't necessarily imply overvaluation. To get a better sense of a company's valuation, investors should look past price per share (or token) and instead analyze market capitalization.
Right now, XRP boasts a market cap of about $190 billion. As the chart below illustrates, that's more than the combined total for crypto-centric companies Robinhood Markets and Coinbase. Taking this a step further, XRP's market cap is almost triple that of the combined market capitalizations of neobanks SoFi Technologies, Chime, and stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group.
These are not trivial details. Even though XRP is trading for significantly less than $5, the market is already attributing greater value to it than to established, revenue-generating businesses with diversified ecosystems that serve customers on a global scale.
Is XRP a buy right now?
Last year, the global market value for cross-border transactions was estimated by Grand View Research at $212 trillion. The firm forecast this to grow to $320 trillion by 2030 -- growth that would imply both immense potential and an accelerated need for innovative payments infrastructure.
The distinction that I think many investors are misunderstanding is that an expanding cross-border transactions market is likely a more meaningful tailwind for solutions providers like Ripple than for bridge currencies such as XRP. In other words, broader adoption of the Ripple payment network is not necessarily a direct catalyst for XRP.",c7f06010eb2c8ac247e054c0e7713e69,trafilatura,2728,0

The company's net profit fell to approximately $450m (1.81trn pesos), down from the previous year's equivalent of $840m, with total sales also decreasing by 9% to around $7.4bn, reported Reuters.
Ecopetrol's CEO, Ricardo Roa, used a a press conference to highlight several operational challenges.
“We have had blockades, attacks and thefts that have prevented us from operating, and we have also seen a significant drop in volumes carried by third parties through our transportation assets,” Roa was quoted as saying.
These disruptions, along with new taxes and inflation, have compounded the impact of the oil price decline on the company's financial performance.
The company's total production saw a marginal year-on-year decline of 0.5%, averaging 755,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd).
Furthermore, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) fell by 21% to around $2.78bn.
Despite the downturn, Ecopetrol has maintained substantial investments, with around $2.58bn allocated to exploration and production projects within Colombia and in international ventures in Brazil and the US.
As of the end of June, the company had completed drilling six out of the ten exploratory wells planned for the year.
The oil sector globally has been navigating through price volatility, partly due to OPEC+ increasing production, which contributed to an 11% decrease in Brent crude prices over the quarter.
Brent crude prices averaged $67 per barrel (bbl) in Q2, a drop from $75/bbl in the previous three months and $85/bbl in the same period last year.
In contrast to Ecopetrol's performance, Mexico's Pemex and Brazil's Petrobras managed to post profits despite the challenging market conditions.
Meanwhile, Ecopetrol has announced plans to continue with natural gas drilling in the Colombian Caribbean, aiming to cater to growing domestic demand and capitalise on its reserve potential, despite Shell's recent exit from three offshore blocks.

But, there are some caveats that retirees might not think of before they make the move.

Try This: 6 Hybrid Vehicles To Stay Away From in Retirement
Some retirees who have downsized are encountering costs they didn’t budget for a few years back. GOBankingRates spoke to retirees to find out what they wish they knew before they downsized.
Account for Inflation
A lot of retirees base how much they’ll need on the price of goods and services when they retire. Even if they downsize, this can still cause a discrepancy in the budget in a few years time.
Stephanie H. retired at the age of 59 in March 2022. She said she wished she had budgeted in a way that left room for prices to rise.
“I didn’t figure in how much the cost of everything would increase. My house insurance doubled. My car insurance went up more than 80%,” she said.
Stephanie also noted that her cell phone bill, health insurance, gym membership and groceries also went up. “I was blessed with a pension, however it will never increase,” the retiree added.
Stephanie recommended that retirees really take stock of their expenses before they downsize.
“Look at your expenses, write down every expense,” she explained. “Are there things where you can change services? Cut down? Cut out? Do it yourself vs paying someone? Are there things you don’t use that you can sell (you’d be surprised) and put that money directly in savings?”

Look for Lower Rates
As Stephanie pointed out, insurance prices — whether it be health insurance, car insurance, pet insurance or any other type — are sure to rise during the retirement years.
Ivy S. recommended being diligent about looking into lower rates for insurance.
“I’m glad I changed my car insurance and saved $350 over six months,” she shared.
Ivy also switched her phone service so she could save more money.
Think About Long-Term Care
Depending on health, some retirees might need long-term care as soon as they stop working. Even if that’s not the case, it’s an important need to think about.
Ivy remarked that long-term care was something her initial retirement plans didn’t budget for. “I don’t need it yet, but I wish I had long-term care,” she said.
It might be wise to save enough money that some can be applied to more extensive care in the future.
Look for Grocery Stores With Lower Prices
One way to save more money is to switch grocery stores. Some stores like Whole Foods and Gelson’s are known for having higher prices than others.",b65de865aa06bc67b346e654e2490bd5,trafilatura,2715,0

Unfortunately for natural gas bulls, despite a hot next few days, milder weather forecasts for the second half of August, combined with robust storage levels and output, pushed US natural gas futures below $2.90 per MMBtu, Tuesday, their lowest level since November 2024.
US natural gas futures. Source: Trading Economics
According to Trading Economics, output in the Lower 48 states averaged 108.3 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in August, compared to July’s record 107.9 bcfd.
[Inventories are] about 7 percent above seasonal norms and expected to keep growing. Meteorologists still see above-normal heat through August 27 but with lower intensity than previously forecast, reducing demand.
Also on Aug. 12, the Wall Street Journal reported US natural gas futures fell for a fourth straight session, with buoyant production and forecasts for a cooler second half of August keeping up concerns about surplus inventories.
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) lowered its Henry Hub price estimate for the rest of the year by 3%, expecting gas in underground storage to end the injection season (April to October) 2 percent above the five-year average, instead of the 3 percent below average forecasted in April.
“Our higher end-of-season storage forecast is largely the result of more natural gas production and fewer liquefied natural gas exports than we had expected in April,” the EIA said.
However, the EIA also stated it expects natural gas inventories to fall closer to the five-year average in the coming months, putting upward pressure on prices.
In its Short-Term Energy Outlook dated Aug. 12, the energy agency said it expects the Henry Hub price to average around $3.60/MMBtu in the second half of 2025 and $4.30 in 2026 — 21 percent and 6 percent lower, respectively, than forecasted in April.
Next April should see a monthly bottom for 2026 prices at around $3.60/MMBtu, rising from there and reaching $5.40/MMbtu in December.
Higher LNG exports should brighten the price picture. The EIA expects LNG exports to grow around 2 bcfd, “further tightening supply-demand balances and contributing to higher prices later in the forecast period.”
Rising natural gas production in recent months has added to higher-than-anticipated inventory levels. The EIA expects marketed production to grow by 2 percent over 2024 volumes, supported by growth in the Permian, Haynesville and Appalachia regions. Drill rigs are being deployed to gas-intensive shale plays. Baker Hughes reported on Aug. 8 that 19 more rigs were drilling for natural gas than at the start of April, an 18 percent increase.",c276a784f40d2d7b73e4b2a7f533bef1,trafilatura,2709,0

He stated that he was responsible for creating “many of the foundational tools” necessary for launching and managing training jobs, later taking on a role overseeing engineering across various projects related to infrastructure, product, and applied AI.
His exit follows the recent departure of xAI’s legal head, Robert Keele, and occurs amid growing competition in the AI landscape, with companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic significantly investing in the development and deployment of advanced AI systems.
Additionally, July 2025, saw the resignation of Linda Yaccarino, CEO of Musk-owned X, shortly after the platform was integrated into xAI.

Investors may monitor major overhead areas on UnitedHealth's chart around $325, $380, and $440, while also watching a key zone of support between $250 and $235.
UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares surged Friday after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) revealed a stake in the embattled healthcare giant.
The stock was up over 11% in recent trading, helping lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a new high. Still, shares of UnitedHealth have shed over a third of their value since the start of the year, weighed down by worries about investigations into the company’s Medicare billing practices, former CEO Andrew Witty's sudden departure in May, and a downbeat forecast amid higher care costs.
Below, let’s take a closer look at UnitedHealth’s chart and use technical analysis to identify major price levels worth watching out for.
Breakout Above Downtrend Line
After bottoming at the start of August, UnitedHealth shares have continued to gain momentum, recently breaking out above a steep downtrend line that extends back to the April peak.
Moreover, the rally in the stock has coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) moving back above its neutral threshold, indicating accelerating buying interest.
Let’s identify three major overhead areas to eye if the shares continue to climb and also identify a key zone of support to watch during potential pullbacks.
Major Overhead Areas to Monitor
The first overhead area to watch sits around $325. This area on the chart could provide overhead resistance near the top of a countertrend trading range that formed on the chart between May and July.
A close above this level could see the shares climb toward $380. Tactical traders who accumulate shares near this month’s low may look for exit points in this location near a series of price activity just prior to the mid-May stock gap.
Further bullish momentum opens the door for a retest of overhead resistance at $440, currently just below the falling 200-week moving average. Investors may decide to lock in profits in this region near the prominent February low and a minor upswing in the shares during late April.

The shareholders are set to receive $43.50 per common share.
Formula Systems (1985), a current shareholder of Sapiens, will maintain a minority interest in the company following the acquisition.
Sapiens provides tools that enable insurers to enhance operational efficiency and adapt to market changes.

Sapiens CEO Roni Al-Dor said: “This transaction marks a significant milestone in Sapiens’ journey, reinforces the success of our strategy, our commitment to delivering exceptional value to our customers, and the strength of our global team.”
Advent has secured committed debt and equity financing to support the acquisition, with funds advised by Advent pledging a total equity contribution of $1.3bn.
The deal is anticipated to close in the fourth quarter of 2025 or the first quarter of 2026, pending the fulfilment of standard closing conditions, including shareholder approval and necessary regulatory clearances.
Advent director Douglas Hallstrom said: “We are delighted to partner with Sapiens to support its next phase of innovation.
“Insurers are increasingly turning to technology to help unlock growth and profitability, drive innovation and improve business resilience – with Sapiens a critical partner in enabling this for market leading insurers globally.”

An analyst upgraded his recommendation on the Danish pharmaceutical company.
-
In his view, the Wegovy developer now ranks as a neutral.
Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) is quite the divisive stock among both investors and analysts these days. Although its high-profile obesity drug Wegovy has been a raging success, the company is being rocked by competition from both a rival and numerous third-party drug compounders.
On Wednesday, however, one analyst became notably more bullish on the Danish pharmaceutical company, and investors took this to heart. Collectively they pushed the company's share price up by more than 2% today, handily beating the 0.3% increase of the bellwether S&P 500 index.
An analyst makes an upgrade
Well before market open today, BNP Paribas Exane's Peter Verdult upgraded his recommendation on Novo Nordisk. This doesn't make him a bull on the stock, however, as he only moved it up from underperform (sell) to neutral. As he did so, he also lifted his price target from $54 per share to $61.
According to reports, Verdult's adjustments were based on financial modeling that was updated to reflect the latest trends driving prescriptions, foreign exchange, and drug pricing.
Again, this doesn't make Novo Nordisk a buy for the analyst, but given the company's share-price slump and the fact that Verdult is anticipating growth in sales and compound earnings of 7% and 8%, respectively, he believes it is fairly priced now.
Shifting focus
Recently, Novo Nordisk announced measures to step up its legal fight against some compounders, indicating that it's focusing much of its attention on activities outside of drug development and commercialization. Still, Wegovy is a high-demand product, and the company remains tightly identified with weight loss treatments; this alone gives it significant value as an investment.
Should you invest $1,000 in Novo Nordisk right now?
Before you buy stock in Novo Nordisk, consider this:
The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Novo Nordisk wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Three-quarters of Japanese firms have a favourable view of the latest tariff deal with the United States after Tokyo managed to draw some concessions from President Donald Trump, a Reuters survey showed on Thursday.
The two Pacific allies agreed last month to set U.S. tariffs on imports from Japan at 15%, down from the previously planned 25%, while the auto import levy would be cut to 15% from 27.5%.
""The worst was averted. But some negative effects are anticipated, and that makes it necessary to keep a close eye on the matter,"" a manager at a chemical company wrote in the survey.
The newly agreed 15% auto tariff is still sharply higher than the 2.5% levy that had been in place before Trump's tariffs kicked in.
Following the agreement, Toyota Motor cut its annual operating profit forecast by 16%, while Sony raised its full-year profit outlook by 4%, with the tariff impact expected to be smaller than first feared.
Reflecting the mixed views, about 38% of survey respondents said they expected a negative earnings impact from the agreement, while 20% anticipated a positive effect.
The bilateral tariff agreement is unlikely to have immediate sway over corporate Japan's capital expenditure, with 95% of respondents saying they would not change capital investment plans following the deal.
The survey was conducted by Nikkei Research for Reuters from July 30 to August 8. Nikkei Research reached out to 497 companies and 241 responded on condition of anonymity.
PRICE HIKES, SECURITY
Asked about the pricing outlook, 54% of respondents said they would continue to raise prices to reflect higher costs, while 46% said they saw little room for further hikes.
Core consumer inflation, which excludes volatile fresh food, has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for well over three years as companies continue to pass on rising raw material costs.
""It is quite noticeable that price hikes are spurring a demand slowdown and market shrinkage,"" said an official at a wholesaler, who agreed with a view that price hikes are nearing their limits.
Asked about the prospect of new anti-espionage laws, more than 60% of respondents said Japan's current legal system did not adequately protect confidential information and technology from foreign spy activity.
Calls for an anti-espionage law are growing in both Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition camp this year, with Japan's security environment becoming more challenging.
About 42% of respondents said an anti-espionage law should be urgently considered while another 42% said it ought to be looked into cautiously. A mere 1% objected to such legislation.",151fceab33535c2d1b984790471cc063,trafilatura,2695,0

The market keeps pushing higher. But does that also mean speculation is running rampant without the support of fundamentals?
A surprising survey from S&P Global Market Intelligence showed risk appetite actually decreased in August, highlighting flagging investor sentiment and a return to levels of risk avoidance last seen during the ""Liberation Day"" doldrums of April.
But from the perspective of Wall Street bulls, the languishing mood reflected a moment to regroup and a base from which investors could build the next rally.
Even with fresh highs, and the idea of the S&P crossing 7,000 back on the table, the current rush hasn't hit a dangerously speculative level, according to analysis by DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas. By using S&P 500 sector correlations to the index as a sign of near-term peaks in investor confidence, Colas accurately called the tops in 2023 and 2024, as well as February 2025. ""History suggests that we are heading towards an unhealthy level of investor optimism but are not there just yet,"" Colas wrote in a note to clients this week.
Growth stocks also continue to outperform value stocks by a statistically significant amount. But Big Tech's concentration in the S&P 500's growth variant, accounting for nearly half of the index's gains, makes the recent outsized run understandable, Colas wrote.
At the same time, crypto investors are partying like the last winter never happened. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ethereum (ETH-USD) are at or near all-time highs. And a parade of altcoins are rallying alongside them, with Washington cheerleading the industry and Wall Street shedding its reluctance to participate in decentralized finance. (Did somebody say new financial instrument?) A string of blockbuster public debuts has also embodied the market's exuberance. But with a momentous Fed cut on the horizon and a settling of the worst tariff-induced fears, the optimism doesn't seem misplaced.
Still, other measures have signaled that the new highs could flash as warnings, drawing comparisons to historical market tops that, in retrospect, look like bubbles or were driven by circumstances that necessitated a downfall.
Goldman Sachs analysts recently observed that their Speculative Trading Indicator has risen sharply during the past few months. Behind only the 1998-2001 dot-com bubble era and the acute COVID period of 2020-2021, the gauge has hit its highest level on record, although it still remains well below those prior peaks.",81764e646fb8266a8ddb38eab062071b,trafilatura,2695,0

LinkedIn’s expanding access to its AI-generated job summaries option for recruiters, which helps prospective employers ensure that the relevant key terms and skills are noted in your job ads, better aligning them with LinkedIn’s recommendation systems.
The option has been available in some regions for a while, while LinkedIn has also been developing its listings within its Recruiter platform to improve their accuracy.
And now, more LinkedIn Company Page managers in more regions will be able to use its AI assistance for their job listings.
As explained by LinkedIn, its AI-generated job summaries are currently available “for a subset of LinkedIn members using LinkedIn job posts in the U.S., India, U.K., Canada, and Australia.”
Originally, the option was only available in the U.S. and Canada, but now, more regions are gaining access, providing expanded AI assistance in the job listing process.
And the expansion into India is significant, because India is now LinkedIn’s third-biggest user market, behind the U.S. and Europe.
The platform has seen rapid growth in India, and as such, it’s now becoming a bigger focus for the platform, as it builds new tools and innovations.
Which, for LinkedIn, at least for the moment, means more and more AI-powered options.
“AI-assisted job descriptions make it easier for hiring managers to create high-quality job descriptions quickly. Using this feature helps you spend less time creating your job description from scratch and more time on other aspects of hiring.”
LinkedIn says that the process leverages data and skills insights from across the platform to draft more resonant job descriptions.
“The inputs used are job title, job location, company, workplace type, and job type that are provided to us when you start your job post.”
LinkedIn says that these AI-generated summaries will help employers come up with better outlines for the position that they’re hiring for, though they won’t necessarily be better than human-created overviews.
“Using AI-assisted job descriptions does not mean the draft job description will be better for your role than if you write your own. We hope to help hiring managers save time writing and editing their job descriptions and use a skills-based approach to help draft a job description for you. While we try to ensure quality, mistakes can sometimes happen and job descriptions will not contain all required information. You’ll still need to review the job description to make sure it is right for your role and make any edits before posting.”",07dedad3fd5cbded7a237056114d4741,trafilatura,2689,0

Alternative investments were defined to include private market investments, real estate, commodities, infrastructure projects, lifetime income strategies — and notably, ""holdings in actively managed investment vehicles that are investing in digital assets."" (Curiously, crypto was the only asset class where ""actively managed"" was specified versus the ""direct or indirect"" language used for everything else — a regulatory breadcrumb worth exploring.)
The crypto industry — at least its asset management segment — cheered this latest presidential order granting crypto managers access to a $12 trillion pool of very sticky U.S. investment money. CoinDesk's coverage included industry reactions like this from Bitwise's Matt Hougan: ""This order isn't about the government saying 'crypto belongs in 401(k)s.' It's about the government getting out of the way and letting people make their own decisions.""
Herein lies the problem: most people who participate in 401k plans don't make their own decisions, or do so hastily. In fact, there is a law in place to make sure participants don't have to decide at all.
The Pension Protection Act of 2006 solved a thorny problem for employers: what to do when 401k participants don't choose their own investments. Previously, employers faced potential liability for any default investment that performed poorly. The act gives employers safe harbor protection if they make default elections a ""Qualified Default Investment Alternative"" (QDIA) — usually a target-date or balanced fund. HR departments no longer had to worry about being sued for picking the ""wrong"" default option.
While this solved the employer liability problem, it created an opportunity for folks to neglect one of the most important investment decisions of their lives. Participants typically join their 401k during the chaos of starting a new job — dealing with health insurance, taxes, onboarding and actually learning the job. Faced with investment choices they don't understand, many simply go with the flow and accept whatever default option their employer has selected, often a target-date fund with a retirement date that roughly matches their age. The glidepath concept — automatically shifting from stocks to bonds as retirement approaches — creates a false sense of security. Participants assume they're ""all set"" simply by not opting out, and never revisit the decision. Years or decades may pass.",4de2e0ca490d706c1c22335e1df01496,trafilatura,2670,0

Experts recommend that you increase the proportion of bonds relative to stocks in your portfolio as you age. The reason is simple: Bonds, especially Treasury bonds, are far less volatile than stocks. In a market downturn, bonds historically fall much less sharply than stocks or may even rise as investors seek out safe investments. They can also provide an income stream in retirement.

But the day of the week on which you buy your bonds may make a difference. Some retirees are buying bonds on Friday instead of Thursday — here’s why.
Which Day of the Week Is Best for Bonds?
In an analysis of long-term treasury bond purchases from 2002 to mid-2025, Quantified Strategies found that Fridays have historically been the best day for bonds. The average daily return for bonds on a Friday was 0.05%, compared to a -0.02% return on Thursdays.
The research also shows that Tuesday is also a good day to buy bonds, particularly if Monday is a down day. On a Tuesday following a down Monday, bonds returned an average of 0.06%.

The Benefits of Bonds
There are two main benefits of bonds in your portfolio. They provide income, which can stay in your account or be used to supplement social security and other forms of retirement income. And they can lower the volatility in your portfolio, which is important for retirees. Let’s look at these two benefits in more detail.
Income From Bonds
When you buy a bond, you are loaning money to a corporation or a government entity. In exchange, the issuer of the bond pays you interest periodically. When the bond matures, you get your principal payment back. The interest you received over time is your return on the investment.
Here’s an example. Suppose you purchase a $1,000 bond that pays 4% interest for ten years. You’ll get $40 in interest each year, usually paid twice a year. During the ten years you own the bond, you’ll get $400 total in interest — that’s your return on your investment. At the end of ten years, you’ll get back the $1,000 you paid for the bond.
Before you retire, you can reinvest the income you earn from bonds to increase the size of your nest egg. Once you stop working, you can use the income from bonds to supplement your social security, pension or other retirement income stream.",b61dd26a337fff2a0d00bf1bce6e9e9f,trafilatura,2661,0

Roughly half of OKB will be burned, permanently removing it from circulation on Aug. 15.
-
The broader cryptocurrency market is experiencing significant investor enthusiasm as coins trade near all-time highs and the crypto exchange Bullish has its IPO today.
The crypto token OKB (CRYPTO: OKB) is exploding today, up 121.8% in the last 24 hours as of 3:45 p.m. ET, having gained as much as 192.3% earlier in that period. The jump comes as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were relatively flat.
The native token of the cryptocurrency exchange OKX, OKB just saw its supply cut in half in what is one of the largest token burns in crypto history.
Massive token burn drives OKB higher
OKX will execute a one-time burn of roughly 65.26 million OKB tokens worth about 7.6 billion by sending them to an unreachable wallet. This will effectively cut the total supply of OKB in circulation by 52% and permanently cap it at 21 million.
The token price immediately soared after OKX announced the move, from about $46 to a high of $142 before retreating to its current level of about $104. Trading volume spiked 13,000% as holders tried to capitalize on the upcoming supply shock.
The burn is part of a larger move by OKX to move its operations from Ethereum's primary blockchain and onto its native L2 layer called X Layer. The move will help cut costs and speed up transactions.
The token is also benefiting from broader bullish sentiment in crypto, driven by today's massive IPO of the Peter Thiel-backed exchange, Bullish.
Don't count on this to continue
A burn of this scale is not going to happen again, and investors shouldn't jump into OKB expecting another one to follow. I would avoid buying this crypto and many niche altcoins like it. For investors looking for exposure to crypto, stick to the ""OGs"" like Ethereum and Bitcoin.

Grant Cardone isn’t mincing words when it comes to how young people should build wealth, and Bitcoin isn’t at the top of his list.
Speaking on TheStreet Roundtable with host Scott Melker, Cardone said the first priority for anyone starting out should be investing in themselves, building their personal brand, and creating a cash-flowing business before touching crypto.
“You’re the business,” Cardone said. “Whether you call yourself a business or not, you’re in the business of being you. And if people don’t see you as a dependable, consistent, solution-oriented person, money’s never coming to you. Opportunity’s not coming to you.”
Join the discussion with CryptoWendyO on Roundtable here.
Once that foundation is set, he says the focus should be all-in on a single income-producing vehicle, not scattering small bets across multiple investments. And for the Bitcoin faithful, Cardone delivered the part that might sting:
“I would not say that one thing for a kid… I don’t believe the first thing should be Bitcoin for those kids,” Cardone said. “I think it should be something that provides cash flow, and they convert the cash flow to Bitcoin. Because if the Bitcoin blows up, you need something to rely on to take care of your bills. I can’t eat Bitcoin.”
Grant Cardone is a self-made real estate mogul, sales trainer, and motivational speaker whose empire spans multiple industries. He is the founder of Cardone Capital, a real estate investment firm that manages billions of dollars in multifamily properties across the United States. Beyond his portfolio, Cardone has built a global brand through his books, sales training programs, and high-energy conferences, attracting entrepreneurs, investors, and ambitious professionals looking to scale their income and influence.

Often described as a straight-talking hustler, Cardone is known for his unapologetically aggressive approach to business and investing. He preaches the “10X Rule” — the idea that people should set goals 10 times bigger than they think possible and take massive action to achieve them. This no-nonsense style, combined with his knack for turning personal branding into revenue, has made him a polarizing but undeniable force in the worlds of entrepreneurship and personal finance.

The 10-year-old startup has started testing its food delivery service in three primary localities in the southern city of Bengaluru, namely Byrasandra, Tavarekere, and Madiwala (BTM) Layout, Hosur Sarjapura Road (HSR) Layout, and Koramangala, Rapido co-founder and CEO Aravind Sanka confirmed to TechCrunch.
Rapido created a wholly owned subsidiary Ctrlx Technologies to launch its food delivery service, named Ownly. The subsidiary lists Sanka and Rapido vice president of finance Vivek Krishna as the directors, per the regulatory filings reviewed by TechCrunch.
Sanka said there was no specific reason for setting up the subsidiary. However, it may be a strategic move to avoid potential conflicts of interest with Swiggy, which currently holds a 12% minority stake in the ride-hailing startup.
Swiggy recently confirmed in a letter to shareholders that it would reevaluate its investment in Rapido, citing a potential conflict of interest “that may arise in the future.”
Meanwhile, Rapido’s Ownly has also released its Android app on Google Play that offers food from nearby restaurants at around 15% lower prices than those on Swiggy and Zomato.
The lower pricing is a result of Rapido’s model of not taking commissions from restaurants, which are up to 30% in the case of other food delivery apps, including Swiggy and Zomato, and instead charging a fixed fee per order. The startup mentioned its fixed-fee approach in a proposal to restaurants in June.
Rapido has a fleet of around 10 million vehicles, including 5 to 6 million two-wheelers, across India, a person familiar with the startup’s business told TechCrunch recently. The company is using its two-wheeler fleet to deliver food — alongside offering its taxi and courier services.
Rapido will avoid showing restaurants located far from customers to reduce fuel costs and delivery times, and will curate menu items on its app to maximize margins while offering enough discoverability, a Rapido investor told TechCrunch on condition of anonymity.

-
U.S. retail sales increased by 0.5% in July, aligning with economists' expectations.
-
July’s figures represent a slowdown from June spending levels, which were revised higher in this month’s report.
-
Auto dealers and online retailers saw some of the most significant increases in July, while spending at restaurants and bars dipped.
Consumer spending slowed down slightly in July, but the data showed that people are still making automobile purchases and shopping online even amid tariff pressures.
“Consumers maintain a moderate rate of spending and even picked up the pace in the past two months as the tariff-price pass-through has been limited thus far,” wrote Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic.
Census Bureau data showed that July retail sales were $726.3 billion, a 0.5% increase from the prior month. This was a slowdown from the June data, which was revised higher to show a 0.9% increase, but it was in line with economists' projections.
“The solid increase in retail sales in July and upward revisions to past months indicate consumers are down but not out this year,” wrote Michael Pearce, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.
Car Sales, Prime Day Help Drive July Increases
Auto dealers saw a 1.6% increase in sales, while furniture retailers saw sales similarly higher. This comes as some economists are watching for tariff impacts on car sales and companies report lower furniture demand.
“After tariff distortions to auto purchases earlier in the year, consumers have returned to auto showrooms ready to buy,” wrote Bostjancic in a commentary.
A 0.8% increase in nonstore retailer sales includes results from e-commerce firms like Amazon, which held its annual Prime Day sales event in July. Miscellaneous store retailers showed the steepest decline in sales, while the restaurant and bar sales, a measure of discretionary spending, also ticked lower.
The data also detailed stronger retail sales results from June, which reflected a bounce back in spending after sales dropped in May. Economists closely follow retail sales as a measure of consumer spending because it makes up about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
“In a world where there are plenty of macro-related worries tied to inflation and employment, consumers are still out there spending,” said Bret Kenwell, eToro U.S. investment analyst. “Retailers will start reporting earnings next week, which should provide more insights into consumer behavior.”
Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD) are among a string of retailers on next week’s corporate earnings calendar.

Dive Brief:
-
Bojangles is coming back to New York City after a nearly four-decade absence, thanks to a 20-unit franchising agreement the chicken chain signed with Habib Hashimi, according to a Wednesday press release.
-
The first unit under the agreement is in construction in East Flatbush, a neighborhood in Brooklyn, and is expected to open during the winter. The remaining units will be built over the next 10 years.
-
The New York deal will help the Southern brand establish a major foothold in the Northeast just as its competitor Zaxby’s looks to expand into Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
Dive Insight:
Bojangles, like other chicken chains, has grown steadily in recent years, with its unit count rising from 773 at the start of 2022 to 825 at the end of 2024, per its franchise disclosure document. The New York City market will provide high foot traffic and dense urban neighborhoods, which the chain said is ideal for introducing the brand’s Southern flavors to an entirely new audience.
Hashimi brings significant experience operating QSRs in New York and Connecticut, according to the press release.
Bojangles also signed a 35-unit deal to open locations in New Jersey with an unspecified franchisee, according to the press release, which gives it a development target of about 55 units in the Northeast.
The brand has relatively strong unit economics, according to its FDD, with average gross sales of about $2.4 million at its full-sized franchised locations, which comprise a majority of its store base.
The increase in demand for chicken overall has helped propel growth across concepts spanning a wide range of culinary traditions. Korean chain Bonchon is looking to more than triple its U.S. unit count. Filipino chicken brand Jollibee has also announced ambitious franchising plans. The growth of Dave’s Hot Chicken — a California brand with a menu anchored around a Nashville specialty — attracted a major investment from Roark Capital earlier this year. Raising Cane’s and Wingstop saw their sales surpass KFC in the U.S. last year.
Bojangles has carved out a menu niche for itself with a Southern menu and a focus on breakfast. The chain’s FDD shows its full-size company-owned restaurants, a useful proxy for its franchise units, see about 36% of their sales in the breakfast daypart. According to the FDD, the chain targets locations “with direct access to a major ‘going-to-work’ traffic artery, in order to benefit from Bojangles’ significant breakfast business.”",12e60dd5c2c28ea509703d22609a3045,trafilatura,2637,0

(NASDAQ:INTC) gained Friday after Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration is weighing taking a stake in the chipmaker, following a meeting between President Donald Trump and CEO Lip-Bu Tan.
Jim Cramer said Intel’s weak balance sheet makes a potential government stake critical to finishing projects that former CEO Pat Gelsinger couldn’t fund.
Tim Seymour of Seymour Asset Management warned that nationalizing a company is “not conventional” and has historically sparked sell-offs, but acknowledged the political and strategic backdrop behind Trump’s potential investment in Intel’s long-delayed Ohio fab.

Intel shares rose in after-hours trading Monday after President Donald Trump softened his stance following a White House meeting with CEO Lip-Bu Tan, whom he had urged to resign last week over alleged China ties.
Cramer had earlier criticized Intel’s $18.8 billion foundry loss in 2024 despite $8.5 billion in U.S. subsidies, questioning the viability of domestic chipmaking and warning investors to sell the stock as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) gain ground.
Intel’s 18A process has hit yield issues, threatening its ability to profitably produce advanced chips and undermining efforts to close the gap with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM).
The setback comes as rivals gain ground, while Intel faces internal headwinds, including multiple senior executive departures, a workforce reduction targeting thousands of positions, and the delay of its long-touted Ohio fab project into the 2030s.
Fitch downgraded Intel’s credit rating, citing uncertain profitability in its foundry pivot, operational turbulence from leadership instability, and the mounting impact of missed timelines.
Intel stock gained 23% year-to-date, topping the NASDAQ 100 Index’s over 13% returns. Intel stock dropped over 9% after second-quarter results showed a revenue beat on tariff-related pull-ins but weak margins and cautious guidance. Management forecasts that the third-quarter revenue will be $13.1B, above consensus, but the gross margin guidance of 36% lagged expectations.
Analysts flagged persistent competitive pressure from AMD and Arm (NASDAQ:ARM), Intel’s lack of an AI pipeline, and a capex-heavy manufacturing model. Benchmark warned Intel may need years to improve design and manufacturing competitiveness. At the same time, Bank of America Securities, Rosenblatt, and Needham said the turnaround remains slow despite stronger-than-expected first-half sales.",66e1b9084e0a10677edae94a3446eb65,trafilatura,2636,0

Shares of Edwards Lifesciences rose 5.5% following its Q2 2025 results on Jul. 24, with adjusted EPS of $0.67 and sales of $1.5 billion, both exceeding estimates and showing strong year-over-year growth. Segment strength was led by TAVR sales of $1.1 billion, TMTT sales of $134.5 million, and Surgical Structural Heart sales of $267 million. The company also raised its 2025 sales growth guidance to $5.90 billion - $6.10 billion and projected adjusted EPS at the high end of $2.40 - $2.50.

Morgan Stanley on Tuesday raised its long-term nuclear energy investment forecast, which it now expects will total $2.2 trillion through 2050, from $1.5 trillion last year.
-
Nuclear power providers like Talen Energy, Public Service Enterprise Group, and Vistra stand to benefit from surging AI demand, limited nuclear capacity, and federal support, according to equity analyst David Arcaro.
The world is having a “nuclear renaissance,” according to Morgan Stanley, and the opportunity for investors is ample.
The pace of nuclear capacity expansion has only increased since last year, according to the firm's analysts. Morgan Stanley now expects investment in nuclear energy to total $2.2 trillion through 2050, up from last year’s forecast of $1.5 trillion.
Morgan Stanley divides nuclear-exposed stocks into three categories: power generators, uranium miners, and equipment and plant providers. The firm’s three favorite U.S. stocks to play the nuclear theme all fall into the first category: Talen Energy (TLN), Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG), and Vistra (VST).
What's Driving the 'Nuclear Renaissance'?
“The dual imperatives of decarbonization and energy security, combined with a gradual decline in investor exclusions and more favorable financing conditions, are making the nuclear renaissance a truly global investment theme,” wrote Morgan Stanley analysts on Tuesday.
President Donald Trump has made energy security a central theme of his second term. In May, Trump set the goal of growing America’s nuclear energy capacity to 400 gigawatts in 2050 from about 100GW today. The president signed several executive orders aiming to expedite the expansion and construction of U.S. nuclear capacity.
Investors around the world have become more open to nuclear energy. As of December 2024, Morgan Stanley wrote, 2.3% of global [assets under management] were subject to an exclusion policy regarding nuclear power—less than for alcohol, military contracting or gambling.
And The World Bank recently lifted its ban on financing nuclear power projects, which the firm said could set the stage for other international lenders to follow.
Morgan Stanley's Three Top Nuclear-Stock Picks
Artificial intelligence is one of the core reasons Morgan Stanley’s preferred U.S. nuclear stocks—Talen, Vistra, and Public Service Enterprise Group—are all power generators.
Artificial intelligence consumes a lot of energy, and nuclear power offers AI companies stable prices, reliability, and efficiency. Morgan Stanley said it believes the market currently underappreciates these long-term benefits, but tech giants don’t.",e01e5a28e185e05d93ac713b2a6408bc,trafilatura,2630,0

The company reported second-quarter sales of $5.7 million, up by 573.0% year-over-year, topping the analyst consensus estimate of $2.3 million.
However, it struggled for profitability, reporting quarterly EPS loss of $1.67, beating the analyst consensus estimate loss of $3.98.

Cost of sales rose 78.8% to $13.1 million. Loss from operations improved to $(14.5) million from $(20.5) million a year ago.
As of June 30, 2025, the company held $2.2 million in cash and equivalents.
Workhorse CEO Rick Dauch noted the company shipped a record 32 trucks in the quarter, fueled by the strong performance of its W56 step vans.
Dauch said the company also reached an agreement to merge with Motiv Electric Trucks to form a leading North American medium-duty electric truck OEM.
Workhorse and Motiv Electric Trucks signed a definitive all-stock merger agreement to form a leading North American medium-duty electric truck OEM valued at approximately $105 million.
Under the deal, Motiv's controlling investor will own about 62.5% of the combined company, Workhorse shareholders will hold roughly 26.5%, and Workhorse's senior secured lender will have rights to about 11% on a fully diluted basis, all subject to adjustments and future dilution.
Workhorse merged a newly created subsidiary with Motiv in exchange for newly issued Workhorse common shares. Certain Motiv stockholders who held its debt agreed to cancel those obligations in exchange for Workhorse equity.
Alongside the merger, Workhorse completed a $20 million sale-leaseback of its Union City, Indiana, manufacturing plant and secured $5 million in convertible note financing from entities tied to Motiv's controlling investor, providing near-term liquidity and enabling partial debt repayment.
At closing, Workhorse will repay or cancel all remaining obligations to its senior secured lender, leaving only the $5 million secured convertible note held by Motiv's controlling investor, which could convert to equity in a post-closing financing.
Motiv's controlling investor also committed to provide $20 million in debt financing at closing, $10 million via a revolving credit facility and $10 million in an ABL facility for manufacturing costs tied to confirmed orders.
The combined company plans to expand its Class 4-6 truck lineup, leverage scale to lower unit costs, and pursue additional equity financing to support strategic execution.",1c02000b9d5c7b58a43a397a27dcfa55,trafilatura,2629,0

""We think the Apple story could be turning the corner,"" analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a Thursday note. To back this up, Woodring pointed to potentially stronger-than-expected iPhone builds in China and the possibility for estimates to be revised higher, which will allow the stock's multiple to expand and drive shares up. Morgan Stanley's China team recently raised its iPhone builds estimate for September by 8%, saying iPhone sales were stronger than expected in the June quarter, which means supply will need to be replenished. ""These positive revisions are a result of better than expected iPhone sell-through in the June quarter, which reduced iPhone channel inventory below normalized levels, and thus created a larger channel fill opportunity in the September quarter, as the positive build revision is entirely iPhone 16 (2M units) and Pro Max (2M units) models,"" he said. Woodring said this more upbeat forecast is baked into its estimates already, but it could imply more upside ahead in the December quarter, which is typically more volatile than the September period. ""Relative to our current 78M December quarter iPhone shipment forecast, this could imply modest iPhone shipment upside, though we'll be able to narrow this range next month when the iPhone 17 is officially launched,"" he said. Apple has yet to fully roll out Apple Intelligence, its full suite of artificial intelligence integration. Functions like an updated Siri with AI integration has been delayed several times since it was first announced last year. Apple is expected to announce the details of its new iPhone next month. ""We are turning more bullish – forward iPhone unit/revenue growth expectations are still relatively muted, many of the same factors that got us bullish last July remain (elongated replacement cycles/pent up iPhone demand, new form factors in the pipeline, structural gross margin tailwinds, etc.), we're past peak tariff risk (Section 232 is a non-event), regulation is not as significant of a near-term headwind as feared (though remains a long-term risk), pricing is an underappreciated lever that Apple can pull for both Product and Services (Apple hasn't raise Services prices in 2 years), and relative to the S & P, Apple is trading in-line with the trailing 5 year average,"" the analyst said. Apple shares have pulled back more than 7% in 2025. The analyst said most institutions are actually underweight Apple compared with its peer megacap technology stocks.

SoftBank is seeking a valuation for PayPay of ¥1.5 trillion ($10 billion) or more, according to people familiar with the matter, who declined to be named as discussion isn’t public. If the plans go ahead, it may be the largest IPO for a Japanese company on a US stock exchange, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
SoftBank Corp., which owns a stake in PayPay, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours. Its parent SoftBank Group, as well as PayPay, declined to comment on the valuation.
PayPay, the country’s dominant QR-code payments application, was originally set up through a venture with former Vision Fund portfolio company Paytm. A transaction last year valued the Japanese firm at around $7 billion at that time, according to local media reports.
The exact schedule, size, and price for the public listing of PayPay’s American depositary receipts are yet to be decided, SoftBank said in a statement Friday. The feasibility of a listing is subject to market and other conditions, and is contingent on the completion of SEC’s review, it said.
SoftBank has been recently working to monetize some of its assets and Vision Fund bets to finance Masayoshi Son’s new investments in artificial intelligence. This includes an additional sale of $3 billion worth of shares in T-Mobile US Inc.
Reuters earlier this month reported that the Japanese company has picked investment banks for PayPay’s US IPO.
PayPay will continue to be a subsidiary of SoftBank Corp. following the public offering and the Japanese conglomerate doesn’t expect the listing to have any material impact on its consolidated earnings, the statement said.

Cisco Systems, long anchored in its networking hardware business—selling routers, switches, and other infrastructure products—has repositioned itself to meet surging enterprise demand for AI infrastructure. Its new chief financial officer, Mark Patterson, is now at the center of that strategy.
The San Jose–based communications giant (No. 83 on the Fortune 500) reported earnings on Wednesday for its fiscal fourth quarter and year that ended on July 26. AI infrastructure orders from webscale customers reached more than $800 million in Q4, bringing fiscal 2025’s total to over $2 billion—more than double the $1 billion target first set in Q4 fiscal 2024.
Quarterly revenue came in at $14.7 billion, up 8% from a year earlier and slightly ahead of the $14.62 billion analysts expected.
“In Q4, revenue, gross margin and operating margin were at the high end of our guidance ranges, earnings per share was above the guidance range, and we delivered solid operating cash flow,” Patterson said on Wednesday’s earnings call.
A 25-year Cisco veteran, Patterson became EVP and CFO on July 27, succeeding Scott Herren, who held the role since December 2020 and retired this summer. Herren is credited with helping shift Cisco’s business mix toward software and recurring revenue.
In recent years, particularly since 2024, Cisco has made a strategic pivot to position itself as the networking backbone for AI infrastructure. In 2024, it closed its $28 billion all-cash acquisition of Splunk, a cybersecurity and analytics firm that uses AI and machine learning, and rolled out Hypershield, an AI-native system that embeds security into every software component and application running on networks, from servers to public and private clouds.
Over his long career at Cisco, Patterson has held leadership roles in finance, strategy, and operations, as well as more than a decade in sales covering every customer segment and geography. Most recently, he served as chief strategy officer before stepping into the CFO position.
“As I look ahead, we have significant opportunities—whether in AI infrastructure for the webscale space, the nascent but growing enterprise AI market, or the buildout of neo-clouds and sovereign AI,” Patterson said on Wednesday’s earnings call, his first as CFO.
Strengthening cybersecurity through Splunk, advancing campus modernization, maintaining disciplined financing, and ensuring sustainable growth and shareholder value are also on his agenda.
“What I really want to do is make sure we’re funded for success,” he said. “You can expect that I will focus on durable, profitable growth.”",039a7542ae8e45e82bdc5b06da8202b7,trafilatura,2623,0

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian employment rebounded in July as firms took on more full-time workers, data showed on Thursday, pulling the jobless rate down from a 3-1/2 year high and calming concerns the labour market was about to fall over.
The upbeat report implied there was less urgency for the Reserve Bank of Australia to follow up this week's rate cut with another in September, and nudged the local dollar up 0.3% to a two-week high at $0.6566.
Yet policy makers have indicated more easing is likely should inflation continue to cool as expected and markets remain fully priced for a further quarter point easing to 3.35% in November.
""The data are reassuring in that they suggest conditions are not deteriorating quickly,"" Sean Langcake, Head of Macroeconomic Forecasting for Oxford Economics Australia.
""Nevertheless, weak economic momentum and global uncertainty will be strong headwinds for the labour market to overcome through the rest of the year.""
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed net employment rose 24,500 in July from June, when it added a meagre 1,000. That was dead in line with market forecasts, while full-time jobs more than recovered a June drop with a jump of 60,500.
In a relief for the economic outlook, the jobless rate eased back to 4.2%, from 4.3%, which had been the highest reading since November 2021. The participation rate ticked down to 67.0%, while hours worked rose 0.3% after a pullback in June.
The ABS noted female full-time jobs jumped by 40,000 in July and their participation rate rose a record high of 63.5%.
The central bank had expected unemployment to rise to around 4.3% this quarter, which is still low by historical standards, and stay there for the foreseeable future.
Leading indicators of labour demand have been solid with vacancies still almost 50% above pre-pandemic levels, while there were 1.8 unemployed per vacancy compared to 3.1 back in early 2020.
Business surveys are generally upbeat and consumer spending has picked up in the last couple of months as lower borrowing costs and past tax cuts feed through to incomes.
RBA Governor Michele Bullock has also flagged the likelihood of at least another 50 basis points of total easing should core inflation continue to moderate from its current 2.7% pace to the mid-point of the central bank's target band of 2% to 3%.
While unemployment is low, there is little sign of wages being an inflationary threat with annual pay growth holding at 3.4% in the second quarter, well below its 2023 peak of 4.2%.

Zelle says James’ office, which accused its parent Early Warning Services in a lawsuit Wednesday of enabling fraud by doing next to nothing to stop it, is engaging in nothing more than a “political stunt to generate press.” The heated exchange made for exciting, Billions-style drama, but more importantly, offered a look at the state of clampdowns on Corporate America in 2025 and beyond.

New York State of Mind
Zelle was launched in 2017 as an alternative to peer-to-peer payment platforms like PayPal and its subsidiary Venmo, with the selling point being that it was backed by the weight of the country’s top consumer banks. Bank of America, Truist, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank, U.S. Bank, and Wells Fargo jointly own its parent, and some 2,200 financial institutions allow customers to use Zelle directly through their app or services.
It’s not an understatement to say that, with access to the enormous customer base of all these financial institutions, Zelle has taken off. Last year, the network topped $1 trillion in person-to-person transactions, a 27% year-over-year increase, while its user base grew 12% to 151 million accounts. That was the most in P2P transactions for any payments service in a single year — PayPal, by comparison, reported $400 billion in P2P payments in 2024. But Zelle’s astronomical growth, the state Attorney General’s Office alleged, coincided with negligent loopholes the size of the Milky Way Galaxy:
-
New York’s lawsuit claims Zelle’s registration process was missing verification steps, which it alleges EWS and its bank backers were aware contributed to fraud amounting to roughly $1 billion, “for years.” James is seeking restitution and damages based on the claim that scammers stole more than $1 billion from Zelle users from 2017 to 2023, and is asking for a court order requiring Zelle to put anti-fraud measures in place.
-
Zelle, rebuffing the lawsuit, said the Attorney General’s Office did not conduct an investigation of its platform and argued the claims are meritless. “Had they conducted an investigation, they would have learned that more than 99.95% of all Zelle transactions are completed without any report of scam or fraud — which leads the industry,” a spokesperson said.",dcb9e69f2048461723dd231970969454,trafilatura,2617,0

A top regulator in New York state is unhappy with a payment service offered by the bank.
-
It has filed a lawsuit against Zelle.
A popular payment system offered by Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) came under some legal fire on Wednesday, and more than a few investors scuttled out of the bank. This left the lender's stock with a 2% loss on the day, during an otherwise generally upbeat session in which the S&P 500 index bumped 0.3% higher.
Headed to court?
That flame was lit by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who has brought a lawsuit against the popular Zelle payment service. The suit accuses Zelle of falling short in efforts to protect its many users from fraud.
James' office wrote in a press release that an investigation it conducted found that Zelle's operator, a company called Early Warning Systems (EWS), ""designed Zelle without critical safety features, allowing scammers to easily target users and steal over $1 billion between 2017 and 2023.""
""EWS knew from the beginning that key features of the Zelle network made it uniquely susceptible to fraud, and yet it failed to adopt basic safeguards to address these glaring flaws or enforce any meaningful anti-fraud rules on its partner banks,"" the Attorney General's team added.
EWS is owned and controlled by a consortium of seven of the top American banks and financial services purveyors. In addition to Wells Fargo, its ownership structure includes JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Capital One Financial.
Accusing the accuser
A Reuters report on the matter quoted Zelle's statement that ""This lawsuit is a political stunt to generate press, not progress. The Attorney General should focus on the hard facts, stopping criminal activity and adherence to the law, not overreach and meritless claims.""
Still, this doesn't help the reputation of Zelle and, by extension, the banks behind it. I don't think this is a make-or-break for Wells Fargo stock. However, it's a development that's surely worth watching.

ASL Airlines Ireland, one of five airlines ASL airlines based in Europe, will begin operating the first A330 on Saudia Cargo’s behalf early in the fourth quarter.
ASL is leasing the A330-300 from U.S.-based Air Transport Services Group, which paid Elbe Flugzeugwerke, a joint venture between Airbus and Singapore-based ST Engineering, to change the used aircraft from passenger configuration to an all-cargo one. The aircraft originally was in service with Taiwan-based China Airlines, according to database Planespotters.
The first cargo jet arrived at Shannon Airport in Dublin in mid-June where it was painted in the Saudia Cargo livery. ASL Airlines Ireland is in the process of reintroducing the A330 to its air operators certificate and obtaining approvals for operating specifications. The second A330 will undergo similar steps before entering service with Saudia later in the fourth quarter.
The A330-300s will supplement ASL Ireland’s existing fleet of Boeing 737-800 converted cargo jets and ATR 72 turboprops.
ASL Ireland ceased flying A330s earlier this year for DHL under an arrangement in which DHL provided the aircraft and ASL provided crews, maintenance and insurance. DHL this year has culled some of its airline partners as it adjusts capacity around the world in response to shifting transportation demand and cost pressures. The wet lease with Saudia Cargo covers all aspects of operating the aircraft — including the airframe.

Two analysts weighed in with fresh takes on the company.
-
One initiated coverage with a buy, and the other upped his price target.
The stock market was hardly sour on Lemonade (NYSE: LMND) stock on Wednesday. On the back of two positive analysts moves on the next-generation insurer, its share price zoomed to an over 9% gain during that day's trading session. In reaching that height it blew past the S&P 500 index, which only mustered a 0.3% increase.
Boosting the buy case
Of the pair, one was an initiation of coverage, and the other a price target increase by a researcher that's been following Lemonade stock for some time.
The initiating individual was Cantor Fitzgerald's Ryan Tunis, who after market close Tuesday launched coverage of Lemonade with an overweight (buy, in other words) recommendation. Tunis set his price target at $60 per share for the stock.
The following day, Jefferies' Andrew Andersen raised his existing price target on the shares. He now believes they are worth $37 apiece, quite some distance north of his previous $30 estimation. That was the good news for Lemonade; the bad is that Andersen left his underperform (sell) rating unchanged.
According to reports, the analyst's bump was due in no small to the company's higher premium retention; this should spur revenue growth for the company. On the down side, Andersen expressed concern that Lemonade was taking on more leverage, an activity that can hamper fundamentals if not managed effectively.
Not yet tasting good
While Lemonade is an innovative company in numerous ways, personally I'd be concerned about its propensity for bottom-line losses. Until and when it can prove that it can not only book a profit but do so with some consistency, I will remain wary of the stock.

Standard Chartered has increased its base-case forecast for Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) to $7,500 by the end of 2025, citing stronger-than-expected demand from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and heightened on-chain activity.
What Happened: The new projection comes less than two months after the bank outlined an $8,000–$9,000 bull case, which it now frames as upside potential rather than the central scenario.
In a note to clients, Geoff Kendrick, the bank's head of FX Research West and Digital Assets Research, said, ""We think Ethereum will continue to benefit from the positive feedback loop between price, on-chain activity, and investor inflows.""
Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.
He added that the updated forecast reflects ""higher-than-expected ETF inflows and stronger on-chain activity.""
The revision follows a period of accelerating institutional inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs.
Data from SoSo Value shows that on Aug. 12 alone, the funds recorded $524 million in net inflows, marking six consecutive days of gains.
BlackRock's (NASDAQ:ETHA) ETF accounted for $319 million of that total.
Spot Bitcoin ETFs also drew $65.94 million on the day, extending their own streak to five days.
Standard Chartered now estimates ETF holdings could reach between 2.39 million and 9.15 million ETH by the end of 2025, equivalent to 2%–8% of the circulating supply.
Such accumulation could tighten market liquidity and amplify price movements, especially when combined with staking.
Kendrick noted the potential for a ""super-squeeze"" if ETF inflows and staking remove more supply from circulation than expected.

Why It Matters: Ethereum’s rally has brought it within striking distance of its November 2021 all-time high of around $4,878.
In the previous bull market, Ethereum surged over 500% from its 2020 lows to its 2021 peak, while in 2017 it climbed more than 9,000% from trough to top.
Standard Chartered expects Ethereum's broader application scope, spanning decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenization, and smart contracts, to help it outperform Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) over the next 18 months.
""Ethereum's broader use case set supports a higher ETH/BTC price ratio,"" Kendrick wrote. The bank also expects staking yields to remain attractive to investors, further supporting the asset's appeal.",17f80dcc3785aaa6c2fb6f310ca8f077,trafilatura,2605,0

MSQ Partners said it was “surprised” by a recent announcement from Sir Martin’s S4 Capital following a report by Sky News that claimed it had received an approach about a possible merger.
S4 said discussions were at a “very preliminary stage”, but insisted any deal would be structured as a takeover of MSQ by S4.
In an update to the stock exchange, MSQ said its board of directors had not been in any talks or considered any proposals.
The ad firm – which counts Diageo, Unilever and Vodafone among its clients – acknowledged that informal conversations may have taken place between its largest shareholder One Equity Partners (OEP) and S4.
But it said: “For the avoidance of doubt, neither OEP nor MSQ intend to pursue further discussions regarding the rumoured transaction.”
The company added: “MSQ remains focused on and confident in its primarily organic growth strategy, which has delivered consistent revenue and ebitda [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation] growth over a 15-year period and two of the most successful private equity exits in the marcomms [marketing communications] sector over recent years.”
The knock-back will deal an embarrassing blow to Sir Martin, who is looking to revive his struggling ad firm.
The 80-year-old tycoon oversaw a period of rapid growth at S4, which he founded following his acrimonious departure from WPP.
But the digital ad company has been buffeted by wider economic malaise as brands cut back spending. Its exposure to major tech clients such as Google and Amazon has left it particularly vulnerable to the slowdown.
S4 has also been hit by accounting blunders that forced it to delay its financial results twice, while it has issued a string of profit warnings in recent years after failing to meet its own lofty revenue targets.
Shares in the London-listed company have collapsed by more than 90pc with its market value now standing at roughly £135m, down from a peak of £5bn in 2021.
S4 has embarked on a heavy programme of cost-cutting, including slashing hundreds of roles. The company posted a loss of £307m last year after taking a £280m write-down owing to tough trading conditions.
Its struggles come amid deep-seated challenges for traditional advertising companies as tech rivals gain a stranglehold over the online market and as artificial intelligence (AI) threatens to upend their business models.
This has fuelled speculation of a wave of consolidation across the industry.",ea913efa39efcb356aeca166acf5a40f,trafilatura,2603,0

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Foxconn on Thursday forecast a significant rise in third-quarter revenue as the world's biggest iPhone maker said it had for the first time made more money from its AI server business than from smart electronics last quarter.
The company said artificial intelligence server revenue is expected to leap more than 170% year-on-year in the coming quarter, though it also warned of uncertainty from U.S. tariffs.
Nvidia's biggest server maker and Apple's top iPhone assembler has been riding a data centre boom, as cloud computing firms such as Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet's Google spend billions of dollars to expand their AI infrastructure and research capacity.
Cloud and networking products, which include servers, accounted for 41% of its revenue in the second quarter, while smart consumer products represented 35%, the company said.
The contribution from the server business to its revenue is set to grow further in the current quarter, as Foxconn expects a slight decline in smart consumer electronics revenue. Some experts expect iPhone sales to slow after they surged in the June quarter ahead of the expected imposition of U.S. tariffs.
""AI has been the primary growth driver so far this year,"" Kathy Yang, rotating CEO of Foxconn, said on a call with media and analysts. She warned however that ""close attention is needed due to the impact of changes in tariffs and exchange rates"".
The company said on Thursday its capital spending would rise more than 20% this year, as it plans to boost server production capacity in its manufacturing sites in Texas and Wisconsin.
Global trade uncertainty and particularly the trade spat between the U.S. and China could dim its outlook this year as it has a major manufacturing presence in China, though Washington and Beijing this week extended a tariff truce for another 90 days.
Most of the iPhones Foxconn makes for Apple are assembled in China, but the bulk of those sold in the U.S. are now produced in India. The company is also building factories in Mexico and Texas to make AI servers for Nvidia.
LORDSTOWN SOLD
Foxconn has also been looking to expand its footprint in electric vehicles, which the company sees as a major future growth generator, though that has not always gone smoothly.
Earlier this month, Foxconn said it had struck a deal to sell a former car factory at Lordstown, Ohio, for $375 million that it purchased in 2022 to manufacture EVs.
However, it will continue to occupy the facility. The company said the Ohio plant would be used to manufacture cloud-related products.",53b37bf9072fe249d047f873b44a81e1,trafilatura,2595,0

XRP has benefited from the more lax regulatory environment.
-
The token runs on a strong network capable of processing hundreds, if not thousands, of transactions per second.
-
Ripple's CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, thinks XRP can start taking share from international payment transactions.
XRP (CRYPTO: XRP), the world's third-largest cryptocurrency, which has a market cap over $177 billion, recently passed $3. While the cryptocurrency continues to be volatile, XRP has had an epic run since President Donald Trump won the election last November, ushering in a new, more welcoming regulatory era for cryptocurrencies. XRP has benefited immensely. With the token hovering around the $3 level, as of this writing, is $4 on the horizon?
What could catapult XRP higher
One of the reasons XRP benefited from Trump's win so much is that the Trump administration installed new cabinet members to lead most regulatory agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In 2020, the SEC sued Ripple, the company behind XRP, and the company's co-founder and CEO for allegedly selling XRP as an unregistered security in 2013.
The case had implications for the crypto sector and cast a negative light on XRP. While it looked like Ripple was heading for victory in the case, new leadership at the SEC expedited a resolution. Other new regulations have paved the way for an eventual SEC-approved spot-XRP exchange-traded fund, which would likely improve liquidity and broaden institutional interest in XRP.
Ripple also continues to grow its business with mainstream banks and institutional traders. This year, the company acquired the prime brokerage Hidden Road, which it could use to integrate XRP within more mainstream finance activities. Furthermore, Ripple launched RLUSD, its own U.S.-dollar-backed stablecoin, which XRP serves as a bridge token for. A bridge token is a digital asset that allows for the transfer of value between different blockchain networks.
Another way for XRP to draw interest would be to continue to drive a compelling use case with its network. XRP can currently process 1,500 transactions per second (TPS), making it ideal for cross-border payments. Other crypto networks boast even higher TPS, but XRP has an interesting ecosystem around it with Ripple, which has onboarded large mainstream financial clients and now has another bridge to mainstream finance with Hidden Road. RLUSD could present another opportunity for increased usage, and Ripple's CEO Brad Garlinghouse is optimistic that XRP can take share from international payment transactions.",504d9ef8aef423eaf841495de8a7b374,trafilatura,2591,0

The firm believes Arm has revitalized itself after keeping out of the spotlight for years. The company has a big presence in the data center market and is now expanding into automotive.
“Historically, Arm was highly reliant on the mobile phone market. Mobile is still important, but the company has diversified widely beyond that. It now has considerable penetration in the data center. The company claims that 50% of data center servers now have some form of IP in them. This includes CPUs, AI head nodes, networking and other chips. This is up from 0% less than 10 years ago. We expect their penetration to grow both deeper (more substantial content) and wider (more deployments in coming years). The company also has considerable design traction in automotive, albeit on the very long time frames associated with that industry.""
An accountant in a suit entering the Federal Reserve with an arm full of U.S. Treasury securities.
""Overall, the company has roughly tripled its addressable market. The company has revamped the entry-level for its products. Three years ago, the company introduced a number of changes to its licensing terms which allowed smaller companies and start-ups to more readily access Arm IP. This has shored up the bottom end of the market which had been gradually shifting to ‘open source’ RISC V. Finally, Arm is attempting to move up the value chain by providing more complete designs for chips. This could be a strong way to increase value capture, but comes at the risk of infringing on the business of some of its licensees. Arm has been very vague about its ultimate ambitions in this space. There is some room here for the company to navigate this prospect, but as of now, its course remains unclear to us.”

Of the employees impacted, 145 were warehouse associates, while 15 focused on inventory control and quality assurance, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act Notice filed July 16. Ten were lead warehouse workers, and another eight were fulfillment operations managers.

All terminations will occur on Sept. 19, but a majority of the impacted employees have already accepted new roles at this facility and nearby locations, according to a Target spokesperson.
The 1.4-million-square-foot building itself will remain open, with the mass merchant’s regional replenishment operation within the facility not impacted. The replenishment area focuses on keeping inventory in supply to restock shelves at local stores, while the fulfillment area processes shipping orders.
Target first converted a 254,000-square-foot portion of the warehouse to a fulfillment space in 2019 as the retailer took on more online orders.
“As we continue to evolve our supply chain to deliver the ease, speed and value consumers expect, we are adjusting the types of operations performed at our Indianapolis Distribution Center and redistributing certain capabilities to other nearby facilities,” the Target spokesperson said. “These changes impact a limited number of team members who will have the opportunity to apply for different roles within the facility and at nearby locations.”
Target has increasingly leaned on its retail stores to fulfill more orders for same-day pickup and delivery, with stores fulfilling more than 96 percent of total sales in each of the last three years. The company is also scaling its network of sortation centers to 15 locations, which are positioned to help with last-mile delivery.
The affected employees are not represented by a union, so there are no bumping rights for senior members of the team.
The company did not list how many employees still work at the Indianapolis distribution center.
This is Target’s second WARN notice in three months regarding the elimination of warehouse jobs. On June 12, Target said it was laying off 62 employees at its Savannah, Ga. facility, with that site’s fulfillment operation also being discontinued.",69c988c82aa46181f86ac26787dad706,trafilatura,2588,0

In a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing on Thursday, Amedisys (NASDAQ:AMED) announced that UnitedHealth closed its home health and hospice provider acquisition.
UnitedHealth agreed to divest more than 160 healthcare facilities as part of a proposed settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to resolve antitrust concerns surrounding its $3.3 billion acquisition of Amedisys.
The insurance giant reported second-quarter adjusted earnings of $4.08, down from $6.80 a year ago, missing the consensus of $4.95. Revenues increased 13% year over year to $111.62 billion, missing the consensus of $111.69 billion.
UnitedHealth reestablished its fiscal year 2025 guidance, with adjusted earnings of at least $16 per share versus a consensus of $22.33 and sales guidance of $445.5 billion-$448 billion compared to the analyst estimate of $449.5 billion. In May, UnitedHealth suspended its 2025 performance outlook.
In July, UnitedHealth engaged with the Department of Justice following reports of ongoing investigations into its Medicare program participation.
The company said it has begun complying with the Department’s formal criminal and civil requests. UnitedHealth says it has full confidence in its practices and is committed to working cooperatively with the Department throughout this process.
Reuters reported that a cyberattack on UnitedHealth’s technology unit last year affected 192.7 million people, citing the U.S. health department data.
In January, the company had estimated the Change Healthcare breach impacted about 190 million people.

So far this month, spot Ethereum ETFs have attracted $2.3 billion—the equivalent of 500,000 ETH—while the network has issued 450,000 ETH since the so-called merge occurred in September 2022, according to crypto data providers CoinGlass and Ultrasound Money. The ""merge"" was a major network upgrade that ended Ethereum's energy-intensive mining requirements.
The seven-day trading stretch has also coincided with the products’ best day on record, with investors allocating $1 billion across nine spot Ethereum ETFs on Monday.
Although Ethereum treasury companies like BitMine Immersion Technologies and SharpLink Gaming have recently stepped into the spotlight as a new source of demand for Ethereum, accumulating billions of dollars' worth of ETH at a rapid pace, they have played more of a complementary role in recent months, according to analysts at investment bank Standard Chartered.
While penciling in a year-end price target of $7,500 for Ethereum, the analysts noted that Ethereum treasury firms have bought 2.3 million ETH, or 1.9% of the asset’s circulating supply, since June, while ETFs have attained 3.8% of ETH’s circulating supply over the same period.
“Based on publicly announced plans by the treasury companies, we think their ETH buying is likely to continue, and we see potential for Ethereum treasury companies to increase their holdings to 10% of all circulating ETH,” the analysts added.
Ethereum Could Soar to $25,000 by 2028: Standard Chartered
Ethereum changed hands around $4,740 on Tuesday while showing a 5% increase over the past day, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Despite hitting $4,000 in December, the asset has yet to eclipse its pandemic-era high near $4,900 in 2021—though this is the closest it's been since late that year.
At the time, Ethereum’s consensus model mirrored Bitcoin’s, where computers constantly crunched complex calculations to keep the network secure and reward miners with newly issued ETH. That changed in 2022, when staking became a core part of how Ethereum keeps itself secure.
Network participants are rewarded with ETH for participating in the process of validating transactions through staking. Ethereum’s supply is not fixed at 21 million like Bitcoin’s, but increases are theoretically capped at 1.5% per year, if all Ethereum were ever staked. In practice, Ethereum’s supply has increased only 0.13% since the merge in September 2022.",30977895626d91b184320bacb332c7e8,trafilatura,2579,0

TOKYO (Reuters) -The Bank of Japan will likely be raising interest rates as it is behind the curve in dealing with the risk of inflation, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg Television, in his most explicit comment on Japan's monetary policy.
The remarks contrast with those of BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda, who has repeatedly brushed aside the view the central bank was being too slow in raising rates and could be late in forestalling too-high inflation.
Bessent said U.S. Treasury yields are feeling the impact of overseas developments, with the 30-year yield getting dragged up by rising long-term bond yields in Japan and Germany.
""There's definitely leakage from — the Japanese have an inflation problem,"" Bessent said in the interview with Bloomberg Television on Wednesday.
Bessent mentioned that he had spoken with BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda. ""My opinion, not his — they're behind the curve. So they're going to be hiking,"" he added, though he made no comment on how soon a rate hike could come.
The comments by Bessent come as rising food and raw material costs keep Japan's core inflation above the central bank's 2% target for well over three years, causing some BOJ policymakers to worry about second-round price effects.
Governor Ueda has signalled readiness to keep raising rates but justified going slow on the view that ""underlying inflation,"" which focuses on domestic demand and wages, remains short of the BOJ's target.
The slow pace of the BOJ's policy normalisation has been blamed by some analysts for the yen's persistent weakness, which in turn has pushed up the cost of imports and broader inflation.
The BOJ next meets for a rate review in September before holding another one in October, when the board conducts a quarterly review of its growth and inflation forecasts.
Bessent, who oversees Washington's trade and exchange-rate talks with Tokyo, has repeatedly signalled his preference for tighter Japanese monetary policy.
In its exchange-rate report to Congress in June, the U.S. Treasury Department said the BOJ should keep tightening monetary policy, which would support a ""normalization of the yen's weakness.""
In an interview with the Nikkei newspaper published on Monday, Bessent said the currency ""will take care of itself"" as long as the BOJ focused on ""economic fundamentals, inflation and growth.""
The BOJ last year exited a decade-long, massive stimulus programme and raised short-term interest rates to 0.5% in January on the view Japan was close to durably hitting its 2% inflation target.",b381324ae7ffd6d654b6a34c07eb34a8,trafilatura,2578,0

Since the stock market bottomed in April, the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen 22%.

It looks like new highs are in reach for the blue-chip index. The 30-stock average closed up more than 400 points Wednesday and was less than a percentage point below its Dec. 4 closing high of 45,014.
But pushing the Dow 464 points higher to Wednesday was not the tech stocks in the average, which include Nvidia (NVDA) , Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) .

It was Home Depot (HD) , Sherwin-Williams (SHW) , UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Visa (V) .
Sherwin-Williams, Home Depot and Visa, especially, are consumer facing stocks. And they all stand to gain because Wall Street is now betting on interest-rate cuts in the months ahead.
Sherwin-Williams sells paint. Home Depot sells tools, lumber, sandpaper, wood, appliances, plants and, yes, paint, too.
Building contractors and do-it-yourselfers need paint. They need tools, wood, grout, nails, pipe, and wiring.
And Visa is one of the very biggest payment processors.
The Federal Reserve may well start trimming its key interest rates in September. Maybe by a quarter point, maybe a lot more if President Trump gets his way.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has advocated for a half-percentage point cut in the Federal Funds Rate in September, now at 4.25% to 4.5%, and a total of 1.5 percentage points in the coming months.
That would bring the Federal Funds Date down to perhaps as low as 2.75%.
But that rate, the starting point for the derivation of short-term interest rates, has only a modest effect on mortgages.

Mortgage rates are coming down a bit, welcome news for home buyers and sellers. (Although it also is true that affordability remains a huge problem in some of the biggest markets, especially California.)
The cause for the welcome news is that the key 10-year Treasury yield is now at 4.245%, down from 4.8% in January. Mortgage rates are derived largely from long-term-bond yields.",3e96f08111bb8ace5f47be47247c73ae,trafilatura,2578,0

Billionaire George Soros’ Q2 portfolio moves into AI aren’t just another tech bet; they feel calculated, swift, and nuanced.
It may appear to be a chip chase on paper, but Soros’ AI portfolio is mostly a macro strategy in disguise.

Though everyone’s watching his big Nvidia (NVDA) move, he’s quietly loading up on pressure points the market punditry may be overlooking, efficiently timing entries and exits like a seasoned pro.
His Q2 shifts feel a lot less about momentum chasing and more like a playbook for what comes next.
How George Soros plays AI like a macro trader
George Soros’s big AI bets on Nvidia and Broadcom are essentially a reflection of how he’s always invested.
He follows the trends early, acts quickly, and adapts according to how the story evolves.
In a nutshell, Soros is hunting for positive feedback loops.
That’s when rising stock prices drive genuine momentum in a company’s underlying fundamentals.

In AI, higher share prices can help businesses raise money in building more data centers while improving tools, which can boost earnings and make the stocks rise even higher.
His style relies on essentially three core ideas:
-
Be flexible: Soros isn’t a fan of locking in on just a single bet. If something stops working, he adapts swiftly.
-
Take smart risks: He likes investments where the upside potential is huge, but the downside is limited. Naturally, he does that through options or spreading bets across related businesses.
-
Spot pressure points: He focuses investment areas where there’s limited supply, including areas like chips or network capacity, because they could potentially lead to outsized gains.
Soros' goal is to effectively find balance, spearheaded by robust long-term tech plays like Nvidia, along with more tactical bets on fintech or chips.
George Soros supercharges AI bets with massive Nvidia move
Billionaire George Soros is all-in on AI, with a massive ramp-up in Nvidia holdings leading the charge.
Fresh Q2 13F filings show that Soros Capital boosted its Nvidia stake to roughly 990,000 share-equivalents, which equates to a leap of 1,600% from the previous quarter.
The bump mainly comes via options, but the common-stock stake has also grown impressively, surging to around 103,000 shares valued at $16.3 million from just 17,500 shares three months earlier.",199da43b9f8eca4a1c0e75ad63abb1f5,trafilatura,2578,0

With its AI ad tools driving improved performance for many ad partners, Meta has posted a new overview of how brands can make best use of its latest ad tools and options, including AI content generation, customized ad targeting, AI-powered video promotions and more.
These developments could provide some food for thought for your holiday campaigns, with Meta’s various options now generating strong results, and enabling more businesses to tap into video and AI targeting.
First off, Meta says that brands should lean into its AI targeting creative tools, which are now helping many businesses get more out of their campaigns.
As explained by Meta:
“By uploading multiple creatives with different themes and messages, businesses can leverage Meta’s AI to test and optimize at a scale that isn’t possible manually. For smaller advertisers with fewer resources, tapping into generative AI to build more creative variety, including video content, can be a game changer.”
Meta says that almost 2 million advertisers are now using its updated video generation features “with small and medium-sized businesses seeing strong adoption of image animation in particular.”
The capacity to tap into video, even without dedicated video assets, could provide a boost for your ad efforts, ensuring that you’re aligning with the latest shifts in usage behavior, while also creating standout, engaging ads that will resonate with users.
Meta currently provides AI tools that can generate images from text, generate video from text or images, add backgrounds to product images, generate ad copy and more.
For example, Meta says that Ben and Jerry’s saw a 7% increase in link clicks and a 6.5% reduction cost per link, when it utilized Meta’s AI background image generation feature.
And video is also helping to drive interest.
As per Meta’s Q2 earnings, overall time spent watching video on both Facebook and IG is up more than 20% year-over-year, with Meta’s improving AI targeting showing users more content that they’re likely to find interesting and useful.
Reels are the main driver on this front, and that also opens up new opportunities for brands.
Meta says that a recent survey of its users showed that 79% have purchased a product or service after watching Reels. Which is probably not entirely indicative of the general population, but it does show that Reels can be a powerful driver of brand response, not just entertainment.",cb9ee794f244e883b6c280d90b5df54e,trafilatura,2575,0

Despite the miss, Wall Street analysts maintained bullish outlooks, pointing to progress on Rigetti’s technology roadmap.
Needham: Scaling Progress Strengthens Confidence
Analyst N. Quinn Bolton reiterated the Buy rating on the stock, with a price forecast of $18.
Bolton said Rigetti met its mid-year goal with a four-chiplet, 36-qubit Cepheus-1-36Q QPU reaching 99.5% median two-qubit fidelity. He added that this strengthens management’s confidence in delivering a >100-qubit system with 99.5% median two-gate fidelity by year-end. He also noted quantum advantage remains about four years away and will require meeting four key specifications.
Rigetti, which went public in February 2022 as the second pure-play quantum firm, is a full-stack pioneer with proprietary quantum-classical infrastructure and is well-positioned to benefit as the industry advances in the near and long term.
Bolton added that its approach, built on scalable multi-chip processors designed, manufactured and housed at Fab-1, lets commercial and government customers explore applications while the company and peers work toward fully fault-tolerant systems.
According to the analyst, existing partnerships and customer ties should lead to follow-on R&D agreements and larger opportunities as scaling continues.
Analysts expect that from 2026 onward, the company will raise its qubit count to the hundreds and improve median two-qubit gate fidelity to 99.9%. They also anticipate the introduction of qLDPC-based quantum error correction.
Benchmark: Roadmap to 1,000 Qubits
Analyst David Williams reiterated the Buy rating, raising the price forecast to $20 from $14.
Williams said Rigetti remains on track to deliver a 100-qubit, multi-chiplet QPU with 99.5% two-qubit gate fidelity by year-end, a key step toward quantum advantage. He noted the newly released Cepheus-1 met that fidelity goal while cutting error rates, debuting what he views as the industry’s largest multi-chip processor for quantum computing and reinforcing the scalability of Rigetti’s architecture.",52e7fdfc928c6a2e1aa01aab744d6df0,trafilatura,2574,0

Fueling Up is a column from C-Store Dive offering a fresh perspective on the top news and trends in the convenience store industry.
He’s no longer part of EG Group’s c-suite, but Zuber Issa continues to put pressure on the company he co-founded over two decades ago.
Before he and his brother resigned as co-CEOs, Issa told The Telegraph in December 2024 that they were planning to take EG Group public on the New York Stock exchange for about $13 billion pounds, equivalent to roughly $17.5 billion. A few months later, Issa told The Sunday Times that the “road map is starting now” for the IPO, which would probably commence in 2026 and list EG Group under Cumberland Farms, its largest c-store banner in the U.S.
Now, Issa appears to be changing his outlook. He told the Financial Times this week that he wants EG Group to sell its assets in the U.S. and that there are already parties interested in purchasing them. Selling these assets, including over 1,500 c-stores under several banners, would help EG Group relieve its over $5 billion in debt much faster than an IPO, Issa told the publication.
As Issa continues to speak to the press, EG Group isn’t talking. The company declined to comment on any speculatory IPO or sale of EG America to the outlets Issa has spoken with, and declined to speak when reached this week by C-Store Dive. Issa himself did not respond by press time when asked for comment by C-Store Dive.
It’s understandable for EG Group to keep quiet if either of these moves is in the works. But Issa’s comments contradict what the company has done the past few years in growing its U.S. network. M&A efforts aside, EG America has revamped its digital ecosystem, overhauled its c-suite team and boosted its fresh food offerings amid efforts to unify its many c-store banners across the country. EG Group even said earlier this year that EG America has become its most profitable market.
Which leads me to this: If EG Group is indeed mulling both options, how would selling EG America impact its potential IPO?
Familiar territory
In early 2023, reports surfaced that EG Group was looking to sell its assets in the U.S. in an effort to relieve over $8 billion of debt falling due in 2025. About two months later, the company entered into a $1.5 billion deal with Realty Income Corporation under which the real estate investment trust purchased over 400 c-stores in the U.S. and leased them back to EG America.",c8cad169fdb0dfaa91009305916aa586,trafilatura,2573,0

The Artificial Intelligence (AI) firm Perplexity offered to pay $34.5 billion for Chrome, well above its estimated $18 billion value. Google would prefer to modify certain business arrangements instead of cut bait with Chrome. Plus, if it appeals the judge’s ultimate ruling, that could delay any changes from taking effect for even longer. The Justice Department originally sued Alphabet in 2020.

A plunge in the stock price had put the company at a risk of delisting. But last month, Canadian hedge fund manager Eric Jackson at EMJ Capital made a series of posts online laying out a bull case for the stock, leading to a surge.
Jackson was a vocal critic of Wheeler on X. He said Friday in an interview with Bloomberg News that Opendoor co-founders Keith Rabois and Eric Wu should come back to the company’s board. And the new leader has to push the company more into artificial intelligence, Jackson said.
“It’s obvious to anybody with a pulse who follows stocks that they’ve got to make a major move into AI and building out a truly national and international platform for real estate,” Jackson said.
Wall Street analysts had turned skeptical on Opendoor in recent days, with KBW downgrading the stock to a sell-equivalent rating from neutral on Tuesday, largely pointing toward uncertainty surrounding management’s strategy pivot. Citigroup also cut the stock to sell from neutral last week.
Of the 11 Wall Street analysts following Opendoor, one rates it a buy, five advise that investors hold the stock, and five rate it a sell.
While traders are boosting the stock in trading Friday, shares of the home-flipper are still trading well below their $34.59 record reached in 2021.",8fad52d8f99744c7b01cd945977710e5,trafilatura,2566,0

TMC stock is losing ground after the company reported its second-quarter results yesterday.
-
The seabed mining specialist is targeting a Q4 2027 window for the commencement of its mining projects.
-
Some investors seem to be disappointed that the mining projects aren't expected to start earlier.
TMC The Metals Company (NASDAQ: TMC) stock is falling in Friday's trading following the company's recent earnings report. TMC's share price was down 8.6% as of 10:45 a.m. ET and had been off as much as 12.2% earlier in trading.
TMC reported its second-quarter results, issued business updates, and held an investor conference call after the market closed yesterday. While the company issued some generally encouraging commentary on its path to beginning commercial operations, some investors appear to be unhappy with the timeline. Despite the post-earnings sell-off today, the stock is still up roughly 339% year to date as of this writing.
TMC stock sinks on Q2 business update
TMC reported a net loss of $0.20 per share on no revenue in the second quarter. The sales result in the period wasn't surprising because the seabed mining specialist is still going through permitting processes and laying other foundations to begin commercial operations. Additionally, the company's operating loss of $22 million doesn't look particularly concerning in the context of its long-term business opportunities.
On the other hand, management set a Q4 2027 date to begin mining operations -- and some investors were likely hoping that the company would manage to get things started earlier. TMC stock has seen incredible valuation gains in conjunction with hopes for rapid scaling of its seabed mining operations, and the targeted start date seems to be causing some investors to take profits on the stock.
What's next for TMC?
TMC released two studies suggesting a net present value of $23.69 billion for its mining projects. The company also issued generally reassuring commentary on its outlook for receiving the necessary permitting approvals.
The company's seabed mining projects have seemingly received some significant support in the form of an executive order from President Donald Trump aimed at speeding up permitting approvals for offshore domestic mining projects. Conversely, the targeted Q4 2027 production date may have some investors worried that the estimated start date aligns with the ramping up of the next U.S. presidential election cycle. TMC has potentially explosive growth opportunities, but there is a lot of uncertainty on the horizon.",01f671ecdac779921e9cf8b7cbc335e2,trafilatura,2562,0

Global-e Online's platform solves the complexities of selling products globally.
-
It continues to grow its sales and improve its profitability, despite the challenging operating environment.
-
Ultimately, the short-term problems plaguing Global-e's stock now could be its long-term opportunity.
Leading cross-border e-commerce enabler Global-e Online (NASDAQ: GLBE) has seen its stock drop 7% as of noon ET Wednesday, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Global-e Online beat analysts' expectations after growing revenue by 28% and recording profitability for the second time in three quarters. The company also raised its full-year guidance to 31% sales growth.
Despite these results, Global-e's stock remains down 7% due to worries over how the company's operations will be affected by the new tariffs and the U.S. de minimis customs exemption ending.
Impressive results in tariff-y times
For the third time in as many quarters, Global-e's stock has dropped following earnings.
With revenue growing 42%, 30%, and 28% over these quarters, it is tough to argue that these sell-offs stem from poor operational results, though.
Instead, Global-e's 42% drop in 2025 seems to stem from factors outside its control.
Since the company's solutions enable its customers to sell products across borders, the ongoing tariff and de minimis changes in the U.S. have soured the market's outlook on Global-e's stock as they complicate cross-border trade.
However, this may be a short-sighted outlook.
Last quarter, Global-e rolled out a new 3B2C (business-to-business-to-consumer) solution that ""enables global brands to leverage their international footprint in order to partially offset costs due to tariffs.""
This complex solution perfectly exemplifies how Global-e thrives amid uncertainty as it helps its customers ""go global.""
Yes, new tariffs and the de minimis exemption ending may weigh on cross-border trade over the short term. However, that could prove to be a long-term benefit for Global-e as it creates solutions to solve these challenges.
Now trading at 35 times free cash flow, Global-e looks like an outstanding business trading at a reasonable valuation.

(Bloomberg) -- The caution flags have been waving for weeks: The record run in US stocks is masking trouble beneath the surface.
Now, signs are emerging that investors have started to heed the warnings.
A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. basket of S&P 500 companies with the strongest balance sheets just posted the best week since early April relative to a basket of firms with weaker finances. The cash-rich companies, including the likes of Fastenal Co., Palantir Technologies Inc. and West Pharmaceutical Services Inc., have gained for three straight weeks, the longest run since Donald Trump’s initial tariff announcement sent markets into a tailspin.
The rotation lets traders who are growing anxious about the market’s three-month surge stay invested while trimming some exposure to more vulnerable companies. Buying shares of firms that have the financial wherewithal to withstand a slowing economy and the threat of margin compression from tariffs could limit downside exposure if the S&P 500’s run begins to falter.
“We’ve been sensing that investors, while riding the rally higher, they’re getting nervous,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “A little caution is warranted” in the current market, he said.
The S&P 500 has surged 29% since a low on April 8, closing at a record on Tuesday. Much of the rally owes to artificial intelligence euphoria that’s powered Nvidia Corp. and Microsoft Corp. to multi-trillion dollar valuations. Solid corporate earnings bolstered optimism that Trump’s chaotic trade policies haven’t caused the damage expected. But most of the profit growth was clustered in tech and tech-adjacent sectors, papering over weakness among purveyors of consumer products and makers of industrial equipment.
As a consequence, Citigroup Inc. strategists noted “early” signs of a rebound in value factors from July into early August as investors sought companies whose shares were underpriced relative to financial fundamentals. That has meant losses for profitless tech companies and other speculative plays.
Higher quality, defensive names have “held their own,” said Colin Cieszynski, portfolio manager and chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management. Telecommunication companies, utilities and insurance firms have performed well, along with the tech behemoths, he said. Other strong defensive performers include tobacco producer Philip Morris International Inc., which is up 40% in 2025.",578023478a7acc33ecc78cf4ba69b585,trafilatura,2555,0

In only three years, shares of Palantir have soared 1,500%.
-
In its most recent quarter, Palantir generated over $1 billion in revenue, a quarterly record for it.
Hitting a home run requires perfect timing: Swing too soon -- or too late -- and you miss the ball entirely. Even if you do make contact, research suggests that a batter needs to launch the ball at between 25 and 35 degrees to hit a home run. Too high an angle results in a pop fly; too low likely means a ground-out.
Thankfully for investors -- who are investing in stocks, not hitting balls -- timing doesn't have to be perfect. You can hit an investing home run even if you're late to the party. With that in mind, let's take a closer look at Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) and why I think it can still set up investors for life.
What Palantir has already achieved
First, we must start by acknowledging that Palantir stock has enjoyed an incredible run over the last few years.
Since Aug. 5, 2022, shares of Palantir have advanced by a mind-blowing 1,500% as of market close Aug. 11. That means an investment of $10,000 made three years ago would now be worth $160,000.
Furthermore, Palantir's market cap has exploded. In late 2022, it stood at around $12 billion. As of this writing, Palantir's market cap is $440 billion. That makes it the 18th-largest American company, right behind legendary energy giant ExxonMobil (market cap of $456 billion) and ahead of corporate titans including Bank of America ($342 billion), Coca-Cola ($303 billion), and AT&T ($201 billion).
In other words, perhaps the ""easy"" money has already been made when it comes to Palantir.
But it's important to remember that past performance doesn't tell you where a stock is going. That's why it's crucial to dig into Palantir's financials to understand the company's potential.
The AI revolution could carry Palantir's stock much higher
As impressive as Palantir's recent stock history is, the company may be just getting started. For proof, consider Palantir's most recent quarterly earnings report. It was an absurdly bullish report, highlighting several key factors.
-
The company reported its first-ever $1 billion revenue quarter, with sales rising 48% year-over-year.
-
Net income surged by 144% to $326 million.
-
Total customer count skyrocketed by 43% from a year ago.
In short, Palantir's business is booming. Moreover, analysts continue to raise expectations of Palantir's future revenue, as it becomes clear that organizations are lining up for Palantir's AI-powered products.",5fe2133c24d7dda381323d4b81b8cf63,trafilatura,2549,0

Earnings reports often drive significant stock moves, and Webtoon did beat analyst expectations in the second quarter of 2025.
-
However, an unexpected content deal with Walt Disney added far more fuel to the stock's fire today.
Shares of Webtoon Entertainment (NASDAQ: WBTN) soared to a 52-week high on Wednesday. Powered by a strong earnings report and an unexpected Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) partnership, Webtoon's shares had gained 93% as of 11:40 a.m. ET — and the chart is still trending upward as of this writing.
Webtoon's results and a sweet Disney deal
Let's start with the financial filings. The average Wall Street firm had expected second-quarter earnings of roughly $0.02 per share, with top-line revenue near $341 million. The mobile webcomics specialist posted adjusted earnings of $0.07 per share instead, based on $348 million of revenues. That's a clean sweep, also exceeding the top end of management's guidance ranges for this period.
But the bigger news came from the House of Mouse. Besides the earnings report, Webtoon also announced a brand new Disney deal. This contract adds a selection of Disney, Marvel, 20th Century Fox, and Star Wars content on the Webtoon platform.
It will start with a handful of free webcomics at launch, followed by approximately 100 pieces of premium content over time. That's a robust slice of Disney's instantly recognizable content portfolio, but Webtoon users won't get full access to this deep well.
How the partnership helps Webtoon and Disney
Webtoon COO & CFO David Lee wasn't able to share financial terms or launch dates quite yet, as the commercial details are still being hammered out. But he called the deal a win-win for both companies. Webtoon will supplement its mainly anime-style comics with a deep well of proven hits, while Disney reaches the Gen Z kids (and younger) from a new angle.
The stock calmed down to an 85% gain by noon ET. That's still a solid 52-week high. Again, the Disney deal holds more weight than a modest earnings surprise. From here, Webtoon needs to make the most of its Disney contract, boosting the company's fairly slow revenue growth and nearly breakeven profits.

Here's what's making news in the markets:
Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.
South Korea’s decision to shelve its central bank digital currency pilot in favor of private-sector stablecoins has sparked a wave of activities among fintechs and banks.
As CoinDesk previously reported, KakaoBank is weighing both issuance and custody roles, while Upbit and Naver Pay are collaborating on a payments-focused token that could help close the “kimchi premium” gap between local and global crypto prices.
The opportunity comes as Korea is moving to extend FX trading hours, allow more foreign participation in its onshore market, and position itself for inclusion in major global bond and equity indices. A regulated KRW stablecoin could fit into these modernization plans, offering faster settlement and tighter integration between banking and digital asset markets.
But any Won stablecoin effort is going to run into a massive wall: Korea's currency is not fully internationalized.
Since the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997, Korea has kept deliverable KRW trading entirely onshore. Foreign institutions cannot exchange won among themselves abroad, and every dollar–won transaction must be settled through domestic intermediaries under the Bank of Korea's supervision.
Authorities in Seoul maintain this system to monitor speculative flows, contain volatility, and preserve monetary policy autonomy.
So for a Won stablecoin to work, it would have to be only used with whitelisted, KYC-verified addresses that have some tie to Korea.
If a privately issued stablecoin becomes too dominant, it can erode a country’s control over its currency, encourage “unintended dollarisation,” and weaken the central bank’s ability to manage employment and price stability, Vera Yuen, a professor at Hong Kong University's business school told CoinDesk in a note.
The question is, just how useful would this on-shore only stablecoin then be?
Domestic interbank transfers in Korea settle around the clock, 365 days a year. Sending money from one account to another is immediate, free, and widely used, leaving little payment friction for a KRW stablecoin to solve inside the country.
Without a speed or cost advantage in domestic transfers, the token’s primary utility would lie in cross-border settlement — and that is precisely where the onshore-only rule becomes a brick wall.",05e29a5cfda8998278a01d5c896f202a,trafilatura,2547,0

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -The California Coastal Commission voted on Thursday against a plan by Elon Musk's SpaceX to nearly double the number of Falcon 9 rocket launches the company is permitted to conduct each year from Vandenberg Space Force Base, from 50 to 95.
But as was the case when the commission voted last October to oppose a previous SpaceX launch expansion from 36 to 50 at the installation, the U.S. government can merely override the objections of California regulators and approve the latest plan.
The U.S. Department of the Air Force, parent agency of the Space Force, has taken the position that the proposed launch expansion at Vandenberg, about 60 miles (97 km) northwest of Santa Barbara on the central California coast, is a federal activity exempt from further state oversight.
A commission staff report countered that of 51 rockets launched last year from Vandenberg, SpaceX Falcon 9s accounted for 46 of them.
While SpaceX flies some missions for the Defense Department and NASA, the enlarged launch operations SpaceX envisions are primarily for carrying payloads for the company's own Starlink satellite network, the report said.
SpaceX also has sought to expand its launch facilities at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.
Air Force officials did not attend Thursday's commission meeting in Calabasas, north of Los Angeles, where the panel voted 11-0 against SpaceX.
Neither representatives for SpaceX nor the Air Force could immediately be reached for comment. SpaceX has sued the California Coastal Commission over its previous objections, accusing the agency of singling out Musk's company for greater regulation in retaliation for his political views.
In addition to allowing as many as 95 launches a year by the company's workhorse Falcon 9, the new plan would permit up to five Falcon Heavy rocket launches annually, and up to 24 landings by the company's reusable rocket boosters, twice as many as previously approved. Two new landing zones at the base would also be built. At-sea landings would also be increased.
In recommending disapproval, commission staff cited what it called insufficient information about the plan and concerns over noise pollution and wildlife disturbance from more frequent, louder sonic booms as SpaceX launch activity escalates.
The staff report also cited the need for more frequent closures of public beaches and campgrounds that lie within the launch hazard zones around the base.

Amazon said Wednesday that it is expanding same-day grocery delivery by adding dairy, meat, produce and other perishables.
-
The move comes after the company said it is building out its same-day and next-day delivery network in smaller towns and rural areas.
-
Shares of Instacart, DoorDash, Walmart and other major supermarkets fell.
Amazon is rolling out full-service grocery delivery. The news quickly ricocheted through the market, hitting shares of a range of competitors.
Beginning Wednesday, the retailer will offer same-day delivery on thousands of grocery items, including dairy, meat, seafood and produce, in 1,000 locations, it said in a press release. Amazon (AMZN) aims to extend the service to a total of 2,300 towns and cities by the end of 2025, the company said.
“We’re continuously innovating to make grocery shopping simpler, faster, and more affordable for our customers,” Doug Herrington, CEO of Worldwide Amazon Stores, said in a statement.
Amazon is waiving the delivery fee Prime members pay orders over $25. Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) offer free same-day delivery to members when they spend $35 or more, according to their websites. (Amazon Prime members can get same-day delivery on smaller orders by paying $2.99, and all customers can access the service for $12.99, its press release said.)
Amazon’s announcement amounts to a “shot heard 'round the warehouse,” Wedbush Securities wrote in a research note. The bank added that the move could weigh on delivery companies and retailers that have large grocery businesses.
Shares of Grocery and Delivery Companies Sink
Investors sold off shares of delivery and supermarket companies Wednesday.
Instacart (CART) shares were recently down 12%, while DoorDash (DASH) shares fell some 5%, Kroger (KR) shares dropped 4%, Walmart and Albertsons Companies (ACI) shares dipped about 2%.
“Along comes Amazon with an existing nationwide network of fulfillment centers and delivery trucks, [and] seems to have finally figured out how to store and fulfill perishables in a way to support same-day efforts,” Wedbush analysts said.
Amazon has struggled to break into the perishable space despite introducing a grocery-specific subscription option, analysts said. It also announced plans to offer same-day and next-day delivery in thousands of less populated areas, which Morgan Stanley described as seizing an opportunity to close the urban-rural gap in online food shopping.
Amazon shares were recently up more than 1%.

The brokerage will be getting exactly $0 in revenue from a new service it's rolling out in Singapore.
-
Although this follows a broad trend in the industry, investors clearly aren't happy about it.
Investors didn't want to interact much with Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ: IBKR) on Wednesday. They were reacting to an announcement by the global securities brokerage that it wouldn't be drawing a particular revenue stream from a new service in a key Asian market. This pushed the stock to a more than 6% decline today, as the S&P 500 index landed in positive territory with a 0.3% rise.
A big, fat goose egg
On Tuesday night, Interactive Brokers announced the launch of its IBKR Lite pricing plan in Singapore. The main feature of this service is that the company charges no commissions for trades on U.S. markets made by users.
The company also made a point of saying that IBKR Lite is free of sneaky fees that produce compensatory revenue.
""Unlike other brokers that promote 'zero commissions' but charge platform or settlement fees, the Singaporean IBKR Lite program delivers true cost transparency with no commissions, platform or settlement fees, or minimums,"" the company wrote in the press release trumpeting the new service's rollout.
Although a small country, Singapore is relatively wealthy for its region. As such, it is an appealing market for companies like Interactive Brokers that can offer online trading in U.S. securities, plus selected markets outside our borders.
The end of the commission era
As Interactive Brokers hinted in its press release, it's now common for brokerages to lure investors with promises of commission-free trading. For years, commissions were a great and steady revenue stream for such companies, and since the end of that era, many have had to adjust their business strategies to adapt. Despite this inevitability, it seems this stock's investors aren't taking the unsurprising news well.

Bloom Energy popped on little to no news today.
-
Rivals Ballard and Plug have had some news this week, with Plug reporting a big net loss, but Ballard getting a price target hike.
-
Bloom is a very expensive fuel cell stock.
Shares of Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE), one of a handful of fuel cell manufacturers and producers of hydrogen fuel, jumped 6% through 1:11 p.m. ET Wednesday. And why did the shares jump?
That's an excellent question. Next question, please.
Bloom isn't Plug, and it also isn't Ballard
I jest, of course. But it turns out there isn't much news specific to Bloom Energy that might be moving the stock today. What is, is a bit of news on Bloom's rivals this week.
Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG), for example, recently reported Q2 earnings showing sales rising 21% and gross losses on sales improving. That could be a promising development for other fuel cell companies, but to be honest, the fact that Plug also reported a huge $0.20 per share loss -- worse than Wall Street expected -- dampens my enthusiasm a bit.
Separately, Bloom rival Ballard Power (NASDAQ: BLDP) scored a near-50% price target hike from Roth Capital on Monday. Again, the improved sentiment on Ballard might translate to Bloom stock. But Roth didn't actually recommend buying Ballard stock, and warned that the ""environment"" for fuel cells remains ""difficult.""
Is Bloom Energy stock a buy?
From where I sit, that's not good news for Bloom Energy stock at all. Speaking of which, Bloom stock costs $44 and only earned $0.11 per share over the past 12 reported months. That's a P/E ratio of 400, folks, which is quite a lot of money to be paying for a stock that's rising on no good news particular to itself. And considering the company has three times more debt than cash on its balance sheet, Bloom's valuation is arguably even richer than that.
Ultimately, Bloom stock looks more like a sell than a buy to me.

Narrowing the focus, UNP has also underperformed the SPDR S&P Transportation ETF’s (XTN) 15% surge over the past 52 weeks and marginal YTD drop.
UNP delivered its Q2 results on Jul. 24. However, despite posting better-than-expected performance, its shares tumbled 4.5% that day. Both its operating revenue of $6.2 billion and adjusted EPS of $3.03 handily surpassed the consensus estimates. Moreover, compared to the year-ago quarter, its top-line grew 2.4% due to higher volume and solid core pricing gains, while its adjusted EPS advanced 11.8%.
For the current fiscal year, ending in December, analysts expect UNP’s EPS to grow 5.7% year over year to $11.72. The company’s earnings surprise history is mixed. It surpassed the consensus estimates in two of the last four quarters, while missing on two other occasions.
Among the 25 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a ""Moderate Buy” which is based on 14 “Strong Buy,” one ""Moderate Buy,” nine “Hold,” and one “Strong Sell” rating.
This configuration is less bullish than a month ago, with 16 analysts suggesting a “Strong Buy” rating.
On Aug. 2, Citigroup Inc. (C) analyst Ariel Rosa downgraded UNP stock to a “Hold"" rating and cut its price target to $250, implying a 12% potential upside from the current levels.
The mean price target of $260.12 represents a 16.6% premium from UNP’s current price levels, while the Street-high price target of $286 suggests an ambitious upside potential of 28.1%.

Nat-Gas Prices Plunge on Cooler US Forecasts and EIA Production Forecast Increase
OKLO stock has been exceptionally rewarding as an investment in 2025. Compared to its year-to-date low in early April it’s up more than 330% at the time of writing.
How DOE Selection Helps Oklo Stock
Investors are cheering the DOE announcement primarily because it validates the firm’s advanced microreactor technology and accelerates its path toward commercialization.
The federal support improves OKLO’s credibility with regulators and investors and positions it to gain operational insights that could streamline future licensing.
With no revenue yet and high development costs, government backing helps de-risk the investment thesis and signals long-term viability.
Together, all of it could significantly boost investor confidence in the nuclear energy company and drive a further increase in Oklo share price in the second half of 2025.
Is It Too Late to Invest in OKLO Shares?
Despite their explosive year-to-date rally, Wedbush remains constructive on OKLO shares mostly due to nuclear licensing progress.
According to the investment firm, Oklo has successfully completed Phase 1 of its NRC readiness assessment, which clears the path for its license application in Q4.
Calling it a major regulatory milestone, Wedbush analysts expressed confidence in the company’s recently disclosed partnership with Vertiv (VRT) to supply clean energy to hyperscaler data centers as well.
With AI-driven energy demand expected to surge tenfold by the end of this decade, Oklo’s build-own-operate model positions it for long-term recurring revenues, making the NYSE-listed firm a compelling clean energy play.
Wall Street Sees Significant Downside in Oklo
Investors should note, however, that valuation remains an overhang for OKLO stock at current levels.
According to Barchart, the consensus rating on Oklo shares currently sits at “Moderate Buy,” but the mean target of roughly $63 actually indicates potential downside of about 20% from here.",666ba80b014d90caf1f8103b6b0485c9,trafilatura,2527,0

The global bubble tea market size will grow from $2.83 billion in 2025 to $4.78 billion by 2032, according to a report from Fortune Business Insights.
This year, three Chinese bubble tea chains — Mixue Group, Guming Holdings and Auntea Jenny — listed in Hong Kong, and raised more than $700 million as investors bet on China's fast-growing consumer market.
""This is the right place at the right time,"" said William Ma, chief investment officer at Grow Investment Group, said in an interview with ""CNBC Explains.""
""A lot of global investors are trying to invest in sectors less sensitive to the U.S. tariffs. So domestic consumption, younger generation consumption, is a more stable or less vulnerable sector,"" Ma added.
Mixue has emerged as the sector's heavyweight, operating more than 46,000 stores worldwide by the end of 2024. That makes it the world's largest food-and-beverage chain by outlet count — ahead of McDonald's, Starbucks and Subway. Its ultra-low pricing and high-volume model lean heavily on franchising.
""In 2024, they are growing at around 22% in terms of new store growth,"" Ma noted.
Franchising is central to the bubble tea industry. Most large bubble tea chains don't run the shops themselves. Nearly every outlet is franchised. Parent companies earn from supplying ingredients and equipment, and collecting fees, while franchisees shoulder the costs of rent, labor and utilities.
That model fuels rapid growth but comes with trade-offs: maintaining quality and avoiding store cannibalization gets harder as outlets multiply.
""The normal payback period for the business owner, for the franchisee, is between 18 to 24 months,"" said Ma, estimating store closure rates at roughly 20% across the market.
But overseas expansion is no guarantee of success. CNBC's China reporter Elaine Yu noted that replicating the domestic formula abroad comes with added challenges.
""Supply chains are harder to control, and consumer tastes differ from city to city. That's why brands are adapting to regional flavors and different store formats to win over local customers,"" Yu said.
Market saturation at home, rising costs and intense price wars are also testing the resilience of these brands. Whether they can sustain their valuations will depend on their ability to balance scale with profitability — and prove they can build more than just a fad.

For the second day in a row, discouraged investors traded out of the company following an earnings release.
-
This was compounded by several post-earnings analyst price target reductions.
Next-generation fintech eToro Group (NASDAQ: ETOR) was looking like quite the tired animal on the stock market Wednesday. For the third trading session in a row its shares closed the day lower in price, sinking by more than 5% as the S&P 500 index ended 0.3% higher. Several analyst price target cuts were a key reason why.
Time to get out the scissors
Those moves occurred a day after eToro published its second quarter earnings report. The company didn't perform badly at all during the period, in fact it notched a double beat on both the top and bottom lines. However, it's a fast-growing company in a lucrative field, and it seems investors were hungry for even better numbers.
Several analysts tracking eToro stock also hoped for more, expressing some degree of disappointment by shaving their price targets. By my count five of them made such cuts on Hump Day.
Among the choppers was Keefe, Bruyette & Woods' Kyle Vogt, who set a new fair value assessment of $60 per share for the fintech, from the preceding $65. He's lukewarm on eToro's prospects, as he continues to rate it as a market perform (hold). Maintaining a similar recommendation was Citigroup's Christopher Allen, accompanied by a $72 per share to $62 price target cut.
Staying cautiously bullish on eToro
Meanwhile, three of the five price target reducers kept their buy recommendations on eToro intact. This clutch included Needham's John Todaro, who despite his $80 per share to $76 reduction is still a believer in the company's future.
According to reports, Todaro expressed some concern about the company's future take from cryptocurrency trading, following the run-up with Ethereum. However that segment is small compared to the company's overall operations, the analyst wrote.

Employees were informed week commencing 10 August, of their role eliminations, reported Bloomberg citing sources familiar with the situation.
Some of the layoffs were attributed to performance-related factors, although the division continues to recruit new talent.
Reports indicate that more than 150 positions were eliminated in the Seattle region, which has historically been a key area for the cloud unit.
Following its decision in 2024 to relocate its headquarters to Nashville, Oracle currently lists more job openings in Tennessee than in any other state.
An Oracle representative did not respond to Bloomberg’s several requests for comment, and the complete extent of the job cuts remains unclear.
The initial report on the reductions was provided by DatacenterDynamics, a publication focused on industry news.
In July 2025, the company secured a significant agreement with OpenAI for around 4.5GW of data centre power in the US.
However; Oracle faces substantial financial commitments, amounting to tens of billions of dollars, to expand its server farms to accommodate growing demand.
The company reported negative free cash flow for the fiscal year ending in May 2025.
In a filing from June 2025, Oracle noted that it regularly adjusts its workforce in response to strategic shifts, reorganisations, or performance issues.
The company stated, “These types of restructurings have resulted, and may in the future result, in increased restructuring costs and temporarily reduced productivity while employees adjust to the restructuring.”
In response to the rising costs associated with AI, several major technology firms have implemented workforce reductions.
Microsoft has laid off approximately 15,000 employees in 2025, while Amazon and Meta Platforms have also made similar cuts.

AI is raising the risk of a ""jobless recovery"" in the labor market, according to JPMorgan.
-
AI is displacing white-collar knowledge workers, who account for 45% of US employment.
-
The result could be a ""dismal"" job market downturn in the economy, JPMorgan said.
There's one group of workers that could be in for a particularly rough time as AI becomes more integrated into the economy.
Murat Tasci, a senior US economist at JPMorgan, thinks AI is poised to replace a vast swath of white-collar knowledge workers — office workers, in other words, who have ""non-routine cognitive occupations,"" the bank wrote in a note to clients last week.
The result could be a ""jobless recovery"" in the labor market — a situation where white-collar knowledge workers face a structurally higher risk of unemployment as growth in their sector remains feeble, Tasci said.
The shift could also pose a huge risk to the overall economy, Tasci suggested, given that white-collar knowledge workers account for around 45% of all household employment in the US.
""A much larger unemployment risk and anemic recovery prospects for these workers might cause the next labor market downturn to look pretty dismal,"" Tasci wrote, speculating that policy makers may need to significantly ease monetary policy or inject the economy with stimulus as workers adjust to changes in the job market.
The idea that AI could be taking away some white-collar jobs has been on Wall Street's radar for a while, but there are signs that the trend may already be beginning to play out in some areas of the job market, Tasci said, such as for entry-level workers.
The rising jobless rate among recent college graduates is related to the hype for AI, JPMorgan said previously.
The share of unemployment accounted for by non-routine cognitive workers has also already surpassed the share of unemployment accounted for by routine workers in recent years, per JPMorgan's analysis.
JPMorgan says that workers in ""routine cognitive occupations,"" — those who have repetitive jobs in areas like sales — as well as ""routine manual occupations"" have already been through a jobless recovery.
The percentage of workers in the US who have a ""routine"" job has dropped from around 55% to 40% over the last four decades, according to the bank's analysis of Labor Department data.
The impact of AI on the job market hasn't significantly impacted employment figures yet, Tasci noted. The overall unemployment rate in the US remains near a historic low, hovering around 4.2% in July.",6337c0d8bd778306cfd9731566ebefa2,trafilatura,2519,0

(Reuters) -Australia's Westpac Banking Corp on Thursday said wider margins and lending and deposits gains helped it post slightly higher third-quarter profit, sending its shares surging more than 5%.
The country's third-largest bank by market value reported a net profit of A$1.9 billion ($1.24 billion) for the three months to June 30, 5% higher than the A$1.8 billion a year earlier.
Westpac's net interest margins, the spread between interest earned from loans and paid to depositors, came in at 1.99% in the quarter, compared with 1.92% a year ago. Net interest income was A$5 billion in the quarter, up 4% from the quarterly average in the first half.
Customer deposits grew by A$10 billion during the quarter, while gross loans jumped by A$16 billion, the bank said in a trading update.
Westpac shares rose to A$35.66 to trade at their highest point in a decade. The bank's shares are up 4.9% so far this year and have risen nearly 20% in the past year.
Australian banking stock valuations, led by Commonwealth Bank, have soared in the past year on the back of increased foreign investor demand and are considered among the most highly valued in the world.
Contribution from Westpac's treasury and markets segment also climbed sharply from a year ago, helped by a favourable interest-rate environment.
The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut its key cash rate by a total of 75 basis points this year, including a 25-basis-point reduction this week.
""The resilience of both households and businesses has been aided by the reduction in interest rates and the moderation of inflation,"" said CEO Anthony Miller.
""This is reflected in lower levels of customer stress. It should also underpin a recovery in private sector activity and support lending growth.""
Miller, who took over as CEO in December, has since focused on cutting costs and streamlining operations and technology under a strategy dubbed UNITE. Quarterly expenses rose, driven by higher salaries and wages and a planned boost in investment for the program.
Late mortgage repayments fell three basis points from a year earlier, the bank added.
The results follow Commonwealth Bank of Australia's report on Wednesday of its strongest annual cash earnings.
The second-largest lender National Australia Bank is set to report its third-quarter earnings next week.

The Dow surpassed the previous peak of 45,073.63 touched on December 4, helped by a jump in UnitedHealth Group shares after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway revealed a new investment in the health insurer.
Counted among the oldest and most followed indexes, the Dow tracks the performance of 30 U.S.-listed large-cap stocks.
The blue-chip index is price-weighted rather than market-cap-weighted, differentiating it from indexes such as the S&P 500, for which companies with larger market values carry the most weight.
The Dow's gains have been propelled by a solid year-to-date performances from Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs, tech giant Microsoft and industrial equipment maker Caterpillar.
Chip designer and AI champion Nvidia, which became the first publicly listed company to clinch $4 trillion in market capitalization, has also aided the Dow's rise. The stock has gained more than 30% this year.
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite reached all-time highs late June, thanks to renewed AI enthusiasm, hopes of U.S. trade deals and rising bets on interest rate cuts, which helped drive a turnaround in U.S. stocks from a sharp rout earlier this year.
The Dow, however, has lagged in reaching record highs, as limited exposure to AI names and the underperformance of companies such as UnitedHealth Group and Salesforce restricted its overall increase.
The Dow has jumped more than 20% since hitting this year's lowest in April when U.S. President Donald Trump announced sweeping ""reciprocal tariffs"" to rebalance the global trade order in favor of the United States.
After a series of U.S. trade agreements with the UK, Japan, and the European Union, investors are certain that a worst-case global recession scenario can be avoided.
Meanwhile, a weak labor market report for July prompted traders to increase their bets on an interest rate cut as early as September.
Trump's moves to shake up the Federal Reserve leadership - including an interim pick for a Fed governor post and an expanded search to replace Chair Jerome Powell next year with someone willing to lower interest rates - have also added to rate cut bets.

Oklo and its subsidiary won a total of three Department of Energy contracts to build pilot small modular nuclear reactors.
-
Nano Nuclear and NuScale Power won no contracts.
-
But eight other companies not named Oklo also won contracts.
Shares of Oklo (NYSE: OKLO), one of a handful of start-up nuclear power companies aiming to commercialize small modular reactors, jumped more than 6% in early trading Wednesday before reversing course and losing it all. As of 12:35 p.m. ET, Oklo stock is now down 1%.
So why did Oklo pop and then drop?
Good news for Oklo
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) picked Oklo to perform two projects under its new Reactor Pilot Program, and picked Oklo subsidiary Atomic Alchemy to perform a third, the company announced today. All three projects are in furtherance of President Donald Trump's May 2025 executive order to get at least three working small modular reactors (SMRs) up and running by July 4, 2026.
This sounds like pretty great news for Oklo, and we haven't heard (yet) about either of its closest rivals in the SMR space, Nano Nuclear Energy (NASDAQ: NNE) or NuScale Power (NYSE: SMR), winning similar contracts.
Both of those other nuclear stocks are down today, by the way, and down even more than Oklo.
Less-good news for Oklo
Digging a little deeper into the news, however, and going to DOE's website to learn if any other companies did win contracts, I discovered that a total of 10 separate companies (two of which are Oklo or its subsidiary) did win contracts. Neither of the 10 is Nano Nuclear or NuScale, which is pretty bad news for those companies, I suspect.
But also, eight of them are not Oklo, and that means Oklo's not quite the odds-on favorite to inaugurate the nation's nuclear renaissance, as its initial press release might lead one to believe.
And this, I suspect, is why Oklo stock was unable to hold on to its gains today.

Toyo Ink Europe has launched a new low migration ink, called Steraflex GIO, to enhance its flexographic print performance.
This new low migration ink is engineered to deliver print and press performance on various label substrates, sleeves, and applications where minimal migration is crucial.
Steraflex GIO meets the stringent standards set by the European Printing Ink Association, Swiss Ordinance, the ECHA SVHC list, and other European regulations, including the German Ink Ordinance (GIO).
It is said to be free from intentionally added photo initiator 379, thus meeting present and future stipulations of the GIO. This adherence instils confidence in printers and brand proprietors, especially when crafting packaging for delicate uses in the food and pharmaceutical industries, stated the company.
The next-generation binder system in Steraflex GIO ensures enhanced adhesion on a wide array of substrates, including standard films and challenging label materials.
It exhibits a significant improvement in bond strength, particularly on low-surface tension substrates such as biaxially oriented polypropylene, offering converters and brands more versatility without sacrificing the quality or safety of the print.
Toyo Ink Europe sales and corporate strategy general manager Ismail Yilmaz said: ""With increasing regulatory scrutiny on food packaging inks, compliance and transparency are more important than ever.”
Additionally, the Toyo Ink Europe team has completed intensive training at Omet Demo Center to improve its flexographic expertise.
The company said in a statement: “This hands-on programme deepened our understanding of flexographic printing and brought together colleagues from different departments and regions to strengthen both our know-how and cooperation.”
The session further bolstered the company’s ongoing partnership with Italian distributor T&K.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -CK Hutchison said on Thursday its $22.8 billion ports business sale had a ""reasonable chance"" of going through after a plan to add a Chinese major strategic investor to the buying consortium, as it tries to navigate through Sino-U.S. tensions.
CK Hutchison, based in the Chinese-controlled territory of Hong Kong, has faced heavy criticism from Beijing since unveiling a plan in March to sell 43 ports in 23 countries, including two near the Panama Canal, to a group led by BlackRock and Italian Gianluigi Aponte's family-run shipping firm MSC.
President Donald Trump had called for the U.S. to ""take back"" the Panama Canal, which is used by more than 40% of U.S. container traffic, valued at roughly $270 billion annually, from Chinese influence. CK Hutchison's ports are not on the canal or part of it, however.
""We are into a new stage of our deal,"" group co-managing director and finance director Frank Sixt told analysts at an earnings conference.
""There is a reasonable chance that those discussions will lead to a deal that is good for all of the parties, ourselves included. And most importantly, that we'll be capable of being approved by all of the relevant authorities.""
On July 28, the conglomerate said it was in talks to include a Chinese ""major strategic investor"" in the bid for its ports, and that it would allow as much time as needed to secure approval in relevant jurisdictions.
On Thursday, Sixt said these included China, the U.S., Britain and the European Union.
He said the talks were taking much longer than expected but that this was ""not particularly troublesome"" because the port business had delivered stronger earnings and cash flow this year than expected.
Sources have said the investor is COSCO - one of the world's dominant, vertically integrated marine transportation firms. They said COSCO wanted a bigger stake while the other parties were keen to keep it a minority.
ALLAYING CHINESE CONCERNS
The inclusion of a Chinese investor would alleviate Beijing's security concerns and have its blessing, the sources and other experts have said. COSCO did not respond to a request last month for comment.
Thursday's results conference was the first opportunity for analysts to quiz management about the ports deal.
But chairman Victor Li, eldest son of Hong Kong's richest man, Li Ka-shing, who took over the conglomerate from his father, was missing for the first time, as was deputy chairman Canning Fok.",5d2785159a25afce702863cb382f0d77,trafilatura,2484,0

Nat-gas prices have fallen sharply since late last week due to forecasts for cooler US temps and Tuesday's EIA forecast of higher gas production. Atmospheric G2 said Wednesday that forecasts shifted slightly cooler in the Northeast for Aug 18-22, and cooler for the eastern two-thirds of the US for Aug 23-27.
Nat-gas prices were undercut Tuesday when the EIA raised its forecast for 2025 US nat-gas production by +0.5% to 106.44 bcf/day from July's estimate of 105.9 bcf/day. The EIA raised its forecast for 2026 US nat-gas production by +0.7% to 106.09 from July's 105.4 bcf/day forecast. US nat-gas production is currently near a record high, with active US nat-gas rigs recently posting a 2-year high.
The consensus is for Thursday's weekly EIA report to show an increase of 54 bcf, which would be substantially higher than the average increase for the week of +33 bcf.
US (lower-48) dry gas production on Wednesday was 108.6 bcf/day (+5.4% y/y), according to BNEF. Lower-48 state gas demand on Wednesday was 81.8 bcf/day (+5.5% y/y), according to BNEF. Estimated LNG net flows to US LNG export terminals on Wednesday were 15.9 bcf/day (-2.4% w/w), according to BNEF.
In a bearish factor, the Edison Electric Institute reported Wednesday that US (lower-48) electricity output in the week ended August 9 fell -1.9% y/y to 93,293 GWh (gigawatt hours), although US electricity output in the 52-week period ending August 9 rose +2.6% y/y to 4,257,529 GWh.
Last Thursday's weekly EIA report was bullish for nat-gas prices since nat-gas inventories for the week ended August 1 rose +7 bcf, below the consensus of +12 bcf and the 5-year average of +29 bcf for the week. As of August 1, nat-gas inventories were down -4.3% y/y, but were +5.9% above their 5-year seasonal average, signaling adequate nat-gas supplies. As of August 9, gas storage in Europe was 72% full, compared to the 5-year seasonal average of 79% full for this time of year.",49c16331e2b14fc76a210659a91ad32f,trafilatura,2480,0

The loss rate averaged 1.7% for the half-year, up from 1.1% a year earlier, but improving from Q1’s 1.9% to 1.7% in Q2.
Leasing division powers growth – New leasing business rose 9.8% in Q2 to €867.4 million, lifting lease receivables to €6.9 billion (Dec 31, 2024: €6.5 billion). This performance keeps Grenke on track to hit its full-year leasing target of €3.2–3.4 billion.
Q2 momentum builds – Net interest income climbed 11.6% year-on-year to €100.9 million, driven by higher interest income (+€24.7 million to €165.0 million). Operating income from leasing and service businesses rose €17.0 million to €162.8 million, while operating expenses grew by a controlled €9.3 million, bringing the cost-income ratio down to 56.1% – well within the <60% target.
Operational resilience – Despite a €47.1 million hit from claims and provisions due to elevated insolvencies, Grenke delivered a Q2 operating result of €22.5 million and Group earnings of €16.0 million, marking a quarter-on-quarter profit recovery.
Strategic progress in leasing footprint – Grenke finalised the takeover of its Chile leasing franchise and is set to acquire operations in Latvia and Canada, completing a multi-year consolidation of original franchise partners for around €70 million.
CEO Dr Sebastian Hirsch: “The Q2 profit rebound signals a turning point. Leasing growth is solid, our cost discipline is paying off, and we remain on course for our full-year targets.”
CFO Dr Martin Paal: “We’ve passed the peak in losses and are managing costs in line with plan. This gives us confidence heading into the second half.”
2025 guidance reaffirmed – Group earnings expected at €71–81 million; leasing new business at €3.2–3.4 billion.

(NYSE:TPR) shares are trading higher on Friday.
On Thursday, the parent of Coach and Kate Spade posted fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share, ahead of the $1.02 consensus, on revenue of $1.72 billion, up 8% year-over-year and above expectations.
Coach saw strong handbag revenue growth, driven by a mid-teens AUR gain for the quarter and a low-double-digit gain for the year.

This reflects compelling innovation and broad-based traction across its leather goods offerings.
Telsey Advisory Group analyst Dana Telsey reiterated the Outperform rating on the stock, with a price forecast of $125.
For fiscal 2026, Tapestry expects revenue to approach $7.2 billion compared to the $6.96 billion estimate, reflecting low-single-digit growth from last year.
Telsey noted that the earnings outlook factors in some current mitigation efforts, but believes the company has more options to drive upside, making the guidance appear prudently conservative.
The firm expressed optimism over what seems to be a “strong start to fiscal year 2026” and said the higher dividend boosts confidence ahead of the September 10 Investor Day, where an updated strategy and long-term outlook are expected.
Tapestry is seeing more tariff pressure than anticipated, with the early end of the de minimis exemption adding to the impact, creating a combined $160 million profit hit, or 230 bps on margins, after mitigating 30% of a $235 million run rate.
This equates to a 60-cent EPS drag, most of which was not in place last quarter. The exemption, once expected to end in 2027, was cut short by executive order. By fiscal year 2027 to fiscal year 2028, mitigation efforts are expected to aid gross margins.
For fiscal year 2026, the analyst now projects revenue of $7.24 billion, up 3.2% from its prior $6.99 billion estimate, above the $7.16 billion consensus and in line with guidance of “approaching $7.2 billion,” expecting Coach to outperform and Kate Spade to underperform earlier forecasts.

A congressman filed, for the fourth time in a row, a bill that would ""reschedule"" cannabis.
-
This could be intended to prod President Trump into using his authority to effect the change.
The halting, stop-and-go journey that is American marijuana legalization seemed to pass through a green light on Wednesday. As a result, the shares of one of the more prominent multistate operators in the sector, Curaleaf (OTC: CURLF), motored to a gain of more than 10% on the day. That compared most favorably to the sluggish (0.3%) rise of the S&P 500 index that trading session.
A new push for rescheduling
President Trump is currently mulling a proposal to, on the federal level, reclassify marijuana as a less harmful drug -- at least, he said so in a press briefing on Monday. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, a Republican congressman quadrupled down on a legislative effort to get that job done.
Greg Steube of Florida filed a bill he's sponsoring, the ""Marijuana 1-to-3 Act,"" for the fourth session in a row. The name references the ""schedules"" used by the Drug Enforcement Agency, from 1 (for the most harmful drugs with minimal medical value) to 5 (least harmful). The proposed rescheduling of pot would knock it down from 1 to 3 within 60 days of the bill's passing, effectively legalizing it.
Steube has been an advocate for reform for years. In 2019, he said that if the restrictions on marijuana are loosened, ""the opportunities for research and study are drastically expanded.""
Legalize it, say Americans
Leaning toward legalization is a clever stance for a politician to take, as there is very broad public support for reform of the federal government's harsh, rigid stance on the drug. According to a 2024 survey conducted by Gallup and cited by PBS News, support for legalization has risen dramatically, to 68% last year from 36% in 2005.

Peter Thiel-Backed Bullish Is About to IPO. Should You Buy BLSH Stock?
What investors may be missing is Qualcomm's successful pivot beyond smartphones. While handset chip revenue grew a modest 7% to $6.3 billion, the company's diversification strategy is gaining serious traction. Automotive revenue surged 21% to $984 million, hitting a quarterly record, while Internet of Things (IoT) revenue jumped 24% to $1.7 billion.
The company's expansion into artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and PC processors, with its Snapdragon X platform, is expected to power over 100 PC models by 2026. The recent $2.4 billion acquisition of Alphawave Semi strengthens its data center capabilities as AI demand continues to surge.
Qualcomm returned $3.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks while maintaining healthy margins. In fiscal 2025 (ending in September), Qualcomm is forecast to pay an annual dividend of $3.59 per share, up from $3.51 per share in fiscal 2024. Moreover, these payouts are forecast to increase to $3.91 per share in fiscal 2028.
Is Qualcomm Stock a Good Buy Right Now?
Qualcomm recently unveiled an ambitious road map to reach $22 billion in combined automotive and IoT revenues by fiscal 2029. Nakul Duggal, GM of Auto, IoT, and Cloud, highlighted Qualcomm's decade-long transformation of automotive architecture through its Snapdragon Digital Chassis platform.

Previously, Goolsbee has spoken of a ""golden path"" that would combine moderating inflation and a stable labor market and lead to lower rates.
But in a CNBC interview Goolsbee said he still wants to see some more convincing data before the Federal Open Market Committee meets on Sept. 16-17. Goolsbee is one of 12 FOMC voters this year.
Reports this week on consumer and producer prices ""put in a note of unease"" on where inflation is headed, as services prices ""which are not obviously going to be transitory"" are ""kicking up,"" he said.
""So I feel like we still need another [inflation report], at least, to figure out if we're still on the golden path,"" Goolsbee said during a ""Squawk Box"" interview.
The July consumer price index was relatively in line with market forecasts, though the core reading that excludes food and energy nudged higher to 3.1%, a bit above Wall Street expectations. However, the July producer price index, which measures wholesale items, posted a surprisingly high 0.9% monthly gain that was the largest in about three years.
The data is being examined particularly closely for clues about the impact tariffs are having on inflation. While neither report showed significant obvious impacts, many economists believe the import duties President Donald Trump has imposed are slowly making their way into the data and will show up in coming months.
""It all depends on the data and what's the economic outlook. If we keep getting inflation reports like [previous] ones ... I would be very comfortable that, hey, the dust is out of the air, it looks like we're still where we were, which is a strong economy with inflation coming back down,"" Goolsbee said.
""In that circumstance ... the right thing to do [is] to just bring the rates down to where we think they're going to settle,"" he added. ""We've got to get some clarity from the numbers.""
Markets are placing a near certainty that the FOMC votes to lower the benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point in September, from the current 4.25% to 4.50% level. However, there are some misgivings about what happens from there, with 55% odds of another reduction in October and just a 43% probability of a third move in December, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.",bc57a6995e232db9794e5d384efc1038,trafilatura,2456,0

LONDON/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Carlsberg missed half-year profit and volume forecasts on Thursday and warned it did not expect the consumer environment to improve in the rest of 2025, sending the Danish brewer's shares down almost 7% in early trading.
The latest report by the world's third-largest brewer - behind Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken - was received with similar pessimism to those of its rivals in recent weeks as investors sent shares declining.
While Carlsberg, which makes Kronenbourg 1664, Tuborg and Somersby, raised the bottom end of its annual profit guidance, that did not offset slower-than-expected first-half operating profit growth of 2.3%, and a 1.7% decline in volumes.
CEO Jacob Aarup-Andersen said on a media call that the brewer's performance was strong in a difficult year, and that it anticipated slightly better volume growth in the second half.
Still, he wasn't optimistic on consumer spending, which was being reined in by price increases and uncertainty, adding: ""There is no indication as we move into the second half that that's going to change.""
Big brewers have been battling reduced demand, the impact of U.S. tariffs and poor weather, and their weak performance or volume expectations have left investors fretting over growth prospects.
Carlsberg's shares were down 5.8%, after earlier falling as much as 6.7%, its steepest decline since July 2024.
Haider Anjum, analyst from Jyske Bank, said he was surprised by the share price reaction, given Carlsberg's relatively strong performance.
But Laurence Whyatt, analyst at Barclays, said the market had been ""punishing volume misses"" like Carlsberg's, which was driven by a weaker-than-expected performance in Asia.
OPTIMISM FADES
As well as temporary challenges, brewers also face questions around longer-term shifts, such as some consumers cutting back on alcohol for health reasons.
Altogether, these issues have dampened earlier optimism around the sector.
Carlsberg had also pledged to deliver revenue growth of between 4% and 6% annually each year until 2027, but Aarup-Andersen told investors on a call that in a year like 2025, that may not be ""fully realistic.""
While it narrowed its expectations for annual operating profit growth to 3% to 5%, compared with 1% to 5% before, analysts said they were already expecting 4%.

So which way for LCID in 2025: A collapse to $1 or a rebound to $7?
About Lucid Stock
Based in California, Lucid Group is an electric vehicle maker focused on premium, long-range EVs. Best known for the Lucid Air sedan, the company builds vehicles at its Arizona facility and targets the luxury EV market as a rival to Tesla (TSLA). Recently, Lucid’s growth story has been clouded by production tweaks and tariff-driven margin pressure.
With a market cap near $7 billion, Lucid’s shares have lagged the broader market over the past year, falling 22.5%.
Despite underperforming, LCID faces a challenging valuation landscape. Its trailing EV-sales ratio is 9.4x, significantly higher than the sector median of 1.28x, indicating a very expensive stock compared to its peers. However, the price-book ratio of 2.12x is slightly undervalued compared to the sector median of 2.69x.
Lucid Misses Q2 Earnings Estimate
Lucid Group shares slid 9.7% on Aug. 6 after the EV maker missed Wall Street’s Q2 2025 expectations for both revenue and earnings. The company posted a loss of $0.24 per share, falling short by $0.22, while revenue rose 29% year over year to $259.4 million, missing estimates for $283.2 million.
Despite delivering a record 3,309 vehicles in the quarter, headwinds from tariffs and a trimmed production outlook weighed heavily on investor sentiment. Tariffs alone shaved $54 million off quarterly results, hitting the gross margin by 21 percentage points and leaving it deeply negative at -105%. Management said these pressures were anticipated and outlined plans to blunt the impact through localized sourcing, vertical integration, and cost optimization.",b69d2e08ad2e04ecc3982346573ebe0f,trafilatura,2452,0

While QUBT has soared a staggering 2,300% over the past 52 weeks, the quantum computing stock’s momentum has slowed considerably in 2025. The stock is underperforming the broader equities market so far this year, down roughly 10% for the period.
Highlights from QUBT’s Q2 Earnings
During the quarter, Quantum Computing strengthened its financial position through a $188 million private placement, resulting in a robust cash balance of $348.8 million. This should provide some crucial runway for their development plans.
Notable operational achievements include the completion of their quantum photonic chip foundry in Arizona and securing strategic orders from prestigious institutions like Delft University of Technology and a major automotive manufacturer, demonstrating growing market acceptance of their technology.
QUBT's commercial momentum is evidenced by recent contract wins, including a NIST award and an order from a Fortune 500 defense contractor for their TFLN photonic technology. The company has also expanded its reach through strategic partnerships, including a NASA subcontract worth up to $406,478 for quantum-based atmospheric sensing applications, while key leadership changes, such as the appointment of Dr. Yuping Huang as interim CEO, aim to further strengthen commercialization efforts.

Block’s second-quarter earnings call revealed a company hitting its stride through accelerated product development and strategic execution.

Cash App’s banking strategy is gaining traction, with 8 million active users either depositing paychecks or spending over $500 monthly, a 16% year-over-year increase.

In recent studies from BestBrokers.com, Nvidia’s operating margin was an astonishing 59.86% during its last four quarters, well ahead of peers like Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META). Such a level of profitability highlights how well-positioned Nvidia is at the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) explosion and how dominant it is in high-end GPUs for AI, gaming, and data centers.
The broad tech universe has seen spotty margin trends, where artificial-intelligence leaders have expanded their profit margins and hardware-based counterparts seen compression. The effectiveness of Nvidia sets it apart from not only peers but all of its Nasdaq majors, where averages are much lower. Investor conundrum: With NVDA around all-time highs, is its extraordinary effectiveness already priced in – or does the stock have further to run?

About Nvidia Stock
Nvidia is a world-leading company in accelerated computing and AI infrastructure, based in Santa Clara, California. The company develops GPUs, data center platforms, and AI software that are deployed across markets, ranging from autonomous vehicles through generative AI. With a $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia dominates the semiconductor and AI tech industry, providing key hardware and software ecosystems.
Shares of NVDA gained significantly over the past year, surging from an all-time 52-week low of $86.62 to a high of $184.48, a better-than 100% gain. That action handily beat out the S&P 500’s (SPY) about 25% gain during this same time period, which is a reflection of investors' enthusiasm for growth being fueled by AI.
From a valuation point of view, Nvidia is priced at 45.40 times forward earnings and 34.16 times sales, much higher than industry averages in the semiconductor sector. Even though multiples this high would normally be seen to reflect a premium, this valuation is justified through its 55.85% net profit margin and return on equity in excess of 105%. Despite this, investors are paying for quality and scalability in a world where Nvidia enjoys a near-monopoly position in high-end AI chips.",be98026daa5b2e1d89b2e3587ef11d70,trafilatura,2437,0

-Tapestry kept up a brisk pace of sales in the April-June quarter, with revenue likely growing 5.5%, thanks to growing demand for its stylish handbags that are more affordable than traditional luxury labels.
Accessible luxury companies, including Tapestry and Ralph Lauren, are gaining momentum in an economy hit by tariffs and inflation, where younger shoppers are being more prudent with their purchases. Shoppers are walking away from the more opulent wares offered by luxury firms, including Kering .
Revenue in the New York-based company's fiscal fourth quarter is expected to have climbed to $1.7 billion, its second-quickest pace of growth in 12 quarters, according to LSEG data. Last week, Tapestry's rival and Michael Kors-owner Capri forecast quarterly revenue above estimates.
Shares of Tapestry, which beat Wall Street revenue estimates in the past four quarters, have surged more than two-thirds this year. Revenue from the Coach brand, which accounted for 82% of the company's revenue for the first nine months of the year, likely grew almost 11% in the June quarter, according to LSEG estimates.
""They've successfully repositioned the brand to target younger demographics with their Tabby and Brooklyn Bag brands,"" said Adam Steffanus, a managing director at Advisory Research Investment Management, which owns Tapestry stock. Steffanus noted that sales of European luxury brands LVMH and Chanel have suffered because they raised their prices too high.
Tapestry said in May that it was well covered on cross-border tariff risk thanks to less than 10% of production from China and a diversified manufacturing base that includes 70% of production from Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Philippines.
Still, Tapestry's other brand, Kate Spade, has been a drag on its performance. The brand has suffered from heavy promotions that have hurt its status as an upscale brand, Steffanus said.
Morningstar analyst David Swartz said Coach could raise prices without driving away customers because of its high margins, but Tapestry cannot do the same for Kate Spade handbags.
Kate Spade's revenue likely fell 13% in the April-June period, according to LSEG estimates.
Tapestry reports earnings on Thursday. At least 16 analysts rate it ""buy"" or higher, with five rating it ""hold."" It has no ""sell"" calls, according to LSEG data.

Narrowing the focus, ROL’s underperformance is apparent compared to the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY). The exchange-traded fund has gained about 29.1% over the past year. However, ROL’s double-digit gains on a YTD basis outshine the ETF’s 2.5% returns over the same time frame.
Rollins’ success can be attributed to its effective use of technology and a careful approach to acquisitions. Innovations like BOSS and Orkin 2.0 have transformed ROL’s field operations, boosting customer satisfaction and reducing expenses. VRM and BizSuite have also improved scheduling and commercial sales. Additionally, ROL’s sound financial management, including a healthy cash reserve and no debt, has earned the trust of investors. With a record number of acquisitions in 2024 alone and a commitment to increasing dividends, ROL continues to impress and is poised for sustained growth in the future.
On Jul. 23, ROL reported its Q2 results, and shares closed up more than 5% in the following trading session. Its adjusted EPS of $0.30 surpassed Wall Street expectations of $0.29. The company’s revenue was $999.5 million, beating Wall Street forecasts of $979.4 million.
For the current fiscal year, ending in December, analysts expect ROL’s EPS to grow 12.1% to $1.11 on a diluted basis. The company’s earnings surprise history is mixed. It beat or matched the consensus estimate in three of the last four quarters while missing the forecast on another occasion.
Among the 12 analysts covering ROL stock, the consensus is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on six “Strong Buy” ratings, one “Moderate Buy,” and five “Holds.”",00bf26cf7ad3df3f880b3b4eda4fdac4,trafilatura,2426,0

According to the company, the new systems will be compatible with the upcoming NVIDIA HGX B300 platforms. The designs offer easy front I/O access, simplified cabling, improved thermal efficiency and compute density, and reduced operational expenses (OPEX).
“Supermicro’s DLC-2 enabled NVIDIA HGX B200 system leads our portfolio to achieve greater power savings and faster time to online for AI Factory deployments,” said Charles Liang, CEO and president, Supermicro. “Our Building Block architecture enables us to quickly deliver solutions exactly as our customers request.

The U.S. Justice Department recently charged former Zero Edge CEO Richard Kim with securities and wire fraud for allegedly diverting $3.8 million worth of seed round funding to himself for personal use, according to an indictment unsealed on Wednesday.
Zero Edge closed its $4.3 million seed funding round last June, and during a seven-day stretch that month, Kim allegedly misappropriated most of investors’ funds, with $1 million diverted to a personal account at Shuffle, a crypto-powered casino and sports betting platform.
Kim allegedly told one investor that the company had only $710,000 left—just one week after Zero Edge’s seed round closed—attributing the losses to “day trading.” Other investors were allegedly told the losses were from Zero Edge’s “treasury management strategy.”
Kim, a former executive at JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, told CoinDesk last year that “old demons” took over after he lost $80,000 to a phishing attack that started “a negative spiral of leverage trading, raising more capital, and hiding the truth.”
Following his arrest, Kim allegedly told the FBI that he was “clearly wrong from the beginning,” and that his conduct amounted to a “completely unjustifiable” betrayal to his investors.
Former OpenSea Manager Has Conviction Overturned in First-Ever Crypto Insider Trading Case
“Kim allegedly hedged his bets that false assurances would induce more investments and conceal the true nature of his spending,” FBI Assistant Director Christopher Raia said in a statement.
Kim worked at institutional crypto firm Galaxy Digital as a venture fund investor before he left to start Zero Edge, and Galaxy had invested in his firm, court documents show.
“Richard Kim left Galaxy in March 2024 to start Zero Edge, a company in which Galaxy had an immaterial balance-sheet investment,” a Galaxy spokesperson told Decrypt. “Upon learning of certain actions taken by Mr. Kim in his role at Zero Edge, we, along with other investors, reported his conduct to the authorities.”
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Kim with fraud in May, saying in a press release that he misappropriated investor funds “minutes” after receiving funds. The regulator noted that Zero Edge never launched, and the company is liquidating.",7c1cccd152bb9470fd2faebf4fd0ae50,trafilatura,2420,0

Despite delivering better-than-expected results, Camden’s stock prices dipped 2.1% in the trading session following the release of its Q2 results on Jul. 31.

However, its CFFO per share of $1.70 surpassed the Street estimates by 59 bps.
The drop in CPT stock prices can be attributed to the broader market downturn observed during the trading session, due to the chaos created by President Trump’s tariff announcements.

S&P cut the makeup company’s ratings to a “D” from a “CCC-minus” on Monday, citing the missed principal and interest payment on its $650 million term loan. Anastasia Beverly Hills entered into a forbearance agreement with lenders on July 25 that gave the company some breathing room, but the rating agency still viewed the situation unfavorably.
More from WWD
“Under the forbearance agreement, the term loan lenders agreed to not exercise certain remedies relating to the nonpayment until Sept. 10, 2025,” S&P Global said. “We view the transaction as distressed and do not have information on sufficient compensation to lenders for the deferral. In our view, this represents a default on the term loan because Anastasia did not meet its contractual obligation to pay principal and interest in a timely manner.”
Katherine Heng, a consumer analyst at S&P, said that the company had been downgraded twice in 2024 due to its credit facility expiration and the loan reaching maturity.
“We highlighted a higher risk of default back then, and then on Monday we lowered our rating to default,” Heng said. “The transaction itself is distressed.”
She said S&P would take another look at the rating after the Sept. 10 deadline on the forbearance.
Moody’s took similar action on Tuesday, downgrading the firm’s corporate family rating to “Ca” from “Caa3,” and the probability of default rating “D-PD” to “Caa3-PD.” The downgrade from Moody’s said the rating has a negative outlook.
“The ratings also incorporate the high likelihood of a debt restructuring or other form of a distressed exchange given the company’s very high leverage and ongoing cash flow deficits,” Moody’s said. “ABH’s scale remains modest, with revenue below $300 million, and Moody’s adjusted debt-to-EBITDA of 11.9x for the 12 months ending March 31, 2025. The company generated negative cash flow and faces intense competition within the beauty industry.”

Zooming in further, Globe Life’s shares have also outperformed the sector-specific ETF. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) has gained 22.7% over the past 52 weeks and 9.3% YTD.
The company’s outperformance can be attributed to positive industry dynamics and robust earnings. Globe Life’s stock reached a 52-week high of $144 on July 31, after it was revealed that both the Department of Justice and the SEC investigations on the company had concluded. The investigations focused on sales practices and uncertainties surrounding the company’s Health segment earnings.
On July 23, Globe Life released its second-quarter earnings, which sparked a more than 5% surge in its shares the following trading session. While the company’s topline of $1.48 billion fell short of Wall Street forecasts, its net operating income increased by 10.1% year-over-year (YOY) to $3.27 per share and was also higher than the $3.25 per share. Globe Life also repurchased 1.9 million shares of its common stock for $226 million during the quarter.
For the current year, ending in December 2025, analysts expect a 15.8% YOY growth in its EPS to $14.32 on a diluted basis. The company has a mixed history of surpassing consensus estimates, topping them in three of the trailing four quarters and missing them on one occasion.",1a0c4202155ab57beb320a800840b243,trafilatura,2387,0

Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Ryan Tomasello downgraded the stock from Market Perform to Underperform on Tuesday, maintaining a $1 price forecast.
Tomasello cut his rating on Opendoor following the company’s weak second-quarter results and steeply lowered outlook.
Also Read: Opendoor’s First Profit Since 2022 Fails To Calm Investor Criticism Of CEO
Analyst Tomasello has revised his financial forecasts, lowering his expectations for 2025 and 2026. He now projects an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) loss of 27 cents for 2025 and 22 cents for 2026, which is down from his previous estimates of a 21 cent and 14 cent loss, respectively.
Additionally, he has lowered his adjusted EBITDA outlook for the same periods to a loss of $72 million and $40 million, a significant drop from his earlier projections of a $44 million loss and a $30 million gain.
He noted that management guided second-half revenue about 40% below consensus and announced a pivot to an agent-led distribution model. While high retail investor interest may buoy valuation, Tomasello expects widening losses and strategic uncertainty to pressure shares, which trade near the high end of historical multiples.
His $1.00 price forecast remains unchanged, equating to 1.4 times fourth-quarter 2025 estimated BVPS and 1.3 times 2026 estimated gross profit.
The downgrade followed second-quarter revenue of $1.567 billion, up 4% year-over-year and above KBW’s $1.516 billion forecast, but contribution profit of $69 million fell short of his $73 million estimate.
Opendoor guided third-quarter revenue to $800 million–$875 million, well below KBW’s $1.039 billion projection, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $28 million–$21 million.
Management also expects a similar sequential revenue drop in the fourth quarter, driven by a mix of older, lower-margin homes that could delay margin improvement until after 2025.
Tomasello projects year-end 2026 liquidity of $649 million, before debt maturities and working capital needs.
Price Action: OPEN shares are trading lower by 2.83% to 2.400 at Wednesday’s last check.

The company’s issuer credit rating was raised to BBB-, the lowest high-grade level, from BB+, the highest junk grade, according to a statement from S&P. The ratings firm cited growth in Roblox’s user base and its gross bookings, as well as increasing free operating cash flow.

The gaming platform has been making a concerted effort to attract an older demographic of players who can spend more money on the platform, after making massive inroads with the under 13 crowd during the pandemic. Investment-grade credit ratings can translate to lower borrowing costs for a company, because a wider array of investors are eligible to buy high-grade securities.
Typically two of the three major rating firms need to deem a company high-grade for the firm to be eligible for investment-grade indexes. Roblox and its debt is still rated junk by Moody’s Ratings, while Fitch Ratings doesn’t appear to have assigned the company a grade.
Roblox shares have more than doubled this year and last hit a record in July after the company reported daily active users and bookings in the second quarter that beat analysts’ expectations. The company’s record-breaking game spurred much of the growth, attracting 22 million concurrent users in July.
Roblox surpassed 100 million daily active users for the first time ever in the quarter.
S&P said Roblox’s outlook is positive, meaning its ratings could be raised further over the medium-term. The company had net long-term debt of less than $1 billion as of June 30, according to a recent securities filing.

The new offering is the result of a collaborative effort with Oliver Wyman, which is also a part of the Marsh McLennan family.
The BrokerSafe facility utilises an underwriting technology tool that incorporates analytics and proprietary algorithms.
The tool provides an assessment of freight broker's contingent auto liability risk exposure.
With the backing of a panel of A-rated US insurers, BrokerSafe will offer contingent auto liability coverage that is aligned with the actual risk profile of freight brokers, the company said in its press release.
The facility provides up to $5m in primary limits, and there is an option for an additional $5m in excess capacity, which can be accessed from the London market.
Marsh US and Canada logistics practice leader Janelle Griffith stated: “In today’s complex liability risk landscape, freight brokers are looking for sustainable, long-term freight broker auto liability insurance that enables them to manage their risks more effectively.
“With BrokerSafe, Marsh and Oliver Wyman are transforming the freight broker auto liability insurance market by providing clients and underwriters the data and insights they need to make informed risk transfer decisions.”
In June, Marsh also launched Nimbus, an insurance facility focused on the construction of large-scale data centres in the UK and Europe.
Nimbus is designed to combine several types of coverage including construction all-risks, delay in start-up, property damage and business interruption.
It offers coverage capacity of up to €1bn ($1.17bn) for construction all-risks and up to €350m for delay in start-up.

Narrowing the focus, SPGI has lagged behind the iShares U.S. Broker-Dealers & Securities Exchanges ETF (IAI). The exchange-traded fund has gained about 44.7% over the past year. Moreover, the ETF’s 22.1% gains on a YTD basis outshine the stock’s returns over the same time frame.
SPGI's underperformance is attributed to modest auto demand in July, driven by concerns over affordability. Sales are expected to improve slightly as the market anticipates a second wave of pull-ahead demand in 2025, with a focus on battery electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of federal EV incentives on September 30th. This will help boost overall new vehicle volumes, but to a lesser extent than seen earlier this year.

Suncorp, now a pure-play general insurer since exiting its banking and life insurance divisions, benefited from favourable natural hazard costs, improved margins on higher policy prices and increased returns on investments in the year ended June 30.
The margin improvement was ""driven by the earn through of price increases that reflected inflation and a higher natural hazards allowance, especially in Consumer and New Zealand,"" the Brisbane-based insurer said.
Cash earnings for the year rose 8% to A$1.49 billion, beating the Visible Alpha consensus estimate of A$1.47 billion, while statutory profit soared 52% to A$1.82 billion on one-off gains from the sale of its banking unit.
""The market should like the higher-than-expected share buy-back, while the small beat relative to consensus should also be received positively,"" Citi analysts wrote in a note.
Suncorp's shares were trading over 3% higher at A$20.725 by 0030 GMT, after jumping as much as A$20.970 earlier in the day.
The company's underlying insurance trading ratio, a key profitability indicator, ticked 8 basis points higher to 11.9% in the year to June 30, while its net investment returns jumped 16% to A$766 million.
Natural hazard costs came in at A$1.36 billion, more than A$200 million below its allowance for the year.
Suncorp's gross written premiums rose 6% to A$15.01 billion in 2025, and are expected to grow in mid-single digits in the current fiscal year. The underlying insurance trading ratio is targeted to be in the top half of the 10% to 12% range.
The general insurer also announced an on-market share buyback of up to A$400 million, just six months after it returned A$4.1 billion capital return through share consolidation. It declared a final dividend of 49 cents per share.
Earlier this month, Suncorp's rivals QBE Insurance and Insurance Australia Group also reported higher profits on the back of lower catastrophe claims and natural peril costs, as well as higher premiums.

(Reuters) -Australia's Telstra forecast a rise in annual operating earnings that fell short of market view, sending its shares more than 2% lower on Thursday, even as the telecom firm announced a A$1 billion ($656.10 million) share buyback plan.
The company expects between A$8.15 billion and A$8.45 billion in underlying operating earnings adjusted for lease amortisation in fiscal 2026, compared with A$8.02 billion reported for 2025.
The mid-point of the forecast range was lower than street consensus of A$8.44 billion, according to Jefferies.
Telstra shares fell more than 2% to A$4.88, their lowest in a month, and were among the biggest losers in the ASX 200 benchmark index, which was trading 0.7% higher, as of 0109 GMT.
Analysts at Jefferies said the earnings composition was ""a bit disappointing"", pointing to softer-than-expected earnings from Telstra's mobile division and a slowdown in customer growth in the second half of the year.
""The FY26 guidance consensus forecast is already at the top end, so there is a risk that consensus forecast may need to be reduced just to bring that into the middle of the range,"" said Roger Samuel, a TMT equity analyst at Jefferies.
Samuel said the higher-than-expected share buyback looked to have capped the losses in shares.
Telstra's A$1 billion share repurchase plan follows the A$750 million buyback announced in February, and underscores the firm's earnings growth and strong balance sheet.
The buyback is enabled by Telstra's earnings growth and strong balance sheet, and demonstrates the management's confidence in its financial strength and outlook, CEO Vicki Brady said.
Telstra reported 2025 underlying operating earnings of A$8.61 billion, 14% higher than last year and in line with a Visible Alpha consensus. Its statutory profit jumped 31% to A$2.34 billion, in line with street view.
Strong contribution from the mobile, fixed consumer, small business, and enterprise divisions helped Telstra's 2025 profit, further propped up by its cost management initiatives.
Telstra declared a final dividend of 9.5 Australian cents per share, slightly higher than the 9 Australian cents declared for the previous year.

CoreWeave stock has been on an absolute tear since its debut in late March. Even after today’s dip, it’s up roughly 200% versus its initial public offering (IPO) price of just $40.
Why the Lockup Expiration Is Negative for CoreWeave Stock
Investors are concerned that CRWV shares could sink rather significantly once the lockup period expires on Aug. 14 after market close.
Why? Because the lockup period essentially refers to a set timeframe (often 90 to 180 days) during which insiders and early investors are restricted from selling a company’s stock.
Now that it’s expiring for CoreWeave, insiders may consider trimming their stake in the AI infrastructure firm, especially since its share price has nearly quadrupled since late April.
In short, if insiders and early investors do indeed choose to take profit after the lockup expires, the added supply could exert pressure on CoreWeave stock over the next few weeks.
HSBC Warns of a Massive Crash in CRWV Shares
HSBC analysts recommend selling the post-earnings rip in CoreWeave shares because the artificial intelligence infrastructure company lacks revenue diversification.
In its research note, the investment firm said lower utilization of data center assets could materially contract CRWV margins to 60.4% in the second half of this year.
Then of course, there’s the valuation overhang. The AI stock is currently trading at a price-sales (P/S) ratio of about 26x, overly stretched given the Nasdaq-listed firm is yet to turn a profit.
HSBC maintained its $32 price target on CRWV shares today indicating potential downside of nearly 75% from here.

U.S. stock buybacks are on track to hit a record $1.1 trillion in 2025, sparking sharp debate among experts like Mark Cuban and Georgetown professor Rush Doshi over their economic impact and taxation.
Record Stock Buybacks Fuel Corporate Wealth But Also Raise Concerns
Doshi, assistant professor at Georgetown University and former Joe Biden NSC China advisor, highlighted the historic surge in U.S. stock buybacks, projecting $1.1 trillion in 2025 — a new all-time high, citing Birinyi Associates data going back to 1982.
He contrasted this with China's investment-driven approach, warning, ""This is the path to deindustrialization, decline, and defeat. American competitors in China don't do buybacks. They invest.""
Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.
Stock buybacks, also known as share repurchases, occur when companies buy their own shares to reduce outstanding stock, boost earnings per share and often raise stock prices.
While buybacks can reward shareholders with increased ownership stakes and potential returns, critics argue they divert cash from critical investments like research and development.

Mark Cuban Calls For Billionaires’ Tax To Encourage Reinvestment
Cuban responded to Doshi's concerns by advocating for a higher tax on stock buybacks, framing it as a billionaire's tax.
The popular investor took to X, formerly Twitter, and said that increased buyback taxes would push companies to reinvest profits into growth or pay dividends — with qualified dividends often tax-free for many Americans.
""Charging a higher buyback tax not only increases tax revenues, if the company does pay a dividend, married households making under $94k pay no taxes on it. If I own it. I pay full taxes,"" Cuban wrote.
He noted this idea has been favored by some Democrats and argued it could generate more equitable revenue from the biggest public companies.",6c01cd25455955ae0aee2765a2225582,trafilatura,2318,0

(NYSEAMERICAN:NG) is one of the 13 Most Promising Gold Stocks According to Wall Street Analysts. On July 15, Citi initiated coverage on NovaGold Resources Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:NG), giving the stock a Buy rating and setting the price target at $7.00.
Citi pointed out that NovaGold Resources Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:NG) is still trading well below its 2020 levels of about $10 per share. This was when gold was trading below $2,00 per ounce.
The firm described NovaGold Resources Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:NG) as “High-Risk” because it is a junior company that has not yet produced gold. While it offers investors significant leverage to gold prices, there is also huge execution risk.
NovaGold Resources Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:NG) owns 60% of the Donlin Gold project in Alaska, while Paulson Advisers LLC owns the other 40%. Citi noted that this project has the potential to become the second-largest gold mine in the US, with production capacity of about 1.5 million ounces of gold.
However, the project faces major development challenges, including an estimated $10 billion capital expenditure requirement. Citi also pointed out that the recent exit of Barrick Mining Corporation (B) serves as a catalyst to advance the project after over 20 years of inactivity.
The Donlin Gold project timeline remains extended, with a new Technical Report expected in the second half of 2027 and no mine production expected before at least 2030. According to Citi, the project becomes attractive at gold prices above $2,500 per ounce but it might not make economic sense if gold prices are under $2,000 per ounce.
NovaGold Resources Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:NG) is a precious metals company focused on the development of the Donlin Gold project in Alaska.

With a market cap of over $85 billion, the company operates cruise brands like Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, Azamara, and Silversea Cruises, and holds interests in TUI Cruises, Pullmantur, and SkySea Cruises.
The cruise giant has significantly outperformed the broader market over the past year. RCL stock has soared 102.8% over the past 52 weeks and 35.9% on a YTD basis, outpacing the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) 19% surge over the past year and 10% returns in 2025.

Narrowing the focus, RCL has also outperformed the sector-focused Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLY) 29.1% surge over the past 52 weeks and 2.5% uptick in 2025.
Royal Caribbean Cruises’ stock prices dropped more than 5% in the trading session following the release of its mixed Q2 results on Jul. 29. Driven by continued growth in ticket sales and onboard and other revenues, the company’s overall topline for the quarter grew by a solid 10.4% year-over-year to $4.5 billion. However, the figure missed the Street’s expectations by a tiny margin. Given RCL's outperformance over the past year, this triggered profit booking among investors.
Nonetheless, its overall performance remained more than impressive. RCL’s adjusted net income increased 36.3% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, and its adjusted EPS of $4.38 exceeded the consensus estimates by 6.8%. Further, its operating cash flows grew 16.3% year-over-year to $3.4 billion.
For the full fiscal 2025, ending in December, analysts expect RCL to deliver an adjusted EPS of $15.62, up 32.4% year-over-year. Further, the company has a robust earnings surprise history. It has surpassed the Street’s bottom-line projections in each of the past four quarters.
The stock maintains a consensus “Strong Buy” rating overall. Of the 24 analysts covering the RCL stock, opinions include 17 “Strong Buys,” one “Moderate Buy,” and six “Holds.”
This configuration is slightly less optimistic than three months ago, when the stock had 18 “Strong Buy” recommendations.",0345802794b5245ba01cc54a4e5a0407,trafilatura,2282,0

An executive in suit presenting a large touch screen of the company's cloud-based enterprise platform.
On August 7, The Trade Desk reported its Q2 2025 earnings, where revenue came in at $694 million. This is a 19% year-over-year increase, but down 25% compared to the previous quarter, and below the expected 22% growth rate.
Jefferies noted that The Trade Desk faces increased competition, particularly from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which secured content deals with Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) and Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS). The analysts pointed to this fact as one of the factors contributing to The Trade Desk’s slowdown in Q2 2025. The firm cited additional pressures, including advertisers shifting budgets to the first quarter to avoid tariff-related uncertainty, senior management changes, a major company reorganization, and a slower-than-expected rollout of The Trade Desk’s new Kokai platform.
Jefferies described The Trade Desk’s third-quarter revenue forecast of “at least 14% growth” as weak, especially compared to solid results from other advertising firms. Accordingly, the firm reduced its adjusted EBITDA estimates for 2025 and 2026 by 1% and 6%, respectively.

US stocks climbed on Wednesday with the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) notching back-to-back record highs as investors bet almost unanimously on a Federal Reserve rate cut at its next meeting following the latest inflation data.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the major gauges, closing up above 1%, or more than 450 points. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier gains but still rose around 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively.
The Dow is once again within striking distance of an all-time high last reached in December.
The gains followed a big upswing in stocks on Tuesday after the release of the July Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both touching new records. Though the data showed inflation had ticked up, it increased less than expected.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also on Wednesday called on the Fed to lower rates by 150 to 175 basis points.
""I think we could go into a series of rate cuts here, starting with a 50 basis point rate cut in September,"" he told Bloomberg.
The result has been a surge in bets that the Fed would cut interest rates at its September policy meeting, especially in light of recent warning signs the labor market is weakening. By Wednesday afternoon, traders had fully priced in a September cut, according to the CME Group, with bets also rising on a potential ""jumbo"" cut of 50 basis points.

EBITDA reached $293 million for the quarter and $659 million for the first half of the year. Net income for H1 2025 was $246 million, which is 8% lower than in the previous year. Management attributed the decrease to higher expenses for general and administrative functions, as well as higher depreciation.

Revenue for the quarter fell by 7.3%. The company stated that the decline was primarily because of lower energy sales in the Generation Segment. The quarter’s operating revenues were $1.177 billion, down 12.6% compared to Q2 2024.
Operational performance was also weak. Net electricity generation dropped 5% year-over-year, totaling 5.9 terawatt-hours (TWh). This decline was attributed to weaker hydropower output (hydro dispatch) and lower renewable electricity production. The company added that transmission bottlenecks and some unavailable thermal (gas or coal) units also caused efficiency losses.
Despite the challenges, the company’s procurement and services dropped 16.1% year-over-year for the first half and nearly 20% for Q2 alone. The cash flow from operations surged to $403 million in H1 2025, much higher than in 2024.

The Solana-based meme token traded in a $0.000031 range, representing 13% volatility, as traders capitalized on short-term momentum, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model.
The rally began after BONK established solid support at $0.000024, with buying interest intensifying. Momentum carried through to the early hours of Aug. 13, where the token reached its daily high of $0.000027 between 03:00 and 04:00 UTC.
Trading volumes consistently outpaced the 24-hour average of 956.8 billion tokens, signaling strong participation from both retail traders and larger market players.
However, the gains proved difficult to sustain.
BONK reversed by 1% during the U.S. morning, slipping from $0.000027 to $0.00002646. The heaviest selling pressure came at 12:52 UTC, when a sharp decline accompanied a 38-billion-token volume spike, suggesting profit-taking by larger holders.
As background, BONK’s trading activity comes days after Nasdaq-listed Safety Shot disclosed a $25 million allocation to the token’s ecosystem via Bonk.fun’s launchpad platform. While that announcement preceded this rally, it underscores institutional interest in the project.
With support still intact at $0.000024 and resistance firmly established at $0.000027, traders will be watching closely to see if BONK can break higher in the coming sessions or consolidate before its next major move.

You know markets are fully risk-on when cryptocurrencies are on a tear, with bitcoin joining global stocks to scale a record peak as the near certainty of U.S. interest rate cuts bolsters risk sentiment and weighs on the dollar.
The world's best-known cryptocurrency, bitcoin, has a lot going for it: prospects of lower interest rates, a more favourable regulatory environment, and bullish inflows from institutional investors.
Ether too has been on the charge, hovering near its highest since November 2021, becoming the token of choice for those looking for more active returns. In fact, ether is up 42% this year, outstripping the 32% gain for bitcoin.
Stocks in Asia were taking a bit of a breather after a blistering rally this week. Japanese shares fell after hitting a record high, while tech-heavy Taiwan and South Korean shares eased after recent highs.
Investors are wagering that the Federal Reserve will resume cutting interest rates from next month, with traders starting to even price in odds of a 50 basis points cut after comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.
""If we'd seen those numbers in May, in June, I suspect we could have had rate cuts in June and July. So that tells me that there's a very good chance of a 50 basis-point rate cut,"" in September, Bessent said in an interview on Bloomberg Television.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has been regularly lambasted by U.S. President Donald Trump, is expected to speak at a central bank research conference in Wyoming next week and the focus will be on his tone on policy path.
Bessent also said the Bank of Japan will likely be raising interest rates as it is behind the curve in dealing with the risk of inflation, leading to strong gains in the yen, which stayed around its strongest level in three weeks.
Investor focus during European hours will be on a swathe of economic data that will offer a glimpse of the tariff uncertainties and the impact of the duties on the economy.

We raise our FY26 EPS estimate 12 cents due to higher gross margins and modestly raise FY27 EPS. Our target adjusts to $260, and we think concerns about the Siri delay are overblown since Apple isn’t losing share. Reiterate Buy.”
Melius is optimistic that a new iPhone product cycle starting in September will likely improve product mix. This will in turn boost growth in high single digits during some quarters.
“We are optimistic that our iPhone estimates can be conservative based on new product cycles that include an “iPhone Air” this September, a foldable model in FY26 and the iPhone 20 line-up in late FY27 (20th year anniversary models). Luckily for Apple, its iPhone base doesn’t seem to care about the Siri/AI delays, and we see no evidence of real switching.”
With more iPhone catalysts, expensive models such as foldables will likely help increase total revenue.
“The iPhone has more catalysts in 2026 with the introduction of a foldable model that should be priced around $2,000 and then the iPhone 20 (“20th anniversary”) cycle in 2027. As foldables “mix in” there can be big revenue growth even on flat units.”
Apple is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and services.

(NYSE:NIO) is one of the best NYSE penny stocks to invest in now. On August 1, Macquarie upgraded NIO’s rating from “Neutral” to “Outperform” and raised its 12-month price target on the company’s U.S.-listed shares from $3.90 to $5.50. The decision came right after NIO launched the new ONVO L90 SUV, which Macquarie analysts described as a “potential blockbuster” and possibly NIO’s “most competitive offering” to date.
The L90 is a six-seat SUV priced at RMB 265,800 ($36,857). This pricing, the analysts noted, undercut rivals like Li Auto’s L8 by 17% but offers similar features, and comes close to the price of Tesla’s five-seat Model Y. The analysts highlighted the family-focused positioning of the L90, emphasizing space and usability over advanced tech. They see this as a key way for NIO to address its “core problem of insufficient volume” in past sales.
Macquarie projects monthly sales for the L90 could reach 8,000–12,000 units and describes the vehicle as a possible “category killer” in its segment. As a result, the analysts raised their FY25 and FY26 NIO vehicle delivery forecasts by 7% and 10% respectively (to 347,000 and 500,000 vehicles).
NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) is a Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer that designs, builds, and sells premium smart EVs, including the ET5, ET7, ES6, and EC7.

A wave of devastating cyberattacks has battered Australia, including a 2022 breach at telecom major Optus that exposed the personal data of up to 10 million users, and a hack on health insurer Medibank affecting nearly 10 million customers.
In July, Qantas Airways disclosed that criminals had infiltrated one of its call centres, accessing personal information of six million customers.
Private equity firm BGH Capital, which is selling CyberCX, has not disclosed any financial terms. Accenture declined to provide additional details, while BGH Capital didn't respond to Reuters' requests for comment on the reported valuation.
The deal underscores the surging demand for advanced digital security services as businesses worldwide face increasingly sophisticated cyber threats that disrupt operations and compromise sensitive data.
Melbourne-based CyberCX was formed in 2019 through the merger of 12 smaller cybersecurity firms backed by BGH Capital.
The company now employs about 1,400 people and runs security operations centres across Australia and New Zealand, with offices in London and New York.
CyberCX is led by John Paitaridis, formerly managing director of Optus Business, and Chief Strategy Officer Alastair MacGibbon, Australia's former national cybersecurity coordinator.
The leadership's ties to Optus are notable, given the telecommunications company's 2022 data breach, which exposed names, birth dates, addresses, phone numbers, email contacts and passport and driver's license numbers.
Since 2015, Accenture has completed 20 security acquisitions, including recent purchases of Brazilian cyber defense firm Morphus, MNEMO Mexico and Spain-based Innotec Security.
On the domestic front, the firm entered into a $700 million collaborative agreement with Telstra in February, aiming to implement AI capabilities across the telecommunications company.

For the second half, the company expects attributable production to be between 400,000 and 485,000 ounces.

Cantor Fitzgerald highlighted concerns about the Health Insurance Exchange (HIX) business, noting that Molina’s 2025 HIX Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) guidance increased by 510 basis points to 85.1%. The analysts stated that the MLR guidance suggests that the HIX product line may operate at “break-even to negative low-single-digit margins,” compared to Elevance Health’s estimated 2-3% margins. Nonetheless, the firm noted that the revised guidance aligns more closely with investor expectations, especially after Elevance Health’s comments, which should provide more stability for Molina’s stock.
Cantor Fitzgerald stated that new uncertainties emerged during the second quarter of 2025. This includes challenges in determining “clean numbers” (excluding one-time SG&A benefits) and understanding why Molina’s Medicare MLR increased by 100 basis points. The firm pointed out that Molina’s Medicare book primarily consists of dual-eligible beneficiaries, which may explain the discrepancy.

Bullish, a cryptocurrency exchange operator, shares surged in their NYSE debut, opening at $90 — more than double the $37 IPO price.
The strong listing reflects investor optimism in the crypto-focused exchange, marking one of the year’s biggest opening-day pops and signaling robust market appetite for digital asset-related stocks.
Bullish, a crypto exchange funded by Peter Thiel and run by former NYSE president Tom Farley, had a huge first day on the New York Stock Exchange on August 13. The company raised roughly $1.1 billion in its initial public offering.
Join the discussion with CryptoWendyO on Roundtable here.
Launched in 2021, Bullish aims to bring institutional-controlled DeFi protocols and the security of a centralized exchange together. ""
The last leg of growth in crypto, the last 10 years, was basically all retail and … the institutional wave has begun,"" Farley told CNBC, saying that early IPO demand points towards lots of interest from buyers with risk capital at professional funds.
“It's here, and it's a question of how big it will be. Based on the reception we’ve gotten thus far as part of our IPO, it feels like institutional investors feel like this could be the moment,"" said Farley.
Since debut, Bullish has handled more than $1.25 trillion in deals as of March 31 and also owns crypto news media site CoinDesk.
The stock started at $90, which was 143% more than its initial public offering (IPO) price of $37. It was then stopped at about $102.44 per share. The firm, which is based in the Cayman Islands, set the price for its IPO far higher than expected.
The price range was first established at $28 to $31, then $32 to $33 this week, which gave the company a market value of over $5.4 billion before trading started.
The listing comes at a time when a lot of crypto businesses are going public. At press time, Bullish was trading at $86.40, up 133.51%.

The shares—BLSH—rose as high as $118 after being offered at $37 in the IPO. Shares were recently trading for about $84 a pop after dipping from the early afternoon peak, currently up 126% on the day.
Bullish's market value was $12.2 billion, based on the outstanding shares listed in its filing. The firm's platform allows clients to buy, sell, and bet on the future price of digital coins and tokens, with Bullish more focused on institutional investors rather than retail traders.
The firm's debut comes as other major companies in the space have also hit traditional markets: San Francisco-based Circle, which issues the USDC stablecoin, had a roaring June NYSE debut where its stock tripled from its original IPO price of $31 per share before soaring to a peak of $299. It was recently trading at $153.
And brokerage platform eToro's stock closed 29% higher following its Nasdaq debut in May.
Bullish CEO Tom Farley, who previously was NYSE's president, said in August that the firm intended to IPO as ""the digital assets industry is beginning its next leg of growth.""
Back in 2021, the Peter Thiel-backed firm—which is also now the parent company of crypto publication CoinDesk—agreed to go public via merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Far Peak in a merger that valued the firm around $9 billion.
But the plans fell apart a year later due to ""time constraints and market conditions"" during a brutal bear market and the collapse of several top crypto companies.

(Reuters) -U.S. energy firms this week held the number of oil and natural gas rigs operating steady, energy services firm Baker Hughes said in its closely followed report on Friday.
The oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, remained at 539 in the week to August 15.
Baker Hughes said oil rigs rose by one to 412 this week, while gas rigs fell by one to 122.
In Texas, the biggest oil and gas-producing state, the rig count fell by one to 242, the lowest since September 2021.
In Wyoming, the rig count fell by one to 13, the lowest since August 2024.
In the Permian basin in West Texas and eastern New Mexico, the biggest U.S. oil-producing shale formation, the rig count fell by one to 255, the lowest since September 2021.
The oil and gas rig count declined by about 5% in 2024 and 20% in 2023 as lower U.S. oil and gas prices over the past couple of years prompted energy firms to focus more on boosting shareholder returns and paying down debt rather than increasing output.
The independent exploration and production (E&P) companies tracked by U.S. financial services firm TD Cowen said they planned to cut capital expenditures by around 4% in 2025 from levels seen in 2024.
That compares with roughly flat year-over-year spending in 2024, increases of 27% in 2023, 40% in 2022, and 4% in 2021.
Even though analysts forecast U.S. spot crude prices would decline for a third year in a row in 2025, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected crude output would rise from a record 13.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024 to around 13.4 million bpd in 2025.
On the gas side, the EIA projected a 65% increase in spot gas prices in 2025 would prompt producers to boost drilling activity this year after a 14% price drop in 2024 caused several energy firms to cut output for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic reduced demand for the fuel in 2020. [NGAS/POLL]
The EIA projected gas output would rise to 106.4 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2025, up from 103.2 bcfd in 2024 and a record 103.6 bcfd in 2023.

Investors Are Wary or Worse About Its Stock . ,2025-08-15 16:15:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Can Target turn it around?
That's the big question ahead of Wednesday morning, when the big retailer is set to report its latest financial results. Those numbers, along with whatever the company says about its outlook and the state of its business, could go a long way toward restoring investor confidence in a stock that's lost nearly one-quarter of its value this year while Walmart (WMT) has posted a double-digit advance.
There's a simple enough reason investors have been cautious around Target's (TGT) stock, which fell in the wake of its first-quarter earnings report and has since crept gently higher. Executives in May clipped the company's outlook for 2025, setting investors up to expect declining sales and lower earnings per share than previously forecast.
Wall Street is looking for revenue and adjusted net income to fall year-over-year in the second quarter, according to Visible Alpha data, with same-store sales also seen declining.
One measure of the wariness out there: As of today, there's a sell-side analyst with a full-on bearish take on the stock. Bank of America on Friday downgraded the shares to ""underperform""—the only such rating tracked by Visible Alpha—and a $93 price target more than 10 bucks below Thursday's close.
The wider picture shows a number of analysts with neutral ratings on the stock, though a few still hold bullish ratings. Oppenheimer analysts on Friday suggested buying dips, as ""volatile trading could continue until comps return to positive territory."" Visible Alpha's consensus target around $104 in line with the stock's finish yesterday.
Bank of America analysts said they're less concerned with next week's results than the broader story, citing worries about digital sales, the state of Target's digital advertising and third-party marketplace, and tariff concerns. They also pointed to competitive pressure from Walmart, which reports its own results on Thursday, and Amazon (AMZN), which this week pushed further into the grocery business.
""Target's longer-term outlook,"" they wrote, ""is becoming more uncertain.""

The analysts had also anticipated that the company would raise its full-year EBITDA guidance to $705–$725 million due to “strong demand in North America, ongoing volume growth in Europe, and modest upside from foreign exchange movements.”

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CFO.com newsletter.
The finance chief of technical products and services provider Diploma plc is stepping down following a “lapse in judgment” at a recent company event, the London-based company said Thursday.
Chris Davies had been in the company’s CFO seat since November 2022, per his LinkedIn profile. His resignation took effect immediately, Diploma officials said in a Thursday news release.
Details on the executive’s actions were sparse as of Thursday morning. Diploma officials said only that his “personal behavior” at an unnamed company event “did not meet the high standards required of the Group's leadership team.”
The company said his resignation isn’t related to Diploma’s financial performance and won’t affect its guidance for the remainder of its 2025 fiscal year.
Diploma in its 2024 fiscal year recorded total revenue of £1.36 billion, up 14% over the prior year, according to earnings reports.
The company, which says it employs 3,600 people, sells a wide range of products, including fasteners, cables and surgical instruments. In its 2024 annual report, Davies cited the company’s “diversified portfolio” as a growth driver.
“Organic growth is our first priority and each of our value-add businesses drives this through end-market expansion, geographic penetration and product extension,” he said at the time. “Our diverse portfolio of businesses means that this growth is both strong and resilient.”
A media representative for Diploma didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday morning.
The incident underscores the fact that executives’ behavior, both on and off the clock, can have major ramifications for businesses.
In July, for instance, the tech firm Astronomer faced a leadership crisis after its CEO and chief people officer were caught hugging on a jumbotron during a Coldplay concert in Massachusetts. Both went on to resign from the company. Such incidents can erode trust in a company at large, HR Dive reported recently.",0def6ccdf447658f7c0b069c1bc36b43,trafilatura,2090,0

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.
Macroeconomist and technical analyst Henrik Zeberg issued a stern warning about the cryptocurrency market on Tuesday, describing it as the “Bubble of this era” and predicting a big crash.
When Is The Blow-Off Top Coming?
In an X post, Zeberg called the current state of the market “insane” and predicted a “horrendous” crash.
Zeberg marked the so-called “Bubble” area on a chart, with a projected peak market valuation of $12.95 trillion around late 2025 and early 2026. The chart has multiple “Euphoria” labels, representing previous bull runs in 2017 and 2021, followed by a sharp downturn.
Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.
The structure resembled a rising wedge formation, a bearish technical analysis pattern that signals a potential reversal of an uptrend.
The chart indicated that after achieving its peak valuation, the market would face a catastrophic decline, potentially plunging to $93 billion. For context, the cryptocurrency market was worth $4 trillion as of this writing.

“The extreme Rally to the BlowOffTop is on. This is where a lot of money can be made as Euphoria develops right into the top of the Business Cycle,” Zeberg added.
A cryptocurrency enthusiast, going by the pseudonym doc_ley on X, questioned Zeberg’s prediction, noting that the $12.95 trillion would likely take until mid- to late-2026, which also appears unkiley owing to the expected “U.S. recession.”
What Are Other Analysts Saying?
Zeberg’s warning aligns with his previous statements, where he described Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and the Nasdaq Composite index as being in a tech-driven bubble. He predicted a crash that could bring both assets back to 2022 levels.",a76ad2fc2ba447819ca651cced91560c,trafilatura,2087,0

Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter also fell to $25.9 million from $50.7 million in Q2 2024.

West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures fell as much as 1.6% to hover above $62 per barrel. Brent crude (BZ=F), the international benchmark, also dropped to trade below $65 per barrel before paring losses.
Prices took a leg lower after government data showed that US crude stockpiles rose last week to 3.04 million barrels, the highest level in two months.
Fears of oversupply in the market were accentuated by a report from the International Energy Agency indicating world supply could outpace demand by a record 2.96 million barrels per day in 2026, surpassing even the glut buildup during the pandemic in 2020.
The report points to increases in production from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) and strong output driven by non-OPEC nations such as the US, Brazil, and Guyana.
The agency also noted global oil inventories rose for the fifth consecutive month in June to reach a 46-month high.
""While oil market balances look ever more bloated as forecast supply far eclipses demand towards year-end and in 2026, additional sanctions on Russia and Iran may curb supplies from the world's third and fifth largest producers,"" the report said.
On Wednesday, President Trump said Russia would face ""severe consequences"" if Moscow did not stop the ongoing war in Ukraine following an upcoming summit between the president and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, though he did not specify what those measures were.
Goldman Sachs analysts also see the possibility of sanctions on oil-producing nations as a catalyst that could cause prices to rise. However, the firm's base case for now is that Brent will average $64 per barrel in the fourth quarter of this year and $56 in 2026 due to excess supply.

S . a  surveillance empire  over trackers in chip shipments,2025-08-15 15:45:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"BEIJING (Reuters) -The United States' practice of installing location trackers in chip shipments at risk of diversion to China reflects the ""instincts of a surveillance empire,"" China's state-run media outlet Xinhua said in a commentary published on Friday.
Reuters reported earlier this week that U.S. authorities had secretly placed location tracking devices in targeted shipments of advanced chips to detect diversions to China, which is under U.S. curbs for advanced chip exports.
The Xinhua commentary, titled ""America turns chip trade into a surveillance game,"" cited ""reports"" that Washington had embedded such trackers, accusing the United States of running ""the world's most sprawling intelligence apparatus"".
The U.S. government has in the past few years tightened restrictions on the exports of advanced chips as well as related technology and equipments to China, as the two superpowers vie for technological dominance.
The Chinese commentary follows longstanding accusations from Washington and its Western allies that China could use some exported products, from telecommunications equipment to vehicles, for surveillance, posing potential security risks.
In 2022, the Biden administration banned the sale and import of new telecommunications equipment from several Chinese firms, including Huawei, citing national security concerns. In January, it intensified scrutiny by targeting China-made cars and trucks.
In its commentary, Xinhua accused the U.S. government of seeing its trading partners as ""rivals to be tripped up or taken down,"" adding that ""if U.S. chips are seen as Trojan horses for surveillance, customers will look elsewhere.""
China's cyberspace watchdog last month said it had asked U.S. chipmaker Nvidia to explain whether its H20 chips had any backdoor security risks - a hidden method of bypassing normal authentication or security controls.
Chinese authorities have also cautioned domestic tech firms over their use of H20 chips, Reuters recently reported.

A meeting between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin was also in focus as traders looked for clues on how the outcome could steer markets.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose just above the flatline, trimming earlier gains to fall short of a record close. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lost 0.4% after President Trump said he would soon announce tariffs on semiconductor imports.
US Census Bureau data released Friday morning showed retail sales rose 0.5% in July from the prior month. That was less than the 0.6% gain expected by economists but still viewed as a solid advance after a sharp pullback in consumer spending this spring.
Meanwhile, US consumer sentiment deteriorated in August, falling for the first time in four months as inflation expectations jumped in the longer term.
Stocks wobbled on Thursday, ending a two-day rally sparked by investor confidence that an interest rate cut in September was nearly certain. Doubts about a significant cut at the Fed's next policy meeting crept in after July's Producer Price Index (PPI) came in hotter than expected.
Major Dow component UnitedHealth (UNH) stock soared on Friday after a regulatory filing showed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B, BRK-A) bought 5 million shares in the company.
Intel (INTC) shares also jumped Friday after a Bloomberg report said the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in the chipmaker, using funds from the US CHIPS Act. President Trump met with Intel's CEO on Monday after calling on him to resign the previous week.

Clear, a NYSE-listed identity company, announced Friday that travelers from the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand can apply for Clear+ memberships.
More countries will likely be announced later this year, the company said.
Clear+ members have their identities verified in via separate lanes at 59 U.S. airports. Verifications are performed using eye, finger or facial biometrics, rather than manual analysis.
Candy Buchanan, a Clear+ member based in California, said the lanes are shorter and her identity is verified ""within seconds.""
Travelers can enroll themselves online, or in person at an airport that uses the program, the company said.
Individual memberships are $209 per year. Family members under 18 years old can accompany adult members in Clear+ lanes.

Buchanan uses her membership with another U.S. program, TSA PreCheck, which collectively allow her to clear airport security within minutes, she said.
TSA PreCheck cuts security line times by letting passengers wear their shoes, belts and jackets, and keep liquids and electronics in their carry-on luggage during the security check process. However, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration announced in July it was ending a roughly 20-year old policy requiring travelers to remove their shoes during airport security screenings.
The TSA Precheck program is only open to U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals and lawful permanent residents.
Global Entry allows expedited entry through U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities. It is available to U.S. citizens, Mexican nationals and citizens of 19 countries and territories, including Australia, Brazil, India, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom.

The Achilles heel of these drugs is that they’re too effective. At some point, you lose enough weight, and you might think you can stop taking them… Whatever the case, if Eli Lilly is going to break out from this level, it needs breakthroughs in new areas, heart, brain, that it just doesn’t have right now, or there has to be some new data that shows something else positive that the GLP-1 drugs can do.

The US economy appears to be on a solid footing, but there's some pain beneath the surface.
-
Corporate bankruptcies this summer have surged to their highest levels since 2020.
-
The list for July filings includes names such as Del Monte Foods and LifeScan Global.
Some beloved 1990s and 2000s brands were among the companies to file for bankruptcy this summer, continuing a troubling trend that hints at pain beneath the surface of the US economy.
Forever 21 and Joann's are among the companies that filed for bankruptcy recently, with many famous retailers closing stores and reducing their physical footprint.
Data from S&P 500 Global shows that this summer, US corporate bankruptcy filings surged to their highest level since 2020, with 71 public and private companies filing for bankruptcy last month. That's an increase from June, when 63 companies filed for bankruptcy.
Despite a strong stock market and 3% economic growth in the second quarter, some once-prominent names reported hard times in July, citing difficult economic conditions.
""Companies are contending with elevated interest rates as uncertainty from US tariff policy pressures costs and supply chain resilience,"" S&P 500 Global said.
Canned goods producer Del Monte Foods, for example, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, noting declining demand and high inventory costs. Leadership also cited a heavy debt burden. Del Monte had combined debts of between $1 billion and $10 billion, Business Insider reported last month.
While the August numbers have not been reported yet, a few prominent companies have already filed for bankruptcy, including fashion retailer Claire's. The retailer submitted its second Chapter 11 filing on August 6, also citing declining demand and high interest rates.
That puts it in the same category as Forever 21, Rite Aid, and Party City, all once-popular retail chains that have filed for bankruptcy and closed locations in 2025.

On July 23, 2025, reports emerged that China’s Zijin Mining is in advanced talks to acquire Barrick’s Tongon gold mine in Ivory Coast for up to $500 million.
The deal, still subject to regulatory approval, comes as Barrick continues to streamline its portfolio by shedding lower-margin, shorter-life assets. Tongon, which began production in 2010, has seen its reserves decline in recent years and is projected to cease operations by 2027 without major reinvestment. Selling the mine would free up capital for Barrick to pursue higher-return opportunities, particularly in copper and long-life gold projects.
The potential sale reflects Barrick’s broader strategy of focusing on assets with strong margins and long production horizons. Management has signaled increased emphasis on copper, which now accounts for roughly one-fifth of the company’s output, with a target of raising that share to 30 percent by 2029. Divesting from smaller, aging mines like Tongon aligns with this shift, enabling Barrick to redeploy resources toward growth-oriented ventures in regions such as Latin America, North America, and Central Asia.
Barrick Mining Corporation (NYSE:B) is a global leader in gold and copper production, with operations spanning North and South America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Founded in 1983, the company is headquartered in Toronto, Canada.

Last April, Dalio flagged Beijing's conflict with the U.S. and depressed prices among key challenges plaguing China's economy, but noted that the problems were ""manageable by Chinese leaders if they do their jobs well.""
In April this year, the billionaire investor called for a rebalancing in U.S.-China relations, arguing that trade imbalances have hollowed out U.S. manufacturing. He also urged both sides to reach a deal to ""engineer big reductions in these imbalances.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -The head of the U.N. commission on Latin America, Jose Manuel Salazar, urged the region's countries to diversify their export and import markets and to integrate their economies in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs.
""Rather than replacing imports, I would use the word diversify,"" Salazar, executive secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, told Reuters in an interview Thursday evening. He said the organization is recommending that its members renew alliances both inside and outside the region, since diversification would require a long-term commitment.
Salazar cited a trade agreement between Mercosur and the European Union that was finalized by negotiators in December after two decades of talks and is expected to get legislative approval soon.
He also called for exploring trade and investment channels with Asian and African countries, and for deepening regional integration in Latin America.
The United Nations commission supports economic development in Latin America and the Caribbean.
Salazar, a Costa Rican economist, was in Mexico to attend a regional conference on women. He said progress has been made regarding women's inclusion in Latin American economies, but more still needs to be done to close the gap in labor market participation.
Salazar also said that, due to aging populations and declining fertility rates in Latin America, the demand for care for older adults will increase. The commission has asked its members to allocate up to 4.7% of their GDP to invest in elder care infrastructure by 2035.
He said such spending could create up to 31 million jobs over the next decade in 23 countries in the region.

The shares would be sold by current and former employees to investors including SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group and Thrive Capital, according to a person familiar with the negotiations who asked not to be named due to the confidential nature of the discussions. The talks are still in early stages and the details could change.
Bloomberg was first to report the discussions. All three firms are existing investors in OpenAI, but Thrive Capital could lead the round, as CNBC previously reported. SoftBank, Dragoneer and Thrive Capital did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.
OpenAI's valuation has grown exponentially since the artificial intelligence startup launched its generative AI chatbot ChatGPT in late 2022.
The company announced a $40 billion funding round in March at a $300 billion, by far the largest amount ever raised by a private tech company. Earlier this month, OpenAI announced its most recent $8.3 billion in fresh capital tied to that funding round.
Last week, OpenAI announced GPT-5, its latest and most advanced large-scale AI model. OpenAI said the model is smarter, faster and ""a lot more useful,"" particularly across domains like writing, coding and health care. But it's been a rocky roll out, as some users complained about losing access to OpenAI's prior models.
""We for sure underestimated how much some of the things that people like in GPT-4o matter to them, even if GPT-5 performs better in most ways,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote in a post on X.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management ended the first quarter more bullish on companies across different sectors and geographies, a securities filing showed on Thursday, after betting against Chinese companies previously as the Trump administration considered imposing tariffs.
Burry, known as the ""Big Short"" investor for his prescient calls ahead of the 2008 U.S. housing market crash, placed bets that benefit from a rise in share prices. The call options convey the right to buy shares at a set price in the future.
The investor bought call options on Chinese companies Alibaba and JD.com, Dutch semiconductor supplier ASML Holding and on some U.S. names, such as cosmetics company Estee Lauder, Lululemon Athletica, Meta Platforms, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, UnitedHealth Group, and VF Corp.
Scion's portfolio also included long-only positions in Bruker Corp, Estee Lauder, Lululemon, Regeneron, and UnitedHealth.
Burry's second-quarter portfolio contrasts with bets against Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com and PDD Holdings in the first quarter, ahead of Trump's announcement of high levies on goods imported from China.
The securities filing does not indicate Burry's current holdings.
After the S&P 500 dipped to its lowest point in almost a year on April 8 following Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement, U.S. stocks recovered. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq reached record closing highs in June, capping their best quarter in over a year as hopes for trade deals and possible rate cuts eased investor uncertainty.
Both indexes ended the quarter with double-digit gains. The S&P 500 gained 10.57% during the period, and the Nasdaq rose 17.75%.

The Dow opened 0.5% higher to trade at about 45,150 Friday morning, leapfrogging its prior record of 45,073 set in early December. UnitedHealth Group led the index higher, rising nearly 12% after a regulatory filing Thursday afternoon revealed Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) had taken a $1.6 billion stake in the company.
The Dow is the last of the major large-cap indexes to set a record high this year. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have closed at records 18 and 20 times, respectively, since the start of the year. The majority of those came in July, when solid earnings reports helped allay some lingering fears about the effect tariffs could have on corporate America’s profits.
The Dow started 2025 off on the back foot, mostly because of the stock that’s fueling its gains today. UnitedHealth Group shares tumbled last December after the CEO of its insurance arm, Brian Thompson, was fatally shot in Manhattan. The shooting reignited debate over U.S. health care costs and intensified criticism of pharmacy benefit managers, including UnitedHealth’s OptumRx.
UnitedHealth and other insurers continued to struggle in the new year as elevated health care costs crimped their results and federal regulators scrutinized industry billing practices. By early August, UnitedHealth was trading more than 60% off its all-time high set in November.
For the Dow to close at a record high, it will need to close above 45,014.04, about 0.2% above its close on Thursday. The index was up 0.2% at 44,995 in recent trading.

Paramount-Skydance shares popped as much as 60% on Wednesday.
-
The huge rally had some calling it a meme stock during the session.
-
Shares of the media company have popped since its recent merger and news of a UFC deal.
There might be a new addition to the meme stock rally ripping through the stock market this summer.
Paramount-Skydance was being called the latest meme stock on Wednesday after shares surged as much as 60%.
The jump follows Paramount's merger with Skydance Media, which was completed last week. Optimism was renewed earlier this week after Paramount announced that it bought the rights to UFC for a seven-year period starting in 2026 in a $7.7 billion deal.

But a few characteristics of the stock put it among other meme names that have emerged recently.
Short interest in Paramount-Skydance, one measure of speculative trading in a stock, hovered around 79.98 million shares on Wednesday, according to data from MarketBeat. That represents 13.4% of total publicly available shares of the company, compared to 1.2% of short interest in Disney and 4.8% of short interest in Warner Bros. Discovery.
It was among the top 15 most actively traded stocks on Wednesday, while the amount of shares available to trade—aka the ""float""—is low.
The frenzy over Paramount is coming amid a broader, pandemic-style resurgence in meme stocks this year. GoPro, American Eagle, and KrispyKreme are among the companies that soared amid a new speculative trading binge last month, though most of those meme stocks have since sputtered and lost momentum.

The health-care stock ended the day up 12%, its best daily performance since March 2020. UnitedHealth, often viewed as an industry bellwether, also helped lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average to an all-tim intraday high on Friday.
The advance came after Buffett's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway revealed a stake of 5 million shares, worth about $1.6 billion, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The ""Big Short"" investor Michael Burry and Appaloosa Management's David Tepper also disclosed sizable stakes in the company, in separate SEC filings on Thursday.
Shares of UnitedHealth were down nearly 50% for 2025 through Thursday's close before Buffett's filing. The largest private health insurer has become the face of public blowback in this country against the rising costs of health care. UnitedHealth is currently facing a Justice Department investigation into its Medicare billing practices.
In May, the company pulled its annual earnings outlook and CEO Andrew Witty stepped down. Last month, UnitedHealth gave a new 2025 outlook that was well short of Wall Street estimates, hitting the stock further.
""The move by Berkshire represents a big vote of confidence in UNH and likely could provide a near-term trading floor for most of the MCO space and, given Berkshire's investment track record, could serve as a near-term bottom and rallying point for other investors that the space is safe to invest in again,"" George Hill, a health-care analyst at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to clients.",b353c00d188a8b6980db9fe4ac4af6c0,trafilatura,1652,0

On July 28, 2025, Raymond James reiterated its “Outperform” rating on Newmont Corporation (NYSE: NEM) and raised its price target to $69 from $67, signaling confidence in the company’s near-term prospects.
On the same day, CIBC analyst Anita Soni maintained a Neutral (Hold) rating while lifting the target from $60 to $74, reflecting expectations for potential upside. Both moves highlight analysts’ recognition of Newmont’s operational momentum and its strong leverage to gold prices.

These ratings came amidst Newmont’s stellar second quarter, where the company crushed expectations by earning $1.43 per share, beating the forecast of roughly $1.18; revenue surged, buoyed by stronger gold prices averaging over $3,320 an ounce.
Headquartered in Denver, Colorado, Newmont is the world’s leading gold miner, with diversified assets spanning North and South America, Africa, and Australia. It also mines copper, silver, lead, and zinc, and recently completed a $17 billion acquisition of Newcrest while divesting non‑core assets to bolster its balance sheet.

The MetaMask stablecoin (mUSD) was already reported to be in the works thanks to a prematurely posted governance proposal that was quickly deleted last week. After this week's potential announcement, the new dollar-pegged token will become a live asset at the end of this month, the person said.
MetaMask, which has said it has over 30 million active monthly users, is working to issue its stablecoin with the help of Bridge, a firm that was acquired by fintech giant Stripe earlier this year that helps businesses integrate stablecoin payment rails, and stablecoin issuance protocol M^0.
As well as working closely with Bridge on the mUSD stablecoin, MetaMask has also enlisted the help of traditional finance alternative asset manager Blackstone to assist with custody and treasury management services for the token, the person said.
MetaMask and M^0 declined to comment. Blackstone and Bridge did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Like several other large crypto platforms that hold significant amounts of user funds in the form of major stablecoins like Tether's USDT and Circle’s USDC, MetaMask’s prerogative to launch a branded stablecoin is driven by the opportunity to share in the yield of underlying stablecoin assets, usually short-term, highly liquid bonds such as U.S. Treasuries.",9a285924ecb3a8ea362c3b489636099c,trafilatura,1577,0

""Count on the Brazilian government. Whoever wants to leave, leave. Whoever wants to come, we welcome you with open arms,"" Lula said at the ceremony.
During his speech, Lula criticized the 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, and said that his country is facing an ""unnecessary turbulence.""
Lula said in an interview with Reuters earlier this month that he would initiate a conversation at the BRICS group of developing nations, which includes China, about how to tackle Trump's tariffs.
The leftist leader noted that in the past automakers Ford and Mercedes have decided to scale back their operations in Brazil, but celebrated the arrival of other companies, like China's GWM . Brazil is always open to negotiating business, he stressed.
GWM's Brazilian arm has capacity to produce 50,000 vehicles per year and is expected to generate more than 2,000 jobs in the future when it begins exporting vehicles to Latin America, according to a press release.
Brazil's auto exports are expected to grow 38.4% in 2025 compared to 2024, reaching 552,000 units, data from automakers association Anfavea showed last week.

The stock jumped as much as 70% Wednesday morning, before paring back. The shares were up about 5% in recent trading, leaving the stock's year-to-date gains around 500%.
The company, which was originally formed to focus on developing therapeutics in chronic pain, inflammation and fibrosis, said it now holds almost $350 million in Ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, and plans to buy more.
The price of the Ether hovered near all-time highs Wednesday at over $4,700 and has added close to half its value in 2025 amid optimism about a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment under the Trump administration.
The move by ETHZilla, which counts billionaire Peter Thiel among its backers, echoes the playbook of Strategy (MSTR), formerly known as MicroStrategy, which has become the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin as part of its Bitcoin treasury strategy.
The price of Bitcoin, which hovered near all-time highs Wednesday at about $121,600, has added close to a third of its value in 2025. Shares of Strategy have also climbed by roughly a third over the same period.

(TYO: 3350, OTCQX: MTPLF) announced its “Metaplanet Prefs” program and its intention to build a BTC-backed yield curve in Japan. The company stated, “As Japan’s largest public holder of Bitcoin, we aim to set a new standard in the Japanese fixed income market by introducing BTC-backed credit through Perpetual Preferred Equity.”
The issuance of different preferred equity instruments can approximate a yield curve based on each instruments’ Macaulay durations. Metaplanet recently filed a ¥555 billion shelf registration for two series of perpetual preferred shares each yielding 6%. This move mirrors what Strategy (MSTR) has done over the course of this year, a topic we’ve broken down in-depth here.
The 33rd page of the presentation clearly defines several types of perpetual preferred which will correspond to targeted “effective durations” of common Japanese Government Bonds (JGB).
According to the slide, medium and short durations can be replicated using perpetual preferred shares with variable dividends. The presentation expounds on the financial engineering behind preferred stock and their impact of BTC per share accretion.

Its CEO suggested bigger gains could be ahead as the company looks to capitalize on growing AI demand.
The networking giant posted adjusted earnings per share of 99 cents on revenue that jumped 8% year-over-year to $14.7 billion, just slightly above analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Sales from Cisco's security and observability segments missed projections. However, strong growth in AI infrastructure orders helped push Cisco's annual total over $2 billion, more than double the company's $1 billion target.
CEO Chuck Robbins said the results underlined a ""massive opportunity ahead as we lead the required architectural shift and build the critical infrastructure needed for the AI era.""
Cisco projected first-quarter revenue of $14.65 billion to $14.85 billion and adjusted earnings per share of 97 cents to 99 cents. Analysts were looking for $14.63 billion and EPS of 97 cents, respectively.
Shares of Cisco fell 2% in after-hours trading following the results. The stock has added nearly a fifth of its value in 2025 through Wednesday’s close.

The online fast-fashion retailer's pre-tax profit rose to £38.25 million in 2024 from £24.43 million in 2023.
The company highlighted several milestones during the year, including the opening of new offices in King's Cross and Manchester, a pop-up shop in Liverpool and a Christmas bus tour across 12 U.K. cities.
Shein flagged risks such as potential supply chain delays, higher costs from currency fluctuations and freight charges, IT system outages, and shifting UK regulations that could require it to alter or withdraw products.
The Chinese company, which is headquartered in Singapore, also noted that weaker consumer confidence from higher inflation and living costs could weigh on sales.
Shein confidentially filed for an initial public offering in Hong Kong earlier this year, a move aimed at pressuring U.K. regulators and speeding up its long-delayed listing plans.
Before this, the fast fashion giant filed to list in London but has struggled to receive regulatory approval before shifting its focus to Hong Kong.",046cf597098095e02ae97a1371c639f5,trafilatura,1162,0
