Do you want to talk about that big day you had yesterday?\"\nAlphabet this week added $230 billion to its market cap after avoiding a breakup in a landmark antitrust case brought by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2020. Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search last year. Deciding on the penalties this week, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled against the most severe consequences proposed by the DOJ, causing shares of the search company to jump.\n\"I'm glad it's over,\" Pichai responded to Trump, causing an eruption of laughter from the other table guests.\n\"It's a long process,\" Pichai said. \"Appreciate that your administration had a constructive dialogue, and we were able to get it to some resolution.\"\n\"Right,\" Trump replied.\n\"The AI moment is one of the most transformative moments any of us have ever seen or will see in our lifetimes, so making sure the U.S. is at the forefront — and I think your administration is investing a lot,\" Pichai said. \"Already the AI action plan under your leadership I think is a great start, and we look forward to working together. And thanks for your leadership.\"\nThe plan Pichai referred to is the administration's \"Winning the AI Race: America's AI Action Plan,\" launched in July, which claims to identify 90 federal policy actions across three pillars: the acceleration of innovation, building of artificial intelligence infrastructure and leadership in international diplomacy and security. Part of that plan includes a July executive order that says AI models should not incorporate \"Woke AI\" or \"ideological dogmas such as DEI,\" meaning diversity, equity and inclusion.\nGoogle is also in discussions with Trump's lawyers for an ongoing lawsuit that the president filed more than four years ago, accusing the online video platform YouTube of unlawful censorship. The lawsuit stemmed from the suspension of Trump's accounts on social media sites after the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.\nEarlier Thursday, Pichai attended the White House \"AI Education Taskforce\" event hosted by First Lady Melania Trump.\nTrump interrupted Pichai's Thursday evening response to say \"Biden was the one who prosecuted that lawsuit, you know that right?\" Trump said, referring to the search monopoly case.\nThe search case was brought by the DOJ while Trump was in office during his first term.

Sign up to receive future editions.\nOverview: Every step to take-off counts\nIf launching a rocket's a prime feast, opening the doors to the vehicle's launch pad is a healthy appetizer.\nLast week, Rocket Lab introduced Launch Complex 3 — the intended take-off pad of its Neutron rocket — located within the Virginia Spaceport Authority's Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport. Neutron itself will arrive a little later to this party, with a first flight targeted this year – but the premiere of the launch site marks a major step for Rocket Lab specifically and for a space industry that's overall hungry for further launch vehicles.\nThe company already produces the small-lift Electron launch vehicle, which was performing its first commercial flights by late 2018. The 141-foot-tall Neutron is an upgrade in scale: a medium-lift reusable rocket that burns liquid methane and oxygen designed to carry payloads up to 13,000 kilograms to low Earth orbit (LEO) and 1,500 kilograms for trips to Mars or Venus.\nThe market scale for global carrier rockets — which are designed to launch a payload on a particular route or orbit — is seen set to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9% between this year and 2034. Forgive the pun, but launch demand's only risen meteorically, with payloads ranging from space exploration and research equipment to humans and defense and telecommunication satellites for fast-evolving networks.\nFor years, the industry bemoaned the limited scale of take-off capacity, with European Space Agency's Director Josef Aschbacher last year acknowledging a \"launcher crisis\" in Europe that the agency sought to resolve with the launch of the Ariane-6.\nMuch of that world's launch capacity is in the hands of Elon Musk's SpaceX, whose take-off cadence last year exceeded that of both commercial competitors and national programs. In 2024, the company saw through more than 130 flights of its workhorse medium-lift Falcon 9, which reuses its first-stage booster and payload fairings. That's just over half of the 259 orbital launches undertaken over the period globally — and could increase to more than 180 Falcon 9 launches this year, according to Musk's estimate of December. An August launch even carried Kuiper satellites for Amazon, whose owner Jeff Bezos' rival Blue Origin unleashed the New Glenn on its maiden orbital voyage in January.\nIt's not taking away from SpaceX's success story to acknowledge the drawbacks of overreliance on a single provider. Toward the middle of the year, U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to cancel government Musk's government contracts in the midst of an explosive public row led the tech billionaire to fleetingly float the possibility of decommissioning SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft — potentially stranding U.S. crew without a ride to and from the International Space Station at the time. The waters have calmed since, and SpaceX and NASA are continuing their partnership, but the incident's driven home the critical downsides of market dominance.\nWe've been over this: getting a brand new rocket model off the ground's no feat for the feeble. Moscow's still planning to push through the all-Russian Soyuz-5 by the end of the year, and Relativity Space's reusable Terran R and Firefly Aerospace's Eclipse are both currently penciled in for liftoff in 2026. Last month, our collective breaths were held as we watched intently whether the second-iteration Starship variant would prevail in the rocket's 10th test flight, or face another fiery setback. (Elon Musk's giant won the day.)\nBut, when the global satellite market is projected to expand seven-fold by 2035, it's hard not to see why all eyes are glued when space companies reveal their latest and greatest in brand new rockets — or their launch pads.\nWhat's up\n- Canada prepares its first lunar rover — Canadensys Aerospace is developing the first Canada-built rover to investigate the Moon — a \"logical first step\" for future space exploration ambitions, according to the company's CEO. — BBC\n- Senate hears NASA doubts over return to Moon timeline — A former NASA administrator told senators it was unlikely that the space agency would be able to put men back on the Moon ahead of Beijing, which has embarked on similar efforts. — Space News\n- ESA spacecraft undertakes Venus flyby — The European Space Agency's JUICE spacecraft has completed a Venus flyby en route to explore Jupiter's icy moons and gather data about the planet's Ganymede, Callisto and Europa moons. — Space.com\nIndustry maneuvers\n- Trump says Space Command HQ to move to Alabama — U.S. President Donald Trump said the U.S. Space Command's headquarters will move to Alabama from Colorado, citing the latter state's mail-in voting system. — NBC News\n- White House axes labor unions at NASA — Washington has moved to eliminate collective bargaining rights for several government institutions, including NASA, citing national security. — White House executive order\nMarket movers\n- Rocket Lab reveals new pad ahead of first Neutron rocket launch — Rocket Lab unveiled its new Launch Complex 3 pad at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport in Wallops Island, which will be used to test and launch the reusable Neutron rocket that could debut as soon as the end of the year. — Defense News\n- Andoya Space, Rheinmetall to bolster efforts to boost satellite launch — Andoya Space and Rheinmetall have agreed to strengthen their combined efforts to bolster satellite launch and space capabilities. — Defence Industry Europe\n- NordSpace's Taiga launch delayed by tech, weather issues — Ontario-based tech startup NordSpace has postponed the launch of its Taiga rocket — intended as the first ever commercial rocket take-off from Canadian soil — after a safety system fault and weather disruptions.

You probably are hearing we'll be putting a fairly substantial tariff, or not that high, but a fairly substantial tariff.\"\nTrump had said last month during an event with Cook that he would impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports, while exempting products from companies that move their manufacturing to the U.S. At the time, Apple pledged to spend an additional $100 billion on a domestic manufacturing initiative, adding on a $500 billion announcement that Apple made in February.\nDuring Thursday's event, Trump noted that \"Tim Cook would be in pretty good shape,\" regarding the potential import levies.\nThe U.S. has been working to onshore its semiconductor supply chain for many years now.

During the visit, Altman said India was OpenAI's second-largest market by number of users.\nHe has subsequently said that AI adoption in India is \"amazing to watch.\"\n\"We love to see the explosion of creativity--india is outpacing the world,\" he said on X earlier this year.\nIndia is one of ChatGPT's fastest-growing markets globally, Nick Patience, practice lead for AI at tech research and analysis firm Futurum Group, told CNBC. \"OpenAI's India focus is a strategic move to gain a competitive edge,\" he added.\nHere's a rundown of how OpenAI is expanding in India.\nChatGPT explosion\nChatGPT, OpenAI's core product, has seen strong growth in India. The app was downloaded 10.2 million times in India in August, a huge jump from the 2.5 million downloads seen during the same month last year, according to analytics firm Appfigures.\nSince its launch, ChatGPT has 111 million downloads in India, ahead of its 80 million downloads in the U.S, Appfigures data shows.\nDownloads do not necessarily equal daily or monthly users, but the figures emphasise OpenAI's growth trajectory in the country.\nThe download numbers are also far ahead of rivals, including Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude. The closest challenger was Perplexity, Appfigures said, which had 6.4 million downloads in August.\nIndia-specific product\nUser spending on ChatGPT has been increasing. To date, Indian users have spent $21.3 million on ChatGPT, Appfigures data shows. In comparison, U.S. users have spent $784 million.\nThat underlines the fact that while the number of users in India is huge, it remains a price-sensitive market.\nTo address this, OpenAI in August launched ChatGPT Go, a low-cost 399-rupees-($4.53)-a-month plan for its AI app.\n\"It's a classic wedge strategy to capture a price-sensitive market and build a user base that will be difficult for local players to dislodge later,\" Futurum Group's Patience said of the strategy.\nInfrastructure and hiring\nAccording to Bloomberg, OpenAI is scouting a location in India for a data center with at least 1-gigawatt capacity. The facility will be part of OpenAI's Stargate-branded infrastructure push, Bloomberg said this week, although CNBC was unable to verify the report.\nThe ChatGPT developer said last month that it would open a local office in the market and is currently advertising three sales roles in India.\nIt also announced last month an education program in India that will include funding for research and provide half a million ChatGPT licenses for educators and students across the country.\nIndia challenges\nWhile India doesn't have a home-grown artificial intelligence company as big as OpenAI, there are some challengers in the form of domestic startups, including Sarvam AI and Krutrim, and other American tech giants like Google and Meta.\nContinued geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and India over trade, however, have the potential to cause complications if there's any backlash from New Delhi against American tech firms.\nOpenAI is also locked in a legal battle with Asian News International in India, which has accused the ChatGPT developer of using copyrighted material illegally. It's a closely-watched case in the country for how copyright laws apply in the AI era.\n\"OpenAI's success in India is not guaranteed and depends heavily on its ability to navigate these legal and political hurdles,\" Futurum Group's Patience said.\n\"While the Indian market is vast, its diversity in languages and user needs presents challenges. OpenAI's ability to deliver a truly localized product and its long-term impact on India's AI talent remain uncertain.\"", "content_hash": "2cc597ecf6d6154ddb53c663447feaee", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Today it's two euros, tomorrow it's going to be four euros. You're not going to give up on your coffee.\"\nItaly has become a top relocation destination for the wealthy in Europe this year, according to Henley & Partners, which markets citizenship and residency-by-investment schemes.\nThough the millionaire migration figures have raised some questions, and global wealth flows are notoriously difficult to track, a number of high-profile figures have made the move to Italy over recent months. These include Egypt's richest man and co-owner of Aston Villa Football Club Nassef Sawiris, and the vice-chair of Goldman Sachs, Richard Gnodde.\nThe total number of new high-net-worth arrivals in Italy so far this year could be as high as 3,600, according to Henley & Partners estimates.\nMilan's millionaire boom\nItaly's flat-tax regime was introduced in 2017 as part of a wider push by the then center-left government to attract foreign investors while encouraging homegrown talent to return to the country following the euro zone debt crisis.\nThat, in turn, has sparked a new wave of businesses looking to cater to the fresh wealth influx, particularly in the country's financial and fashion hub, Milan. Among those are newly opened members club The Wilde and, prior to that, Casa Cipriani.\n\"We really thought it was a good time to come back to Italy,\" Anna Cipriani, director of membership at Casa Cipriani Milano, told CNBC of the group's 2022 opening.\n\"Milan has evolved a lot over the years,\" she said. \"Before, it used to be known more for its industrial character and, of course, the fashion houses, while over the last few years it became more and more attractive also for creatives, for investors and for [an] international crowd.\"\nItaly's wealthy arrivals, meanwhile, have led to a surge in real estate prices across some of the country's most desirable locations, from Tuscany and the Italian Riviera to cities such as Rome, Venice and Florence. Milan, and the surrounding lakes region, however, have emerged as a firm favorite.\n\"We are at all-time high prices at the moment,\" said Pella, who is based in BHHS' Lake Como office.\n\"In five years, we had an increase [of] double-digit percentages. For the upcoming years, we're probably going to look at a steady 3% to 4% type of increase here in Lake Como.\"\nProperty prices in Milan have risen 49% since the country's flat-tax regime was introduced in 2017, compared to 10.9% across the rest of Italy's big cities, according to real estate group Tecnocasa. Global property consultancy Knight Frank now expects the city's prime real estate market to record a further 3.5% price growth in 2025.\n\"It's about those who can afford it, because prices are not necessarily down to their street market logic as an investment,\" Pella said.\n\"They like a property with their guts. Then they do a little bit of math, of course, but they're ready to spend and sometimes to overspend just to secure a one-of-a-kind view or a one-of-a-kind position.\"\nUHNW migration\nMillionaires have been migrating in droves to new residences, as more and more jurisdictions offer options to those willing to pay.\nOver the past decade, the number of high-net-worth individuals relocating abroad is estimated to have almost tripled, reaching record highs in 2024.\nThat trend looks set to continue in 2025 and 2026, as a divide deepens between countries seeking to attract the uber-rich and those clamping down in a bid to combat perceived inequality.\nFrance has deliberated expanding its wealth tax, while Switzerland is weighing new changes to inheritance tax.\nMeanwhile, the U.K. in April abolished its over 200-year-old non-dom tax regime, which exempted wealthy foreigners living in Britain from paying U.K. tax on their overseas income and gains. It follows an outflow of London-based banks and financiers to other European capitals, such as Milan, following the 2016 Brexit vote.\nThat has left other countries looking to fill the gap.\n\"There are countries literally around the world coming to us and saying: 'We want the U.K.'s millionaires and billionaires. What can we do? How can we bring them to our country?'\" Stuart Wakeling, managing partner at Henley & Partners U.K., said.\nWhile such citizenship and residence regimes vary vastly, and can include stringent investment requirements, part of the appeal of Italy's system is its simplicity. The one-off payment offers foreign individuals, or nationals who have lived overseas for at least nine years, exemption from wider taxes on income and assets for up to 15 years.\nWorsening wealth divides\nItaly's new surge of arrivals has nevertheless raised questions about the impact on the wider economy.\nSome have warned of worsening wealth inequalities, with the overall tax take from the regime minimal compared to the country's overall deficit, and much of the newly generated wealth concentrated in specific areas.\nMeanwhile, critics suggest that attempts to emulate the scheme elsewhere could lead to a race to the bottom and an erosion of the tax base.\nStill, businesses say they are hopeful that the increased activity and new job creation in industries from finance and private equity to hospitality and services will ultimately reap benefits across Milan and the wider country.\n\"It's kind of a wheel, you know, that keeps rolling. You have all these people moving in and you have all these hotels opening and you have more and more people that then decide to come to town because now that they think about it more,\" Cipriani, from private members club Casa Cipriani Milano, said.\n\"When you have a lot of investments into a city, the economy creates more job opportunities also for the people.\"\n— CNBC's Gaelle Legrand contributed to this report.", "content_hash": "af32b3f2ce1db46d9d995c471a578dad", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently commented that, while he has worked seven days a week since the pandemic, \"the zoomers don't show up\" — referring to Gen Z professionals.\nBritish businessman Lord Alan Sugar, 78, said young people \"just want to sit at home,\" and that they need to get back to the office.\nDespite this, young workers say they're keen on more in-person interactions and are coming to the office an average of three days a week, more than all other age groups, according to a recent global study of 12,000 employees by real estate firm JLL.\nAs older professionals shirk the office, young people are finding they're often either alone when coming into work premises, or surrounded by peers of a similar age.\nThis has given rise to a series of new workplace trends from the viral \"Gen Z stare\", to the \"office siren\" aesthetic and even TikTok slang like \"ick\" becoming normalized in professional lingo.\n\"We're blurring the boundaries between just being a colleague to also being friends, and it just makes it more comfortable for us as well to work with people.\"Weirong LiCommunications Professional\n\"Gen Z is reshaping workplace norms by introducing new ways of working that reflect their values, digital fluency, and desire for authenticity,\" Dan Schawbel, managing partner of Workplace Intelligence, told CNBC.\nIntentional networking\nSenior professionals' prefer to work from home and this has eroded much of the water-cooler chat and mentorship culture that young workers are seeking. Gen Z are becoming more intentional to fill the gap.\nTwenty-five-year-old Weirong Li, a communications professional who graduated from NYU's Stern School of Business, said she was going into the office five days a week, while more senior colleagues would stick to a hybrid or remote schedule. Li noted that the people who do come into the office are generally of a similar age to her.\n\"With this hybrid schedule, it's based on your hierarchy, so if you are higher up...you have more of a slack to not come into the office because you're in a position where you've already proven yourself and you don't need to build a network.\"\nThis has taught Li to be thoughtful about how she approaches colleagues, including taking advantage of both virtual and in-person opportunities.\n\"Most of the connections that I've had with older colleagues, if it wasn't in the office, has built from first being online and virtual because I didn't know these people. I would reach out to people on LinkedIn or even cold email people,\" Li explained.\nShe added she takes water-cooler chats \"quite seriously\" because she views them as an opportunity to strike up a conversation and meet someone new.\nSome Gen Zers are deliberately signing up to professional networking events to try to bridge the gap and mingle in a structured environment, as CNBC previously reported.\nTwenty-five-year-old Vivek Haria, a senior tax advisor at a financial services firm, told CNBC Make It at the time that he's attended 10 events for young professionals organized by London's business district Canary Wharf because it felt lonely in the office, as older workers were not showing up.\nBringing your whole personality to work\nGen Z workers aren't shy about bringing their personalities to work and blurring the boundaries between personal and professional, including dressing more casually and being unfiltered in meetings and conversations.\nTwenty-seven-year-old PR manager Mady Lanni, prioritizes dressing comfortably and brings \"her whole self to work,\" she said. \"'I'm not coming into work with dress pants and heels on. I wear sneakers or my Birkenstocks every day.\"\nGen Z workers are often more casual and comfortable in how they show up at work — sometimes literally.\n\"It'll always be the Gen Zers that sit on the floor instead of sitting like in a chair at a desk,\" Lanni said, referring to team meetings. \"We find the bean bags, or we find the more unique seating situations.\"\nLi believes showing up to work with an authentic personality is a unique trait of Gen Z culture, regardless of whether it aligns with corporate norms.\n\"It's a part of our kind of Gen Z norm, which is showing who we are, what we stand for, our mission, our purpose... value-based actions and conversations do matter for us,\" she said. \"We're more open, and we realize that's also a superpower, that's how people remember us.\"\nMental health check-ins\nWhere mental health was formerly a hush-hush conversation in the workplace, Gen Z workers like prioritizing wellbeing.\nRoughly 51% of young people view mental and physical health as a primary metric of future success, more than other factors like wealth, occupation and family relationships, according to a recent global EY study of over 10,000 respondents aged between 18 and 34 years.\nCommunications professional Li noted that, after the pandemic, \"psychological safety has been very important\" for young people, so essentially being able to bring their emotional side to work.\nShe said that her friends and colleagues often check in with each other during lunch breaks. \"We really value having conversations about how we are doing mentally or physically so that we acknowledge the person in a work context and environment.\"\nInstead of making the typical office small talk, young workers like Li try to take the conversation deeper.\n\"We're blurring the boundaries between just being a colleague to also being friends, and it just makes it more comfortable for us as well to work with people,\" Li said. \"We feel like we have shared values and can relate. It makes communications easier. We don't really want to always be communicating so formally, 24/7.\"\nLanni said she also reached out to colleagues who seem overwhelmed or stressed, adding that Gen Z is more open about discussing mental well-being in the workplace.\nLanni, who works at the office three days a week, added that younger generations are \"pushing for the need of including mental health services and benefits... taking a mental health day is becoming more and more accepted.\"\nEmbracing AI\nGen Z are leaning into generative AI at a faster pace than other workers and are using the tech to get ahead at work.\nTwenty-five-year-old Gracie Lissick, a PR manager, said that younger generations can help normalize the use of AI amongst their teams.\n\"We really have this awesome kind of Michael Jordan moment to help our teams implement AI,\" she said. \"We can be that resource as much as we can.\"\nAround 57% of Gen Zs are already using AI in their daily work for a variety of tasks, whether it's content creation, data analysis, project management, or something else, and most view it positively, per Deloitte.\nLissick said that adopting AI is an advantage because it shows your ability to be tech agile and forward-thinking to managers.\nLi said young people like herself are using AI to save time and improve their work.\n\"The goal is to have more time to do other stuff later on and so I think that we're a quite focused generation contrary to what other people think. We're also always experimenting with new tools, especially in the AI world, that can help us be more efficient at our work,\" she said.\nWorkplace Intelligence's Schawbel added: \"Many Gen Z workers are using AI to bridge gaps in knowledge, confidence, and professional support, treating it almost like a digital coach or co-pilot. While it can't fully replace human mentorship, for Gen Z, AI is emerging as a reliable stand-in — available 24/7, judgment-free, and often more responsive than a busy boss.\"", "content_hash": "04fedf449910b3ba6db790d6d315dbe7", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The agreement reached in July had included Japan purchasing 100 Boeing planes, 75% higher imports of U.S. rice and $8 billion worth of agricultural and crop products.\nWashington will apply a baseline 15% tariff on nearly all Japanese imports, with separate sector-specific levies for automobiles and parts (also 15%), aerospace products, generic pharmaceutical goods and natural resources, according to the executive order.\nThe Thursday order prevents Trump's country-specific tariffs on top of existing levies. The lower tariffs will apply retroactively to Japanese goods \"entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 7, 2025,\" the order stated. The tariff relief on automobiles is set to take effect after seven days.\nTrump's global tariff campaign has thrown the global supply chain into disarray, in particular Japan's massive auto sector. Last month, Toyota warned that it expected a hit of nearly $10 billion as Trump's tariffs on autos weighed on its sales to the U.S., forcing it to slash by 16% its forecast for full-year operating profits.\nTariffs are expected to hit rivals as well, with Ford's pre-tax adjusted profit reportedly set to drop $3 billion while GM projects $4 billion to $5 billion hit for the year.\nJapan's top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, who was in Washington, delivered a letter from Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba inviting Trump to visit his country, Kyoto News reported. The Japanese official had reportedly canceled his trip to the U.S. last month as some sticking points required \"further technical discussion.\"\nPolitical tides\nThe finalizing of the deal came as political pressure for the Japanese leader mounts at home. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party earlier this week released a long-awaited report on why it lost seats in the upper house election in July.\nThe report ascribed the loss to the lack of appeal for the party's measures aimed at taming inflation, previous political scandals and weak mobilization of young voters.\nLocal media reports suggested many key members of the LDP have signaled their intention to resign to the prime minister, while Ishiba has said he intends to stay on amid calls within his party for choosing another leader.\nThough the reports have avoided naming individuals, they signal an \"implicit indictment of Ishiba's leadership of the party,\" said James Brady, vice president at political consultancy Teneo.\nAnalysts at Eurasia Group suggested in a report Friday that Ishiba is unlikely to survive a challenge from within the party next Monday, when a vote on whether to bring forward a leadership election is expected to take place.\n\"Ishiba's poor performance as party leader in lower and upper house elections and events in recent days, including former prime minister Aso Taro announcing his support for the special election, have turned the tide against Ishiba,\" analysts said, predicting a 60% odd of Ishiba's defeat in the election, with him possibly resigning before the vote takes place as internal discontent grows.", "content_hash": "f6d82ea4737a68384b0cbe9cbf00590e", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

So, when he discovered an investment vehicle called a search fund while studying for his MBA, he went all in.\nAs millions of baby boomers prepare to retire, a quiet crisis — and an unexpected business opportunity — is unfolding across the economy. Today, over half of all U.S. small businesses are owned by people aged 55 and over, yet most lack a succession plan, according to Gallup.\nThese businesses are often unglamorous, but essential to keep society running: plumbers, equipment rental companies and pest control.\n\"They're the types of companies that if they drop what they do, it would really hurt,\" said Jon Staenberg, founder & CEO of Agate Hound Fund.\nEnter the next generation of entrepreneurs — millennials and Gen Zers — who are seizing this moment not by launching startups, but by buying companies through search funds. In doing so, they're revitalizing Main Street businesses and solving a looming succession crisis, all while building wealth in a turbulent economy.\nWhat is a search fund?\nFirst conceived in 1984, search funds — also known as \"entrepreneurship through acquisition\" — let individuals — or \"searchers\" — raise money from a small group of investors to buy and operate a small or medium-sized private company.\nA 2024 study by the Stanford Graduate School of Business describes the process in four steps:\n- Stage one: Raise initial capital (about 2 to 6 months)\n- Stage two: Search for and acquire company (about 12 to 24 months)\n- Stage three: Operation and value creation (about 4 to 7+ years)\n- Stage four: Exit (about 6 months)\nThe goal is to grow these businesses and exit with a profit — often to a private equity firm.\nIt's a compelling model: lower risk than starting from scratch, since the business already has customers, revenue, and a product-market fit.\nAcquisition targets are typically businesses with recurring revenue, low overhead, minimal regulatory risk, and stable customer bases.\n\"These are businesses that are, frankly, hard to break,\" said Jackson, who is now a search fund investor. \"It's very forgiving for the first-time CEO.\"\nBesides \"core\" search funds, other variants include self-funded, single-investor models, while others prioritize a larger pool of capital committed at launch, or a longer holding period of between 10 and 20 years.\nIn 2023, a record 94 core search funds were launched across the U.S. and Canada, while international interest also set new milestones, with 59 new core funds outside North America, according to studies conducted by Stanford and IESE Business School.\n'Safe port in a storm'\nSearch funds have grown popular as traditional career paths feel less secure, with layoffs, automation and artificial intelligence reshaping industries.\n\"There is a big displacement of young professionals who are in the middle of their career,\" said Aik Chuan Goh, managing partner of Singapore-based search fund Garlic Equity Capital. Many of these \"ambitious young professionals no longer see corporate life as their future,\" he added.\nOn the other hand, many business owners are looking to retire. \"When you put one and one together, you have a great match,\" said Goh.\nWe live in such a tumultuous time with change happening so fast, this feels like a very safe port in a storm.Jon StaenbergFounder and CEO, Agate Hound Fund\nInvestors are taking notice too. Amid downturns in the venture capital and private equity markets, search funds have emerged as an alternative asset class.\n\"Venture [capital] is so crowded now. Search funds still remain small, while the opportunity set is so big — it's the only thing I want to do for the rest of my career. You look at the returns, they've been phenomenal. They've been outsized,\" said Staenberg.\nStanford's 2024 study of 681 search funds formed in the U.S. and Canada since 1984 found that their internal rate of return was 35.1%, with a 4.5 times return on investment.\n\"Over the last 40 years, the stock market has been somewhere [around] 8.5% annual returns ... Then you go to private equity or venture over that same 40-year period ... and the returns are somewhere around 13% to 14%. So [when] you start looking at the outsized returns of 35% for search, it's a bit of a head scratcher,\" said Staenberg.\n\"We live in such a tumultuous time with change happening so fast, this feels like a very safe port in a storm.\"\nCheckbook, phonebook, playbook\nMeanwhile, search funds have also offered a risk-adjusted way for aspiring business owners to pursue their CEO dreams, such as Jackson, who, together with his friend Olaide Lawal, started their search fund in 2015.\nAbout 18 months later, the duo raised more than $5 million and acquired three dental practices from a dentist who was in his 50s. Over the next six years, Jackson ran Unified Dental Care as CEO and grew the company to seven locations before selling the business to a strategic buyer in 2023.\nBut Jackson did not come from wealth. Growing up in Champaign, Illinois, he didn't see many business success stories around him.\n\"It was normal for me to literally see in front of my door, gang fights [break] out ... and so I did not have as much access to seeing entrepreneurs,\" said Jackson.\n\"I saw the barber shop that was down the street, or I saw the person that owned the barbecue shop ... [and] people that were making an honest living, but barely livable wages,\" said Jackson.\nSo it was a risk adjusted path for me as a minority entrepreneur that didn't come with a lot of resources to have ... a successful exit.Jason JacksonFormer CEO, Unified Dental Care\n\"For me, the idea [of a search fund] was fantastic, because ... I didn't have the startup idea, so it was an opportunity for me to buy an existing business,\" he said.\nWhat makes search funds unique, he said, is that his investors also become his mentors.\n\"What separates search fund investors is that they provide, principally, three things to the entrepreneur. The first thing that they provide is [a] checkbook... This is something that I didn't have access to,\" said Jackson.\n\"Second thing that they provide access to is a phone book, meaning call me or call my network anytime ... and the third thing that they provide [is a] playbook, meaning, here's how you execute once you buy this business,\" Jackson added.\n\"So it was a risk-adjusted path for me as a minority entrepreneur that didn't come with a lot of resources to have ... a successful exit,\" said Jackson.\nThe new American dream?\nBut running a search fund isn't all smooth sailing. In fact, Jackson uncovered fraud two weeks into running the business: the seller had inflated revenue by millions.\n\"We thought we were buying a $7 million revenue company and $1.5 million in EBITDA,\" said Jackson. \"What we discovered was that the business was really doing $5 million in revenue and losing $500,000 a year after adjusting for the fraud.\"\nDespite the rocky start, Jackson turned the business around. He exited successfully, more than doubling his investment and earning seven figures altogether from his tenure as CEO and from the deal, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.\n\"We eventually were able to sell the business at a decent multiple. It's decent for the search fund industry. It's really good compared to private equity, but it's really great compared to where my partner and I came from. He came from Lagos, Nigeria. I came from an under-resourced community,\" said Jackson.\nToday, Jackson runs the Black Search Network, which he co-founded in 2020. He spends his time investing in and passing on the knowledge he's gained through his own journey to other aspiring entrepreneurs and searchers.\nIt also allows people who are gritty, who are hungry, who are willing to be coached, to pursue what we used to call the American dream — to build a business into even more success and have an exit and then come back and help others do the same thing.Jon StaenbergFounder and CEO, Agate Hound Fund\nSearch funds are not a silver bullet. Besides dealing with rejection, searchers have to find a good business to buy, convincing the owner to entrust you with their life's work, and of course, learning how to run a business for the first time.\nBut for a generation looking for stability and purpose, they may offer something rare in today's economy: a practical, profitable, and supported route to owning a business.\n\"It truly is the life cycle of entrepreneurship,\" said Staenberg. \"It also allows people who are gritty, who are hungry, who are willing to be coached, to pursue what we used to call the American dream — to build a business into even more success and have an exit and then come back and help others do the same thing.\"\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

The 35-page report includes data on tickets sold, net ticket receipts, the visiting team's share of gate receipts and club seat premiums, gross general admission ticket prices, and the premium paid for club seats for the preseason and regular season for all 32 teams. The ticketing data in this CNBC report was sourced from that document.\nThe NFL requires every team to give 34% of ticket revenue and the licensing amount of a club seat to the league based on an internal formula, according to several NFL executives who asked to remain unnamed so they could speak freely about private conversations. This pool, known as the visiting team's share, or VTS, is mostly redistributed equally among the 32 teams. In 2024, each team received $27 million, up from $25 million the previous year, according to the league executives.\nStory continues after interactive chart.\nThe VTS money not redistributed is used by the NFL to fund league-level lending programs that go toward the private financing of new stadiums and renovations. Some teams are granted waivers by the NFL on a portion of their VTS contribution if they are using stadium revenue to finance construction or renovations. The Las Vegas Raiders and Los Angeles Rams, for example, received waivers of $23.4 million and $12.2 million, respectively, for their new stadiums, according to the NFL executives.\nThe league's 32 teams collected an average of $433 million in national revenue in 2024 from media, licensing and sponsorship agreements, said the executives. National revenue made up about two-thirds of overall league revenue. Local revenue — including tickets, suites, stadium sponsorships, concessions, parking and non-NFL stadium events — accounted for the remainder.\nThe San Francisco 49ers led the league in net ticket receipts — the amount the team keeps after taxes, fees and surcharges — with $176.5 million in 2024. That's $40.8 million more than the No. 2 Dallas Cowboys and $67.5 million above the league average. The Tennessee Titans ranked last, at $81.2 million in net receipts. The Indianapolis Colts were next to last, at $83.3 million, and the Arizona Cardinals came in just above the Colts, at $83.4 million.\nThe 49ers also had the highest general admission ticket price, at $190.78 last season, followed by the Philadelphia Eagles, at $184.27, and the Las Vegas Raiders, at $165.58. The New England Patriots, who have won six Super Bowls but have not made the postseason since 2021, charged the highest club seat premium at $471.92 — more than double the NFL average.\nThe NFL declined to comment in response to CNBC's questions regarding the Summary of Attendance Statistics report.", "content_hash": "89d656d2711df0ac76209e82533fbe07", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Copper alone is estimated to represent $16 billion, more than all non-mining sectors combined.\nMajor players including BHP, Glencore and Rio Tinto are among those making bold bets on Argentina's copper and lithium potential, with top executives from Glencore and Rio Tinto recently traveling to meet with Milei on a trip to Buenos Aires.\nRo Dhawan, CEO of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), a trade body representing roughly one-third of the global industry, described Argentina as \"arguably the most exciting new copper story today.\"\nThere are other countries and jurisdictions which may be more geologically rich, Dhawan said, but not one that sits at the intersection of a stable domestic political environment, and the provision of basic infrastructure and facilities and sufficient other investments complementary to the mining industry.\nAmong the most notable copper projects in Argentina is BHP and Lundin's Vicuna joint venture.\nSituated along the Chile-Argentina border, the Vicuna District is regarded as a geologically prospective region. Indeed, the deposits at Vicuna's Josemaria and Filo del Sol mines are estimated to contain 13 million metric tons of measured copper and 25 million tons of inferred copper.\nPolicy consistency and social licence will determine whether this is Argentina's mining moment or another mirage.Mariano MachadoAmericas principal analyst at Verisk Maplecroft\nFor ICMM's Dhawan, the potential significance of BHP and Lundin's Vicuna copper project is extraordinary.\n\"It's of the same importance to copper as Western Australia was to iron ore — and I don't say that lightly. It is a bold comparison to make but it is one that I do genuinely believe in,\" Dhawan said.\nA spokesperson for BHP and Lundin's Vicuna copper project said last month that the two companies intend to apply to receive benefits under RIGI, Reuters reported.\nA $47 billion opportunity\nArgentina's renewed mining focus comes as global copper demand is expected to skyrocket over the coming years, dramatically outstripping supply amid an artificial intelligence boom and a shift away from fossil fuels.\nAnalysts at consultancy CRU Group have estimated that the pipeline of Argentina's potential copper projects could represent a roughly $47 billion opportunity for the economy through to 2040.\nThis cumulative impact is comparable to the record $44-billion bailout loan Argentina received from the International Monetary Fund.\nA government spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment when contacted by CNBC.\nRead more\nAsked whether Argentina's long history of boom-and-bust economic cycles means Argentina's copper dreams could crumble once again, ICMM's Dhawan said: \"Where doesn't have that risk is the question I would ask?\"\nHe added: \"I just think that people have adjusted to a new normal expectation of quite significant volatility and that has almost worked in Argentina's favor. I think two things have happened, I think Argentina's stability has gone up and the world's stability has gone down.\"\nDhawan said it's not possible to predict which way Argentina will go, but investors appear to be prepared for different political and economic scenarios and that sovereign risk has been priced in.\nArgentina's mining moment?\nMariano Machado, principal analyst for the Americas at Verisk Maplecroft, said that while Argentina does possess the minerals needed to reshape its export base, \"policy consistency and social licence will determine whether this is Argentina's mining moment or another mirage.\"\n\"The country's policy swings have kept investment below potential levels, and the government's failure to persuade lawmakers from the opposition Union for the Homeland (UP) to vote for the RIGI means there is a risk that less private sector-friendly sectors will dispute its provisions if they make a comeback,\" Machado told CNBC by email.\n\"A new mining boom could also stoke anti-mining activism,\" he added. \"Issues around water, protection of glaciers and broader human rights underscore persistent challenges for companies to secure durable social licence to operate.\"", "content_hash": "4b52d00da89126336f2614c771ade18c", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Honeywell announced Thursday that its quantum computing company, Quantinuum, has raised another $600 million in funding at an approximately $10 billion valuation. The latest round, which doubles Quantinuum's valuation of $ 5 billion last seen in January 2024 , sets the privately held firm up for a highly anticipated initial public offering — a key step in unlocking value for Club holding Honeywell as its majority shareholder. Honeywell CFO Mike Stepniak said so himself in reaction to the fresh capital raise during an industry event on Thursday morning. \"I'm excited about commercializing this business and ultimately I think this really [gets us to an] IPO,\" Stepniak said at an industrials conferenced hosted by Jefferies. \"Our intent is to IPO this business.\" In July, Honeywell CEO Vimal Kapur said that the company is looking to bring Quantinuum public in 2027. A successful IPO would help show that Honeywell's long-term investment into Quantinuum will have been worth it. Quantinuum was formed back in 2021 following a merger of Honeywell's Quantum Solutions with Cambridge Quantum. However, it has never been a source of significant revenue or profits for the industrial conglomerate given quantum computing technology is still in the early innings and a ways off from widespread commercial use. In 2024, Honeywell reported a loss of $454 million for the segment that houses its stake in Quantinuum. Still, there's a lot of potential value to unlock for Honeywell because of the promise that many see in quantum computing, which can solve complex tasks far beyond the abilities of traditional computers due to fundamentally different architectures. Technology stalwarts including Alphabet and IBM are among those pursuing the nascent technology — in fact, it was a breakthrough quantum chip from Alphabet's Google in late 2024 that catalyzed a new wave of interest in the industry and sent stocks of publicly traded quantum firms on a major tear. Club name Nvidia has shown an increased focus on quantum , and its venture capital arm participated in Quantinuum's capital raise. Other new investors include Quant Computer, QED investors, and existing shareholders like JPMorgan Chase , Mitsui, among others. Financial services is one industry that sees a lot of potential in quantum computing, and JPMorgan even as an internal research group that focuses on the technology. Honeywell benefits from Quantinuum by more than just capitalizing on this trend, though. The market seems to have not realized Quantinuum's value to the industrial conglomerate yet either, according to Bank of America's Andrew Obin. \"What we've said is that the market doesn't seem to be assigning a particular value to their stake in Quantinuum, so risk/reward is definitely skewed to the upside,\" Obin told CNBC in an interview Thursday afternoon. Case in point: Shares of Honeywell were up only slightly on the Thursday announcement. Plus, Obin added that Quantinuum is just one of the ways \"you can win with Honeywell stock.\" The Club believes another is the company's forthcoming business spin-offs, which we have long argued will unlock more value for shareholders as Honeywell becomes a more streamlined company and its crown jewel aerospace segment gets to operate on its own. Honeywell's advanced materials business is on track to be spun off in the fourth quarter of this year, while the aerospace separation is tracking for next year.

Kennedy Jr. doubled down on false claims about vaccines and claimed he isn't limiting access to Covid shots during his Senate testimony on Thursday, as senators grilled him on his sweeping changes to immunization policy and federal health agencies.\nKennedy said he supports a statement made by a newly appointed member of a key government vaccine panel that mRNA vaccines pose a dangerous risk to people. Numerous studies have demonstrated that shots using mRNA technology, including Covid vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, are safe and effective, and serious side effects have happened in extremely rare cases.\nSen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., noted that the committee member, Dr. Retsef Levi, has said that evidence is mounting that mRNA vaccines cause \"serious harm, including death, especially among young people,\" apparently referring to a post pinned on Levi's X account. Kennedy appointed Levi to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine recommendations and insurance coverage.\nKennedy said he wasn't aware of Levi's comments, but added, \"I agree with it.\"\nHe also claimed that anyone could get a Covid booster shot, while also acknowledging that access \"depends on the state\" and that the government no longer recommends the vaccines for healthy people.\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved a fresh round of Covid shots with new limits, only clearing them for adults aged 65 and older and people with a medical condition that puts them at risk of a severe illness. The CDC and its vaccine panel will decide who to recommend the shots to later this month.\n\"I'm not taking them away from people,\" Kennedy said, referring to the vaccines.\nBut Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., argued that not everyone can walk into a pharmacy and get a Covid shot now.\nThe FDA's new limits have complicated Covid shot access in the U.S., which now depends on a patient's age and risk level, laws and policies in their state, insurance coverage, and health-care provider. Pending CDC guidance, some pharmacies have added prescription requirements for Covid vaccines in certain states.\n\"You clearly are taking away vaccines,\" she said after a prolonged shouting match with Kennedy.\nKennedy's comments before the Senate Finance Committee come after he repeatedly promised the panel in January that he would do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it more difficult or discourages people from taking vaccines. Since then, he has canceled funding for mRNA shot development and made other vaccine policy changes that could limit access to immunizations, including gutting the CDC vaccine panel and dropping Covid shot recommendations for certain groups.\nHis comments also follow a leadership shake-up at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The White House last week fired CDC Director Susan Monarez, and four senior agency officials resigned shortly after, with some of them citing the politicization of the agency and a threat to public health. In an opinion piece on Thursday, Monarez accused Kennedy of \"a deliberate effort to weaken America's public-health system and vaccine protections.\"\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X in support of Kennedy on Thursday, writing that he \"is taking flak because he's over the target\" and saying Democrats were attacking the Trump administration's \"commonsense effort.\"\nKennedy touted skepticism around Covid vaccines, despite evidence of their safety and effectiveness.\n\"We were told again and again the vaccines would prevent transmission, they prevent infection.

They knew it from the start,\" Kennedy said.\nHe also said he does not know how many people died of Covid and whether the vaccines prevented deaths from the virus.\n\"I would like to see the data and talk about the data,\" Kennedy said.\nBut data is readily available from dozens of studies. One paper in August estimates that Covid vaccines saved more than 2 million lives, mostly among older adults, worldwide between 2020 and October 2024.\nThe CDC website also says that Covid vaccines from the 2023 to 2024 season reduced the risk of severe illness from Covid by almost 70% in the first two months after vaccination in adults ages 18 and older, with protection gradually declining over time.\nThose shots also decreased the risk of hospitalization due to Covid by around 50% in the first two months of vaccination in that same population. The Covid vaccines showed similar benefits in older adults.\nKennedy also defended his decision to fire all 17 previous members of the CDC vaccine panel, saying he didn't politicize the committee.\n\"What we did is we got rid of the conflicts of interest. ... We depoliticized and put great scientists on it from a very diverse group,\" the HHS secretary said. \"They are very, very pro-vaccine.\"\nBut a new analysis published last month from USC researchers found that conflicts of interest on that panel had been at \"historic lows for years\" before Kennedy restacked it with new members, some of whom are widely known vaccine critics.\nCorrection: Kennedy testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday.

For those with at least two AI skills, the premium was 43% higher.\nThe study also noted three fields with the largest premium: customer and client support, sales, and manufacturing and production.\nJoshua Woo, founder of Recruit Fast, an employment agency in Singapore, made a similar observation that \"AI skills are paying above average in this market.\"\nHe added that they are no longer just nice to have, \"they're a differentiator.\"\nMore accessible\nLightcast's report identified over 300 AI skills ranging from AI ethics and generative AI to machine learning.\nThe study also found that different career areas required fundamentally different AI skills. For example, roles in transportation were likely to require autonomous driving skills, while maintenance positions prioritized robotics capabilities.\nThough many of the AI skills required high technical expertise, the most commonly-listed ones were often quite general, such as proficiency in the use of ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot.\nThese basic skills are becoming more prevalent and accessible in the job market, according to Bridget Wong, head of human relations at Accenture Singapore.\n\"While positions like decision scientist or LLM/data architect demand deep technical expertise, many operational and junior employees are also being equipped to work effectively with AI-enabled processes,\" Wong said.\nThus, \"there is no wrong stage in a career to learn AI—opportunities exist at every level, and organizations should invest in training and exposure to empower employees,\" she added.\nDemand in non-tech roles\nNotably, Lightcast's study found that demand for AI skills was higher in non-tech sectors than in IT and computer science, which are normally associated with AI.\nSince 2022, the year OpenAI launched ChatGPT, job postings mentioning generative AI skills were up 800% for non-tech roles, the study found.\nWhile IT and computer science still reigned the list of sectors demanding AI skills, marketing and public relations came in second place. This was followed by science & research, and social analysis and planning.\n\"It's not just software developers or the data scientists that are benefiting from AI skills; It's something people in everything from marketing to finance to HR should be thinking about,\" Magrini said.\n'Be prepared'\nAI skills \"are coming to every job function, to every career area, but at different paces,\" which means everybody needs a layer of AI literacy, Magrini said.\nRecruit Fast's Woo noted that AI skills are likely less relevant as prerequisites in blue-collar jobs as compared to other fields.\nStill, Magrini said that \"AI is coming, but we don't need to be scared.

It can't be too slow, nor can it be too hot.\nWall Street is on edge heading into Friday's nonfarm payrolls. Economists polled by Dow Jones are forecasting the U.S. economy added 75,000 jobs last month, a weak estimate that's only slightly higher than the dismal 73,000 headline number in the July report. The unemployment rate is also projected to tick higher, to 4.3% from 4.2%.\nInvestors may be able to shrug off a soft report so long as the headline number manages to hit a sweet spot, one that is cool enough to justify a September rate cut, but not so weak as to add to recession fears. Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge puts an \"ideal\" range that fulfills those two requirements between 70,000 and 95,000.\nThe August jobs report will also be heavily scrutinized for another reason. It will be the first after the poor jobs data and accompanying revisions last month prompted President Donald Trump to fire the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner. It's a decision that has spurred fears of government overreach and cast doubt over federal economic data.\nTrump nominated conservative economist E.J. Antoni to be the new head of the BLS. William Wiatrowski is acting commissioner until Antoni is confirmed.\nMarket reaction\nThe stock market could come under pressure if the jobs figure is outside of the expected range from traders. Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, worries a downside surprise is coming in the jobs data, one that will ding markets. Just not quite yet.\nThe economist, who is projecting nonfarm payrolls growth of 75,000 in August, said that he expects a negative jobs number will come in the second half of the year at some point. He said it's possible that the weak number could even come Friday.\nKKM Financial investment chief Jeff Kilburg worries Friday's jobs data could come in stronger than expected, given the low expectations heading into the report, and that could boost interest rates and reduce the chances the Fed cuts as many times as expected this year. Many traders are hoping for three rate cuts between now and year's end.\nUltimately, Wall Street is hoping for greater clarity on the labor market, one that is alarming some who have noted companies are abstaining from hiring or firing workers in a troubling pattern.\n\"Is this just a case of, sort of, a 'low hires, low fires,' kind of stagnant labor market, or is there some real deterioration that's starting to unfold?\" said John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Growth Innovators ETF. \"And historically, when the labor market has started to deteriorate, it has a tendency to quickly deteriorate further.\"\nADP's private employment report, which can sometimes be a precursor to the official figures that follow, was weaker-than expected on Thursday, but within a comfortable range that didn't panic markets. It showed an addition of just 54,000 private payrolls last month. The stock market gained on Thursday following the figures.", "content_hash": "5b4ebfbdb7ab64f3570f9c035031b511", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona, introduced a bill on Thursday — titled the You Earn It, You Keep it Act — to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits. A House version of the bill was introduced by Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minnesota, in April.\nGallego's bill would permanently eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits.\nIt would also expand the Social Security payroll tax to apply to annual earnings over $250,000. Currently, the maximum earnings subject to Social Security payroll taxes is $176,100 in 2025. Consequently, high earners may only pay into the program for part of the year.\n\"Despite decades of paying into the system, seniors are still forced to pay taxes on their hard-earned benefits — all while the ultra wealthy barely pay into the system,\" Gallego said in a statement.\nHow Social Security benefits are taxed\nSocial Security recipients may owe federal income taxes on their benefits depending on their income.\nHow much they may owe is based on a formula known as combined income — the sum of adjusted gross income, tax-exempt interest income and half of Social Security benefits.\nUp to 50% of benefits may be taxed for individual tax filers with between $25,000 and $34,000 in combined income, or married couples who file jointly with between $32,000 and $44,000.\nUp to 85% of benefits may be taxable for individuals with more than $34,000 in combined income or couples with more than $44,000.\nHow the 'big beautiful' tax law helps seniors\nRepublicans' new \"big beautiful\" law includes a new senior deduction aimed at helping to defray the effects of federal taxes on Social Security benefits.\nAdults aged 65 and over may be able to claim an additional deduction of up to $6,000.\nWhether beneficiaries will benefit from the change will depend on their income.\nThe full deduction will be available to individual taxpayers with up to $75,000 in modified adjusted gross income or married couples with up to $150,000. The deduction will gradually phase out for taxpayers with incomes above those thresholds.\nThe temporary deduction — which will be in effect for tax years 2025 through 2028 — will be available to eligible taxpayers regardless of whether they take the standard deduction or itemize their returns.\nMiddle-income taxpayers stand to benefit the most from the policy, according to tax experts, since low earners may already be exempt from federal taxes on benefits and higher earners will be above the phaseout thresholds.\nHow 'You Earn It, You Keep It' may affect Social Security\nUnlike the temporary senior deduction recently signed into law, Gallego's You Earn It, You Keep It proposal would eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits for all beneficiaries.\nTo be sure, it remains to be seen whether it may get enough support to become law.\nThe proposal does have the support of The Senior Citizens League, a nonpartisan senior advocacy group that is petitioning Congress to stop taxing Social Security benefits. Eliminating federal taxes on Social Security benefits is a \"commonsense step to ensure older Americans can keep more of what they've earned,\" Senior Citizens League Executive Director Shannon Benton said in a statement.\nEfforts to change the federal taxation of Social Security benefits come as the program is facing a trust fund shortfall. Benefits may be reduced within the next decade unless Congress enacts changes sooner, according to projections from Social Security's trustees.\nBecause the \"big beautiful\" law did not include any offsets for the reduced revenue from federal taxes on benefits, it would accelerate the depletion dates, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\nIn contrast, the You Earned It, You Keep It proposal would extend the Social Security trust funds' ability to pay benefits in full and on time for 24 years, or until 2058, according to Gallego's office. That matches an analysis of Craig's House proposal by Social Security's chief actuary in April.", "content_hash": "c9191b29aba6f9e461228cb296b7877b", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

He pointed to the deals available at the Excalibur, one of MGM's resorts on the Las Vegas Strip: $85 rooms, including resort fee; $5 tables; $5 beers.

And the industry as a whole is facing some troubling obstacles.\nCanadian visitation to the U.S. has plummeted some 40% this year, following comments by President Donald Trump about Canada as a potential 51st U.S. state and evolving trade policies. The Canadian dollar has also weakened, lessening the buying power of visitors crossing the border into the U.S.\nHornbuckle also pointed to massive price hikes for a U.S. visa, from $100 to $350, where a family of four visiting for the Ryder Cup, World Cup or Olympics in 2028, for example, could pay $1,400 for visa documents alone.\n\"International travel in 2016 had a $50 billion U.S. surplus. Today it's a $50 billion deficit,\" Hornbuckle said.\nThe government's commitment to funding marketing and promotion of U.S. travel was also slashed by 80% in the most recent spending bill, to $20 million.\n\"We obviously find ourselves in a world that has a fair amount of uncertainty from a macroeconomic perspective, from a socio-political perspective,\" Marriott CEO Tony Capuano told investors at the BofA conference Thursday. \"Marriott, and the sector more broadly, thrives in times of certainty and stability. So that creates some measure of challenge.\"\nCapuano said there's been a slight uptick after Labor Day in some segments of travel. He said Marriott sees spending restrained in budget travelers and small businesses. But he described demand for luxury travel as \"sturdy.\"\nWyndham Hotel and Resorts CEO Geoff Ballotti laid out an optimistic view of the travel industry, noting robust demand for extended stay, driven in part by projects supporting the government's infrastructure spending.\n\"You're seeing incredible interest in investment right now,\" Ballotti told CNBC. \"Our new construction pipeline, 20 consecutive quarters of growth, is at an all-time high.

That implies 122% upside from its current share price of $90.\nHere's what investors should know about CoreWeave.\nBulls say CoreWeave is a leading provider of cloud AI services\nCoreWeave provides cloud infrastructure and software services purpose built for artificial intelligence (AI), and its data centers exclusively use Nvidia GPUs. SemiAnalysis recently ranked CoreWeave as the best AI cloud on the market, awarding it a higher score than Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform. That praise reflects two competitive advantages.\nFirst, CoreWeave is frequently the first cloud platform to bring new chips to market because of its longstanding relationship with Nvidia. For instance, the company was the first to deploy Nvidia H100 and H200 systems, and it more recently became the first company to deploy Nvidia GB200 and GB300 systems. Early access to the latest technologies is a compelling reason to work with CoreWeave.\nSecond, CoreWeave often achieves top results at the MLPerf benchmarks, standardized tests that measure artificial intelligence systems across training and inference use cases. The company says its infrastructure and software expertise results in up to 20% higher GPU cluster performance than alternative solutions.\nCoreWeave reported tremendous demand in the second quarter. Revenue soared 207% to $1.2 billion and non-GAAP operating income increased 135% to $200 million. In addition, the company said its revenue backlog increased 86% because of expanded deals with OpenAI and an unnamed hyperscale company (possibly Google).\nBears say CoreWeave has a capital-intensive business model\nCoreWeave currently operates 33 data centers across the United States and Europe, with at least two more under construction, one in Pennsylvania and another in New Jersey. But operating data centers, especially when those data centers are filled with AI infrastructure, is very expensive.\nSo CoreWeave has taken on substantial debt. And while the company says it has done so responsibly -- never taking on debt unless a signed contract creates a need for additional infrastructure, and only if the contract covers the entire cost of the debt -- the interest payments associated with its debt are already cutting deeply into profitability.\nAs mentioned, CoreWeave said adjusted operating income increased 135% to $200 million in the second quarter. But that number excludes interest expense. When accounting for those costs, the company reported an adjusted net loss of $131 million, a much stepper loss than $5 million in the same quarter last year.\nImportantly, CoreWeave plans to unlock cost efficiencies by acquiring longtime partner Core Scientific, an infrastructure company that owns nine U.S. data centers. Management says the deal, expected to close in the fourth quarter, will eliminate more than $10 billion in future lease overhead, and result in additional annual cost savings of $500 million by the end of 2027.\nHowever, some analysts have raised questions about the terms of the all-stock deal, which stipulate Core Scientific stockholders get 0.1235 shares of CoreWeave for every share of Core Scientific. Those terms valued Core Scientific at $9 billion when the deal was announced. But CoreWeave stock has since dropped 44%.\nThe risk here is shareholder dilution. CoreWeave will probably have to renegotiate deal with a higher exchange ratio to account for the sharp decline in its own stock. In that scenario, current shareholders would be diluted even more extensively than under the original terms.\nCoreWeave trades at a reasonable valuation, but the stock is likely to be volatile\nCoreWeave shares have advanced 125% since its March IPO, but the stock has also fallen 44% from the record high it reached in July. Currently, shares trade at 10 times sales, a very reasonable multiple for a company whose revenue is forecast to increase at 127% annually through 2026.\nHowever, CoreWeave is not expected to be profitable until at least 2027, which means the stock is likely to be volatile in the interim. Only patient investors comfortable with that risk should consider buying this AI stock, and they should start with a very small position.", "content_hash": "295db2b361b543d27ec949dc3f3d5063", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The ruling, for instance, leaves intact the multibillion-dollar arrangement that makes Google the default on Apple devices -- a high-margin revenue stream that investors in the iPhone-maker have worried could be curtailed.\nThe market's read-through was simple: Alphabet's win reduces uncertainty for Apple, which reportedly receives around tens of billions of dollars annually from Alphabet to keep Google Search as the default on Safari. Those traffic-acquisition payments have long been a quiet but meaningful contributor to Apple's Services economics, so clarity on their continuation helps sentiment toward the stock.\nFor context, Alphabet shares also rose on the news, underscoring how central these agreements are across the ecosystem.\nApple investors can now pivot from \"Will the deal be killed?\" to \"What does Apple's business look like with the deal preserved?\"\nAdding to Apple's momentum\nThis news just adds to a growing bull case for Apple stock.\nThe tech company's most recent quarter -- fiscal Q3 -- was solid. Revenue rose 10% to $94 billion and earnings per share (EPS) increased 12% to $1.57 -- both June-quarter records. Capturing some of the quarter's key catalysts, Apple's services revenue reached an all-time high and iPhone posted double-digit growth.\nWith this legal overhang behind the company, investors can begin giving more weight to Apple's financial momentum in their analysis. The concern was big enough that it even came up in Apple's most recent earnings call. CEO Tim Cook explicitly conditioned Apple's forward-looking \"color\" on assumptions that \"the current revenue-share agreement with Google continues.\" That's unusually direct language for Apple, indicating the deal's materiality to near-term planning.\nInvestors don't need to model precise dollars to grasp the takeaway: the high-margin engine just avoided a forced reset. Apple's services business mix boasts higher margins than its hardware sales, so preserving the Google payments stabilizes a line item that helps EPS compounding. For the nine months ended June 28, for instance, Apple's services gross margin was 75% -- more than twice its hardware gross margin of 37%.\nWhy this week's ruling matters from here\nNear-term, the decision removes a key bear argument around Apple's services segment's durability. If you believed a ban on default payments would hit high-margin revenue and compress the multiple, that tail risk just faded. Wedbush called the outcome a \"monster win\" for Apple and a \"home run\" for Google -- language that captures why both stocks rallied, even if investors should still track any negotiated tweaks that emerge.\nOf course, with Apple stock rising sharply in recent weeks, valuation is more of a concern. Apple trades at a premium on trailing earnings -- about 36 times earnings as of this writing -- which means upside depends more on execution than multiple expansion from here. However, with the company's iPhone and services segments growing nicely, a clean balance sheet, and steady capital returns, shares still look attractive. But the market will need to see continued momentum in Apple's important services business.\nThe bigger picture for long-term holders is straightforward. This week's ruling kept a high-margin revenue source intact and aligned with what management had assumed on the third-quarter earnings call, reinforcing the base case for EPS growth. There are still risks. Appeal risk and Google's new data-sharing requirements, for instance, add some noise. But Apple now faces that future with one less black cloud and with fundamentals doing their part.", "content_hash": "af65fb1c66e752a6e82c2e347063dc39", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Each has a powerful commerce engine, a fast-growing cloud platform, and a significant opportunity in AI infrastructure and applications.\nBut when you strip away headlines and focus on the operating results and the playbook for the next few years, one option stands out as the clear winner.\nAmazon: broad-based, profitable growth\nAmazon's latest quarter showed healthy top-line growth and strong profit execution. Revenue rose double digits, with both its North America and international year-over-year growth rates in top-line revenue accelerating significantly, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) expanding at a rate of nearly 18% year over year. Operating income climbed sharply as the company continues to drive efficiency across fulfillment and cloud. It's the kind of combination long-term investors want: growth with expanding earnings power.\nFurthermore, AWS's momentum and scale are extraordinary. The cloud-computing business's annualized revenue run rate is now just over $123 billion. The business has powerful momentum in AI. For generative AI solutions, specifically, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in its second-quarter earnings call that it is growing sales by a triple-digit year-over-year percentage and has \"more demand than we have supplied for at the moment.\"\nHighlighting the benefit of Amazon's scale, the cloud computing segment's operating margin remains robust -- at 32.9% (adjusted to exclude the impact of foreign exchange headwinds) in Q2 -- even as Amazon steps up investment in data centers, networking, and accelerators to meet AI demand.\nMeanwhile, Amazon's online store segment, where the company records e-commerce sales, grew by 11% year over year in Q2 -- up from 5% growth in Q1. Similarly, the company's high-margin advertising business clearly accelerated because Amazon's other revenue segment, which primarily consists of advertising sales, grew 19% year over year in Q2 -- up from a growth rate of 4% in Q1.\nAlibaba: A cheaper valuation -- but for a reason\nAlibaba's latest quarter gave investors a clear (and bullish) data point: accelerated cloud growth and the stock ripped higher. Revenue in its cloud intelligence segment rose 26% year over year, powered by an eighth quarter in a row of triple-digit year-over-year growth in AI-related product revenue.\nThe overall picture of Alibaba's business, however, is more nuanced. Total revenue increased just 2% year over year, or 10% when excluding sales in the year-ago quarter from recently sold businesses. Further, Alibaba's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITDA) fell 14% year over year as the e-commerce and cloud-computing company leaned into what it calls \"quick commerce,\" or ultra-fast delivery, broader user experience investments, and AI. These heavy investments also meant that free cash flow went from positive in the year-ago quarter to negative.\nA clear winner\nBoth stocks could end up being long-term winners. But Amazon ultimately offers the better risk-reward.\nAlibaba is cheaper on traditional valuation multiples (but more expensive than it used to be after its recent sharp move higher) and is returning significant capital via buybacks and dividends. This lower valuation helps make up for the company's lower growth and some of the risks associated with China's weak macroeconomic backdrop. Indeed, given how cheap the stock's valuations is (it currently trades at just 15 times earnings), Alibaba could end up being a bargain in hindsight. But only if China's economy picks up speed and consumer and enterprise spending reaccelerate. If this happens, the upside in the stock price could be massive. But the company still has some things it needs to prove to investors to command a higher valuation multiple; it needs to demonstrate scalability, shown by operating margin expansion and free cash flow improvement, as Alibaba grows. We're not there yet.\nUltimately, Amazon offers the cleaner, more reliable setup. The company has three growth vectors that reinforce one another: retail, advertising, and cloud -- and each of these drivers will likely contribute substantially to Amazon's business in the coming years. Retail keeps getting faster and more convenient, ads help further monetize the company's e-commerce customers, and AWS offers investors a fast-growing, high-margin catalyst for the business. Together, Amazon's broad-based catalyst of scaled and profitable business segments provides investors with more certainty when thinking about the company's long-term potential.\nIf I had to pick just one of these two growth stocks today, I'd choose Amazon -- despite its higher valuation of about 35 times earnings. The operating momentum is better, the AI strategy is tied to an already scaled platform, and the cash generation gives the company room to invest through cycles. Alibaba is investable and improving, but the execution bar (and ultimately the risk) is higher.", "content_hash": "3a73d7a5744c1c5677f9f7480385dff9", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Trump said that he would soon impose “fairly substantial” tariffs on semiconductor imports, but noted that companies relocating their manufacturing to the US could see their products exempted from the next levy.\n“We’ll be putting a tariff very shortly. You probably are hearing we’ll be putting a fairly substantial tariff,\" the president said, adding that it concerns companies that do not shift production to the US.\n“We’ll be putting tariffs on companies that aren’t coming in,” Trump said.

Based on estimates from Mordor Intelligence, the global retail industry will grow from an estimated $27.3 trillion this year to about $36.9 trillion by the turn of the decade.\nWith an addressable market this massive, it should come as no surprise that retail is one of the most competitive industries on the planet. However, there are a handful of retail standouts, including e-commerce giant Amazon, superstore chain Walmart, and of course warehouse club Costco Wholesale (COST 0.64%).\nWhile Amazon and Walmart have (mostly) grown their respective businesses traditionally, Costco is the oddball of the bunch. It's known for its quirky deals, such as the $1.50 hot-dog combo for members, generous return policy, and its penchant for selling one-of-a-kind and unexpected items, such as gold bars and luxury jewelry.\nCostco's 79.6 million paying members, as of the end of the fiscal third quarter (May 11, 2025), have come to expect these perks and surprises. But a new rule is a complete game-changer for many of its paying cardholders.\nCostco's executive members just earned a lucrative new perk\nTo shop in one of Costco's more than 900 warehouse locations, you'll need a membership. Approximately 42 million of its paid membership are gold star and business level, which each carry a $65 annual cost. The remaining 37.6 million are executive level, which carries twice the annual cost ($130), but also lays on the perks.\nAccording to Costco, its executive members can earn up to 2% back on most purchases totaling up to $1,250 annually, as well as receive a monthly credit of $10 for eligible delivery orders topping $150. Executive cardholders may also qualify for discounts on Costco travel packages.\nThe reason the company caters to this group is because they're responsible for the bulk of net sales. Despite accounting for \"just\" 47% of total memberships, executive cardholders were responsible for approximately 73% of sales during the fiscal third quarter. Keeping these folks happy and sustaining annual renewal rates above 90% is key to Costco's success.\nBut a newly announced perk for executive members, which was unveiled in June but only fully implemented earlier this week, is bound to turn heads.\nOn June 11, Costco revealed plans to allow its executive cardholders exclusive shopping hours seven days a week in its more than 600 U.S. warehouses. On weekdays and Sundays, only executive members will be allowed to enter its warehouses from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., with this exclusive shopping window narrowed to 30 minutes (9 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.) on Saturdays. Though this policy technically went into effect at the end of June, there had been a two-month grace period where gold star and business members were allowed in. This isn't the case any longer.\nWhile some non-executive members have expressed frustration with this new policy, it's a smart move by Costco to put the proverbial carrot at the end of the stick and encourage existing gold star and business members to upgrade.\nMembership fees are a key ingredient to Costco's competitive edge\nThough membership fees aren't the only factor responsible for making Costco such a successful growth stock and phenomenal multidecade investment, they play an undeniably important role.\nGroceries act as the primary lure responsible for getting people into Costco's warehouses. However, food and beverages traditionally sport razor-thin margins. Since membership fees flow almost entirely to Costco's bottom line, they can be used as something of a buffer to offset the minuscule margins tied to groceries.\nArguably even more important, membership fees afford Costco a pricing buffer. Management understands fully that members of all levels expect various perks, including prices on most groceries that'll undercut traditional mom and pop shops and national grocery chains. The membership fees Costco receives are one of the reasons it can keep prices on basic need goods so comparatively low. It's something of a repeating cycle that works in the company's favor.\nCostco Wholesale's size shouldn't be overlooked, either. When a company has deep pockets, it's often able to buy products in bulk, which reduces the per-unit cost for each item. These lower costs can then be passed along to its members as a key perk to shopping in its warehouses.\nEven though cardholders are likely heading to Costco for groceries and other household necessities, it only takes a handful of higher-margin discretionary purchases for the company to benefit. It also doesn't hurt when members buy Costco's private-label brand, Kirkland Signature, which tends to boast premium margins, relative to comparable products.\nThere's no denying this formula works. Just over 90% of its worldwide customers renewed their memberships, based on fiscal third-quarter data, with an even higher 92.7% renewal rate in the U.S. and Canada. It also boasts exceptional membership pricing power, with the number of paid memberships growing following a fee increase on Sept. 1, 2024.\nThere's a reason investors have been paying a traditionally head-scratching (for a retail company) forward-year earnings multiple of 47 to buy shares of Costco stock. Given its array of competitive advantages, and the exceptional loyalty of its shoppers, there's a good likelihood this new perk is going to mint even more executive level cardholders in the quarters that lie ahead.", "content_hash": "cda69b4754487e45f02c700f686e0666", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

I just wanted to talk about the AI business, specifically the XPU. When you said you're going to grow significantly faster than what you had thought a quarter ago, what's changed? Is it just the impressive prospect moving to a customer definition, or is it stronger demand across the existing three customers? A: I think it's both. But to a large extent, it's the fourth customer that we now add to our roster, which we will ship pretty strongly in 2026. So a combination of increasing volumes from existing three customers and the addition of a fourth customer with immediate and substantial demand really changes our outlook for 2026.\nQ: Near term, from the cyclical bottom, how should we think about the magnitude of the cyclical upturn in the non-AI semiconductor business? Are you seeing continued order improvements in the non-AI segment, which would point to continued cyclical recovery into next fiscal year? A: From a year-on-year Q4 guidance, we are actually up slightly. The only consistent trend we've seen over the last three quarters that is moving up strongly is broadband. Non-AI semiconductor is slow to recover, and Q4 year-on-year is maybe low single digit. I'm expecting to see more of a U-shaped recovery in non-AI, perhaps by late mid '26, late '26.\nQ: Can you help us quantify what is the new fiscal '26 AI guidance? And do you expect the custom versus networking mix to stay broadly what it has been this past year or evolve more towards custom? A: We are expecting and seeing 2026 to accelerate more than the growth rate we see in '25. Regarding the mix, as we gain more experience among four customers, the networking percentage of the pool will be a declining percentage going into '26.\nQ: Could you give some color on the $110 billion backlog? How much of that is AI versus non-AI versus software? A: We generally don't break up backlog, but it's largely driven by AI in terms of growth. Software continues to add steadily, and non-AI has grown double digits. Fully 50% of it at least is semiconductors, and it's fair to say that semiconductor piece is much more AI than non-AI.\nQ: How is the dialogue going beyond these four customers? Are you hearing from others, and how is the trend going with the other three prospects? A: We have identified seven prospects, four of which are now customers. We are very picky and careful about who qualifies, and we may see one more prospect. But right now, for sure, we have seven, and that is pretty much what we have.", "content_hash": "e66039ced60cfdbe0939fcd855381170", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

A quick look at the world's most valuable companies shows that nine of the top 10 are pioneers in AI, all jockeying for a shot at the title.\nNvidia recently made headlines by becoming the world's first $4 trillion company and currently clocks in at $4.1 trillion. Microsoft and Apple are close on its heels, with market caps of $3.7 trillion and $3.5 trillion, respectively. Rounding out the top five are Alphabet and Amazon, worth $2.7 trillion and $2.4 trillion, respectively.\nWith a current market cap of just $372 billion, it may seem premature to suggest that Palantir Technologies (PLTR 0.79%) could soar 169% to earn its place in the $1 trillion club. Yet while many companies are still working to comprehend this paradigm shift, Palantir is helping businesses profit from AI and enriching shareholders along the way.\nDecades of AI expertise\nYears before the company went public, Palantir had been toiling away on advanced AI algorithms for defense and intelligence agencies within the U.S. government. In recent years, the company has also focused on enterprise software that saves businesses time and money.\nBut it was Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform that catapulted the company to AI stardom, as the system leverages generative AI to develop real-time solutions to company-specific problems.\nThe two biggest stumbling blocks to adopting AI are knowing exactly where to begin and getting a solid return on investment (ROI). Palantir was able to solve both of those challenges with a simple strategy.\nPalantir invites developers and business leaders to attend \"boot camps,\" or workshops that show AIP in action. During these interactive sessions, users work side-by-side with Palantir engineers to develop solutions to their real-world business problems.\nThis strategy is a clear winner. In the second quarter, Palantir's revenue of $1 billion climbed 48% year over year and 14% sequentially. The star of the show was its U.S. commercial revenue, which surged 93% to $306 million, representing nearly 31% of total revenue, fueled by ongoing demand for AIP. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.16, which surged 78%.\nThe segment ended the quarter with contract value of $843 million, up 222% year over year. This helped drive Palantir's remaining performance obligation (RPO) -- or contractually obligated sales that aren't yet included in revenue -- up a whopping 77% to $2.4 billion.\nPalantir also boosted its full-year guidance, forecasting at least 85% growth for the U.S. commercial segment (namely AIP) for 2025, up from its previous outlook for 68% growth.\nThe path to $1 trillion\nPalantir's decades of experience and its groundbreaking AI solutions have created a windfall for shareholders, and there could be much more to come.\nAccording to Wall Street, Palantir is expected to generate sales of $4.1 billion in 2025, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of about 89 (not a typo). Assuming its P/S remains constant, Palantir would have to generate revenue of more than $11 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap.\nWall Street is forecasting annual revenue growth of 38.7% for Palantir over the next five years. If the company is able to grow at that pace, it could reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2028. But if Palantir's sales and profit growth continue to accelerate, it could achieve that benchmark even sooner.\nI'm not the only one who thinks so. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has run the models and calculated that Palantir's market cap could hit $1 trillion sometime in 2027 or 2028. Ives argues that investors focused solely on valuation have missed \"every transformational tech stock over the past 20 years.\" He goes on to say that AI will be the driving factor behind Palantir's success.\nPalantir's operational and financial trajectory seems to back up that assertion, as the company continues to announce new and larger customer wins and its sales and profits continue to accelerate.\nEvery rose has its thorns\nLest there be any doubt, and as promising as Palantir is, there are also plenty of things that could go wrong. The development of AI could stall, the economy could hit a rough patch, or Palantir could fail to capitalize on the tremendous opportunity that is AI -- and any of these could send the stock careening lower. Let's not forget the company's valuation, which is extreme, to say the least.\nPalantir is currently selling for 66 times next year's sales and 184 times next year's earnings. History shows that the higher the multiple, the more extreme the volatility, and Palantir isn't immune. Investors should prepare themselves for significant stock price movements, which aren't for the faint of heart.\nEstimates abound for the potential of generative AI, but the software opportunity alone is intriguing. Cathie Wood, founder and CEO of Ark Investment Management, suggests that if software purveyors are able to capture 10% of the value created by their AI-focused products, it could generate as much as $14 trillion in revenue in 2030.\nIf Palantir continues along its current trajectory, helping companies drive positive ROI for their AI spending -- and I believe it can -- it could achieve a $1 trillion market cap sooner than many expect.", "content_hash": "dbb9de435376779d026bc8e18dbf2f4e", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Revenue from China gained 4.4% in the June quarter — but that was only its first rise in two years, and it’s lost market share there to local rivals like Xiaomi Corp.\nRead: Apple’s China Comeback Fueled by Mac Sales, iPhone Upgrades\nApple did not respond to requests for comment.\nAs part of its retail push in India, Apple just added two new stores in the cities of Bangalore and Pune this week. It’s also is planning to launch a new outlet in Noida, on the outskirts of Delhi, and another in Mumbai early next year.\nThe US company in 2023 reshuffled management of its international businesses, making India its own sales region due to the growth potential the market offers with its rising incomes and a burgeoning middle class. IPhones, viewed by many Indians as a status symbol, currently account for about 7% of the local smartphone market, according to Tarun Pathak of Counterpoint Research.\nIndia’s local sourcing requirements prevented Apple from opening its iconic stores in the South Asian nation for years. As the policy eased, Apple finally launched its online store in India in 2020. Apple’s Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook then inaugurated the first two stores in India, respectively located in the financial hub of Mumbai and capital New Delhi, in 2023. The company has since boosted its retail network in the country and added more premium resellers.", "content_hash": "50e689981c47fc33738f0a4673aacf17", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

In other words, it's finding even more exclusive opportunities in an already exclusive market.\nREAD MORE:\nSeparately,\nMeanwhile,\nAll in for alts\nThe firms' announcements\nWhatever the pitfalls, numerous surveys and reports suggest investor demand for alternatives is running high. The investment bank Robert A. Stanger reported in January that $122 billion was raised for alts from everyday \"retail\" investors in 2024, topping the previous high of $105 billion set in 2022.\nMeanwhile Bank of America Private Bank found last year that demand for alternatives is particularly strong among investors between the ages of 21 and 43. Drawing on results from a\nThat cohort's allocation is already higher than older clients' — 17% of their total portfolios vs. 5% for investors 44 and older. And they want more.\nMerrill and Bank of America Private Bank's offering for the ultrarich\nBank of America Private Bank and Merrill is among the many large wealth managers scrambling to meet this demand with an array of new products and offerings. Its Alts Expanded Access Program for investors with $50 million or more \"will be supplemental to the core alternative platform that we already have, and ultimately, it'll allow us to bring more offerings to market than we do today,\" said Mark Sutterlin, head of alternative investments.\nSutterlin said Merrill and the private bank are working with a third-party firm — which he declined to name — to find harder-to-access private investments that may be of interest to ultrahigh net worth clients.\nSometimes these opportunities will come with smaller-than-usual capacity allotments, meaning the percentage of a fund set aside for investors at a particular institution. Also unlike standard investments in private equity, the offerings will allow investors to become limited partners in the funds they're putting money into. As a result, they will have greater responsibility for vetting the various opportunities they're presented with. Sutterlin said that doesn't mean Merill and the private bank are abandoning their fiduciary duties to investors. Ultimately, he said, and that they will still be responsible for making sure anything they recommend is in their clients' best interests.\n\"But I would say that the ability for investors to do independent diligence, and the expectation that these investors are going to have more experience in private markets and a higher level of expertise in terms of private market investing, is part of what allows us to do a broader based offering for these types of funds,\" Sutterlin said.\nSutterlin said advisors at Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank are now learning about the Alts Expanded Access Program and they'll begin to introduce clients to funds through it starting this fall. He said there are no plans now to offer it to investors below the $50 million asset threshold.\nGoldman and the push to allow alts in retirement plans\nElsewhere, though, a movement is afoot to bring more of the so-called mass affluent into private and alternative markets — and it's\nPresident Donald Trump\nThe order provoked an outcry. American Retirement Association CEO Brian Graff argued that fiduciaries, not the government, should be the ones deciding if an investment class is appropriate for plan participants.\n\"Professional retirement plan fiduciaries that are subject to strict fiduciary standards — not the federal government — are in the best position to assess developments in the financial markets and determine what is in the financial best interest of retirement plan participants and beneficiaries,\" Graff said in a statement in response to Trump's executive order.\nDee Sawyer, head of global distribution at T. Rowe Price, said the target date funds are still being designed for release by the middle of next year so it's hard to say now exactly what strategies they will employ.\n\"Everybody is unique, but at different points in time, you can have an exposure to different types of solutions, including private markets, and we think that there's opportunities to have that across the spectrum,\" Sawyer said.\nSawyer said she and her colleagues at T. Rowe Price welcomed Trump's order calling on the DOL to reconsider its fiduciary guidelines for private investments in retirement plans.\n\"And the reason for that is because it allows more plan sponsors the ability to offer these solutions from a fiduciary perspective, without a concern of litigation risk, which is a real concern of plan sponsors,\" she said.\nMeanwhile,\nGreg Wilson, head of retirement for\n\"Companies are staying private longer,\" Wilson said. \"So when you look at private equity returns over a 10-, 15- and 20-year basis, they've outperformed public equity equivalents. Making these available to the primary source of retirement savings today, which is in the 401(k) plan, we think is absolutely appropriate within a professionally managed portfolio.\"\nWells sees the value in simplicity even with complex products\nMeanwhile,\nWells is working with the wealth technology firm InvestCloud to offer UMA clients access not only to alternative markets but trading strategies involving derivatives and long and short positions that can be used to reduce investing risks. Previously, Maddox said, Wells advisors had to manage clients' allocations to private markets separate from all their other investments.\nBy bringing it all into one system, advisors should have an easier time with tasks like rebalancing — or buying and selling assets to make sure they maintain a certain proportion to each other in a portfolio. To be included in the UMA, alternative investments and other products also can't charge clients separate sales commissions; everything has to be paid for using a simple fee.\n\"This just makes it very simple for advisors and clients to understand where it's just one account wrap fee,\" Maddox said.\n\"This consolidation of different investment product types into one platform, one program, one advisory relationship, is an industry trend,\" he added. \"I think that will continue. We'll start to see everything kind of collapse into these single-platform sources.\"\nThe biggest barrier to getting into alts\nTo Brian Griggs, the head of portfolio strategy and solutions at the investment management firm Nuveen, the biggest barrier to bringing more regular investors into private markets is a simple lack of understanding. One of Nuveen's lines of business is working with wealth managers at registered investment advisors and other firms and helping them provide opportunities in alternatives and other markets.\nTo better shed light on the benefits but also possible risks of alts, Nuveen has started what it calls its\n\"I would say 5% might be too little,\" Griggs said. \"It might not be worth the extra effort of understanding these assets if you're just going to allocate 5%. But then we also work with some family offices and RIAs that have some of their clients with anywhere up to 50% in private markets.\"\nThe biggest of those factors is an investor's likely need for cash at any given moment. One of the knocks against private investments is that they are often \"illiquid\" — or harder to pull money out of than stocks and bonds.\n\"I think most advisors would say most of their clients don't need 100% of their portfolio in liquid stocks and bonds,\" Griggs said. \"So if you can answer that question with confidence, then all of a sudden it opens up the opportunity to put more of the portfolio in these more diversifying private markets.\"", "content_hash": "ff52bd4a2156c00207f2d1c866bcd60a", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Clients will eventually gain direct access to data rooms and fund information, a nod to the institutionalization of private wealth.\nBut this move isn't happening in isolation. Wall Street's biggest players are all repositioning. Goldman Sachs (GS) just committed up to $1 billion to partner with T.

Morgan Stanley has already entered the arena with a fund focused on co-investments and secondaries in the lower-middle market. Across the board, the bar to entry is fallingfrom $50 million down to $5 million, with firms increasingly eyeing the swelling cohort of mass-affluent investors with portfolios in the $1$5 million range.\nWhy now? Institutionspensions, endowments, sovereignsare pulling back. Higher rates have made public markets more attractive and reduced the need to chase illiquid alpha. That's left firms like Apollo (NYSE:APO), Ares (NYSE:ARES), Blackstone (NYSE:BX), and KKR (NYSE:KKR) hunting for new capital. The next frontier? Mini-millionaires.

Under the deal, BlackRock will take over portfolio management duties for thousands of Citi's high-net-worth clients, while Citi retains advisory control. About 100 staff, including CIO Robert Jasminski, will make the jump. Completion is targeted for year-end.\nThis isn't just another asset management outsourcing. It's a structural bet. Andy Sieg, who joined Citi in 2023 to lead the wealth division, said it bluntly: Citi alone couldn't double the platformit needed BlackRock's global engine to scale. Sieg has spent the past year ripping out complexityexiting the trust admin business, cutting headcount, and dumping legacy platforms.

This was followed by Fidelity’s FETH, which added $65.8 million, and Grayscale’s lower-fee Mini Trust, which attracted $62.5 million.\nBitwise logged $20.8 million in fresh inflows, while other issuers such as VanEck, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, and Invesco saw no major changes.\nDespite the setback, cumulative inflows across all Ethereum ETFs remain positive at $13.34 billion, with BlackRock accounting for about $13 billion of that total.\nThe surge reverses a trend from August, when Ethereum funds dominated activity. ETH products attracted $3.87 billion in inflows last month compared with $751 million in Bitcoin outflows.\nTrading volumes showed the divergence, with Ethereum ETF activity jumping to $58.3 billion in August, nearly double July’s total, while Bitcoin volumes slipped to $78.1 billion.\nEthereum also posted a new all-time high of $4,953 in August, supported by corporate treasuries holding a combined $119.6 billion of ETH by the end of the month.\nBut September is telling a different story. On August 29, Ethereum ETFs logged $164.6 million in outflows, breaking a five-day inflow streak that had added $1.5 billion.\nCumulative inflows remain positive at $13.34 billion, almost entirely concentrated in BlackRock’s ETHA, which accounts for $13.1 billion. Analysts note Ethereum historically struggles in September, citing $46.5 million in ETF outflows during the same month in 2024.\nBitcoin, by contrast, gained $1.26 billion that September, benefiting from risk-off positioning.\nWhales Scoop Up $620M in Ether as Institutions Boost Exposure\nDespite the latest ETF withdrawals, whale and institutional activity suggest a sustained appetite for Ether.\nLast week, nine large addresses purchased $456.8 million worth of ETH, with five wallets receiving transfers from custodian BitGo and others acquiring coins through Galaxy Digital.\nLookonchain data added that newly created wallets accumulated another 35,948 ETH, worth $164 million, within eight hours, with tokens sourced from FalconX and Galaxy Digital.\nInstitutions are also active. Bitmine received 14,665 ETH worth $65.3 million from Galaxy Digital, while three wallets received 65,662 ETH, valued at $293 million, from FalconX.\nMeanwhile, BlackRock deposited 33,884 ETH, worth $148.6 million, into Coinbase Prime. The activity follows reports that the firm sold $151.4 million in ETH while doubling its Bitcoin purchases, illustrating shifting allocations between the two assets.\nEthereum’s relative strength adds context. Over the past month, Ether has gained 18.5%, while Bitcoin has slipped 6.4%. ETH now trades 6.7% below its record high, while Bitcoin remains more than 10% off its $124,500 all-time high earlier this year\nAnalysts pointed out that some long-term Bitcoin holders are taking profits. A whale who bought BTC in 2013 at $332 recently moved 750 coins, worth $83.3 million, to Binance. On-chain watchers suggested the funds could rotate into Ethereum, echoing earlier transactions where whales sold Bitcoin to buy Ether.\nOne such trade this month saw 670 BTC, worth $76 million, converted into 68,130 ETH valued at $295 million. Another long-dormant address withdrew 6,334 ETH, worth $28 million, from Kraken after years of inactivity.\nBitcoin Consolidates as Binance Futures Volume Hits $2.6 Trillion\nBitcoin (BTC) is trading at $110,778, down 0.7% in the past 24 hours and 1.9% over the week. The asset remains 10.5% below its $124,500 all-time high.\nNotably, over the weekend, BTC dropped to $107,400, its lowest level in seven weeks, before rebounding to $112,000.\nGlassnode data shows the correction cooled the “euphoric phase” that began in mid-August, when 100% of Bitcoin’s supply was in profit.\nSustaining such conditions typically requires strong inflows, which faded by late August. Currently, 90% of supply remains in profit, within the $104,100–$114,300 cost basis range.\nGlassnode noted that a break below $104,100 could trigger another post-ATH drawdown, while a recovery above $114,300 would indicate renewed demand.\nShort-term holders saw profits collapse from above 90% to just 42% during the decline. While the rebound restored profitability to over 60% of their supply, analysts warned that the recovery is fragile.\nGlassnode said only a move above $114,000–$116,000, where 75% of short-term holders would be in profit, could restore confidence for a fresh rally.\nResistance remains heavy in the $111,700–$115,500 zone, which aligns with the 50-day and 100-day simple moving averages.\n“BTC has been consolidating below its previous local range and has failed to retake it,” trader Daan Crypto Trades noted on X, adding that the $107,000 monthly low may not hold if selling pressure intensifies.\nSource: Daan Crypto Trades\nMeanwhile, Binance futures trading surged to a record $2.62 trillion in August, up from $2.55 trillion in July, according to CryptoQuant. The spike reflects heightened volatility, increased hedge fund and institutional participation, and rising open interest.\nAnalysts cautioned that while strong derivatives activity indicates liquidity, futures-driven momentum without stable spot inflows often precedes sharp corrections.\nFor now, Bitcoin remains range-bound, with bulls needing to reclaim $114,000 to confirm a stronger recovery.\n- New ChatGPT AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Avalanche and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana and Pepe by the End of 2025\n- Perplexity AI Predicts the Price of XRP, World Liberty Financial and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Why Is Crypto Down Today? – September 4, 2025\n- XRP Price Prediction: Gaming Giant Expands to XRP Ledger – Shocking Move to $10 Starting Now\n- New ChatGPT AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Avalanche and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana and Pepe by the End of 2025\n- Perplexity AI Predicts the Price of XRP, World Liberty Financial and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Why Is Crypto Down Today? – September 4, 2025\n- XRP Price Prediction: Gaming Giant Expands to XRP Ledger – Shocking Move to $10 Starting Now", "content_hash": "aecc8ce34dfcf2eac1eaa48e377df0bd", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

And we’ve seen behavioral change on items that have gone up in cost because of tariffs, where they’re switching from one item to the other. Some of the behavioral stuff that you always see during times of pressure.\n“But generally speaking, people have held up really well and we expect the same thing to happen for the balance of the year,” he said. “Big picture, customers want low prices, a really broad assortment, a great experience buying it and they want to do business with somebody they trust. And e-commerce changed the game, obviously, as it relates to retail. The assortment that you can get is incredible. And the delivery, accuracy, and speed, we’re all learning how to improve as it relates to that.”\nWalmart isn’t alone in trying to fine-tune after refocusing its business — it’s kind of a mini-trend right now.\nLevi Strauss & Co. has really been pushing its evolution into a much more retail-oriented business and has gotten a lot of spotlight over the last year with its Beyoncé Knowles-Carter ads.\nNow the brand has to follow up on the Queen Bey.\nHarmit Singh, chief financial and growth officer at Levi’s, said the denim giant plans to sustain the marketing momentum.\n“This year was about music,” Singh said. “Next year, we’ve got the Super Bowl at the Levi’s Stadium, we’ve got the World Cup at the Levi’s Stadium. There are definitely a couple of things that we feel over time will continue to maintain the sustained growth that we’re seeing, we’d like to be a mid-digit-growth company, which is about 5 percent.”\nLike many other brands, Levi’s is more cautious going into the second half, but feeling good about what it can control.\n“We’re very confident about our product offers and our marketing,” Singh said. “There are probably going to be winners and losers as the macroeconomics play out, I think we’ll be in the winners category because we have the product, we have the people, we have the stores and we have great marketing.”\nThat’s a playbook a lot of the big companies are working from.\nStefan Larsson, CEO at PVH Corp., has been rebuilding the approach at the company’s two mega brands: Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger.\n“We lean into the iconic brand love,” Larsson told analysts. “We lean into the biggest and most iconic categories. We put a lot of innovation into the most important products. We amplify it with cut-through campaigns. In Calvin in the second quarter, you saw where we have put innovation into underwear, we’re up 14 percent. Where we have put innovation into new denim, we’re up 19 percent.”\nIt hasn’t always been an easy transition, especially as Calvin Klein looked to centralize its design in New York.\n“Calvin Klein two, three years ago had a completely decentralized product creation,” the CEO said. “So we pulled it together and built global product creation capabilities, same as we already have for Tommy. And we were overconfident — took too many parts of this together in one season. And the team realized that they were on their heels in the middle of a product season, and it had a big negative impact on the gross margin this year. It’s super frustrating.”\nBut he said the company rolled up its sleeves and is now much better set for the long term.\n“There is not a single successful competitor that doesn’t have a global product capability,” Larsson said. “We had to do it, and we hit some turbulence and then we fixed it. But that’s why I wanted to just shout out to say, it was painful to share last quarter. It’s less painful today because we have fixed it.”", "content_hash": "6ff9fb4bc4846e636ce3d09bff986f56", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Much of today’s crypto stack either explicitly or implicitly caters to trading (a highly valuable use case in its own right) but is comparatively underoptimized for payments,” wrote Matt Huang, Paradigm’s founder and the lead at Tempo.\nIn addition to low fees and its payments-centric experience, the network expects to enable more than 100,000 transactions per second (TPS) with privacy features that will allow users to keep some transaction details hidden. It will also make use of an automated market maker (AMM) that allows transaction fees to be paid via any stablecoin.\nThrilled to team up with @Tempo as a design partner to see what’s possible with a payments-first blockchain. The pace of crypto innovation is incredible at this time, and we’re ready to learn and build alongside them. https://t.co/1LmfXeDZxI\n— Andy Fang (@andyfang) September 4, 2025\n“Tempo eases the path to bringing real-world flows on-chain,” Huang posted on X, highlighting Tempo’s potential for onboarding global payrolls, remittances, microtransactions, and agentic payments to blockchain.\nThe network is currently in private testnet, as the team experiments with use cases like e-commerce and cross-boarder payments with its global partners, according to its website.\nSome of its design partners are also acting as validators for the network, but Tempo will eventually transition to an open, permissionless network. In other words, anyone will be able to participate in network validation in the future.\n“At Stripe, we care about high-throughput, low-latency payments use cases,” wrote Stripe CEO Patrick Collison. “As the use of stablecoins (and crypto more broadly) grows across Stripe, Bridge, and Privy, we found that existing blockchains are not optimized for them.”\nStripe’s incubation of Tempo will rival layer-1 network plans from Google and Circle, as crypto becomes increasingly intertwined with traditional finance.\nThe payments giant acquired crypto wallet infrastructure firm Privy in June, less than one year after spending $1.1 billion to snatch up stablecoin payment platform, Bridge.\nTempo wasn't the only stablecoin network announcement on Thursday, either. Crypto infrastructure firm Fireblocks also launched its Fireblocks Network, which is supported by USDC issuer Circle and more than 40 other providers.", "content_hash": "4c05ef950b41dfb58c5222b7ef584f77", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Sign up to receive future editions.\nOverview: Every step to take-off counts\nIf launching a rocket's a prime feast, opening the doors to the vehicle's launch pad is a healthy appetizer.\nLast week, Rocket Lab introduced Launch Complex 3 — the intended take-off pad of its Neutron rocket — located within the Virginia Spaceport Authority's Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport. Neutron itself will arrive a little later to this party, with a first flight targeted this year – but the premiere of the launch site marks a major step for Rocket Lab specifically and for a space industry that's overall hungry for further launch vehicles.\nThe company already produces the small-lift Electron launch vehicle, which was performing its first commercial flights by late 2018. The 141-foot-tall Neutron is an upgrade in scale: a medium-lift reusable rocket that burns liquid methane and oxygen designed to carry payloads up to 13,000 kilograms to low Earth orbit (LEO) and 1,500 kilograms for trips to Mars or Venus.\nThe market scale for global carrier rockets — which are designed to launch a payload on a particular route or orbit — is seen set to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9% between this year and 2034. Forgive the pun, but launch demand's only risen meteorically, with payloads ranging from space exploration and research equipment to humans and defense and telecommunication satellites for fast-evolving networks.\nFor years, the industry bemoaned the limited scale of take-off capacity, with European Space Agency's Director Josef Aschbacher last year acknowledging a \"launcher crisis\" in Europe that the agency sought to resolve with the launch of the Ariane-6.\nMuch of that world's launch capacity is in the hands of Elon Musk's SpaceX, whose take-off cadence last year exceeded that of both commercial competitors and national programs. In 2024, the company saw through more than 130 flights of its workhorse medium-lift Falcon 9, which reuses its first-stage booster and payload fairings. That's just over half of the 259 orbital launches undertaken over the period globally — and could increase to more than 180 Falcon 9 launches this year, according to Musk's estimate of December. An August launch even carried Kuiper satellites for Amazon, whose owner Jeff Bezos' rival Blue Origin unleashed the New Glenn on its maiden orbital voyage in January.\nIt's not taking away from SpaceX's success story to acknowledge the drawbacks of overreliance on a single provider. Toward the middle of the year, U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to cancel government Musk's government contracts in the midst of an explosive public row led the tech billionaire to fleetingly float the possibility of decommissioning SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft — potentially stranding U.S. crew without a ride to and from the International Space Station at the time. The waters have calmed since, and SpaceX and NASA are continuing their partnership, but the incident's driven home the critical downsides of market dominance.\nWe've been over this: getting a brand new rocket model off the ground's no feat for the feeble. Moscow's still planning to push through the all-Russian Soyuz-5 by the end of the year, and Relativity Space's reusable Terran R and Firefly Aerospace's Eclipse are both currently penciled in for liftoff in 2026. Last month, our collective breaths were held as we watched intently whether the second-iteration Starship variant would prevail in the rocket's 10th test flight, or face another fiery setback. (Elon Musk's giant won the day.)\nBut, when the global satellite market is projected to expand seven-fold by 2035, it's hard not to see why all eyes are glued when space companies reveal their latest and greatest in brand new rockets — or their launch pads.\nWhat's up\n- Canada prepares its first lunar rover — Canadensys Aerospace is developing the first Canada-built rover to investigate the Moon — a \"logical first step\" for future space exploration ambitions, according to the company's CEO. — BBC\n- Senate hears NASA doubts over return to Moon timeline — A former NASA administrator told senators it was unlikely that the space agency would be able to put men back on the Moon ahead of Beijing, which has embarked on similar efforts. — Space News\n- ESA spacecraft undertakes Venus flyby — The European Space Agency's JUICE spacecraft has completed a Venus flyby en route to explore Jupiter's icy moons and gather data about the planet's Ganymede, Callisto and Europa moons. — Space.com\nIndustry maneuvers\n- Trump says Space Command HQ to move to Alabama — U.S. President Donald Trump said the U.S. Space Command's headquarters will move to Alabama from Colorado, citing the latter state's mail-in voting system. — NBC News\n- White House axes labor unions at NASA — Washington has moved to eliminate collective bargaining rights for several government institutions, including NASA, citing national security. — White House executive order\nMarket movers\n- Rocket Lab reveals new pad ahead of first Neutron rocket launch — Rocket Lab unveiled its new Launch Complex 3 pad at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport in Wallops Island, which will be used to test and launch the reusable Neutron rocket that could debut as soon as the end of the year. — Defense News\n- Andoya Space, Rheinmetall to bolster efforts to boost satellite launch — Andoya Space and Rheinmetall have agreed to strengthen their combined efforts to bolster satellite launch and space capabilities. — Defence Industry Europe\n- NordSpace's Taiga launch delayed by tech, weather issues — Ontario-based tech startup NordSpace has postponed the launch of its Taiga rocket — intended as the first ever commercial rocket take-off from Canadian soil — after a safety system fault and weather disruptions.

During the visit, Altman said India was OpenAI's second-largest market by number of users.\nHe has subsequently said that AI adoption in India is \"amazing to watch.\"\n\"We love to see the explosion of creativity--india is outpacing the world,\" he said on X earlier this year.\nIndia is one of ChatGPT's fastest-growing markets globally, Nick Patience, practice lead for AI at tech research and analysis firm Futurum Group, told CNBC. \"OpenAI's India focus is a strategic move to gain a competitive edge,\" he added.\nHere's a rundown of how OpenAI is expanding in India.\nChatGPT explosion\nChatGPT, OpenAI's core product, has seen strong growth in India. The app was downloaded 10.2 million times in India in August, a huge jump from the 2.5 million downloads seen during the same month last year, according to analytics firm Appfigures.\nSince its launch, ChatGPT has 111 million downloads in India, ahead of its 80 million downloads in the U.S, Appfigures data shows.\nDownloads do not necessarily equal daily or monthly users, but the figures emphasise OpenAI's growth trajectory in the country.\nThe download numbers are also far ahead of rivals, including Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude. The closest challenger was Perplexity, Appfigures said, which had 6.4 million downloads in August.\nIndia-specific product\nUser spending on ChatGPT has been increasing. To date, Indian users have spent $21.3 million on ChatGPT, Appfigures data shows. In comparison, U.S. users have spent $784 million.\nThat underlines the fact that while the number of users in India is huge, it remains a price-sensitive market.\nTo address this, OpenAI in August launched ChatGPT Go, a low-cost 399-rupees-($4.53)-a-month plan for its AI app.\n\"It's a classic wedge strategy to capture a price-sensitive market and build a user base that will be difficult for local players to dislodge later,\" Futurum Group's Patience said of the strategy.\nInfrastructure and hiring\nAccording to Bloomberg, OpenAI is scouting a location in India for a data center with at least 1-gigawatt capacity. The facility will be part of OpenAI's Stargate-branded infrastructure push, Bloomberg said this week, although CNBC was unable to verify the report.\nThe ChatGPT developer said last month that it would open a local office in the market and is currently advertising three sales roles in India.\nIt also announced last month an education program in India that will include funding for research and provide half a million ChatGPT licenses for educators and students across the country.\nIndia challenges\nWhile India doesn't have a home-grown artificial intelligence company as big as OpenAI, there are some challengers in the form of domestic startups, including Sarvam AI and Krutrim, and other American tech giants like Google and Meta.\nContinued geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and India over trade, however, have the potential to cause complications if there's any backlash from New Delhi against American tech firms.\nOpenAI is also locked in a legal battle with Asian News International in India, which has accused the ChatGPT developer of using copyrighted material illegally. It's a closely-watched case in the country for how copyright laws apply in the AI era.\n\"OpenAI's success in India is not guaranteed and depends heavily on its ability to navigate these legal and political hurdles,\" Futurum Group's Patience said.\n\"While the Indian market is vast, its diversity in languages and user needs presents challenges. OpenAI's ability to deliver a truly localized product and its long-term impact on India's AI talent remain uncertain.\"", "content_hash": "2cc597ecf6d6154ddb53c663447feaee", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Today it's two euros, tomorrow it's going to be four euros. You're not going to give up on your coffee.\"\nItaly has become a top relocation destination for the wealthy in Europe this year, according to Henley & Partners, which markets citizenship and residency-by-investment schemes.\nThough the millionaire migration figures have raised some questions, and global wealth flows are notoriously difficult to track, a number of high-profile figures have made the move to Italy over recent months. These include Egypt's richest man and co-owner of Aston Villa Football Club Nassef Sawiris, and the vice-chair of Goldman Sachs, Richard Gnodde.\nThe total number of new high-net-worth arrivals in Italy so far this year could be as high as 3,600, according to Henley & Partners estimates.\nMilan's millionaire boom\nItaly's flat-tax regime was introduced in 2017 as part of a wider push by the then center-left government to attract foreign investors while encouraging homegrown talent to return to the country following the euro zone debt crisis.\nThat, in turn, has sparked a new wave of businesses looking to cater to the fresh wealth influx, particularly in the country's financial and fashion hub, Milan. Among those are newly opened members club The Wilde and, prior to that, Casa Cipriani.\n\"We really thought it was a good time to come back to Italy,\" Anna Cipriani, director of membership at Casa Cipriani Milano, told CNBC of the group's 2022 opening.\n\"Milan has evolved a lot over the years,\" she said. \"Before, it used to be known more for its industrial character and, of course, the fashion houses, while over the last few years it became more and more attractive also for creatives, for investors and for [an] international crowd.\"\nItaly's wealthy arrivals, meanwhile, have led to a surge in real estate prices across some of the country's most desirable locations, from Tuscany and the Italian Riviera to cities such as Rome, Venice and Florence. Milan, and the surrounding lakes region, however, have emerged as a firm favorite.\n\"We are at all-time high prices at the moment,\" said Pella, who is based in BHHS' Lake Como office.\n\"In five years, we had an increase [of] double-digit percentages. For the upcoming years, we're probably going to look at a steady 3% to 4% type of increase here in Lake Como.\"\nProperty prices in Milan have risen 49% since the country's flat-tax regime was introduced in 2017, compared to 10.9% across the rest of Italy's big cities, according to real estate group Tecnocasa. Global property consultancy Knight Frank now expects the city's prime real estate market to record a further 3.5% price growth in 2025.\n\"It's about those who can afford it, because prices are not necessarily down to their street market logic as an investment,\" Pella said.\n\"They like a property with their guts. Then they do a little bit of math, of course, but they're ready to spend and sometimes to overspend just to secure a one-of-a-kind view or a one-of-a-kind position.\"\nUHNW migration\nMillionaires have been migrating in droves to new residences, as more and more jurisdictions offer options to those willing to pay.\nOver the past decade, the number of high-net-worth individuals relocating abroad is estimated to have almost tripled, reaching record highs in 2024.\nThat trend looks set to continue in 2025 and 2026, as a divide deepens between countries seeking to attract the uber-rich and those clamping down in a bid to combat perceived inequality.\nFrance has deliberated expanding its wealth tax, while Switzerland is weighing new changes to inheritance tax.\nMeanwhile, the U.K. in April abolished its over 200-year-old non-dom tax regime, which exempted wealthy foreigners living in Britain from paying U.K. tax on their overseas income and gains. It follows an outflow of London-based banks and financiers to other European capitals, such as Milan, following the 2016 Brexit vote.\nThat has left other countries looking to fill the gap.\n\"There are countries literally around the world coming to us and saying: 'We want the U.K.'s millionaires and billionaires. What can we do? How can we bring them to our country?'\" Stuart Wakeling, managing partner at Henley & Partners U.K., said.\nWhile such citizenship and residence regimes vary vastly, and can include stringent investment requirements, part of the appeal of Italy's system is its simplicity. The one-off payment offers foreign individuals, or nationals who have lived overseas for at least nine years, exemption from wider taxes on income and assets for up to 15 years.\nWorsening wealth divides\nItaly's new surge of arrivals has nevertheless raised questions about the impact on the wider economy.\nSome have warned of worsening wealth inequalities, with the overall tax take from the regime minimal compared to the country's overall deficit, and much of the newly generated wealth concentrated in specific areas.\nMeanwhile, critics suggest that attempts to emulate the scheme elsewhere could lead to a race to the bottom and an erosion of the tax base.\nStill, businesses say they are hopeful that the increased activity and new job creation in industries from finance and private equity to hospitality and services will ultimately reap benefits across Milan and the wider country.\n\"It's kind of a wheel, you know, that keeps rolling. You have all these people moving in and you have all these hotels opening and you have more and more people that then decide to come to town because now that they think about it more,\" Cipriani, from private members club Casa Cipriani Milano, said.\n\"When you have a lot of investments into a city, the economy creates more job opportunities also for the people.\"\n— CNBC's Gaelle Legrand contributed to this report.", "content_hash": "af32b3f2ce1db46d9d995c471a578dad", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently commented that, while he has worked seven days a week since the pandemic, \"the zoomers don't show up\" — referring to Gen Z professionals.\nBritish businessman Lord Alan Sugar, 78, said young people \"just want to sit at home,\" and that they need to get back to the office.\nDespite this, young workers say they're keen on more in-person interactions and are coming to the office an average of three days a week, more than all other age groups, according to a recent global study of 12,000 employees by real estate firm JLL.\nAs older professionals shirk the office, young people are finding they're often either alone when coming into work premises, or surrounded by peers of a similar age.\nThis has given rise to a series of new workplace trends from the viral \"Gen Z stare\", to the \"office siren\" aesthetic and even TikTok slang like \"ick\" becoming normalized in professional lingo.\n\"We're blurring the boundaries between just being a colleague to also being friends, and it just makes it more comfortable for us as well to work with people.\"Weirong LiCommunications Professional\n\"Gen Z is reshaping workplace norms by introducing new ways of working that reflect their values, digital fluency, and desire for authenticity,\" Dan Schawbel, managing partner of Workplace Intelligence, told CNBC.\nIntentional networking\nSenior professionals' prefer to work from home and this has eroded much of the water-cooler chat and mentorship culture that young workers are seeking. Gen Z are becoming more intentional to fill the gap.\nTwenty-five-year-old Weirong Li, a communications professional who graduated from NYU's Stern School of Business, said she was going into the office five days a week, while more senior colleagues would stick to a hybrid or remote schedule. Li noted that the people who do come into the office are generally of a similar age to her.\n\"With this hybrid schedule, it's based on your hierarchy, so if you are higher up...you have more of a slack to not come into the office because you're in a position where you've already proven yourself and you don't need to build a network.\"\nThis has taught Li to be thoughtful about how she approaches colleagues, including taking advantage of both virtual and in-person opportunities.\n\"Most of the connections that I've had with older colleagues, if it wasn't in the office, has built from first being online and virtual because I didn't know these people. I would reach out to people on LinkedIn or even cold email people,\" Li explained.\nShe added she takes water-cooler chats \"quite seriously\" because she views them as an opportunity to strike up a conversation and meet someone new.\nSome Gen Zers are deliberately signing up to professional networking events to try to bridge the gap and mingle in a structured environment, as CNBC previously reported.\nTwenty-five-year-old Vivek Haria, a senior tax advisor at a financial services firm, told CNBC Make It at the time that he's attended 10 events for young professionals organized by London's business district Canary Wharf because it felt lonely in the office, as older workers were not showing up.\nBringing your whole personality to work\nGen Z workers aren't shy about bringing their personalities to work and blurring the boundaries between personal and professional, including dressing more casually and being unfiltered in meetings and conversations.\nTwenty-seven-year-old PR manager Mady Lanni, prioritizes dressing comfortably and brings \"her whole self to work,\" she said. \"'I'm not coming into work with dress pants and heels on. I wear sneakers or my Birkenstocks every day.\"\nGen Z workers are often more casual and comfortable in how they show up at work — sometimes literally.\n\"It'll always be the Gen Zers that sit on the floor instead of sitting like in a chair at a desk,\" Lanni said, referring to team meetings. \"We find the bean bags, or we find the more unique seating situations.\"\nLi believes showing up to work with an authentic personality is a unique trait of Gen Z culture, regardless of whether it aligns with corporate norms.\n\"It's a part of our kind of Gen Z norm, which is showing who we are, what we stand for, our mission, our purpose... value-based actions and conversations do matter for us,\" she said. \"We're more open, and we realize that's also a superpower, that's how people remember us.\"\nMental health check-ins\nWhere mental health was formerly a hush-hush conversation in the workplace, Gen Z workers like prioritizing wellbeing.\nRoughly 51% of young people view mental and physical health as a primary metric of future success, more than other factors like wealth, occupation and family relationships, according to a recent global EY study of over 10,000 respondents aged between 18 and 34 years.\nCommunications professional Li noted that, after the pandemic, \"psychological safety has been very important\" for young people, so essentially being able to bring their emotional side to work.\nShe said that her friends and colleagues often check in with each other during lunch breaks. \"We really value having conversations about how we are doing mentally or physically so that we acknowledge the person in a work context and environment.\"\nInstead of making the typical office small talk, young workers like Li try to take the conversation deeper.\n\"We're blurring the boundaries between just being a colleague to also being friends, and it just makes it more comfortable for us as well to work with people,\" Li said. \"We feel like we have shared values and can relate. It makes communications easier. We don't really want to always be communicating so formally, 24/7.\"\nLanni said she also reached out to colleagues who seem overwhelmed or stressed, adding that Gen Z is more open about discussing mental well-being in the workplace.\nLanni, who works at the office three days a week, added that younger generations are \"pushing for the need of including mental health services and benefits... taking a mental health day is becoming more and more accepted.\"\nEmbracing AI\nGen Z are leaning into generative AI at a faster pace than other workers and are using the tech to get ahead at work.\nTwenty-five-year-old Gracie Lissick, a PR manager, said that younger generations can help normalize the use of AI amongst their teams.\n\"We really have this awesome kind of Michael Jordan moment to help our teams implement AI,\" she said. \"We can be that resource as much as we can.\"\nAround 57% of Gen Zs are already using AI in their daily work for a variety of tasks, whether it's content creation, data analysis, project management, or something else, and most view it positively, per Deloitte.\nLissick said that adopting AI is an advantage because it shows your ability to be tech agile and forward-thinking to managers.\nLi said young people like herself are using AI to save time and improve their work.\n\"The goal is to have more time to do other stuff later on and so I think that we're a quite focused generation contrary to what other people think. We're also always experimenting with new tools, especially in the AI world, that can help us be more efficient at our work,\" she said.\nWorkplace Intelligence's Schawbel added: \"Many Gen Z workers are using AI to bridge gaps in knowledge, confidence, and professional support, treating it almost like a digital coach or co-pilot. While it can't fully replace human mentorship, for Gen Z, AI is emerging as a reliable stand-in — available 24/7, judgment-free, and often more responsive than a busy boss.\"", "content_hash": "04fedf449910b3ba6db790d6d315dbe7", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The agreement reached in July had included Japan purchasing 100 Boeing planes, 75% higher imports of U.S. rice and $8 billion worth of agricultural and crop products.\nWashington will apply a baseline 15% tariff on nearly all Japanese imports, with separate sector-specific levies for automobiles and parts (also 15%), aerospace products, generic pharmaceutical goods and natural resources, according to the executive order.\nThe Thursday order prevents Trump's country-specific tariffs on top of existing levies. The lower tariffs will apply retroactively to Japanese goods \"entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 7, 2025,\" the order stated. The tariff relief on automobiles is set to take effect after seven days.\nTrump's global tariff campaign has thrown the global supply chain into disarray, in particular Japan's massive auto sector. Last month, Toyota warned that it expected a hit of nearly $10 billion as Trump's tariffs on autos weighed on its sales to the U.S., forcing it to slash by 16% its forecast for full-year operating profits.\nTariffs are expected to hit rivals as well, with Ford's pre-tax adjusted profit reportedly set to drop $3 billion while GM projects $4 billion to $5 billion hit for the year.\nJapan's top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, who was in Washington, delivered a letter from Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba inviting Trump to visit his country, Kyoto News reported. The Japanese official had reportedly canceled his trip to the U.S. last month as some sticking points required \"further technical discussion.\"\nPolitical tides\nThe finalizing of the deal came as political pressure for the Japanese leader mounts at home. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party earlier this week released a long-awaited report on why it lost seats in the upper house election in July.\nThe report ascribed the loss to the lack of appeal for the party's measures aimed at taming inflation, previous political scandals and weak mobilization of young voters.\nLocal media reports suggested many key members of the LDP have signaled their intention to resign to the prime minister, while Ishiba has said he intends to stay on amid calls within his party for choosing another leader.\nThough the reports have avoided naming individuals, they signal an \"implicit indictment of Ishiba's leadership of the party,\" said James Brady, vice president at political consultancy Teneo.\nAnalysts at Eurasia Group suggested in a report Friday that Ishiba is unlikely to survive a challenge from within the party next Monday, when a vote on whether to bring forward a leadership election is expected to take place.\n\"Ishiba's poor performance as party leader in lower and upper house elections and events in recent days, including former prime minister Aso Taro announcing his support for the special election, have turned the tide against Ishiba,\" analysts said, predicting a 60% odd of Ishiba's defeat in the election, with him possibly resigning before the vote takes place as internal discontent grows.", "content_hash": "f6d82ea4737a68384b0cbe9cbf00590e", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

So, when he discovered an investment vehicle called a search fund while studying for his MBA, he went all in.\nAs millions of baby boomers prepare to retire, a quiet crisis — and an unexpected business opportunity — is unfolding across the economy. Today, over half of all U.S. small businesses are owned by people aged 55 and over, yet most lack a succession plan, according to Gallup.\nThese businesses are often unglamorous, but essential to keep society running: plumbers, equipment rental companies and pest control.\n\"They're the types of companies that if they drop what they do, it would really hurt,\" said Jon Staenberg, founder & CEO of Agate Hound Fund.\nEnter the next generation of entrepreneurs — millennials and Gen Zers — who are seizing this moment not by launching startups, but by buying companies through search funds. In doing so, they're revitalizing Main Street businesses and solving a looming succession crisis, all while building wealth in a turbulent economy.\nWhat is a search fund?\nFirst conceived in 1984, search funds — also known as \"entrepreneurship through acquisition\" — let individuals — or \"searchers\" — raise money from a small group of investors to buy and operate a small or medium-sized private company.\nA 2024 study by the Stanford Graduate School of Business describes the process in four steps:\n- Stage one: Raise initial capital (about 2 to 6 months)\n- Stage two: Search for and acquire company (about 12 to 24 months)\n- Stage three: Operation and value creation (about 4 to 7+ years)\n- Stage four: Exit (about 6 months)\nThe goal is to grow these businesses and exit with a profit — often to a private equity firm.\nIt's a compelling model: lower risk than starting from scratch, since the business already has customers, revenue, and a product-market fit.\nAcquisition targets are typically businesses with recurring revenue, low overhead, minimal regulatory risk, and stable customer bases.\n\"These are businesses that are, frankly, hard to break,\" said Jackson, who is now a search fund investor. \"It's very forgiving for the first-time CEO.\"\nBesides \"core\" search funds, other variants include self-funded, single-investor models, while others prioritize a larger pool of capital committed at launch, or a longer holding period of between 10 and 20 years.\nIn 2023, a record 94 core search funds were launched across the U.S. and Canada, while international interest also set new milestones, with 59 new core funds outside North America, according to studies conducted by Stanford and IESE Business School.\n'Safe port in a storm'\nSearch funds have grown popular as traditional career paths feel less secure, with layoffs, automation and artificial intelligence reshaping industries.\n\"There is a big displacement of young professionals who are in the middle of their career,\" said Aik Chuan Goh, managing partner of Singapore-based search fund Garlic Equity Capital. Many of these \"ambitious young professionals no longer see corporate life as their future,\" he added.\nOn the other hand, many business owners are looking to retire. \"When you put one and one together, you have a great match,\" said Goh.\nWe live in such a tumultuous time with change happening so fast, this feels like a very safe port in a storm.Jon StaenbergFounder and CEO, Agate Hound Fund\nInvestors are taking notice too. Amid downturns in the venture capital and private equity markets, search funds have emerged as an alternative asset class.\n\"Venture [capital] is so crowded now. Search funds still remain small, while the opportunity set is so big — it's the only thing I want to do for the rest of my career. You look at the returns, they've been phenomenal. They've been outsized,\" said Staenberg.\nStanford's 2024 study of 681 search funds formed in the U.S. and Canada since 1984 found that their internal rate of return was 35.1%, with a 4.5 times return on investment.\n\"Over the last 40 years, the stock market has been somewhere [around] 8.5% annual returns ... Then you go to private equity or venture over that same 40-year period ... and the returns are somewhere around 13% to 14%. So [when] you start looking at the outsized returns of 35% for search, it's a bit of a head scratcher,\" said Staenberg.\n\"We live in such a tumultuous time with change happening so fast, this feels like a very safe port in a storm.\"\nCheckbook, phonebook, playbook\nMeanwhile, search funds have also offered a risk-adjusted way for aspiring business owners to pursue their CEO dreams, such as Jackson, who, together with his friend Olaide Lawal, started their search fund in 2015.\nAbout 18 months later, the duo raised more than $5 million and acquired three dental practices from a dentist who was in his 50s. Over the next six years, Jackson ran Unified Dental Care as CEO and grew the company to seven locations before selling the business to a strategic buyer in 2023.\nBut Jackson did not come from wealth. Growing up in Champaign, Illinois, he didn't see many business success stories around him.\n\"It was normal for me to literally see in front of my door, gang fights [break] out ... and so I did not have as much access to seeing entrepreneurs,\" said Jackson.\n\"I saw the barber shop that was down the street, or I saw the person that owned the barbecue shop ... [and] people that were making an honest living, but barely livable wages,\" said Jackson.\nSo it was a risk adjusted path for me as a minority entrepreneur that didn't come with a lot of resources to have ... a successful exit.Jason JacksonFormer CEO, Unified Dental Care\n\"For me, the idea [of a search fund] was fantastic, because ... I didn't have the startup idea, so it was an opportunity for me to buy an existing business,\" he said.\nWhat makes search funds unique, he said, is that his investors also become his mentors.\n\"What separates search fund investors is that they provide, principally, three things to the entrepreneur. The first thing that they provide is [a] checkbook... This is something that I didn't have access to,\" said Jackson.\n\"Second thing that they provide access to is a phone book, meaning call me or call my network anytime ... and the third thing that they provide [is a] playbook, meaning, here's how you execute once you buy this business,\" Jackson added.\n\"So it was a risk-adjusted path for me as a minority entrepreneur that didn't come with a lot of resources to have ... a successful exit,\" said Jackson.\nThe new American dream?\nBut running a search fund isn't all smooth sailing. In fact, Jackson uncovered fraud two weeks into running the business: the seller had inflated revenue by millions.\n\"We thought we were buying a $7 million revenue company and $1.5 million in EBITDA,\" said Jackson. \"What we discovered was that the business was really doing $5 million in revenue and losing $500,000 a year after adjusting for the fraud.\"\nDespite the rocky start, Jackson turned the business around. He exited successfully, more than doubling his investment and earning seven figures altogether from his tenure as CEO and from the deal, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.\n\"We eventually were able to sell the business at a decent multiple. It's decent for the search fund industry. It's really good compared to private equity, but it's really great compared to where my partner and I came from. He came from Lagos, Nigeria. I came from an under-resourced community,\" said Jackson.\nToday, Jackson runs the Black Search Network, which he co-founded in 2020. He spends his time investing in and passing on the knowledge he's gained through his own journey to other aspiring entrepreneurs and searchers.\nIt also allows people who are gritty, who are hungry, who are willing to be coached, to pursue what we used to call the American dream — to build a business into even more success and have an exit and then come back and help others do the same thing.Jon StaenbergFounder and CEO, Agate Hound Fund\nSearch funds are not a silver bullet. Besides dealing with rejection, searchers have to find a good business to buy, convincing the owner to entrust you with their life's work, and of course, learning how to run a business for the first time.\nBut for a generation looking for stability and purpose, they may offer something rare in today's economy: a practical, profitable, and supported route to owning a business.\n\"It truly is the life cycle of entrepreneurship,\" said Staenberg. \"It also allows people who are gritty, who are hungry, who are willing to be coached, to pursue what we used to call the American dream — to build a business into even more success and have an exit and then come back and help others do the same thing.\"\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

The 35-page report includes data on tickets sold, net ticket receipts, the visiting team's share of gate receipts and club seat premiums, gross general admission ticket prices, and the premium paid for club seats for the preseason and regular season for all 32 teams. The ticketing data in this CNBC report was sourced from that document.\nThe NFL requires every team to give 34% of ticket revenue and the licensing amount of a club seat to the league based on an internal formula, according to several NFL executives who asked to remain unnamed so they could speak freely about private conversations. This pool, known as the visiting team's share, or VTS, is mostly redistributed equally among the 32 teams. In 2024, each team received $27 million, up from $25 million the previous year, according to the league executives.\nStory continues after interactive chart.\nThe VTS money not redistributed is used by the NFL to fund league-level lending programs that go toward the private financing of new stadiums and renovations. Some teams are granted waivers by the NFL on a portion of their VTS contribution if they are using stadium revenue to finance construction or renovations. The Las Vegas Raiders and Los Angeles Rams, for example, received waivers of $23.4 million and $12.2 million, respectively, for their new stadiums, according to the NFL executives.\nThe league's 32 teams collected an average of $433 million in national revenue in 2024 from media, licensing and sponsorship agreements, said the executives. National revenue made up about two-thirds of overall league revenue. Local revenue — including tickets, suites, stadium sponsorships, concessions, parking and non-NFL stadium events — accounted for the remainder.\nThe San Francisco 49ers led the league in net ticket receipts — the amount the team keeps after taxes, fees and surcharges — with $176.5 million in 2024. That's $40.8 million more than the No. 2 Dallas Cowboys and $67.5 million above the league average. The Tennessee Titans ranked last, at $81.2 million in net receipts. The Indianapolis Colts were next to last, at $83.3 million, and the Arizona Cardinals came in just above the Colts, at $83.4 million.\nThe 49ers also had the highest general admission ticket price, at $190.78 last season, followed by the Philadelphia Eagles, at $184.27, and the Las Vegas Raiders, at $165.58. The New England Patriots, who have won six Super Bowls but have not made the postseason since 2021, charged the highest club seat premium at $471.92 — more than double the NFL average.\nThe NFL declined to comment in response to CNBC's questions regarding the Summary of Attendance Statistics report.", "content_hash": "89d656d2711df0ac76209e82533fbe07", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Copper alone is estimated to represent $16 billion, more than all non-mining sectors combined.\nMajor players including BHP, Glencore and Rio Tinto are among those making bold bets on Argentina's copper and lithium potential, with top executives from Glencore and Rio Tinto recently traveling to meet with Milei on a trip to Buenos Aires.\nRo Dhawan, CEO of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), a trade body representing roughly one-third of the global industry, described Argentina as \"arguably the most exciting new copper story today.\"\nThere are other countries and jurisdictions which may be more geologically rich, Dhawan said, but not one that sits at the intersection of a stable domestic political environment, and the provision of basic infrastructure and facilities and sufficient other investments complementary to the mining industry.\nAmong the most notable copper projects in Argentina is BHP and Lundin's Vicuna joint venture.\nSituated along the Chile-Argentina border, the Vicuna District is regarded as a geologically prospective region. Indeed, the deposits at Vicuna's Josemaria and Filo del Sol mines are estimated to contain 13 million metric tons of measured copper and 25 million tons of inferred copper.\nPolicy consistency and social licence will determine whether this is Argentina's mining moment or another mirage.Mariano MachadoAmericas principal analyst at Verisk Maplecroft\nFor ICMM's Dhawan, the potential significance of BHP and Lundin's Vicuna copper project is extraordinary.\n\"It's of the same importance to copper as Western Australia was to iron ore — and I don't say that lightly. It is a bold comparison to make but it is one that I do genuinely believe in,\" Dhawan said.\nA spokesperson for BHP and Lundin's Vicuna copper project said last month that the two companies intend to apply to receive benefits under RIGI, Reuters reported.\nA $47 billion opportunity\nArgentina's renewed mining focus comes as global copper demand is expected to skyrocket over the coming years, dramatically outstripping supply amid an artificial intelligence boom and a shift away from fossil fuels.\nAnalysts at consultancy CRU Group have estimated that the pipeline of Argentina's potential copper projects could represent a roughly $47 billion opportunity for the economy through to 2040.\nThis cumulative impact is comparable to the record $44-billion bailout loan Argentina received from the International Monetary Fund.\nA government spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment when contacted by CNBC.\nRead more\nAsked whether Argentina's long history of boom-and-bust economic cycles means Argentina's copper dreams could crumble once again, ICMM's Dhawan said: \"Where doesn't have that risk is the question I would ask?\"\nHe added: \"I just think that people have adjusted to a new normal expectation of quite significant volatility and that has almost worked in Argentina's favor. I think two things have happened, I think Argentina's stability has gone up and the world's stability has gone down.\"\nDhawan said it's not possible to predict which way Argentina will go, but investors appear to be prepared for different political and economic scenarios and that sovereign risk has been priced in.\nArgentina's mining moment?\nMariano Machado, principal analyst for the Americas at Verisk Maplecroft, said that while Argentina does possess the minerals needed to reshape its export base, \"policy consistency and social licence will determine whether this is Argentina's mining moment or another mirage.\"\n\"The country's policy swings have kept investment below potential levels, and the government's failure to persuade lawmakers from the opposition Union for the Homeland (UP) to vote for the RIGI means there is a risk that less private sector-friendly sectors will dispute its provisions if they make a comeback,\" Machado told CNBC by email.\n\"A new mining boom could also stoke anti-mining activism,\" he added. \"Issues around water, protection of glaciers and broader human rights underscore persistent challenges for companies to secure durable social licence to operate.\"", "content_hash": "4b52d00da89126336f2614c771ade18c", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Honeywell announced Thursday that its quantum computing company, Quantinuum, has raised another $600 million in funding at an approximately $10 billion valuation. The latest round, which doubles Quantinuum's valuation of $ 5 billion last seen in January 2024 , sets the privately held firm up for a highly anticipated initial public offering — a key step in unlocking value for Club holding Honeywell as its majority shareholder. Honeywell CFO Mike Stepniak said so himself in reaction to the fresh capital raise during an industry event on Thursday morning. \"I'm excited about commercializing this business and ultimately I think this really [gets us to an] IPO,\" Stepniak said at an industrials conferenced hosted by Jefferies. \"Our intent is to IPO this business.\" In July, Honeywell CEO Vimal Kapur said that the company is looking to bring Quantinuum public in 2027. A successful IPO would help show that Honeywell's long-term investment into Quantinuum will have been worth it. Quantinuum was formed back in 2021 following a merger of Honeywell's Quantum Solutions with Cambridge Quantum. However, it has never been a source of significant revenue or profits for the industrial conglomerate given quantum computing technology is still in the early innings and a ways off from widespread commercial use. In 2024, Honeywell reported a loss of $454 million for the segment that houses its stake in Quantinuum. Still, there's a lot of potential value to unlock for Honeywell because of the promise that many see in quantum computing, which can solve complex tasks far beyond the abilities of traditional computers due to fundamentally different architectures. Technology stalwarts including Alphabet and IBM are among those pursuing the nascent technology — in fact, it was a breakthrough quantum chip from Alphabet's Google in late 2024 that catalyzed a new wave of interest in the industry and sent stocks of publicly traded quantum firms on a major tear. Club name Nvidia has shown an increased focus on quantum , and its venture capital arm participated in Quantinuum's capital raise. Other new investors include Quant Computer, QED investors, and existing shareholders like JPMorgan Chase , Mitsui, among others. Financial services is one industry that sees a lot of potential in quantum computing, and JPMorgan even as an internal research group that focuses on the technology. Honeywell benefits from Quantinuum by more than just capitalizing on this trend, though. The market seems to have not realized Quantinuum's value to the industrial conglomerate yet either, according to Bank of America's Andrew Obin. \"What we've said is that the market doesn't seem to be assigning a particular value to their stake in Quantinuum, so risk/reward is definitely skewed to the upside,\" Obin told CNBC in an interview Thursday afternoon. Case in point: Shares of Honeywell were up only slightly on the Thursday announcement. Plus, Obin added that Quantinuum is just one of the ways \"you can win with Honeywell stock.\" The Club believes another is the company's forthcoming business spin-offs, which we have long argued will unlock more value for shareholders as Honeywell becomes a more streamlined company and its crown jewel aerospace segment gets to operate on its own. Honeywell's advanced materials business is on track to be spun off in the fourth quarter of this year, while the aerospace separation is tracking for next year.

Kennedy Jr. doubled down on false claims about vaccines and claimed he isn't limiting access to Covid shots during his Senate testimony on Thursday, as senators grilled him on his sweeping changes to immunization policy and federal health agencies.\nKennedy said he supports a statement made by a newly appointed member of a key government vaccine panel that mRNA vaccines pose a dangerous risk to people. Numerous studies have demonstrated that shots using mRNA technology, including Covid vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, are safe and effective, and serious side effects have happened in extremely rare cases.\nSen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., noted that the committee member, Dr. Retsef Levi, has said that evidence is mounting that mRNA vaccines cause \"serious harm, including death, especially among young people,\" apparently referring to a post pinned on Levi's X account. Kennedy appointed Levi to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine recommendations and insurance coverage.\nKennedy said he wasn't aware of Levi's comments, but added, \"I agree with it.\"\nHe also claimed that anyone could get a Covid booster shot, while also acknowledging that access \"depends on the state\" and that the government no longer recommends the vaccines for healthy people.\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved a fresh round of Covid shots with new limits, only clearing them for adults aged 65 and older and people with a medical condition that puts them at risk of a severe illness. The CDC and its vaccine panel will decide who to recommend the shots to later this month.\n\"I'm not taking them away from people,\" Kennedy said, referring to the vaccines.\nBut Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., argued that not everyone can walk into a pharmacy and get a Covid shot now.\nThe FDA's new limits have complicated Covid shot access in the U.S., which now depends on a patient's age and risk level, laws and policies in their state, insurance coverage, and health-care provider. Pending CDC guidance, some pharmacies have added prescription requirements for Covid vaccines in certain states.\n\"You clearly are taking away vaccines,\" she said after a prolonged shouting match with Kennedy.\nKennedy's comments before the Senate Finance Committee come after he repeatedly promised the panel in January that he would do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it more difficult or discourages people from taking vaccines. Since then, he has canceled funding for mRNA shot development and made other vaccine policy changes that could limit access to immunizations, including gutting the CDC vaccine panel and dropping Covid shot recommendations for certain groups.\nHis comments also follow a leadership shake-up at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The White House last week fired CDC Director Susan Monarez, and four senior agency officials resigned shortly after, with some of them citing the politicization of the agency and a threat to public health. In an opinion piece on Thursday, Monarez accused Kennedy of \"a deliberate effort to weaken America's public-health system and vaccine protections.\"\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X in support of Kennedy on Thursday, writing that he \"is taking flak because he's over the target\" and saying Democrats were attacking the Trump administration's \"commonsense effort.\"\nKennedy touted skepticism around Covid vaccines, despite evidence of their safety and effectiveness.\n\"We were told again and again the vaccines would prevent transmission, they prevent infection. It wasn't true. They knew it from the start,\" Kennedy said.\nHe also said he does not know how many people died of Covid and whether the vaccines prevented deaths from the virus.\n\"I would like to see the data and talk about the data,\" Kennedy said.\nBut data is readily available from dozens of studies. One paper in August estimates that Covid vaccines saved more than 2 million lives, mostly among older adults, worldwide between 2020 and October 2024.\nThe CDC website also says that Covid vaccines from the 2023 to 2024 season reduced the risk of severe illness from Covid by almost 70% in the first two months after vaccination in adults ages 18 and older, with protection gradually declining over time.\nThose shots also decreased the risk of hospitalization due to Covid by around 50% in the first two months of vaccination in that same population. The Covid vaccines showed similar benefits in older adults.\nKennedy also defended his decision to fire all 17 previous members of the CDC vaccine panel, saying he didn't politicize the committee.\n\"What we did is we got rid of the conflicts of interest. ... We depoliticized and put great scientists on it from a very diverse group,\" the HHS secretary said. \"They are very, very pro-vaccine.\"\nBut a new analysis published last month from USC researchers found that conflicts of interest on that panel had been at \"historic lows for years\" before Kennedy restacked it with new members, some of whom are widely known vaccine critics.\nCorrection: Kennedy testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday.

For those with at least two AI skills, the premium was 43% higher.\nThe study also noted three fields with the largest premium: customer and client support, sales, and manufacturing and production.\nJoshua Woo, founder of Recruit Fast, an employment agency in Singapore, made a similar observation that \"AI skills are paying above average in this market.\"\nHe added that they are no longer just nice to have, \"they're a differentiator.\"\nMore accessible\nLightcast's report identified over 300 AI skills ranging from AI ethics and generative AI to machine learning.\nThe study also found that different career areas required fundamentally different AI skills. For example, roles in transportation were likely to require autonomous driving skills, while maintenance positions prioritized robotics capabilities.\nThough many of the AI skills required high technical expertise, the most commonly-listed ones were often quite general, such as proficiency in the use of ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot.\nThese basic skills are becoming more prevalent and accessible in the job market, according to Bridget Wong, head of human relations at Accenture Singapore.\n\"While positions like decision scientist or LLM/data architect demand deep technical expertise, many operational and junior employees are also being equipped to work effectively with AI-enabled processes,\" Wong said.\nThus, \"there is no wrong stage in a career to learn AI—opportunities exist at every level, and organizations should invest in training and exposure to empower employees,\" she added.\nDemand in non-tech roles\nNotably, Lightcast's study found that demand for AI skills was higher in non-tech sectors than in IT and computer science, which are normally associated with AI.\nSince 2022, the year OpenAI launched ChatGPT, job postings mentioning generative AI skills were up 800% for non-tech roles, the study found.\nWhile IT and computer science still reigned the list of sectors demanding AI skills, marketing and public relations came in second place. This was followed by science & research, and social analysis and planning.\n\"It's not just software developers or the data scientists that are benefiting from AI skills; It's something people in everything from marketing to finance to HR should be thinking about,\" Magrini said.\n'Be prepared'\nAI skills \"are coming to every job function, to every career area, but at different paces,\" which means everybody needs a layer of AI literacy, Magrini said.\nRecruit Fast's Woo noted that AI skills are likely less relevant as prerequisites in blue-collar jobs as compared to other fields.\nStill, Magrini said that \"AI is coming, but we don't need to be scared.

It's a decision that has spurred fears of government overreach and cast doubt over federal economic data.\nTrump nominated conservative economist E.J. Antoni to be the new head of the BLS. William Wiatrowski is acting commissioner until Antoni is confirmed.\nMarket reaction\nThe stock market could come under pressure if the jobs figure is outside of the expected range from traders. Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, worries a downside surprise is coming in the jobs data, one that will ding markets. Just not quite yet.\nThe economist, who is projecting nonfarm payrolls growth of 75,000 in August, said that he expects a negative jobs number will come in the second half of the year at some point. He said it's possible that the weak number could even come Friday.\nKKM Financial investment chief Jeff Kilburg worries Friday's jobs data could come in stronger than expected, given the low expectations heading into the report, and that could boost interest rates and reduce the chances the Fed cuts as many times as expected this year. Many traders are hoping for three rate cuts between now and year's end.\nUltimately, Wall Street is hoping for greater clarity on the labor market, one that is alarming some who have noted companies are abstaining from hiring or firing workers in a troubling pattern.\n\"Is this just a case of, sort of, a 'low hires, low fires,' kind of stagnant labor market, or is there some real deterioration that's starting to unfold?\" said John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Growth Innovators ETF. \"And historically, when the labor market has started to deteriorate, it has a tendency to quickly deteriorate further.\"\nADP's private employment report, which can sometimes be a precursor to the official figures that follow, was weaker-than expected on Thursday, but within a comfortable range that didn't panic markets. It showed an addition of just 54,000 private payrolls last month. The stock market gained on Thursday following the figures.", "content_hash": "5b4ebfbdb7ab64f3570f9c035031b511", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona, introduced a bill on Thursday — titled the You Earn It, You Keep it Act — to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits. A House version of the bill was introduced by Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minnesota, in April.\nGallego's bill would permanently eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits.\nIt would also expand the Social Security payroll tax to apply to annual earnings over $250,000. Currently, the maximum earnings subject to Social Security payroll taxes is $176,100 in 2025. Consequently, high earners may only pay into the program for part of the year.\n\"Despite decades of paying into the system, seniors are still forced to pay taxes on their hard-earned benefits — all while the ultra wealthy barely pay into the system,\" Gallego said in a statement.\nHow Social Security benefits are taxed\nSocial Security recipients may owe federal income taxes on their benefits depending on their income.\nHow much they may owe is based on a formula known as combined income — the sum of adjusted gross income, tax-exempt interest income and half of Social Security benefits.\nUp to 50% of benefits may be taxed for individual tax filers with between $25,000 and $34,000 in combined income, or married couples who file jointly with between $32,000 and $44,000.\nUp to 85% of benefits may be taxable for individuals with more than $34,000 in combined income or couples with more than $44,000.\nHow the 'big beautiful' tax law helps seniors\nRepublicans' new \"big beautiful\" law includes a new senior deduction aimed at helping to defray the effects of federal taxes on Social Security benefits.\nAdults aged 65 and over may be able to claim an additional deduction of up to $6,000.\nWhether beneficiaries will benefit from the change will depend on their income.\nThe full deduction will be available to individual taxpayers with up to $75,000 in modified adjusted gross income or married couples with up to $150,000. The deduction will gradually phase out for taxpayers with incomes above those thresholds.\nThe temporary deduction — which will be in effect for tax years 2025 through 2028 — will be available to eligible taxpayers regardless of whether they take the standard deduction or itemize their returns.\nMiddle-income taxpayers stand to benefit the most from the policy, according to tax experts, since low earners may already be exempt from federal taxes on benefits and higher earners will be above the phaseout thresholds.\nHow 'You Earn It, You Keep It' may affect Social Security\nUnlike the temporary senior deduction recently signed into law, Gallego's You Earn It, You Keep It proposal would eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits for all beneficiaries.\nTo be sure, it remains to be seen whether it may get enough support to become law.\nThe proposal does have the support of The Senior Citizens League, a nonpartisan senior advocacy group that is petitioning Congress to stop taxing Social Security benefits. Eliminating federal taxes on Social Security benefits is a \"commonsense step to ensure older Americans can keep more of what they've earned,\" Senior Citizens League Executive Director Shannon Benton said in a statement.\nEfforts to change the federal taxation of Social Security benefits come as the program is facing a trust fund shortfall. Benefits may be reduced within the next decade unless Congress enacts changes sooner, according to projections from Social Security's trustees.\nBecause the \"big beautiful\" law did not include any offsets for the reduced revenue from federal taxes on benefits, it would accelerate the depletion dates, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\nIn contrast, the You Earned It, You Keep It proposal would extend the Social Security trust funds' ability to pay benefits in full and on time for 24 years, or until 2058, according to Gallego's office. That matches an analysis of Craig's House proposal by Social Security's chief actuary in April.", "content_hash": "c9191b29aba6f9e461228cb296b7877b", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

He pointed to the deals available at the Excalibur, one of MGM's resorts on the Las Vegas Strip: $85 rooms, including resort fee; $5 tables; $5 beers. But the $12 Starbucks coffee grabs the headline.\n\"There is value there, and there's always been value,\" Hornbuckle said. \"We let the narrative get away from us and shame on us. We need to do a better job.\"\nMGM and Las Vegas more broadly had posted several years of growth in visitation, room rates and profits before this year's slowdown.\nWhen asked whether the Vegas slump could be a canary in the coal mine for U.S. travel more broadly, Hornbuckle, who chairs the U.S. Travel Association, said it does seem to be a leading indicator. And the industry as a whole is facing some troubling obstacles.\nCanadian visitation to the U.S. has plummeted some 40% this year, following comments by President Donald Trump about Canada as a potential 51st U.S. state and evolving trade policies. The Canadian dollar has also weakened, lessening the buying power of visitors crossing the border into the U.S.\nHornbuckle also pointed to massive price hikes for a U.S. visa, from $100 to $350, where a family of four visiting for the Ryder Cup, World Cup or Olympics in 2028, for example, could pay $1,400 for visa documents alone.\n\"International travel in 2016 had a $50 billion U.S. surplus. Today it's a $50 billion deficit,\" Hornbuckle said.\nThe government's commitment to funding marketing and promotion of U.S. travel was also slashed by 80% in the most recent spending bill, to $20 million.\n\"We obviously find ourselves in a world that has a fair amount of uncertainty from a macroeconomic perspective, from a socio-political perspective,\" Marriott CEO Tony Capuano told investors at the BofA conference Thursday. \"Marriott, and the sector more broadly, thrives in times of certainty and stability. So that creates some measure of challenge.\"\nCapuano said there's been a slight uptick after Labor Day in some segments of travel. He said Marriott sees spending restrained in budget travelers and small businesses. But he described demand for luxury travel as \"sturdy.\"\nWyndham Hotel and Resorts CEO Geoff Ballotti laid out an optimistic view of the travel industry, noting robust demand for extended stay, driven in part by projects supporting the government's infrastructure spending.\n\"You're seeing incredible interest in investment right now,\" Ballotti told CNBC. \"Our new construction pipeline, 20 consecutive quarters of growth, is at an all-time high. We're seeing groundbreakings accelerate. We're seeing a new construction pipeline accelerate, and we're seeing it more so here domestically than we are anywhere else in the world.\"", "content_hash": "020989cb6f7ffff916b022c9ebe4af5c", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

That implies 122% upside from its current share price of $90.\nHere's what investors should know about CoreWeave.\nBulls say CoreWeave is a leading provider of cloud AI services\nCoreWeave provides cloud infrastructure and software services purpose built for artificial intelligence (AI), and its data centers exclusively use Nvidia GPUs. SemiAnalysis recently ranked CoreWeave as the best AI cloud on the market, awarding it a higher score than Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform. That praise reflects two competitive advantages.\nFirst, CoreWeave is frequently the first cloud platform to bring new chips to market because of its longstanding relationship with Nvidia. For instance, the company was the first to deploy Nvidia H100 and H200 systems, and it more recently became the first company to deploy Nvidia GB200 and GB300 systems. Early access to the latest technologies is a compelling reason to work with CoreWeave.\nSecond, CoreWeave often achieves top results at the MLPerf benchmarks, standardized tests that measure artificial intelligence systems across training and inference use cases. The company says its infrastructure and software expertise results in up to 20% higher GPU cluster performance than alternative solutions.\nCoreWeave reported tremendous demand in the second quarter. Revenue soared 207% to $1.2 billion and non-GAAP operating income increased 135% to $200 million. In addition, the company said its revenue backlog increased 86% because of expanded deals with OpenAI and an unnamed hyperscale company (possibly Google).\nBears say CoreWeave has a capital-intensive business model\nCoreWeave currently operates 33 data centers across the United States and Europe, with at least two more under construction, one in Pennsylvania and another in New Jersey. But operating data centers, especially when those data centers are filled with AI infrastructure, is very expensive.\nSo CoreWeave has taken on substantial debt. And while the company says it has done so responsibly -- never taking on debt unless a signed contract creates a need for additional infrastructure, and only if the contract covers the entire cost of the debt -- the interest payments associated with its debt are already cutting deeply into profitability.\nAs mentioned, CoreWeave said adjusted operating income increased 135% to $200 million in the second quarter. But that number excludes interest expense. When accounting for those costs, the company reported an adjusted net loss of $131 million, a much stepper loss than $5 million in the same quarter last year.\nImportantly, CoreWeave plans to unlock cost efficiencies by acquiring longtime partner Core Scientific, an infrastructure company that owns nine U.S. data centers. Management says the deal, expected to close in the fourth quarter, will eliminate more than $10 billion in future lease overhead, and result in additional annual cost savings of $500 million by the end of 2027.\nHowever, some analysts have raised questions about the terms of the all-stock deal, which stipulate Core Scientific stockholders get 0.1235 shares of CoreWeave for every share of Core Scientific. Those terms valued Core Scientific at $9 billion when the deal was announced. But CoreWeave stock has since dropped 44%.\nThe risk here is shareholder dilution. CoreWeave will probably have to renegotiate deal with a higher exchange ratio to account for the sharp decline in its own stock. In that scenario, current shareholders would be diluted even more extensively than under the original terms.\nCoreWeave trades at a reasonable valuation, but the stock is likely to be volatile\nCoreWeave shares have advanced 125% since its March IPO, but the stock has also fallen 44% from the record high it reached in July. Currently, shares trade at 10 times sales, a very reasonable multiple for a company whose revenue is forecast to increase at 127% annually through 2026.\nHowever, CoreWeave is not expected to be profitable until at least 2027, which means the stock is likely to be volatile in the interim. Only patient investors comfortable with that risk should consider buying this AI stock, and they should start with a very small position.", "content_hash": "295db2b361b543d27ec949dc3f3d5063", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The ruling, for instance, leaves intact the multibillion-dollar arrangement that makes Google the default on Apple devices -- a high-margin revenue stream that investors in the iPhone-maker have worried could be curtailed.\nThe market's read-through was simple: Alphabet's win reduces uncertainty for Apple, which reportedly receives around tens of billions of dollars annually from Alphabet to keep Google Search as the default on Safari. Those traffic-acquisition payments have long been a quiet but meaningful contributor to Apple's Services economics, so clarity on their continuation helps sentiment toward the stock.\nFor context, Alphabet shares also rose on the news, underscoring how central these agreements are across the ecosystem.\nApple investors can now pivot from \"Will the deal be killed?\" to \"What does Apple's business look like with the deal preserved?\"\nAdding to Apple's momentum\nThis news just adds to a growing bull case for Apple stock.\nThe tech company's most recent quarter -- fiscal Q3 -- was solid. Revenue rose 10% to $94 billion and earnings per share (EPS) increased 12% to $1.57 -- both June-quarter records. Capturing some of the quarter's key catalysts, Apple's services revenue reached an all-time high and iPhone posted double-digit growth.\nWith this legal overhang behind the company, investors can begin giving more weight to Apple's financial momentum in their analysis. The concern was big enough that it even came up in Apple's most recent earnings call. CEO Tim Cook explicitly conditioned Apple's forward-looking \"color\" on assumptions that \"the current revenue-share agreement with Google continues.\" That's unusually direct language for Apple, indicating the deal's materiality to near-term planning.\nInvestors don't need to model precise dollars to grasp the takeaway: the high-margin engine just avoided a forced reset. Apple's services business mix boasts higher margins than its hardware sales, so preserving the Google payments stabilizes a line item that helps EPS compounding. For the nine months ended June 28, for instance, Apple's services gross margin was 75% -- more than twice its hardware gross margin of 37%.\nWhy this week's ruling matters from here\nNear-term, the decision removes a key bear argument around Apple's services segment's durability. If you believed a ban on default payments would hit high-margin revenue and compress the multiple, that tail risk just faded. Wedbush called the outcome a \"monster win\" for Apple and a \"home run\" for Google -- language that captures why both stocks rallied, even if investors should still track any negotiated tweaks that emerge.\nOf course, with Apple stock rising sharply in recent weeks, valuation is more of a concern. Apple trades at a premium on trailing earnings -- about 36 times earnings as of this writing -- which means upside depends more on execution than multiple expansion from here. However, with the company's iPhone and services segments growing nicely, a clean balance sheet, and steady capital returns, shares still look attractive. But the market will need to see continued momentum in Apple's important services business.\nThe bigger picture for long-term holders is straightforward. This week's ruling kept a high-margin revenue source intact and aligned with what management had assumed on the third-quarter earnings call, reinforcing the base case for EPS growth. There are still risks. Appeal risk and Google's new data-sharing requirements, for instance, add some noise. But Apple now faces that future with one less black cloud and with fundamentals doing their part.", "content_hash": "af65fb1c66e752a6e82c2e347063dc39", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Each has a powerful commerce engine, a fast-growing cloud platform, and a significant opportunity in AI infrastructure and applications.\nBut when you strip away headlines and focus on the operating results and the playbook for the next few years, one option stands out as the clear winner.\nAmazon: broad-based, profitable growth\nAmazon's latest quarter showed healthy top-line growth and strong profit execution. Revenue rose double digits, with both its North America and international year-over-year growth rates in top-line revenue accelerating significantly, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) expanding at a rate of nearly 18% year over year. Operating income climbed sharply as the company continues to drive efficiency across fulfillment and cloud. It's the kind of combination long-term investors want: growth with expanding earnings power.\nFurthermore, AWS's momentum and scale are extraordinary. The cloud-computing business's annualized revenue run rate is now just over $123 billion. The business has powerful momentum in AI. For generative AI solutions, specifically, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in its second-quarter earnings call that it is growing sales by a triple-digit year-over-year percentage and has \"more demand than we have supplied for at the moment.\"\nHighlighting the benefit of Amazon's scale, the cloud computing segment's operating margin remains robust -- at 32.9% (adjusted to exclude the impact of foreign exchange headwinds) in Q2 -- even as Amazon steps up investment in data centers, networking, and accelerators to meet AI demand.\nMeanwhile, Amazon's online store segment, where the company records e-commerce sales, grew by 11% year over year in Q2 -- up from 5% growth in Q1. Similarly, the company's high-margin advertising business clearly accelerated because Amazon's other revenue segment, which primarily consists of advertising sales, grew 19% year over year in Q2 -- up from a growth rate of 4% in Q1.\nAlibaba: A cheaper valuation -- but for a reason\nAlibaba's latest quarter gave investors a clear (and bullish) data point: accelerated cloud growth and the stock ripped higher. Revenue in its cloud intelligence segment rose 26% year over year, powered by an eighth quarter in a row of triple-digit year-over-year growth in AI-related product revenue.\nThe overall picture of Alibaba's business, however, is more nuanced. Total revenue increased just 2% year over year, or 10% when excluding sales in the year-ago quarter from recently sold businesses. Further, Alibaba's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITDA) fell 14% year over year as the e-commerce and cloud-computing company leaned into what it calls \"quick commerce,\" or ultra-fast delivery, broader user experience investments, and AI. These heavy investments also meant that free cash flow went from positive in the year-ago quarter to negative.\nA clear winner\nBoth stocks could end up being long-term winners. But Amazon ultimately offers the better risk-reward.\nAlibaba is cheaper on traditional valuation multiples (but more expensive than it used to be after its recent sharp move higher) and is returning significant capital via buybacks and dividends. This lower valuation helps make up for the company's lower growth and some of the risks associated with China's weak macroeconomic backdrop. Indeed, given how cheap the stock's valuations is (it currently trades at just 15 times earnings), Alibaba could end up being a bargain in hindsight. But only if China's economy picks up speed and consumer and enterprise spending reaccelerate. If this happens, the upside in the stock price could be massive. But the company still has some things it needs to prove to investors to command a higher valuation multiple; it needs to demonstrate scalability, shown by operating margin expansion and free cash flow improvement, as Alibaba grows. We're not there yet.\nUltimately, Amazon offers the cleaner, more reliable setup. The company has three growth vectors that reinforce one another: retail, advertising, and cloud -- and each of these drivers will likely contribute substantially to Amazon's business in the coming years. Retail keeps getting faster and more convenient, ads help further monetize the company's e-commerce customers, and AWS offers investors a fast-growing, high-margin catalyst for the business. Together, Amazon's broad-based catalyst of scaled and profitable business segments provides investors with more certainty when thinking about the company's long-term potential.\nIf I had to pick just one of these two growth stocks today, I'd choose Amazon -- despite its higher valuation of about 35 times earnings. The operating momentum is better, the AI strategy is tied to an already scaled platform, and the cash generation gives the company room to invest through cycles. Alibaba is investable and improving, but the execution bar (and ultimately the risk) is higher.", "content_hash": "3a73d7a5744c1c5677f9f7480385dff9", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The president said that those investing in the US could be exempt from new tariffs.\nThe US President sent out a warning about semiconductor tariffs during a dinner at the White House on Thursday, where he hosted a high-powered group of tech executives.\nThe president has been vocal about wanting to see substantial domestic investment from big tech companies. Trump said that he would soon impose “fairly substantial” tariffs on semiconductor imports, but noted that companies relocating their manufacturing to the US could see their products exempted from the next levy.\n“We’ll be putting a tariff very shortly. You probably are hearing we’ll be putting a fairly substantial tariff,\" the president said, adding that it concerns companies that do not shift production to the US.\n“We’ll be putting tariffs on companies that aren’t coming in,” Trump said. He also mentioned the Apple CEO by name, saying that, regarding the new levies, \"Tim Cook would be in pretty good shape.\"\nNew tariffs for semiconductor imports\nIn August, the US President already talked about imposing a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports during an event with Apple CEO Tim Cook. The tech giant pledged to make an additional $100 billion (€85.7bn) investment in domestic manufacturing at the time, on top of a previously approved $500bn (€428.5bn).\nDuring the dinner at the White House on Thursday, the likes of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Apple CEO Tim Cook found themselves as the centre of attention when Trump asked guests around the table how much they were investing in the country.\nMeta's Mark Zuckerberg, who sat to Trump's right, said $600bn (€514.2bn), Apple's Tim Cook quoted the same and Google's Sundar Pichai promised $250bn (€214.2bn).\n“What about Microsoft?” Trump said. “That's a big number.”\nCEO Satya Nadella said it was up to $80bn (€68.6bn) per year.\n“Good,” Trump responded. “Very good.”\nNotably absent from the guest list was Elon Musk.

Based on estimates from Mordor Intelligence, the global retail industry will grow from an estimated $27.3 trillion this year to about $36.9 trillion by the turn of the decade.\nWith an addressable market this massive, it should come as no surprise that retail is one of the most competitive industries on the planet. However, there are a handful of retail standouts, including e-commerce giant Amazon, superstore chain Walmart, and of course warehouse club Costco Wholesale (COST 0.64%).\nWhile Amazon and Walmart have (mostly) grown their respective businesses traditionally, Costco is the oddball of the bunch. It's known for its quirky deals, such as the $1.50 hot-dog combo for members, generous return policy, and its penchant for selling one-of-a-kind and unexpected items, such as gold bars and luxury jewelry.\nCostco's 79.6 million paying members, as of the end of the fiscal third quarter (May 11, 2025), have come to expect these perks and surprises. But a new rule is a complete game-changer for many of its paying cardholders.\nCostco's executive members just earned a lucrative new perk\nTo shop in one of Costco's more than 900 warehouse locations, you'll need a membership. Approximately 42 million of its paid membership are gold star and business level, which each carry a $65 annual cost. The remaining 37.6 million are executive level, which carries twice the annual cost ($130), but also lays on the perks.\nAccording to Costco, its executive members can earn up to 2% back on most purchases totaling up to $1,250 annually, as well as receive a monthly credit of $10 for eligible delivery orders topping $150. Executive cardholders may also qualify for discounts on Costco travel packages.\nThe reason the company caters to this group is because they're responsible for the bulk of net sales. Despite accounting for \"just\" 47% of total memberships, executive cardholders were responsible for approximately 73% of sales during the fiscal third quarter. Keeping these folks happy and sustaining annual renewal rates above 90% is key to Costco's success.\nBut a newly announced perk for executive members, which was unveiled in June but only fully implemented earlier this week, is bound to turn heads.\nOn June 11, Costco revealed plans to allow its executive cardholders exclusive shopping hours seven days a week in its more than 600 U.S. warehouses. On weekdays and Sundays, only executive members will be allowed to enter its warehouses from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., with this exclusive shopping window narrowed to 30 minutes (9 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.) on Saturdays. Though this policy technically went into effect at the end of June, there had been a two-month grace period where gold star and business members were allowed in. This isn't the case any longer.\nWhile some non-executive members have expressed frustration with this new policy, it's a smart move by Costco to put the proverbial carrot at the end of the stick and encourage existing gold star and business members to upgrade.\nMembership fees are a key ingredient to Costco's competitive edge\nThough membership fees aren't the only factor responsible for making Costco such a successful growth stock and phenomenal multidecade investment, they play an undeniably important role.\nGroceries act as the primary lure responsible for getting people into Costco's warehouses. However, food and beverages traditionally sport razor-thin margins. Since membership fees flow almost entirely to Costco's bottom line, they can be used as something of a buffer to offset the minuscule margins tied to groceries.\nArguably even more important, membership fees afford Costco a pricing buffer. Management understands fully that members of all levels expect various perks, including prices on most groceries that'll undercut traditional mom and pop shops and national grocery chains. The membership fees Costco receives are one of the reasons it can keep prices on basic need goods so comparatively low. It's something of a repeating cycle that works in the company's favor.\nCostco Wholesale's size shouldn't be overlooked, either. When a company has deep pockets, it's often able to buy products in bulk, which reduces the per-unit cost for each item. These lower costs can then be passed along to its members as a key perk to shopping in its warehouses.\nEven though cardholders are likely heading to Costco for groceries and other household necessities, it only takes a handful of higher-margin discretionary purchases for the company to benefit. It also doesn't hurt when members buy Costco's private-label brand, Kirkland Signature, which tends to boast premium margins, relative to comparable products.\nThere's no denying this formula works. Just over 90% of its worldwide customers renewed their memberships, based on fiscal third-quarter data, with an even higher 92.7% renewal rate in the U.S. and Canada. It also boasts exceptional membership pricing power, with the number of paid memberships growing following a fee increase on Sept. 1, 2024.\nThere's a reason investors have been paying a traditionally head-scratching (for a retail company) forward-year earnings multiple of 47 to buy shares of Costco stock. Given its array of competitive advantages, and the exceptional loyalty of its shoppers, there's a good likelihood this new perk is going to mint even more executive level cardholders in the quarters that lie ahead.", "content_hash": "cda69b4754487e45f02c700f686e0666", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

I just wanted to talk about the AI business, specifically the XPU. When you said you're going to grow significantly faster than what you had thought a quarter ago, what's changed? Is it just the impressive prospect moving to a customer definition, or is it stronger demand across the existing three customers? A: I think it's both. But to a large extent, it's the fourth customer that we now add to our roster, which we will ship pretty strongly in 2026. So a combination of increasing volumes from existing three customers and the addition of a fourth customer with immediate and substantial demand really changes our outlook for 2026.\nQ: Near term, from the cyclical bottom, how should we think about the magnitude of the cyclical upturn in the non-AI semiconductor business? Are you seeing continued order improvements in the non-AI segment, which would point to continued cyclical recovery into next fiscal year? A: From a year-on-year Q4 guidance, we are actually up slightly. The only consistent trend we've seen over the last three quarters that is moving up strongly is broadband. Non-AI semiconductor is slow to recover, and Q4 year-on-year is maybe low single digit. I'm expecting to see more of a U-shaped recovery in non-AI, perhaps by late mid '26, late '26.\nQ: Can you help us quantify what is the new fiscal '26 AI guidance? And do you expect the custom versus networking mix to stay broadly what it has been this past year or evolve more towards custom? A: We are expecting and seeing 2026 to accelerate more than the growth rate we see in '25. Regarding the mix, as we gain more experience among four customers, the networking percentage of the pool will be a declining percentage going into '26.\nQ: Could you give some color on the $110 billion backlog? How much of that is AI versus non-AI versus software? A: We generally don't break up backlog, but it's largely driven by AI in terms of growth. Software continues to add steadily, and non-AI has grown double digits. Fully 50% of it at least is semiconductors, and it's fair to say that semiconductor piece is much more AI than non-AI.\nQ: How is the dialogue going beyond these four customers? Are you hearing from others, and how is the trend going with the other three prospects? A: We have identified seven prospects, four of which are now customers. We are very picky and careful about who qualifies, and we may see one more prospect. But right now, for sure, we have seven, and that is pretty much what we have.", "content_hash": "e66039ced60cfdbe0939fcd855381170", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

A quick look at the world's most valuable companies shows that nine of the top 10 are pioneers in AI, all jockeying for a shot at the title.\nNvidia recently made headlines by becoming the world's first $4 trillion company and currently clocks in at $4.1 trillion. Microsoft and Apple are close on its heels, with market caps of $3.7 trillion and $3.5 trillion, respectively. Rounding out the top five are Alphabet and Amazon, worth $2.7 trillion and $2.4 trillion, respectively.\nWith a current market cap of just $372 billion, it may seem premature to suggest that Palantir Technologies (PLTR 0.80%) could soar 169% to earn its place in the $1 trillion club. Yet while many companies are still working to comprehend this paradigm shift, Palantir is helping businesses profit from AI and enriching shareholders along the way.\nDecades of AI expertise\nYears before the company went public, Palantir had been toiling away on advanced AI algorithms for defense and intelligence agencies within the U.S. government. In recent years, the company has also focused on enterprise software that saves businesses time and money.\nBut it was Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform that catapulted the company to AI stardom, as the system leverages generative AI to develop real-time solutions to company-specific problems.\nThe two biggest stumbling blocks to adopting AI are knowing exactly where to begin and getting a solid return on investment (ROI). Palantir was able to solve both of those challenges with a simple strategy.\nPalantir invites developers and business leaders to attend \"boot camps,\" or workshops that show AIP in action. During these interactive sessions, users work side-by-side with Palantir engineers to develop solutions to their real-world business problems.\nThis strategy is a clear winner. In the second quarter, Palantir's revenue of $1 billion climbed 48% year over year and 14% sequentially. The star of the show was its U.S. commercial revenue, which surged 93% to $306 million, representing nearly 31% of total revenue, fueled by ongoing demand for AIP. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.16, which surged 78%.\nThe segment ended the quarter with contract value of $843 million, up 222% year over year. This helped drive Palantir's remaining performance obligation (RPO) -- or contractually obligated sales that aren't yet included in revenue -- up a whopping 77% to $2.4 billion.\nPalantir also boosted its full-year guidance, forecasting at least 85% growth for the U.S. commercial segment (namely AIP) for 2025, up from its previous outlook for 68% growth.\nThe path to $1 trillion\nPalantir's decades of experience and its groundbreaking AI solutions have created a windfall for shareholders, and there could be much more to come.\nAccording to Wall Street, Palantir is expected to generate sales of $4.1 billion in 2025, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of about 89 (not a typo). Assuming its P/S remains constant, Palantir would have to generate revenue of more than $11 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap.\nWall Street is forecasting annual revenue growth of 38.7% for Palantir over the next five years. If the company is able to grow at that pace, it could reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2028. But if Palantir's sales and profit growth continue to accelerate, it could achieve that benchmark even sooner.\nI'm not the only one who thinks so. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has run the models and calculated that Palantir's market cap could hit $1 trillion sometime in 2027 or 2028. Ives argues that investors focused solely on valuation have missed \"every transformational tech stock over the past 20 years.\" He goes on to say that AI will be the driving factor behind Palantir's success.\nPalantir's operational and financial trajectory seems to back up that assertion, as the company continues to announce new and larger customer wins and its sales and profits continue to accelerate.\nEvery rose has its thorns\nLest there be any doubt, and as promising as Palantir is, there are also plenty of things that could go wrong. The development of AI could stall, the economy could hit a rough patch, or Palantir could fail to capitalize on the tremendous opportunity that is AI -- and any of these could send the stock careening lower. Let's not forget the company's valuation, which is extreme, to say the least.\nPalantir is currently selling for 66 times next year's sales and 184 times next year's earnings. History shows that the higher the multiple, the more extreme the volatility, and Palantir isn't immune. Investors should prepare themselves for significant stock price movements, which aren't for the faint of heart.\nEstimates abound for the potential of generative AI, but the software opportunity alone is intriguing. Cathie Wood, founder and CEO of Ark Investment Management, suggests that if software purveyors are able to capture 10% of the value created by their AI-focused products, it could generate as much as $14 trillion in revenue in 2030.\nIf Palantir continues along its current trajectory, helping companies drive positive ROI for their AI spending -- and I believe it can -- it could achieve a $1 trillion market cap sooner than many expect.", "content_hash": "7cca6646ec9140b58c6ba0806a184068", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Do you want to talk about that big day you had yesterday?\"\nAlphabet this week added $230 billion to its market cap after avoiding a breakup in a landmark antitrust case brought by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2020. Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search last year. Deciding on the penalties this week, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled against the most severe consequences proposed by the DOJ, causing shares of the search company to jump.\n\"I'm glad it's over,\" Pichai responded to Trump, causing an eruption of laughter from the other table guests.\n\"It's a long process,\" Pichai said. \"Appreciate that your administration had a constructive dialogue, and we were able to get it to some resolution.\"\n\"Right,\" Trump replied.\n\"The AI moment is one of the most transformative moments any of us have ever seen or will see in our lifetimes, so making sure the U.S. is at the forefront — and I think your administration is investing a lot,\" Pichai said. \"Already the AI action plan under your leadership I think is a great start, and we look forward to working together. And thanks for your leadership.\"\nThe plan Pichai referred to is the administration's \"Winning the AI Race: America's AI Action Plan,\" launched in July, which claims to identify 90 federal policy actions across three pillars: the acceleration of innovation, building of artificial intelligence infrastructure and leadership in international diplomacy and security. Part of that plan includes a July executive order that says AI models should not incorporate \"Woke AI\" or \"ideological dogmas such as DEI,\" meaning diversity, equity and inclusion.\nGoogle is also in discussions with Trump's lawyers for an ongoing lawsuit that the president filed more than four years ago, accusing the online video platform YouTube of unlawful censorship.

Sign up to receive future editions.\nOverview: Every step to take-off counts\nIf launching a rocket's a prime feast, opening the doors to the vehicle's launch pad is a healthy appetizer.\nLast week, Rocket Lab introduced Launch Complex 3 — the intended take-off pad of its Neutron rocket — located within the Virginia Spaceport Authority's Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport. Neutron itself will arrive a little later to this party, with a first flight targeted this year – but the premiere of the launch site marks a major step for Rocket Lab specifically and for a space industry that's overall hungry for further launch vehicles.\nThe company already produces the small-lift Electron launch vehicle, which was performing its first commercial flights by late 2018. The 141-foot-tall Neutron is an upgrade in scale: a medium-lift reusable rocket that burns liquid methane and oxygen designed to carry payloads up to 13,000 kilograms to low Earth orbit (LEO) and 1,500 kilograms for trips to Mars or Venus.\nThe market scale for global carrier rockets — which are designed to launch a payload on a particular route or orbit — is seen set to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9% between this year and 2034. Forgive the pun, but launch demand's only risen meteorically, with payloads ranging from space exploration and research equipment to humans and defense and telecommunication satellites for fast-evolving networks.\nFor years, the industry bemoaned the limited scale of take-off capacity, with European Space Agency's Director Josef Aschbacher last year acknowledging a \"launcher crisis\" in Europe that the agency sought to resolve with the launch of the Ariane-6.\nMuch of that world's launch capacity is in the hands of Elon Musk's SpaceX, whose take-off cadence last year exceeded that of both commercial competitors and national programs. In 2024, the company saw through more than 130 flights of its workhorse medium-lift Falcon 9, which reuses its first-stage booster and payload fairings. That's just over half of the 259 orbital launches undertaken over the period globally — and could increase to more than 180 Falcon 9 launches this year, according to Musk's estimate of December. An August launch even carried Kuiper satellites for Amazon, whose owner Jeff Bezos' rival Blue Origin unleashed the New Glenn on its maiden orbital voyage in January.\nIt's not taking away from SpaceX's success story to acknowledge the drawbacks of overreliance on a single provider. Toward the middle of the year, U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to cancel government Musk's government contracts in the midst of an explosive public row led the tech billionaire to fleetingly float the possibility of decommissioning SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft — potentially stranding U.S. crew without a ride to and from the International Space Station at the time. The waters have calmed since, and SpaceX and NASA are continuing their partnership, but the incident's driven home the critical downsides of market dominance.\nWe've been over this: getting a brand new rocket model off the ground's no feat for the feeble. Moscow's still planning to push through the all-Russian Soyuz-5 by the end of the year, and Relativity Space's reusable Terran R and Firefly Aerospace's Eclipse are both currently penciled in for liftoff in 2026. Last month, our collective breaths were held as we watched intently whether the second-iteration Starship variant would prevail in the rocket's 10th test flight, or face another fiery setback. (Elon Musk's giant won the day.)\nBut, when the global satellite market is projected to expand seven-fold by 2035, it's hard not to see why all eyes are glued when space companies reveal their latest and greatest in brand new rockets — or their launch pads.\nWhat's up\n- Canada prepares its first lunar rover — Canadensys Aerospace is developing the first Canada-built rover to investigate the Moon — a \"logical first step\" for future space exploration ambitions, according to the company's CEO. — BBC\n- Senate hears NASA doubts over return to Moon timeline — A former NASA administrator told senators it was unlikely that the space agency would be able to put men back on the Moon ahead of Beijing, which has embarked on similar efforts. — Space News\n- ESA spacecraft undertakes Venus flyby — The European Space Agency's JUICE spacecraft has completed a Venus flyby en route to explore Jupiter's icy moons and gather data about the planet's Ganymede, Callisto and Europa moons. — Space.com\nIndustry maneuvers\n- Trump says Space Command HQ to move to Alabama — U.S. President Donald Trump said the U.S. Space Command's headquarters will move to Alabama from Colorado, citing the latter state's mail-in voting system. — NBC News\n- White House axes labor unions at NASA — Washington has moved to eliminate collective bargaining rights for several government institutions, including NASA, citing national security. — White House executive order\nMarket movers\n- Rocket Lab reveals new pad ahead of first Neutron rocket launch — Rocket Lab unveiled its new Launch Complex 3 pad at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport in Wallops Island, which will be used to test and launch the reusable Neutron rocket that could debut as soon as the end of the year. — Defense News\n- Andoya Space, Rheinmetall to bolster efforts to boost satellite launch — Andoya Space and Rheinmetall have agreed to strengthen their combined efforts to bolster satellite launch and space capabilities. — Defence Industry Europe\n- NordSpace's Taiga launch delayed by tech, weather issues — Ontario-based tech startup NordSpace has postponed the launch of its Taiga rocket — intended as the first ever commercial rocket take-off from Canadian soil — after a safety system fault and weather disruptions.

You probably are hearing we'll be putting a fairly substantial tariff, or not that high, but a fairly substantial tariff.\"\nTrump had said last month during an event with Cook that he would impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports, while exempting products from companies that move their manufacturing to the U.S. At the time, Apple pledged to spend an additional $100 billion on a domestic manufacturing initiative, adding on a $500 billion announcement that Apple made in February.\nDuring Thursday's event, Trump noted that \"Tim Cook would be in pretty good shape,\" regarding the potential import levies.\nThe U.S. has been working to onshore its semiconductor supply chain for many years now.

During the visit, Altman said India was OpenAI's second-largest market by number of users.\nHe has subsequently said that AI adoption in India is \"amazing to watch.\"\n\"We love to see the explosion of creativity--india is outpacing the world,\" he said on X earlier this year.\nIndia is one of ChatGPT's fastest-growing markets globally, Nick Patience, practice lead for AI at tech research and analysis firm Futurum Group, told CNBC. \"OpenAI's India focus is a strategic move to gain a competitive edge,\" he added.\nHere's a rundown of how OpenAI is expanding in India.\nChatGPT explosion\nChatGPT, OpenAI's core product, has seen strong growth in India. The app was downloaded 10.2 million times in India in August, a huge jump from the 2.5 million downloads seen during the same month last year, according to analytics firm Appfigures.\nSince its launch, ChatGPT has 111 million downloads in India, ahead of its 80 million downloads in the U.S, Appfigures data shows.\nDownloads do not necessarily equal daily or monthly users, but the figures emphasise OpenAI's growth trajectory in the country.\nThe download numbers are also far ahead of rivals, including Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude. The closest challenger was Perplexity, Appfigures said, which had 6.4 million downloads in August.\nIndia-specific product\nUser spending on ChatGPT has been increasing. To date, Indian users have spent $21.3 million on ChatGPT, Appfigures data shows. In comparison, U.S. users have spent $784 million.\nThat underlines the fact that while the number of users in India is huge, it remains a price-sensitive market.\nTo address this, OpenAI in August launched ChatGPT Go, a low-cost 399-rupees-($4.53)-a-month plan for its AI app.\n\"It's a classic wedge strategy to capture a price-sensitive market and build a user base that will be difficult for local players to dislodge later,\" Futurum Group's Patience said of the strategy.\nInfrastructure and hiring\nAccording to Bloomberg, OpenAI is scouting a location in India for a data center with at least 1-gigawatt capacity. The facility will be part of OpenAI's Stargate-branded infrastructure push, Bloomberg said this week, although CNBC was unable to verify the report.\nThe ChatGPT developer said last month that it would open a local office in the market and is currently advertising three sales roles in India.\nIt also announced last month an education program in India that will include funding for research and provide half a million ChatGPT licenses for educators and students across the country.\nIndia challenges\nWhile India doesn't have a home-grown artificial intelligence company as big as OpenAI, there are some challengers in the form of domestic startups, including Sarvam AI and Krutrim, and other American tech giants like Google and Meta.\nContinued geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and India over trade, however, have the potential to cause complications if there's any backlash from New Delhi against American tech firms.\nOpenAI is also locked in a legal battle with Asian News International in India, which has accused the ChatGPT developer of using copyrighted material illegally.

Today it's two euros, tomorrow it's going to be four euros. You're not going to give up on your coffee.\"\nItaly has become a top relocation destination for the wealthy in Europe this year, according to Henley & Partners, which markets citizenship and residency-by-investment schemes.\nThough the millionaire migration figures have raised some questions, and global wealth flows are notoriously difficult to track, a number of high-profile figures have made the move to Italy over recent months. These include Egypt's richest man and co-owner of Aston Villa Football Club Nassef Sawiris, and the vice-chair of Goldman Sachs, Richard Gnodde.\nThe total number of new high-net-worth arrivals in Italy so far this year could be as high as 3,600, according to Henley & Partners estimates.\nMilan's millionaire boom\nItaly's flat-tax regime was introduced in 2017 as part of a wider push by the then center-left government to attract foreign investors while encouraging homegrown talent to return to the country following the euro zone debt crisis.\nThat, in turn, has sparked a new wave of businesses looking to cater to the fresh wealth influx, particularly in the country's financial and fashion hub, Milan. Among those are newly opened members club The Wilde and, prior to that, Casa Cipriani.\n\"We really thought it was a good time to come back to Italy,\" Anna Cipriani, director of membership at Casa Cipriani Milano, told CNBC of the group's 2022 opening.\n\"Milan has evolved a lot over the years,\" she said. \"Before, it used to be known more for its industrial character and, of course, the fashion houses, while over the last few years it became more and more attractive also for creatives, for investors and for [an] international crowd.\"\nItaly's wealthy arrivals, meanwhile, have led to a surge in real estate prices across some of the country's most desirable locations, from Tuscany and the Italian Riviera to cities such as Rome, Venice and Florence. Milan, and the surrounding lakes region, however, have emerged as a firm favorite.\n\"We are at all-time high prices at the moment,\" said Pella, who is based in BHHS' Lake Como office.\n\"In five years, we had an increase [of] double-digit percentages. For the upcoming years, we're probably going to look at a steady 3% to 4% type of increase here in Lake Como.\"\nProperty prices in Milan have risen 49% since the country's flat-tax regime was introduced in 2017, compared to 10.9% across the rest of Italy's big cities, according to real estate group Tecnocasa. Global property consultancy Knight Frank now expects the city's prime real estate market to record a further 3.5% price growth in 2025.\n\"It's about those who can afford it, because prices are not necessarily down to their street market logic as an investment,\" Pella said.\n\"They like a property with their guts. Then they do a little bit of math, of course, but they're ready to spend and sometimes to overspend just to secure a one-of-a-kind view or a one-of-a-kind position.\"\nUHNW migration\nMillionaires have been migrating in droves to new residences, as more and more jurisdictions offer options to those willing to pay.\nOver the past decade, the number of high-net-worth individuals relocating abroad is estimated to have almost tripled, reaching record highs in 2024.\nThat trend looks set to continue in 2025 and 2026, as a divide deepens between countries seeking to attract the uber-rich and those clamping down in a bid to combat perceived inequality.\nFrance has deliberated expanding its wealth tax, while Switzerland is weighing new changes to inheritance tax.\nMeanwhile, the U.K. in April abolished its over 200-year-old non-dom tax regime, which exempted wealthy foreigners living in Britain from paying U.K. tax on their overseas income and gains. It follows an outflow of London-based banks and financiers to other European capitals, such as Milan, following the 2016 Brexit vote.\nThat has left other countries looking to fill the gap.\n\"There are countries literally around the world coming to us and saying: 'We want the U.K.'s millionaires and billionaires. What can we do? How can we bring them to our country?'\" Stuart Wakeling, managing partner at Henley & Partners U.K., said.\nWhile such citizenship and residence regimes vary vastly, and can include stringent investment requirements, part of the appeal of Italy's system is its simplicity. The one-off payment offers foreign individuals, or nationals who have lived overseas for at least nine years, exemption from wider taxes on income and assets for up to 15 years.\nWorsening wealth divides\nItaly's new surge of arrivals has nevertheless raised questions about the impact on the wider economy.\nSome have warned of worsening wealth inequalities, with the overall tax take from the regime minimal compared to the country's overall deficit, and much of the newly generated wealth concentrated in specific areas.\nMeanwhile, critics suggest that attempts to emulate the scheme elsewhere could lead to a race to the bottom and an erosion of the tax base.\nStill, businesses say they are hopeful that the increased activity and new job creation in industries from finance and private equity to hospitality and services will ultimately reap benefits across Milan and the wider country.\n\"It's kind of a wheel, you know, that keeps rolling. You have all these people moving in and you have all these hotels opening and you have more and more people that then decide to come to town because now that they think about it more,\" Cipriani, from private members club Casa Cipriani Milano, said.\n\"When you have a lot of investments into a city, the economy creates more job opportunities also for the people.\"\n— CNBC's Gaelle Legrand contributed to this report.", "content_hash": "af32b3f2ce1db46d9d995c471a578dad", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently commented that, while he has worked seven days a week since the pandemic, \"the zoomers don't show up\" — referring to Gen Z professionals.\nBritish businessman Lord Alan Sugar, 78, said young people \"just want to sit at home,\" and that they need to get back to the office.\nDespite this, young workers say they're keen on more in-person interactions and are coming to the office an average of three days a week, more than all other age groups, according to a recent global study of 12,000 employees by real estate firm JLL.\nAs older professionals shirk the office, young people are finding they're often either alone when coming into work premises, or surrounded by peers of a similar age.\nThis has given rise to a series of new workplace trends from the viral \"Gen Z stare\", to the \"office siren\" aesthetic and even TikTok slang like \"ick\" becoming normalized in professional lingo.\n\"We're blurring the boundaries between just being a colleague to also being friends, and it just makes it more comfortable for us as well to work with people.\"Weirong LiCommunications Professional\n\"Gen Z is reshaping workplace norms by introducing new ways of working that reflect their values, digital fluency, and desire for authenticity,\" Dan Schawbel, managing partner of Workplace Intelligence, told CNBC.\nIntentional networking\nSenior professionals' prefer to work from home and this has eroded much of the water-cooler chat and mentorship culture that young workers are seeking. Gen Z are becoming more intentional to fill the gap.\nTwenty-five-year-old Weirong Li, a communications professional who graduated from NYU's Stern School of Business, said she was going into the office five days a week, while more senior colleagues would stick to a hybrid or remote schedule. Li noted that the people who do come into the office are generally of a similar age to her.\n\"With this hybrid schedule, it's based on your hierarchy, so if you are higher up...you have more of a slack to not come into the office because you're in a position where you've already proven yourself and you don't need to build a network.\"\nThis has taught Li to be thoughtful about how she approaches colleagues, including taking advantage of both virtual and in-person opportunities.\n\"Most of the connections that I've had with older colleagues, if it wasn't in the office, has built from first being online and virtual because I didn't know these people. I would reach out to people on LinkedIn or even cold email people,\" Li explained.\nShe added she takes water-cooler chats \"quite seriously\" because she views them as an opportunity to strike up a conversation and meet someone new.\nSome Gen Zers are deliberately signing up to professional networking events to try to bridge the gap and mingle in a structured environment, as CNBC previously reported.\nTwenty-five-year-old Vivek Haria, a senior tax advisor at a financial services firm, told CNBC Make It at the time that he's attended 10 events for young professionals organized by London's business district Canary Wharf because it felt lonely in the office, as older workers were not showing up.\nBringing your whole personality to work\nGen Z workers aren't shy about bringing their personalities to work and blurring the boundaries between personal and professional, including dressing more casually and being unfiltered in meetings and conversations.\nTwenty-seven-year-old PR manager Mady Lanni, prioritizes dressing comfortably and brings \"her whole self to work,\" she said. \"'I'm not coming into work with dress pants and heels on. I wear sneakers or my Birkenstocks every day.\"\nGen Z workers are often more casual and comfortable in how they show up at work — sometimes literally.\n\"It'll always be the Gen Zers that sit on the floor instead of sitting like in a chair at a desk,\" Lanni said, referring to team meetings. \"We find the bean bags, or we find the more unique seating situations.\"\nLi believes showing up to work with an authentic personality is a unique trait of Gen Z culture, regardless of whether it aligns with corporate norms.\n\"It's a part of our kind of Gen Z norm, which is showing who we are, what we stand for, our mission, our purpose... value-based actions and conversations do matter for us,\" she said. \"We're more open, and we realize that's also a superpower, that's how people remember us.\"\nMental health check-ins\nWhere mental health was formerly a hush-hush conversation in the workplace, Gen Z workers like prioritizing wellbeing.\nRoughly 51% of young people view mental and physical health as a primary metric of future success, more than other factors like wealth, occupation and family relationships, according to a recent global EY study of over 10,000 respondents aged between 18 and 34 years.\nCommunications professional Li noted that, after the pandemic, \"psychological safety has been very important\" for young people, so essentially being able to bring their emotional side to work.\nShe said that her friends and colleagues often check in with each other during lunch breaks. \"We really value having conversations about how we are doing mentally or physically so that we acknowledge the person in a work context and environment.\"\nInstead of making the typical office small talk, young workers like Li try to take the conversation deeper.\n\"We're blurring the boundaries between just being a colleague to also being friends, and it just makes it more comfortable for us as well to work with people,\" Li said. \"We feel like we have shared values and can relate. It makes communications easier. We don't really want to always be communicating so formally, 24/7.\"\nLanni said she also reached out to colleagues who seem overwhelmed or stressed, adding that Gen Z is more open about discussing mental well-being in the workplace.\nLanni, who works at the office three days a week, added that younger generations are \"pushing for the need of including mental health services and benefits... taking a mental health day is becoming more and more accepted.\"\nEmbracing AI\nGen Z are leaning into generative AI at a faster pace than other workers and are using the tech to get ahead at work.\nTwenty-five-year-old Gracie Lissick, a PR manager, said that younger generations can help normalize the use of AI amongst their teams.\n\"We really have this awesome kind of Michael Jordan moment to help our teams implement AI,\" she said. \"We can be that resource as much as we can.\"\nAround 57% of Gen Zs are already using AI in their daily work for a variety of tasks, whether it's content creation, data analysis, project management, or something else, and most view it positively, per Deloitte.\nLissick said that adopting AI is an advantage because it shows your ability to be tech agile and forward-thinking to managers.\nLi said young people like herself are using AI to save time and improve their work.\n\"The goal is to have more time to do other stuff later on and so I think that we're a quite focused generation contrary to what other people think. We're also always experimenting with new tools, especially in the AI world, that can help us be more efficient at our work,\" she said.\nWorkplace Intelligence's Schawbel added: \"Many Gen Z workers are using AI to bridge gaps in knowledge, confidence, and professional support, treating it almost like a digital coach or co-pilot. While it can't fully replace human mentorship, for Gen Z, AI is emerging as a reliable stand-in — available 24/7, judgment-free, and often more responsive than a busy boss.\"", "content_hash": "04fedf449910b3ba6db790d6d315dbe7", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

So, when he discovered an investment vehicle called a search fund while studying for his MBA, he went all in.\nAs millions of baby boomers prepare to retire, a quiet crisis — and an unexpected business opportunity — is unfolding across the economy. Today, over half of all U.S. small businesses are owned by people aged 55 and over, yet most lack a succession plan, according to Gallup.\nThese businesses are often unglamorous, but essential to keep society running: plumbers, equipment rental companies and pest control.\n\"They're the types of companies that if they drop what they do, it would really hurt,\" said Jon Staenberg, founder & CEO of Agate Hound Fund.\nEnter the next generation of entrepreneurs — millennials and Gen Zers — who are seizing this moment not by launching startups, but by buying companies through search funds. In doing so, they're revitalizing Main Street businesses and solving a looming succession crisis, all while building wealth in a turbulent economy.\nWhat is a search fund?\nFirst conceived in 1984, search funds — also known as \"entrepreneurship through acquisition\" — let individuals — or \"searchers\" — raise money from a small group of investors to buy and operate a small or medium-sized private company.\nA 2024 study by the Stanford Graduate School of Business describes the process in four steps:\n- Stage one: Raise initial capital (about 2 to 6 months)\n- Stage two: Search for and acquire company (about 12 to 24 months)\n- Stage three: Operation and value creation (about 4 to 7+ years)\n- Stage four: Exit (about 6 months)\nThe goal is to grow these businesses and exit with a profit — often to a private equity firm.\nIt's a compelling model: lower risk than starting from scratch, since the business already has customers, revenue, and a product-market fit.\nAcquisition targets are typically businesses with recurring revenue, low overhead, minimal regulatory risk, and stable customer bases.\n\"These are businesses that are, frankly, hard to break,\" said Jackson, who is now a search fund investor. \"It's very forgiving for the first-time CEO.\"\nBesides \"core\" search funds, other variants include self-funded, single-investor models, while others prioritize a larger pool of capital committed at launch, or a longer holding period of between 10 and 20 years.\nIn 2023, a record 94 core search funds were launched across the U.S. and Canada, while international interest also set new milestones, with 59 new core funds outside North America, according to studies conducted by Stanford and IESE Business School.\n'Safe port in a storm'\nSearch funds have grown popular as traditional career paths feel less secure, with layoffs, automation and artificial intelligence reshaping industries.\n\"There is a big displacement of young professionals who are in the middle of their career,\" said Aik Chuan Goh, managing partner of Singapore-based search fund Garlic Equity Capital. Many of these \"ambitious young professionals no longer see corporate life as their future,\" he added.\nOn the other hand, many business owners are looking to retire. \"When you put one and one together, you have a great match,\" said Goh.\nWe live in such a tumultuous time with change happening so fast, this feels like a very safe port in a storm.Jon StaenbergFounder and CEO, Agate Hound Fund\nInvestors are taking notice too. Amid downturns in the venture capital and private equity markets, search funds have emerged as an alternative asset class.\n\"Venture [capital] is so crowded now. Search funds still remain small, while the opportunity set is so big — it's the only thing I want to do for the rest of my career. You look at the returns, they've been phenomenal. They've been outsized,\" said Staenberg.\nStanford's 2024 study of 681 search funds formed in the U.S. and Canada since 1984 found that their internal rate of return was 35.1%, with a 4.5 times return on investment.\n\"Over the last 40 years, the stock market has been somewhere [around] 8.5% annual returns ... Then you go to private equity or venture over that same 40-year period ... and the returns are somewhere around 13% to 14%. So [when] you start looking at the outsized returns of 35% for search, it's a bit of a head scratcher,\" said Staenberg.\n\"We live in such a tumultuous time with change happening so fast, this feels like a very safe port in a storm.\"\nCheckbook, phonebook, playbook\nMeanwhile, search funds have also offered a risk-adjusted way for aspiring business owners to pursue their CEO dreams, such as Jackson, who, together with his friend Olaide Lawal, started their search fund in 2015.\nAbout 18 months later, the duo raised more than $5 million and acquired three dental practices from a dentist who was in his 50s. Over the next six years, Jackson ran Unified Dental Care as CEO and grew the company to seven locations before selling the business to a strategic buyer in 2023.\nBut Jackson did not come from wealth. Growing up in Champaign, Illinois, he didn't see many business success stories around him.\n\"It was normal for me to literally see in front of my door, gang fights [break] out ... and so I did not have as much access to seeing entrepreneurs,\" said Jackson.\n\"I saw the barber shop that was down the street, or I saw the person that owned the barbecue shop ... [and] people that were making an honest living, but barely livable wages,\" said Jackson.\nSo it was a risk adjusted path for me as a minority entrepreneur that didn't come with a lot of resources to have ... a successful exit.Jason JacksonFormer CEO, Unified Dental Care\n\"For me, the idea [of a search fund] was fantastic, because ... I didn't have the startup idea, so it was an opportunity for me to buy an existing business,\" he said.\nWhat makes search funds unique, he said, is that his investors also become his mentors.\n\"What separates search fund investors is that they provide, principally, three things to the entrepreneur. The first thing that they provide is [a] checkbook... This is something that I didn't have access to,\" said Jackson.\n\"Second thing that they provide access to is a phone book, meaning call me or call my network anytime ... and the third thing that they provide [is a] playbook, meaning, here's how you execute once you buy this business,\" Jackson added.\n\"So it was a risk-adjusted path for me as a minority entrepreneur that didn't come with a lot of resources to have ... a successful exit,\" said Jackson.\nThe new American dream?\nBut running a search fund isn't all smooth sailing. In fact, Jackson uncovered fraud two weeks into running the business: the seller had inflated revenue by millions.\n\"We thought we were buying a $7 million revenue company and $1.5 million in EBITDA,\" said Jackson. \"What we discovered was that the business was really doing $5 million in revenue and losing $500,000 a year after adjusting for the fraud.\"\nDespite the rocky start, Jackson turned the business around. He exited successfully, more than doubling his investment and earning seven figures altogether from his tenure as CEO and from the deal, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.\n\"We eventually were able to sell the business at a decent multiple. It's decent for the search fund industry. It's really good compared to private equity, but it's really great compared to where my partner and I came from. He came from Lagos, Nigeria. I came from an under-resourced community,\" said Jackson.\nToday, Jackson runs the Black Search Network, which he co-founded in 2020. He spends his time investing in and passing on the knowledge he's gained through his own journey to other aspiring entrepreneurs and searchers.\nIt also allows people who are gritty, who are hungry, who are willing to be coached, to pursue what we used to call the American dream — to build a business into even more success and have an exit and then come back and help others do the same thing.Jon StaenbergFounder and CEO, Agate Hound Fund\nSearch funds are not a silver bullet. Besides dealing with rejection, searchers have to find a good business to buy, convincing the owner to entrust you with their life's work, and of course, learning how to run a business for the first time.\nBut for a generation looking for stability and purpose, they may offer something rare in today's economy: a practical, profitable, and supported route to owning a business.\n\"It truly is the life cycle of entrepreneurship,\" said Staenberg. \"It also allows people who are gritty, who are hungry, who are willing to be coached, to pursue what we used to call the American dream — to build a business into even more success and have an exit and then come back and help others do the same thing.\"\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

The agreement reached in July had included Japan purchasing 100 Boeing planes, 75% higher imports of U.S. rice and $8 billion worth of agricultural and crop products.\nWashington will apply a baseline 15% tariff on nearly all Japanese imports, with separate sector-specific levies for automobiles and parts (also 15%), aerospace products, generic pharmaceutical goods and natural resources, according to the executive order.\nThe Thursday order prevents Trump's country-specific tariffs on top of existing levies. The lower tariffs will apply retroactively to Japanese goods \"entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 7, 2025,\" the order stated. The tariff relief on automobiles is set to take effect after seven days.\nTrump's global tariff campaign has thrown the global supply chain into disarray, in particular Japan's massive auto sector. Last month, Toyota warned that it expected a hit of nearly $10 billion as Trump's tariffs on autos weighed on its sales to the U.S., forcing it to slash by 16% its forecast for full-year operating profits.\nTariffs are expected to hit rivals as well, with Ford's pre-tax adjusted profit reportedly set to drop $3 billion while GM projects $4 billion to $5 billion hit for the year.\nJapan's top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, who was in Washington, delivered a letter from Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba inviting Trump to visit his country, Kyoto News reported. The Japanese official had reportedly canceled his trip to the U.S. last month as some sticking points required \"further technical discussion.\"\nPolitical tides\nThe finalizing of the deal came as political pressure for the Japanese leader mounts at home. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party earlier this week released a long-awaited report on why it lost seats in the upper house election in July.\nThe report ascribed the loss to the lack of appeal for the party's measures aimed at taming inflation, previous political scandals and weak mobilization of young voters.\nLocal media reports suggested many key members of the LDP have signaled their intention to resign to the prime minister, while Ishiba has said he intends to stay on amid calls within his party for choosing another leader.\nThough the reports have avoided naming individuals, they signal an \"implicit indictment of Ishiba's leadership of the party,\" said James Brady, vice president at political consultancy Teneo.\nAnalysts at Eurasia Group suggested in a report Friday that Ishiba is unlikely to survive a challenge from within the party next Monday, when a vote on whether to bring forward a leadership election is expected to take place.\n\"Ishiba's poor performance as party leader in lower and upper house elections and events in recent days, including former prime minister Aso Taro announcing his support for the special election, have turned the tide against Ishiba,\" analysts said, predicting a 60% odd of Ishiba's defeat in the election, with him possibly resigning before the vote takes place as internal discontent grows.", "content_hash": "f6d82ea4737a68384b0cbe9cbf00590e", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The 35-page report includes data on tickets sold, net ticket receipts, the visiting team's share of gate receipts and club seat premiums, gross general admission ticket prices, and the premium paid for club seats for the preseason and regular season for all 32 teams. The ticketing data in this CNBC report was sourced from that document.\nThe NFL requires every team to give 34% of ticket revenue and the licensing amount of a club seat to the league based on an internal formula, according to several NFL executives who asked to remain unnamed so they could speak freely about private conversations. This pool, known as the visiting team's share, or VTS, is mostly redistributed equally among the 32 teams. In 2024, each team received $27 million, up from $25 million the previous year, according to the league executives.\nStory continues after interactive chart.\nThe VTS money not redistributed is used by the NFL to fund league-level lending programs that go toward the private financing of new stadiums and renovations. Some teams are granted waivers by the NFL on a portion of their VTS contribution if they are using stadium revenue to finance construction or renovations. The Las Vegas Raiders and Los Angeles Rams, for example, received waivers of $23.4 million and $12.2 million, respectively, for their new stadiums, according to the NFL executives.\nThe league's 32 teams collected an average of $433 million in national revenue in 2024 from media, licensing and sponsorship agreements, said the executives. National revenue made up about two-thirds of overall league revenue. Local revenue — including tickets, suites, stadium sponsorships, concessions, parking and non-NFL stadium events — accounted for the remainder.\nThe San Francisco 49ers led the league in net ticket receipts — the amount the team keeps after taxes, fees and surcharges — with $176.5 million in 2024. That's $40.8 million more than the No. 2 Dallas Cowboys and $67.5 million above the league average. The Tennessee Titans ranked last, at $81.2 million in net receipts.

The New England Patriots, who have won six Super Bowls but have not made the postseason since 2021, charged the highest club seat premium at $471.92 — more than double the NFL average.\nThe NFL declined to comment in response to CNBC's questions regarding the Summary of Attendance Statistics report.", "content_hash": "89d656d2711df0ac76209e82533fbe07", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Copper alone is estimated to represent $16 billion, more than all non-mining sectors combined.\nMajor players including BHP, Glencore and Rio Tinto are among those making bold bets on Argentina's copper and lithium potential, with top executives from Glencore and Rio Tinto recently traveling to meet with Milei on a trip to Buenos Aires.\nRo Dhawan, CEO of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), a trade body representing roughly one-third of the global industry, described Argentina as \"arguably the most exciting new copper story today.\"\nThere are other countries and jurisdictions which may be more geologically rich, Dhawan said, but not one that sits at the intersection of a stable domestic political environment, and the provision of basic infrastructure and facilities and sufficient other investments complementary to the mining industry.\nAmong the most notable copper projects in Argentina is BHP and Lundin's Vicuna joint venture.\nSituated along the Chile-Argentina border, the Vicuna District is regarded as a geologically prospective region. Indeed, the deposits at Vicuna's Josemaria and Filo del Sol mines are estimated to contain 13 million metric tons of measured copper and 25 million tons of inferred copper.\nPolicy consistency and social licence will determine whether this is Argentina's mining moment or another mirage.Mariano MachadoAmericas principal analyst at Verisk Maplecroft\nFor ICMM's Dhawan, the potential significance of BHP and Lundin's Vicuna copper project is extraordinary.\n\"It's of the same importance to copper as Western Australia was to iron ore — and I don't say that lightly. It is a bold comparison to make but it is one that I do genuinely believe in,\" Dhawan said.\nA spokesperson for BHP and Lundin's Vicuna copper project said last month that the two companies intend to apply to receive benefits under RIGI, Reuters reported.\nA $47 billion opportunity\nArgentina's renewed mining focus comes as global copper demand is expected to skyrocket over the coming years, dramatically outstripping supply amid an artificial intelligence boom and a shift away from fossil fuels.\nAnalysts at consultancy CRU Group have estimated that the pipeline of Argentina's potential copper projects could represent a roughly $47 billion opportunity for the economy through to 2040.\nThis cumulative impact is comparable to the record $44-billion bailout loan Argentina received from the International Monetary Fund.\nA government spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment when contacted by CNBC.\nRead more\nAsked whether Argentina's long history of boom-and-bust economic cycles means Argentina's copper dreams could crumble once again, ICMM's Dhawan said: \"Where doesn't have that risk is the question I would ask?\"\nHe added: \"I just think that people have adjusted to a new normal expectation of quite significant volatility and that has almost worked in Argentina's favor. I think two things have happened, I think Argentina's stability has gone up and the world's stability has gone down.\"\nDhawan said it's not possible to predict which way Argentina will go, but investors appear to be prepared for different political and economic scenarios and that sovereign risk has been priced in.\nArgentina's mining moment?\nMariano Machado, principal analyst for the Americas at Verisk Maplecroft, said that while Argentina does possess the minerals needed to reshape its export base, \"policy consistency and social licence will determine whether this is Argentina's mining moment or another mirage.\"\n\"The country's policy swings have kept investment below potential levels, and the government's failure to persuade lawmakers from the opposition Union for the Homeland (UP) to vote for the RIGI means there is a risk that less private sector-friendly sectors will dispute its provisions if they make a comeback,\" Machado told CNBC by email.\n\"A new mining boom could also stoke anti-mining activism,\" he added. \"Issues around water, protection of glaciers and broader human rights underscore persistent challenges for companies to secure durable social licence to operate.\"", "content_hash": "4b52d00da89126336f2614c771ade18c", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Honeywell announced Thursday that its quantum computing company, Quantinuum, has raised another $600 million in funding at an approximately $10 billion valuation. The latest round, which doubles Quantinuum's valuation of $ 5 billion last seen in January 2024 , sets the privately held firm up for a highly anticipated initial public offering — a key step in unlocking value for Club holding Honeywell as its majority shareholder. Honeywell CFO Mike Stepniak said so himself in reaction to the fresh capital raise during an industry event on Thursday morning. \"I'm excited about commercializing this business and ultimately I think this really [gets us to an] IPO,\" Stepniak said at an industrials conferenced hosted by Jefferies. \"Our intent is to IPO this business.\" In July, Honeywell CEO Vimal Kapur said that the company is looking to bring Quantinuum public in 2027. A successful IPO would help show that Honeywell's long-term investment into Quantinuum will have been worth it. Quantinuum was formed back in 2021 following a merger of Honeywell's Quantum Solutions with Cambridge Quantum. However, it has never been a source of significant revenue or profits for the industrial conglomerate given quantum computing technology is still in the early innings and a ways off from widespread commercial use. In 2024, Honeywell reported a loss of $454 million for the segment that houses its stake in Quantinuum. Still, there's a lot of potential value to unlock for Honeywell because of the promise that many see in quantum computing, which can solve complex tasks far beyond the abilities of traditional computers due to fundamentally different architectures. Technology stalwarts including Alphabet and IBM are among those pursuing the nascent technology — in fact, it was a breakthrough quantum chip from Alphabet's Google in late 2024 that catalyzed a new wave of interest in the industry and sent stocks of publicly traded quantum firms on a major tear. Club name Nvidia has shown an increased focus on quantum , and its venture capital arm participated in Quantinuum's capital raise. Other new investors include Quant Computer, QED investors, and existing shareholders like JPMorgan Chase , Mitsui, among others. Financial services is one industry that sees a lot of potential in quantum computing, and JPMorgan even as an internal research group that focuses on the technology. Honeywell benefits from Quantinuum by more than just capitalizing on this trend, though. The market seems to have not realized Quantinuum's value to the industrial conglomerate yet either, according to Bank of America's Andrew Obin. \"What we've said is that the market doesn't seem to be assigning a particular value to their stake in Quantinuum, so risk/reward is definitely skewed to the upside,\" Obin told CNBC in an interview Thursday afternoon. Case in point: Shares of Honeywell were up only slightly on the Thursday announcement. Plus, Obin added that Quantinuum is just one of the ways \"you can win with Honeywell stock.\" The Club believes another is the company's forthcoming business spin-offs, which we have long argued will unlock more value for shareholders as Honeywell becomes a more streamlined company and its crown jewel aerospace segment gets to operate on its own. Honeywell's advanced materials business is on track to be spun off in the fourth quarter of this year, while the aerospace separation is tracking for next year.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that shots using mRNA technology, including Covid vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, are safe and effective, and serious side effects have happened in extremely rare cases.\nSen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., noted that the committee member, Dr. Retsef Levi, has said that evidence is mounting that mRNA vaccines cause \"serious harm, including death, especially among young people,\" apparently referring to a post pinned on Levi's X account.

The CDC and its vaccine panel will decide who to recommend the shots to later this month.\n\"I'm not taking them away from people,\" Kennedy said, referring to the vaccines.\nBut Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., argued that not everyone can walk into a pharmacy and get a Covid shot now.\nThe FDA's new limits have complicated Covid shot access in the U.S., which now depends on a patient's age and risk level, laws and policies in their state, insurance coverage, and health-care provider. Pending CDC guidance, some pharmacies have added prescription requirements for Covid vaccines in certain states.\n\"You clearly are taking away vaccines,\" she said after a prolonged shouting match with Kennedy.\nKennedy's comments before the Senate Finance Committee come after he repeatedly promised the panel in January that he would do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it more difficult or discourages people from taking vaccines. Since then, he has canceled funding for mRNA shot development and made other vaccine policy changes that could limit access to immunizations, including gutting the CDC vaccine panel and dropping Covid shot recommendations for certain groups.\nHis comments also follow a leadership shake-up at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The White House last week fired CDC Director Susan Monarez, and four senior agency officials resigned shortly after, with some of them citing the politicization of the agency and a threat to public health. In an opinion piece on Thursday, Monarez accused Kennedy of \"a deliberate effort to weaken America's public-health system and vaccine protections.\"\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X in support of Kennedy on Thursday, writing that he \"is taking flak because he's over the target\" and saying Democrats were attacking the Trump administration's \"commonsense effort.\"\nKennedy touted skepticism around Covid vaccines, despite evidence of their safety and effectiveness.\n\"We were told again and again the vaccines would prevent transmission, they prevent infection. It wasn't true. They knew it from the start,\" Kennedy said.\nHe also said he does not know how many people died of Covid and whether the vaccines prevented deaths from the virus.\n\"I would like to see the data and talk about the data,\" Kennedy said.\nBut data is readily available from dozens of studies. One paper in August estimates that Covid vaccines saved more than 2 million lives, mostly among older adults, worldwide between 2020 and October 2024.\nThe CDC website also says that Covid vaccines from the 2023 to 2024 season reduced the risk of severe illness from Covid by almost 70% in the first two months after vaccination in adults ages 18 and older, with protection gradually declining over time.\nThose shots also decreased the risk of hospitalization due to Covid by around 50% in the first two months of vaccination in that same population. The Covid vaccines showed similar benefits in older adults.\nKennedy also defended his decision to fire all 17 previous members of the CDC vaccine panel, saying he didn't politicize the committee.\n\"What we did is we got rid of the conflicts of interest. ... We depoliticized and put great scientists on it from a very diverse group,\" the HHS secretary said. \"They are very, very pro-vaccine.\"\nBut a new analysis published last month from USC researchers found that conflicts of interest on that panel had been at \"historic lows for years\" before Kennedy restacked it with new members, some of whom are widely known vaccine critics.\nCorrection: Kennedy testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday.

For those with at least two AI skills, the premium was 43% higher.\nThe study also noted three fields with the largest premium: customer and client support, sales, and manufacturing and production.\nJoshua Woo, founder of Recruit Fast, an employment agency in Singapore, made a similar observation that \"AI skills are paying above average in this market.\"\nHe added that they are no longer just nice to have, \"they're a differentiator.\"\nMore accessible\nLightcast's report identified over 300 AI skills ranging from AI ethics and generative AI to machine learning.\nThe study also found that different career areas required fundamentally different AI skills. For example, roles in transportation were likely to require autonomous driving skills, while maintenance positions prioritized robotics capabilities.\nThough many of the AI skills required high technical expertise, the most commonly-listed ones were often quite general, such as proficiency in the use of ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot.\nThese basic skills are becoming more prevalent and accessible in the job market, according to Bridget Wong, head of human relations at Accenture Singapore.\n\"While positions like decision scientist or LLM/data architect demand deep technical expertise, many operational and junior employees are also being equipped to work effectively with AI-enabled processes,\" Wong said.\nThus, \"there is no wrong stage in a career to learn AI—opportunities exist at every level, and organizations should invest in training and exposure to empower employees,\" she added.\nDemand in non-tech roles\nNotably, Lightcast's study found that demand for AI skills was higher in non-tech sectors than in IT and computer science, which are normally associated with AI.\nSince 2022, the year OpenAI launched ChatGPT, job postings mentioning generative AI skills were up 800% for non-tech roles, the study found.\nWhile IT and computer science still reigned the list of sectors demanding AI skills, marketing and public relations came in second place. This was followed by science & research, and social analysis and planning.\n\"It's not just software developers or the data scientists that are benefiting from AI skills; It's something people in everything from marketing to finance to HR should be thinking about,\" Magrini said.\n'Be prepared'\nAI skills \"are coming to every job function, to every career area, but at different paces,\" which means everybody needs a layer of AI literacy, Magrini said.\nRecruit Fast's Woo noted that AI skills are likely less relevant as prerequisites in blue-collar jobs as compared to other fields.\nStill, Magrini said that \"AI is coming, but we don't need to be scared.

It can't be too slow, nor can it be too hot.\nWall Street is on edge heading into Friday's nonfarm payrolls. Economists polled by Dow Jones are forecasting the U.S. economy added 75,000 jobs last month, a weak estimate that's only slightly higher than the dismal 73,000 headline number in the July report. The unemployment rate is also projected to tick higher, to 4.3% from 4.2%.\nInvestors may be able to shrug off a soft report so long as the headline number manages to hit a sweet spot, one that is cool enough to justify a September rate cut, but not so weak as to add to recession fears. Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge puts an \"ideal\" range that fulfills those two requirements between 70,000 and 95,000.\nThe August jobs report will also be heavily scrutinized for another reason. It will be the first after the poor jobs data and accompanying revisions last month prompted President Donald Trump to fire the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner. It's a decision that has spurred fears of government overreach and cast doubt over federal economic data.\nTrump nominated conservative economist E.J. Antoni to be the new head of the BLS. William Wiatrowski is acting commissioner until Antoni is confirmed.\nMarket reaction\nThe stock market could come under pressure if the jobs figure is outside of the expected range from traders. Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, worries a downside surprise is coming in the jobs data, one that will ding markets. Just not quite yet.\nThe economist, who is projecting nonfarm payrolls growth of 75,000 in August, said that he expects a negative jobs number will come in the second half of the year at some point. He said it's possible that the weak number could even come Friday.\nKKM Financial investment chief Jeff Kilburg worries Friday's jobs data could come in stronger than expected, given the low expectations heading into the report, and that could boost interest rates and reduce the chances the Fed cuts as many times as expected this year. Many traders are hoping for three rate cuts between now and year's end.\nUltimately, Wall Street is hoping for greater clarity on the labor market, one that is alarming some who have noted companies are abstaining from hiring or firing workers in a troubling pattern.\n\"Is this just a case of, sort of, a 'low hires, low fires,' kind of stagnant labor market, or is there some real deterioration that's starting to unfold?\" said John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Growth Innovators ETF. \"And historically, when the labor market has started to deteriorate, it has a tendency to quickly deteriorate further.\"\nADP's private employment report, which can sometimes be a precursor to the official figures that follow, was weaker-than expected on Thursday, but within a comfortable range that didn't panic markets. It showed an addition of just 54,000 private payrolls last month. The stock market gained on Thursday following the figures.", "content_hash": "5b4ebfbdb7ab64f3570f9c035031b511", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona, introduced a bill on Thursday — titled the You Earn It, You Keep it Act — to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits. A House version of the bill was introduced by Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minnesota, in April.\nGallego's bill would permanently eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits.\nIt would also expand the Social Security payroll tax to apply to annual earnings over $250,000. Currently, the maximum earnings subject to Social Security payroll taxes is $176,100 in 2025. Consequently, high earners may only pay into the program for part of the year.\n\"Despite decades of paying into the system, seniors are still forced to pay taxes on their hard-earned benefits — all while the ultra wealthy barely pay into the system,\" Gallego said in a statement.\nHow Social Security benefits are taxed\nSocial Security recipients may owe federal income taxes on their benefits depending on their income.\nHow much they may owe is based on a formula known as combined income — the sum of adjusted gross income, tax-exempt interest income and half of Social Security benefits.\nUp to 50% of benefits may be taxed for individual tax filers with between $25,000 and $34,000 in combined income, or married couples who file jointly with between $32,000 and $44,000.\nUp to 85% of benefits may be taxable for individuals with more than $34,000 in combined income or couples with more than $44,000.\nHow the 'big beautiful' tax law helps seniors\nRepublicans' new \"big beautiful\" law includes a new senior deduction aimed at helping to defray the effects of federal taxes on Social Security benefits.\nAdults aged 65 and over may be able to claim an additional deduction of up to $6,000.\nWhether beneficiaries will benefit from the change will depend on their income.\nThe full deduction will be available to individual taxpayers with up to $75,000 in modified adjusted gross income or married couples with up to $150,000. The deduction will gradually phase out for taxpayers with incomes above those thresholds.\nThe temporary deduction — which will be in effect for tax years 2025 through 2028 — will be available to eligible taxpayers regardless of whether they take the standard deduction or itemize their returns.\nMiddle-income taxpayers stand to benefit the most from the policy, according to tax experts, since low earners may already be exempt from federal taxes on benefits and higher earners will be above the phaseout thresholds.\nHow 'You Earn It, You Keep It' may affect Social Security\nUnlike the temporary senior deduction recently signed into law, Gallego's You Earn It, You Keep It proposal would eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits for all beneficiaries.\nTo be sure, it remains to be seen whether it may get enough support to become law.\nThe proposal does have the support of The Senior Citizens League, a nonpartisan senior advocacy group that is petitioning Congress to stop taxing Social Security benefits. Eliminating federal taxes on Social Security benefits is a \"commonsense step to ensure older Americans can keep more of what they've earned,\" Senior Citizens League Executive Director Shannon Benton said in a statement.\nEfforts to change the federal taxation of Social Security benefits come as the program is facing a trust fund shortfall. Benefits may be reduced within the next decade unless Congress enacts changes sooner, according to projections from Social Security's trustees.\nBecause the \"big beautiful\" law did not include any offsets for the reduced revenue from federal taxes on benefits, it would accelerate the depletion dates, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\nIn contrast, the You Earned It, You Keep It proposal would extend the Social Security trust funds' ability to pay benefits in full and on time for 24 years, or until 2058, according to Gallego's office. That matches an analysis of Craig's House proposal by Social Security's chief actuary in April.", "content_hash": "c9191b29aba6f9e461228cb296b7877b", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

He pointed to the deals available at the Excalibur, one of MGM's resorts on the Las Vegas Strip: $85 rooms, including resort fee; $5 tables; $5 beers.

And the industry as a whole is facing some troubling obstacles.\nCanadian visitation to the U.S. has plummeted some 40% this year, following comments by President Donald Trump about Canada as a potential 51st U.S. state and evolving trade policies. The Canadian dollar has also weakened, lessening the buying power of visitors crossing the border into the U.S.\nHornbuckle also pointed to massive price hikes for a U.S. visa, from $100 to $350, where a family of four visiting for the Ryder Cup, World Cup or Olympics in 2028, for example, could pay $1,400 for visa documents alone.\n\"International travel in 2016 had a $50 billion U.S. surplus. Today it's a $50 billion deficit,\" Hornbuckle said.\nThe government's commitment to funding marketing and promotion of U.S. travel was also slashed by 80% in the most recent spending bill, to $20 million.\n\"We obviously find ourselves in a world that has a fair amount of uncertainty from a macroeconomic perspective, from a socio-political perspective,\" Marriott CEO Tony Capuano told investors at the BofA conference Thursday. \"Marriott, and the sector more broadly, thrives in times of certainty and stability. So that creates some measure of challenge.\"\nCapuano said there's been a slight uptick after Labor Day in some segments of travel. He said Marriott sees spending restrained in budget travelers and small businesses. But he described demand for luxury travel as \"sturdy.\"\nWyndham Hotel and Resorts CEO Geoff Ballotti laid out an optimistic view of the travel industry, noting robust demand for extended stay, driven in part by projects supporting the government's infrastructure spending.\n\"You're seeing incredible interest in investment right now,\" Ballotti told CNBC. \"Our new construction pipeline, 20 consecutive quarters of growth, is at an all-time high.

Unlike traditional computers, which store their data in binary bits of zeros and ones, quantum computers can store those zeros and ones simultaneously in \"qubits.\" That difference enables them to process larger amounts of data at much faster speeds -- which makes them well-suited for crunching massive amounts of information for AI applications.\nTwo popular quantum computing stocks are Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT 1.44%), also known as QCi, and IonQ (IONQ 2.73%). Over the past 12 months, QCi's stock surged nearly 2,280% as IonQ's stock rallied more than 510%.\nLet's see which of these high-flying stocks is a better play on the quantum computing and AI markets.\nThe differences between QCi and IonQ\nQuantum computers are much faster than traditional servers and mainframes, but they're bigger, pricier, consume more power, and output a higher percentage of errors. To resolve those issues, companies like QCi and IonQ are developing new technologies that could make quantum processing units (QPUs) smaller, cheaper, and more scalable.\nMost quantum computers are powered by ions (individually charged atoms), electrons (subatomic particles with a negative charge), or photons (particles of light). In ion-driven systems, ions are trapped in electromagnetic fields and manipulated with lasers. In electron-driven systems, electrons are sped up in \"superconducting loops\" to process data. In photon-driven systems, light particles are used to transmit the data.\nQCi develops photonic chips, which operate at room temperature and can be produced at conventional chip fabs. It doesn't build any of its own quantum systems, but it provides a cloud-based platform for simulations.\nIonQ produces \"trapped ion\" chips, builds its own systems (its older Aria system, its flagship Forte system, its data center-oriented Forte Enterprise system, and its upcoming Tempo system), and provides its own cloud-based services. But unlike photonic systems, ion-driven systems still require moderate cooling.\nMeanwhile, electron-driven superconducting systems, like the ones produced by IBM and Rigetti Computing, can only function in cryogenic environments. That makes them the most expensive to maintain, but those chips are also the easiest to mass-produce with existing lithography technologies.\nWhich of these companies has a brighter future?\nQCi only started manufacturing and delivering its first photonics chips this year, so the technology remains in its infancy. So, while the idea of quantum chips functioning at room temperature sounds disruptive, it hasn't proven that its business model is sustainable yet. Its main customers are still small design firms and research institutions.\nFor 2025, analysts expect QCI to generate just $400,000 in revenue with a net loss of $39 million. But by 2027, they expect its revenue to more than quadruple to $1.85 billion with a net loss of $44 million as it scales up production of its photonic chips, rolls out its own Dirac-3 quantum system, and expands its Qatalyst cloud platform.\nIonQ's business is more mature. From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect its revenue to surge from $43 million to $315 million as its ion-driven systems are adopted across more industries. But they still expect its annual net loss to widen from $332 million to $552 million.\nFor now, IonQ is focused on increasing its total quantum computing power, which it measures in algorithmic qubits (AQ). It expects that figure to soar from 64-100 AQ in 2025 to 100-256 AQ in 2026, 10,000 AQ in 2027, 20,000 AQ in 2028, 200,000 AQ in 2029, and 2 million AQ in 2030.\nInvestors should take that ambitious outlook with a grain of salt, but IonQ hit its previous long-term AQ targets before. Its ongoing efforts to shrink the width of its QPUs with its trapped ion technology (from a few feet to a few inches) -- could support that explosive growth spurt. It's also been integrating Nvidia's CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) parallel computing platform into its own quantum systems to support a broader range of AI applications.\nThe better buy: IonQ\nQCi's photonics technology is promising, but its stock is already valued at more than 1,300 times its projected revenue for 2027. That meme stock valuation makes it a dangerous stock to own, and it could easily crash if it struggles to scale up its business. IonQ is also speculative, but it looks more reasonably valued at just over 40 times its estimated sales for 2027. Therefore, it's smarter to stick with IonQ than to pay a sky-high premium for QCi's potential growth.", "content_hash": "2b16fdef75818ede5a416d22c8f6be2e", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

That implies 122% upside from its current share price of $90.\nHere's what investors should know about CoreWeave.\nBulls say CoreWeave is a leading provider of cloud AI services\nCoreWeave provides cloud infrastructure and software services purpose built for artificial intelligence (AI), and its data centers exclusively use Nvidia GPUs. SemiAnalysis recently ranked CoreWeave as the best AI cloud on the market, awarding it a higher score than Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform. That praise reflects two competitive advantages.\nFirst, CoreWeave is frequently the first cloud platform to bring new chips to market because of its longstanding relationship with Nvidia. For instance, the company was the first to deploy Nvidia H100 and H200 systems, and it more recently became the first company to deploy Nvidia GB200 and GB300 systems. Early access to the latest technologies is a compelling reason to work with CoreWeave.\nSecond, CoreWeave often achieves top results at the MLPerf benchmarks, standardized tests that measure artificial intelligence systems across training and inference use cases. The company says its infrastructure and software expertise results in up to 20% higher GPU cluster performance than alternative solutions.\nCoreWeave reported tremendous demand in the second quarter. Revenue soared 207% to $1.2 billion and non-GAAP operating income increased 135% to $200 million. In addition, the company said its revenue backlog increased 86% because of expanded deals with OpenAI and an unnamed hyperscale company (possibly Google).\nBears say CoreWeave has a capital-intensive business model\nCoreWeave currently operates 33 data centers across the United States and Europe, with at least two more under construction, one in Pennsylvania and another in New Jersey. But operating data centers, especially when those data centers are filled with AI infrastructure, is very expensive.\nSo CoreWeave has taken on substantial debt. And while the company says it has done so responsibly -- never taking on debt unless a signed contract creates a need for additional infrastructure, and only if the contract covers the entire cost of the debt -- the interest payments associated with its debt are already cutting deeply into profitability.\nAs mentioned, CoreWeave said adjusted operating income increased 135% to $200 million in the second quarter. But that number excludes interest expense. When accounting for those costs, the company reported an adjusted net loss of $131 million, a much stepper loss than $5 million in the same quarter last year.\nImportantly, CoreWeave plans to unlock cost efficiencies by acquiring longtime partner Core Scientific, an infrastructure company that owns nine U.S. data centers. Management says the deal, expected to close in the fourth quarter, will eliminate more than $10 billion in future lease overhead, and result in additional annual cost savings of $500 million by the end of 2027.\nHowever, some analysts have raised questions about the terms of the all-stock deal, which stipulate Core Scientific stockholders get 0.1235 shares of CoreWeave for every share of Core Scientific. Those terms valued Core Scientific at $9 billion when the deal was announced. But CoreWeave stock has since dropped 44%.\nThe risk here is shareholder dilution. CoreWeave will probably have to renegotiate deal with a higher exchange ratio to account for the sharp decline in its own stock. In that scenario, current shareholders would be diluted even more extensively than under the original terms.\nCoreWeave trades at a reasonable valuation, but the stock is likely to be volatile\nCoreWeave shares have advanced 125% since its March IPO, but the stock has also fallen 44% from the record high it reached in July. Currently, shares trade at 10 times sales, a very reasonable multiple for a company whose revenue is forecast to increase at 127% annually through 2026.\nHowever, CoreWeave is not expected to be profitable until at least 2027, which means the stock is likely to be volatile in the interim. Only patient investors comfortable with that risk should consider buying this AI stock, and they should start with a very small position.", "content_hash": "a611886bb7ac0b8e075cbe6451f78cab", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The ruling, for instance, leaves intact the multibillion-dollar arrangement that makes Google the default on Apple devices -- a high-margin revenue stream that investors in the iPhone-maker have worried could be curtailed.\nThe market's read-through was simple: Alphabet's win reduces uncertainty for Apple, which reportedly receives around tens of billions of dollars annually from Alphabet to keep Google Search as the default on Safari. Those traffic-acquisition payments have long been a quiet but meaningful contributor to Apple's Services economics, so clarity on their continuation helps sentiment toward the stock.\nFor context, Alphabet shares also rose on the news, underscoring how central these agreements are across the ecosystem.\nApple investors can now pivot from \"Will the deal be killed?\" to \"What does Apple's business look like with the deal preserved?\"\nAdding to Apple's momentum\nThis news just adds to a growing bull case for Apple stock.\nThe tech company's most recent quarter -- fiscal Q3 -- was solid. Revenue rose 10% to $94 billion and earnings per share (EPS) increased 12% to $1.57 -- both June-quarter records. Capturing some of the quarter's key catalysts, Apple's services revenue reached an all-time high and iPhone posted double-digit growth.\nWith this legal overhang behind the company, investors can begin giving more weight to Apple's financial momentum in their analysis. The concern was big enough that it even came up in Apple's most recent earnings call. CEO Tim Cook explicitly conditioned Apple's forward-looking \"color\" on assumptions that \"the current revenue-share agreement with Google continues.\" That's unusually direct language for Apple, indicating the deal's materiality to near-term planning.\nInvestors don't need to model precise dollars to grasp the takeaway: the high-margin engine just avoided a forced reset. Apple's services business mix boasts higher margins than its hardware sales, so preserving the Google payments stabilizes a line item that helps EPS compounding. For the nine months ended June 28, for instance, Apple's services gross margin was 75% -- more than twice its hardware gross margin of 37%.\nWhy this week's ruling matters from here\nNear-term, the decision removes a key bear argument around Apple's services segment's durability. If you believed a ban on default payments would hit high-margin revenue and compress the multiple, that tail risk just faded. Wedbush called the outcome a \"monster win\" for Apple and a \"home run\" for Google -- language that captures why both stocks rallied, even if investors should still track any negotiated tweaks that emerge.\nOf course, with Apple stock rising sharply in recent weeks, valuation is more of a concern. Apple trades at a premium on trailing earnings -- about 36 times earnings as of this writing -- which means upside depends more on execution than multiple expansion from here. However, with the company's iPhone and services segments growing nicely, a clean balance sheet, and steady capital returns, shares still look attractive. But the market will need to see continued momentum in Apple's important services business.\nThe bigger picture for long-term holders is straightforward. This week's ruling kept a high-margin revenue source intact and aligned with what management had assumed on the third-quarter earnings call, reinforcing the base case for EPS growth. There are still risks. Appeal risk and Google's new data-sharing requirements, for instance, add some noise. But Apple now faces that future with one less black cloud and with fundamentals doing their part.", "content_hash": "af65fb1c66e752a6e82c2e347063dc39", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Each has a powerful commerce engine, a fast-growing cloud platform, and a significant opportunity in AI infrastructure and applications.\nBut when you strip away headlines and focus on the operating results and the playbook for the next few years, one option stands out as the clear winner.\nAmazon: broad-based, profitable growth\nAmazon's latest quarter showed healthy top-line growth and strong profit execution. Revenue rose double digits, with both its North America and international year-over-year growth rates in top-line revenue accelerating significantly, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) expanding at a rate of nearly 18% year over year. Operating income climbed sharply as the company continues to drive efficiency across fulfillment and cloud. It's the kind of combination long-term investors want: growth with expanding earnings power.\nFurthermore, AWS's momentum and scale are extraordinary. The cloud-computing business's annualized revenue run rate is now just over $123 billion. The business has powerful momentum in AI. For generative AI solutions, specifically, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in its second-quarter earnings call that it is growing sales by a triple-digit year-over-year percentage and has \"more demand than we have supplied for at the moment.\"\nHighlighting the benefit of Amazon's scale, the cloud computing segment's operating margin remains robust -- at 32.9% (adjusted to exclude the impact of foreign exchange headwinds) in Q2 -- even as Amazon steps up investment in data centers, networking, and accelerators to meet AI demand.\nMeanwhile, Amazon's online store segment, where the company records e-commerce sales, grew by 11% year over year in Q2 -- up from 5% growth in Q1. Similarly, the company's high-margin advertising business clearly accelerated because Amazon's other revenue segment, which primarily consists of advertising sales, grew 19% year over year in Q2 -- up from a growth rate of 4% in Q1.\nAlibaba: A cheaper valuation -- but for a reason\nAlibaba's latest quarter gave investors a clear (and bullish) data point: accelerated cloud growth and the stock ripped higher. Revenue in its cloud intelligence segment rose 26% year over year, powered by an eighth quarter in a row of triple-digit year-over-year growth in AI-related product revenue.\nThe overall picture of Alibaba's business, however, is more nuanced. Total revenue increased just 2% year over year, or 10% when excluding sales in the year-ago quarter from recently sold businesses. Further, Alibaba's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITDA) fell 14% year over year as the e-commerce and cloud-computing company leaned into what it calls \"quick commerce,\" or ultra-fast delivery, broader user experience investments, and AI. These heavy investments also meant that free cash flow went from positive in the year-ago quarter to negative.\nA clear winner\nBoth stocks could end up being long-term winners. But Amazon ultimately offers the better risk-reward.\nAlibaba is cheaper on traditional valuation multiples (but more expensive than it used to be after its recent sharp move higher) and is returning significant capital via buybacks and dividends. This lower valuation helps make up for the company's lower growth and some of the risks associated with China's weak macroeconomic backdrop. Indeed, given how cheap the stock's valuations is (it currently trades at just 15 times earnings), Alibaba could end up being a bargain in hindsight. But only if China's economy picks up speed and consumer and enterprise spending reaccelerate. If this happens, the upside in the stock price could be massive. But the company still has some things it needs to prove to investors to command a higher valuation multiple; it needs to demonstrate scalability, shown by operating margin expansion and free cash flow improvement, as Alibaba grows. We're not there yet.\nUltimately, Amazon offers the cleaner, more reliable setup. The company has three growth vectors that reinforce one another: retail, advertising, and cloud -- and each of these drivers will likely contribute substantially to Amazon's business in the coming years. Retail keeps getting faster and more convenient, ads help further monetize the company's e-commerce customers, and AWS offers investors a fast-growing, high-margin catalyst for the business. Together, Amazon's broad-based catalyst of scaled and profitable business segments provides investors with more certainty when thinking about the company's long-term potential.\nIf I had to pick just one of these two growth stocks today, I'd choose Amazon -- despite its higher valuation of about 35 times earnings. The operating momentum is better, the AI strategy is tied to an already scaled platform, and the cash generation gives the company room to invest through cycles. Alibaba is investable and improving, but the execution bar (and ultimately the risk) is higher.", "content_hash": "b8f4b83bf1fce8b8abbf9a2dfec34c63", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The president said that those investing in the US could be exempt from new tariffs.\nThe US President sent out a warning about semiconductor tariffs during a dinner at the White House on Thursday, where he hosted a high-powered group of tech executives.\nThe president has been vocal about wanting to see substantial domestic investment from big tech companies. Trump said that he would soon impose “fairly substantial” tariffs on semiconductor imports, but noted that companies relocating their manufacturing to the US could see their products exempted from the next levy.\n“We’ll be putting a tariff very shortly. You probably are hearing we’ll be putting a fairly substantial tariff,\" the president said, adding that it concerns companies that do not shift production to the US.\n“We’ll be putting tariffs on companies that aren’t coming in,” Trump said. He also mentioned the Apple CEO by name, saying that, regarding the new levies, \"Tim Cook would be in pretty good shape.\"\nNew tariffs for semiconductor imports\nIn August, the US President already talked about imposing a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports during an event with Apple CEO Tim Cook. The tech giant pledged to make an additional $100 billion (€85.7bn) investment in domestic manufacturing at the time, on top of a previously approved $500bn (€428.5bn).\nDuring the dinner at the White House on Thursday, the likes of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Apple CEO Tim Cook found themselves as the centre of attention when Trump asked guests around the table how much they were investing in the country.\nMeta's Mark Zuckerberg, who sat to Trump's right, said $600bn (€514.2bn), Apple's Tim Cook quoted the same and Google's Sundar Pichai promised $250bn (€214.2bn).\n“What about Microsoft?” Trump said. “That's a big number.”\nCEO Satya Nadella said it was up to $80bn (€68.6bn) per year.\n“Good,” Trump responded. “Very good.”\nNotably absent from the guest list was Elon Musk.

Based on estimates from Mordor Intelligence, the global retail industry will grow from an estimated $27.3 trillion this year to about $36.9 trillion by the turn of the decade.\nWith an addressable market this massive, it should come as no surprise that retail is one of the most competitive industries on the planet. However, there are a handful of retail standouts, including e-commerce giant Amazon, superstore chain Walmart, and of course warehouse club Costco Wholesale (COST 0.64%).\nWhile Amazon and Walmart have (mostly) grown their respective businesses traditionally, Costco is the oddball of the bunch. It's known for its quirky deals, such as the $1.50 hot-dog combo for members, generous return policy, and its penchant for selling one-of-a-kind and unexpected items, such as gold bars and luxury jewelry.\nCostco's 79.6 million paying members, as of the end of the fiscal third quarter (May 11, 2025), have come to expect these perks and surprises. But a new rule is a complete game-changer for many of its paying cardholders.\nCostco's executive members just earned a lucrative new perk\nTo shop in one of Costco's more than 900 warehouse locations, you'll need a membership. Approximately 42 million of its paid membership are gold star and business level, which each carry a $65 annual cost. The remaining 37.6 million are executive level, which carries twice the annual cost ($130), but also lays on the perks.\nAccording to Costco, its executive members can earn up to 2% back on most purchases totaling up to $1,250 annually, as well as receive a monthly credit of $10 for eligible delivery orders topping $150. Executive cardholders may also qualify for discounts on Costco travel packages.\nThe reason the company caters to this group is because they're responsible for the bulk of net sales. Despite accounting for \"just\" 47% of total memberships, executive cardholders were responsible for approximately 73% of sales during the fiscal third quarter. Keeping these folks happy and sustaining annual renewal rates above 90% is key to Costco's success.\nBut a newly announced perk for executive members, which was unveiled in June but only fully implemented earlier this week, is bound to turn heads.\nOn June 11, Costco revealed plans to allow its executive cardholders exclusive shopping hours seven days a week in its more than 600 U.S. warehouses. On weekdays and Sundays, only executive members will be allowed to enter its warehouses from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., with this exclusive shopping window narrowed to 30 minutes (9 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.) on Saturdays. Though this policy technically went into effect at the end of June, there had been a two-month grace period where gold star and business members were allowed in. This isn't the case any longer.\nWhile some non-executive members have expressed frustration with this new policy, it's a smart move by Costco to put the proverbial carrot at the end of the stick and encourage existing gold star and business members to upgrade.\nMembership fees are a key ingredient to Costco's competitive edge\nThough membership fees aren't the only factor responsible for making Costco such a successful growth stock and phenomenal multidecade investment, they play an undeniably important role.\nGroceries act as the primary lure responsible for getting people into Costco's warehouses. However, food and beverages traditionally sport razor-thin margins. Since membership fees flow almost entirely to Costco's bottom line, they can be used as something of a buffer to offset the minuscule margins tied to groceries.\nArguably even more important, membership fees afford Costco a pricing buffer. Management understands fully that members of all levels expect various perks, including prices on most groceries that'll undercut traditional mom and pop shops and national grocery chains. The membership fees Costco receives are one of the reasons it can keep prices on basic need goods so comparatively low. It's something of a repeating cycle that works in the company's favor.\nCostco Wholesale's size shouldn't be overlooked, either. When a company has deep pockets, it's often able to buy products in bulk, which reduces the per-unit cost for each item. These lower costs can then be passed along to its members as a key perk to shopping in its warehouses.\nEven though cardholders are likely heading to Costco for groceries and other household necessities, it only takes a handful of higher-margin discretionary purchases for the company to benefit. It also doesn't hurt when members buy Costco's private-label brand, Kirkland Signature, which tends to boast premium margins, relative to comparable products.\nThere's no denying this formula works. Just over 90% of its worldwide customers renewed their memberships, based on fiscal third-quarter data, with an even higher 92.7% renewal rate in the U.S. and Canada. It also boasts exceptional membership pricing power, with the number of paid memberships growing following a fee increase on Sept. 1, 2024.\nThere's a reason investors have been paying a traditionally head-scratching (for a retail company) forward-year earnings multiple of 47 to buy shares of Costco stock. Given its array of competitive advantages, and the exceptional loyalty of its shoppers, there's a good likelihood this new perk is going to mint even more executive level cardholders in the quarters that lie ahead.", "content_hash": "cda69b4754487e45f02c700f686e0666", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

I just wanted to talk about the AI business, specifically the XPU. When you said you're going to grow significantly faster than what you had thought a quarter ago, what's changed? Is it just the impressive prospect moving to a customer definition, or is it stronger demand across the existing three customers? A: I think it's both. But to a large extent, it's the fourth customer that we now add to our roster, which we will ship pretty strongly in 2026. So a combination of increasing volumes from existing three customers and the addition of a fourth customer with immediate and substantial demand really changes our outlook for 2026.\nQ: Near term, from the cyclical bottom, how should we think about the magnitude of the cyclical upturn in the non-AI semiconductor business? Are you seeing continued order improvements in the non-AI segment, which would point to continued cyclical recovery into next fiscal year? A: From a year-on-year Q4 guidance, we are actually up slightly. The only consistent trend we've seen over the last three quarters that is moving up strongly is broadband. Non-AI semiconductor is slow to recover, and Q4 year-on-year is maybe low single digit. I'm expecting to see more of a U-shaped recovery in non-AI, perhaps by late mid '26, late '26.\nQ: Can you help us quantify what is the new fiscal '26 AI guidance? And do you expect the custom versus networking mix to stay broadly what it has been this past year or evolve more towards custom? A: We are expecting and seeing 2026 to accelerate more than the growth rate we see in '25. Regarding the mix, as we gain more experience among four customers, the networking percentage of the pool will be a declining percentage going into '26.\nQ: Could you give some color on the $110 billion backlog? How much of that is AI versus non-AI versus software? A: We generally don't break up backlog, but it's largely driven by AI in terms of growth. Software continues to add steadily, and non-AI has grown double digits. Fully 50% of it at least is semiconductors, and it's fair to say that semiconductor piece is much more AI than non-AI.\nQ: How is the dialogue going beyond these four customers? Are you hearing from others, and how is the trend going with the other three prospects? A: We have identified seven prospects, four of which are now customers. We are very picky and careful about who qualifies, and we may see one more prospect. But right now, for sure, we have seven, and that is pretty much what we have.", "content_hash": "e66039ced60cfdbe0939fcd855381170", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

A quick look at the world's most valuable companies shows that nine of the top 10 are pioneers in AI, all jockeying for a shot at the title.\nNvidia recently made headlines by becoming the world's first $4 trillion company and currently clocks in at $4.1 trillion. Microsoft and Apple are close on its heels, with market caps of $3.7 trillion and $3.5 trillion, respectively. Rounding out the top five are Alphabet and Amazon, worth $2.7 trillion and $2.4 trillion, respectively.\nWith a current market cap of just $372 billion, it may seem premature to suggest that Palantir Technologies (PLTR 0.79%) could soar 169% to earn its place in the $1 trillion club. Yet while many companies are still working to comprehend this paradigm shift, Palantir is helping businesses profit from AI and enriching shareholders along the way.\nDecades of AI expertise\nYears before the company went public, Palantir had been toiling away on advanced AI algorithms for defense and intelligence agencies within the U.S. government. In recent years, the company has also focused on enterprise software that saves businesses time and money.\nBut it was Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform that catapulted the company to AI stardom, as the system leverages generative AI to develop real-time solutions to company-specific problems.\nThe two biggest stumbling blocks to adopting AI are knowing exactly where to begin and getting a solid return on investment (ROI). Palantir was able to solve both of those challenges with a simple strategy.\nPalantir invites developers and business leaders to attend \"boot camps,\" or workshops that show AIP in action. During these interactive sessions, users work side-by-side with Palantir engineers to develop solutions to their real-world business problems.\nThis strategy is a clear winner. In the second quarter, Palantir's revenue of $1 billion climbed 48% year over year and 14% sequentially. The star of the show was its U.S. commercial revenue, which surged 93% to $306 million, representing nearly 31% of total revenue, fueled by ongoing demand for AIP. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.16, which surged 78%.\nThe segment ended the quarter with contract value of $843 million, up 222% year over year. This helped drive Palantir's remaining performance obligation (RPO) -- or contractually obligated sales that aren't yet included in revenue -- up a whopping 77% to $2.4 billion.\nPalantir also boosted its full-year guidance, forecasting at least 85% growth for the U.S. commercial segment (namely AIP) for 2025, up from its previous outlook for 68% growth.\nThe path to $1 trillion\nPalantir's decades of experience and its groundbreaking AI solutions have created a windfall for shareholders, and there could be much more to come.\nAccording to Wall Street, Palantir is expected to generate sales of $4.1 billion in 2025, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of about 89 (not a typo). Assuming its P/S remains constant, Palantir would have to generate revenue of more than $11 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap.\nWall Street is forecasting annual revenue growth of 38.7% for Palantir over the next five years. If the company is able to grow at that pace, it could reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2028. But if Palantir's sales and profit growth continue to accelerate, it could achieve that benchmark even sooner.\nI'm not the only one who thinks so. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has run the models and calculated that Palantir's market cap could hit $1 trillion sometime in 2027 or 2028. Ives argues that investors focused solely on valuation have missed \"every transformational tech stock over the past 20 years.\" He goes on to say that AI will be the driving factor behind Palantir's success.\nPalantir's operational and financial trajectory seems to back up that assertion, as the company continues to announce new and larger customer wins and its sales and profits continue to accelerate.\nEvery rose has its thorns\nLest there be any doubt, and as promising as Palantir is, there are also plenty of things that could go wrong. The development of AI could stall, the economy could hit a rough patch, or Palantir could fail to capitalize on the tremendous opportunity that is AI -- and any of these could send the stock careening lower. Let's not forget the company's valuation, which is extreme, to say the least.\nPalantir is currently selling for 66 times next year's sales and 184 times next year's earnings. History shows that the higher the multiple, the more extreme the volatility, and Palantir isn't immune. Investors should prepare themselves for significant stock price movements, which aren't for the faint of heart.\nEstimates abound for the potential of generative AI, but the software opportunity alone is intriguing. Cathie Wood, founder and CEO of Ark Investment Management, suggests that if software purveyors are able to capture 10% of the value created by their AI-focused products, it could generate as much as $14 trillion in revenue in 2030.\nIf Palantir continues along its current trajectory, helping companies drive positive ROI for their AI spending -- and I believe it can -- it could achieve a $1 trillion market cap sooner than many expect.", "content_hash": "dbb9de435376779d026bc8e18dbf2f4e", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Apple’s marquee iPhones accounted for a majority of the sales, and demand for MacBook computers also surged.\nThe outsized jump — which hasn’t been previously reported — is a boost for the Cupertino, California-based company at a time it’s grappling with plateauing mobile device sales around the world. While India represents still a fraction of its overall business, the company is investing in a country it expects to become a key market in coming years.\nThat’s particularly important given volatile consumption in and geopolitical uncertainty around China, today its largest overseas base. Revenue from China gained 4.4% in the June quarter — but that was only its first rise in two years, and it’s lost market share there to local rivals like Xiaomi Corp.\nRead: Apple’s China Comeback Fueled by Mac Sales, iPhone Upgrades\nApple did not respond to requests for comment.\nAs part of its retail push in India, Apple just added two new stores in the cities of Bangalore and Pune this week. It’s also is planning to launch a new outlet in Noida, on the outskirts of Delhi, and another in Mumbai early next year.\nThe US company in 2023 reshuffled management of its international businesses, making India its own sales region due to the growth potential the market offers with its rising incomes and a burgeoning middle class. IPhones, viewed by many Indians as a status symbol, currently account for about 7% of the local smartphone market, according to Tarun Pathak of Counterpoint Research.\nIndia’s local sourcing requirements prevented Apple from opening its iconic stores in the South Asian nation for years. As the policy eased, Apple finally launched its online store in India in 2020. Apple’s Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook then inaugurated the first two stores in India, respectively located in the financial hub of Mumbai and capital New Delhi, in 2023.

The style is approachable yet thorough, moving from qualitative excitement to quantitative rigor with DCFs, reverse DCFs, and growth scenarios. It’s a good example of how to mix story-driven optimism with concrete numbers, giving us readers both a reason to believe and a valuation anchor.\n💡 Why we like it: This narrative takes a big, sprawling story and makes it digestible by weaving together IREN’s mining roots, efficiency metrics, and emerging AI ambitions into one clear thread. It’s a strong example of blending industry context with forward-looking projections, all while anchoring the analysis around the big question — does IREN offer enough outperformance over simply holding Bitcoin?\n💡 Why we like it: Mandelman’s catalysts for Cadeler are supported with concrete numbers, while the risks are acknowledged in plain terms. The narrative update strengthens the piece by showing how new results feed directly into revised growth and margin assumptions, which are a nice example of process discipline.

The goal is to give high net worth investors access to private funds, primarily in private equity, that aren't typically among the options offered by most wealth managers. In other words, it's finding even more exclusive opportunities in an already exclusive market.\nREAD MORE:\nSeparately,\nMeanwhile,\nAll in for alts\nThe firms' announcements\nWhatever the pitfalls, numerous surveys and reports suggest investor demand for alternatives is running high. The investment bank Robert A. Stanger reported in January that $122 billion was raised for alts from everyday \"retail\" investors in 2024, topping the previous high of $105 billion set in 2022.\nMeanwhile Bank of America Private Bank found last year that demand for alternatives is particularly strong among investors between the ages of 21 and 43. Drawing on results from a\nThat cohort's allocation is already higher than older clients' — 17% of their total portfolios vs. 5% for investors 44 and older. And they want more.\nMerrill and Bank of America Private Bank's offering for the ultrarich\nBank of America Private Bank and Merrill is among the many large wealth managers scrambling to meet this demand with an array of new products and offerings. Its Alts Expanded Access Program for investors with $50 million or more \"will be supplemental to the core alternative platform that we already have, and ultimately, it'll allow us to bring more offerings to market than we do today,\" said Mark Sutterlin, head of alternative investments.\nSutterlin said Merrill and the private bank are working with a third-party firm — which he declined to name — to find harder-to-access private investments that may be of interest to ultrahigh net worth clients.\nSometimes these opportunities will come with smaller-than-usual capacity allotments, meaning the percentage of a fund set aside for investors at a particular institution. Also unlike standard investments in private equity, the offerings will allow investors to become limited partners in the funds they're putting money into. As a result, they will have greater responsibility for vetting the various opportunities they're presented with. Sutterlin said that doesn't mean Merill and the private bank are abandoning their fiduciary duties to investors. Ultimately, he said, and that they will still be responsible for making sure anything they recommend is in their clients' best interests.\n\"But I would say that the ability for investors to do independent diligence, and the expectation that these investors are going to have more experience in private markets and a higher level of expertise in terms of private market investing, is part of what allows us to do a broader based offering for these types of funds,\" Sutterlin said.\nSutterlin said advisors at Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank are now learning about the Alts Expanded Access Program and they'll begin to introduce clients to funds through it starting this fall. He said there are no plans now to offer it to investors below the $50 million asset threshold.\nGoldman and the push to allow alts in retirement plans\nElsewhere, though, a movement is afoot to bring more of the so-called mass affluent into private and alternative markets — and it's\nPresident Donald Trump\nThe order provoked an outcry. American Retirement Association CEO Brian Graff argued that fiduciaries, not the government, should be the ones deciding if an investment class is appropriate for plan participants.\n\"Professional retirement plan fiduciaries that are subject to strict fiduciary standards — not the federal government — are in the best position to assess developments in the financial markets and determine what is in the financial best interest of retirement plan participants and beneficiaries,\" Graff said in a statement in response to Trump's executive order.\nDee Sawyer, head of global distribution at T. Rowe Price, said the target date funds are still being designed for release by the middle of next year so it's hard to say now exactly what strategies they will employ.\n\"Everybody is unique, but at different points in time, you can have an exposure to different types of solutions, including private markets, and we think that there's opportunities to have that across the spectrum,\" Sawyer said.\nSawyer said she and her colleagues at T. Rowe Price welcomed Trump's order calling on the DOL to reconsider its fiduciary guidelines for private investments in retirement plans.\n\"And the reason for that is because it allows more plan sponsors the ability to offer these solutions from a fiduciary perspective, without a concern of litigation risk, which is a real concern of plan sponsors,\" she said.\nMeanwhile,\nGreg Wilson, head of retirement for\n\"Companies are staying private longer,\" Wilson said. \"So when you look at private equity returns over a 10-, 15- and 20-year basis, they've outperformed public equity equivalents. Making these available to the primary source of retirement savings today, which is in the 401(k) plan, we think is absolutely appropriate within a professionally managed portfolio.\"\nWells sees the value in simplicity even with complex products\nMeanwhile,\nWells is working with the wealth technology firm InvestCloud to offer UMA clients access not only to alternative markets but trading strategies involving derivatives and long and short positions that can be used to reduce investing risks. Previously, Maddox said, Wells advisors had to manage clients' allocations to private markets separate from all their other investments.\nBy bringing it all into one system, advisors should have an easier time with tasks like rebalancing — or buying and selling assets to make sure they maintain a certain proportion to each other in a portfolio. To be included in the UMA, alternative investments and other products also can't charge clients separate sales commissions; everything has to be paid for using a simple fee.\n\"This just makes it very simple for advisors and clients to understand where it's just one account wrap fee,\" Maddox said.\n\"This consolidation of different investment product types into one platform, one program, one advisory relationship, is an industry trend,\" he added. \"I think that will continue. We'll start to see everything kind of collapse into these single-platform sources.\"\nThe biggest barrier to getting into alts\nTo Brian Griggs, the head of portfolio strategy and solutions at the investment management firm Nuveen, the biggest barrier to bringing more regular investors into private markets is a simple lack of understanding. One of Nuveen's lines of business is working with wealth managers at registered investment advisors and other firms and helping them provide opportunities in alternatives and other markets.\nTo better shed light on the benefits but also possible risks of alts, Nuveen has started what it calls its\n\"I would say 5% might be too little,\" Griggs said. \"It might not be worth the extra effort of understanding these assets if you're just going to allocate 5%. But then we also work with some family offices and RIAs that have some of their clients with anywhere up to 50% in private markets.\"\nThe biggest of those factors is an investor's likely need for cash at any given moment. One of the knocks against private investments is that they are often \"illiquid\" — or harder to pull money out of than stocks and bonds.\n\"I think most advisors would say most of their clients don't need 100% of their portfolio in liquid stocks and bonds,\" Griggs said. \"So if you can answer that question with confidence, then all of a sudden it opens up the opportunity to put more of the portfolio in these more diversifying private markets.\"", "content_hash": "ff52bd4a2156c00207f2d1c866bcd60a", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The first product drops next month. Mark Sutterlin, who leads alternative investments for the group, emphasized that exclusivityand the optics of itare becoming more important than ever. Clients will eventually gain direct access to data rooms and fund information, a nod to the institutionalization of private wealth.\nBut this move isn't happening in isolation. Wall Street's biggest players are all repositioning. Goldman Sachs (GS) just committed up to $1 billion to partner with T.

Morgan Stanley has already entered the arena with a fund focused on co-investments and secondaries in the lower-middle market. Across the board, the bar to entry is fallingfrom $50 million down to $5 million, with firms increasingly eyeing the swelling cohort of mass-affluent investors with portfolios in the $1$5 million range.\nWhy now? Institutionspensions, endowments, sovereignsare pulling back. Higher rates have made public markets more attractive and reduced the need to chase illiquid alpha. That's left firms like Apollo (NYSE:APO), Ares (NYSE:ARES), Blackstone (NYSE:BX), and KKR (NYSE:KKR) hunting for new capital. The next frontier? Mini-millionaires. And with competition heating up, firms that can repackage exclusivity for this segmentwhile still maintaining the sheen of institutional rigorcould be the ones pulling ahead.

The move shuts down Citi's last in-house asset management operation and turns the keys over to BlackRockalready managing a large share of Citi's $635 billion client base. Under the deal, BlackRock will take over portfolio management duties for thousands of Citi's high-net-worth clients, while Citi retains advisory control. About 100 staff, including CIO Robert Jasminski, will make the jump. Completion is targeted for year-end.\nThis isn't just another asset management outsourcing. It's a structural bet. Andy Sieg, who joined Citi in 2023 to lead the wealth division, said it bluntly: Citi alone couldn't double the platformit needed BlackRock's global engine to scale. Sieg has spent the past year ripping out complexityexiting the trust admin business, cutting headcount, and dumping legacy platforms. Now, the focus is squarely on mass-affluent flows, global private bank reach, and offering institutional-grade products via Citigold. BlackRock, meanwhile, picks up more than AUM. It gains a global partner with boots in key international marketssomething Rob Fairbairn, BlackRock's vice chair, called a critical edge.\nThe partnership could also pave the way for BlackRock to manage alternative assetsinfra, credit, and beyondfor Citi clients.

This was followed by Fidelity’s FETH, which added $65.8 million, and Grayscale’s lower-fee Mini Trust, which attracted $62.5 million.\nBitwise logged $20.8 million in fresh inflows, while other issuers such as VanEck, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, and Invesco saw no major changes.\nDespite the setback, cumulative inflows across all Ethereum ETFs remain positive at $13.34 billion, with BlackRock accounting for about $13 billion of that total.\nThe surge reverses a trend from August, when Ethereum funds dominated activity. ETH products attracted $3.87 billion in inflows last month compared with $751 million in Bitcoin outflows.\nTrading volumes showed the divergence, with Ethereum ETF activity jumping to $58.3 billion in August, nearly double July’s total, while Bitcoin volumes slipped to $78.1 billion.\nEthereum also posted a new all-time high of $4,953 in August, supported by corporate treasuries holding a combined $119.6 billion of ETH by the end of the month.\nBut September is telling a different story. On August 29, Ethereum ETFs logged $164.6 million in outflows, breaking a five-day inflow streak that had added $1.5 billion.\nCumulative inflows remain positive at $13.34 billion, almost entirely concentrated in BlackRock’s ETHA, which accounts for $13.1 billion. Analysts note Ethereum historically struggles in September, citing $46.5 million in ETF outflows during the same month in 2024.\nBitcoin, by contrast, gained $1.26 billion that September, benefiting from risk-off positioning.\nWhales Scoop Up $620M in Ether as Institutions Boost Exposure\nDespite the latest ETF withdrawals, whale and institutional activity suggest a sustained appetite for Ether.\nLast week, nine large addresses purchased $456.8 million worth of ETH, with five wallets receiving transfers from custodian BitGo and others acquiring coins through Galaxy Digital.\nLookonchain data added that newly created wallets accumulated another 35,948 ETH, worth $164 million, within eight hours, with tokens sourced from FalconX and Galaxy Digital.\nInstitutions are also active. Bitmine received 14,665 ETH worth $65.3 million from Galaxy Digital, while three wallets received 65,662 ETH, valued at $293 million, from FalconX.\nMeanwhile, BlackRock deposited 33,884 ETH, worth $148.6 million, into Coinbase Prime. The activity follows reports that the firm sold $151.4 million in ETH while doubling its Bitcoin purchases, illustrating shifting allocations between the two assets.\nEthereum’s relative strength adds context. Over the past month, Ether has gained 18.5%, while Bitcoin has slipped 6.4%. ETH now trades 6.7% below its record high, while Bitcoin remains more than 10% off its $124,500 all-time high earlier this year\nAnalysts pointed out that some long-term Bitcoin holders are taking profits. A whale who bought BTC in 2013 at $332 recently moved 750 coins, worth $83.3 million, to Binance. On-chain watchers suggested the funds could rotate into Ethereum, echoing earlier transactions where whales sold Bitcoin to buy Ether.\nOne such trade this month saw 670 BTC, worth $76 million, converted into 68,130 ETH valued at $295 million. Another long-dormant address withdrew 6,334 ETH, worth $28 million, from Kraken after years of inactivity.\nBitcoin Consolidates as Binance Futures Volume Hits $2.6 Trillion\nBitcoin (BTC) is trading at $110,778, down 0.7% in the past 24 hours and 1.9% over the week. The asset remains 10.5% below its $124,500 all-time high.\nNotably, over the weekend, BTC dropped to $107,400, its lowest level in seven weeks, before rebounding to $112,000.\nGlassnode data shows the correction cooled the “euphoric phase” that began in mid-August, when 100% of Bitcoin’s supply was in profit.\nSustaining such conditions typically requires strong inflows, which faded by late August. Currently, 90% of supply remains in profit, within the $104,100–$114,300 cost basis range.\nGlassnode noted that a break below $104,100 could trigger another post-ATH drawdown, while a recovery above $114,300 would indicate renewed demand.\nShort-term holders saw profits collapse from above 90% to just 42% during the decline. While the rebound restored profitability to over 60% of their supply, analysts warned that the recovery is fragile.\nGlassnode said only a move above $114,000–$116,000, where 75% of short-term holders would be in profit, could restore confidence for a fresh rally.\nResistance remains heavy in the $111,700–$115,500 zone, which aligns with the 50-day and 100-day simple moving averages.\n“BTC has been consolidating below its previous local range and has failed to retake it,” trader Daan Crypto Trades noted on X, adding that the $107,000 monthly low may not hold if selling pressure intensifies.\nSource: Daan Crypto Trades\nMeanwhile, Binance futures trading surged to a record $2.62 trillion in August, up from $2.55 trillion in July, according to CryptoQuant. The spike reflects heightened volatility, increased hedge fund and institutional participation, and rising open interest.\nAnalysts cautioned that while strong derivatives activity indicates liquidity, futures-driven momentum without stable spot inflows often precedes sharp corrections.\nFor now, Bitcoin remains range-bound, with bulls needing to reclaim $114,000 to confirm a stronger recovery.\n- New ChatGPT AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Avalanche and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana and Pepe by the End of 2025\n- Perplexity AI Predicts the Price of XRP, World Liberty Financial and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Why Is Crypto Down Today? – September 4, 2025\n- XRP Price Prediction: Gaming Giant Expands to XRP Ledger – Shocking Move to $10 Starting Now\n- New ChatGPT AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Avalanche and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana and Pepe by the End of 2025\n- Perplexity AI Predicts the Price of XRP, World Liberty Financial and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Why Is Crypto Down Today? – September 4, 2025\n- XRP Price Prediction: Gaming Giant Expands to XRP Ledger – Shocking Move to $10 Starting Now", "content_hash": "aecc8ce34dfcf2eac1eaa48e377df0bd", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

There are definitely a couple of things that we feel over time will continue to maintain the sustained growth that we’re seeing, we’d like to be a mid-digit-growth company, which is about 5 percent.”\nLike many other brands, Levi’s is more cautious going into the second half, but feeling good about what it can control.\n“We’re very confident about our product offers and our marketing,” Singh said. “There are probably going to be winners and losers as the macroeconomics play out, I think we’ll be in the winners category because we have the product, we have the people, we have the stores and we have great marketing.”\nThat’s a playbook a lot of the big companies are working from.\nStefan Larsson, CEO at PVH Corp., has been rebuilding the approach at the company’s two mega brands: Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger.\n“We lean into the iconic brand love,” Larsson told analysts. “We lean into the biggest and most iconic categories. We put a lot of innovation into the most important products. We amplify it with cut-through campaigns. In Calvin in the second quarter, you saw where we have put innovation into underwear, we’re up 14 percent. Where we have put innovation into new denim, we’re up 19 percent.”\nIt hasn’t always been an easy transition, especially as Calvin Klein looked to centralize its design in New York.\n“Calvin Klein two, three years ago had a completely decentralized product creation,” the CEO said. “So we pulled it together and built global product creation capabilities, same as we already have for Tommy. And we were overconfident — took too many parts of this together in one season. And the team realized that they were on their heels in the middle of a product season, and it had a big negative impact on the gross margin this year. It’s super frustrating.”\nBut he said the company rolled up its sleeves and is now much better set for the long term.\n“There is not a single successful competitor that doesn’t have a global product capability,” Larsson said. “We had to do it, and we hit some turbulence and then we fixed it. But that’s why I wanted to just shout out to say, it was painful to share last quarter. It’s less painful today because we have fixed it.”", "content_hash": "6ff9fb4bc4846e636ce3d09bff986f56", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

PME, another major Dutch fund, is reevaluating a 5 billion mandate with BlackRock, following months of pressure from climate advocacy group Fossil Free Netherlands. The nonprofit's Break with BlackRock campaign has gained momentum, urging savers to push their funds to cut ties with managers perceived to be backtracking on climate stewardship. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) said it offers clients the ability to participate in proxy voting, while L&G reaffirmed its long-term commitment to responsible investing. But in this case, PFZW decided that wasn't enough.\nWith the reshuffle, PFZW is handing its 50 billion equity portfolio to a new lineup that includes Robeco, Man Numeric, Acadian, Lazard, Schroders, M&G, UBS, and PGGM. AQR declined to commentbut it's worth noting that only 80% of its $146 billion AUM reportedly integrates ESG signals, and Asness himself once suggested that doing good and generating returns might not always go hand in hand. For PFZW, that kind of nuance may no longer cut it.

Much of today’s crypto stack either explicitly or implicitly caters to trading (a highly valuable use case in its own right) but is comparatively underoptimized for payments,” wrote Matt Huang, Paradigm’s founder and the lead at Tempo.\nIn addition to low fees and its payments-centric experience, the network expects to enable more than 100,000 transactions per second (TPS) with privacy features that will allow users to keep some transaction details hidden. It will also make use of an automated market maker (AMM) that allows transaction fees to be paid via any stablecoin.\nThrilled to team up with @Tempo as a design partner to see what’s possible with a payments-first blockchain. The pace of crypto innovation is incredible at this time, and we’re ready to learn and build alongside them. https://t.co/1LmfXeDZxI\n— Andy Fang (@andyfang) September 4, 2025\n“Tempo eases the path to bringing real-world flows on-chain,” Huang posted on X, highlighting Tempo’s potential for onboarding global payrolls, remittances, microtransactions, and agentic payments to blockchain.\nThe network is currently in private testnet, as the team experiments with use cases like e-commerce and cross-boarder payments with its global partners, according to its website.\nSome of its design partners are also acting as validators for the network, but Tempo will eventually transition to an open, permissionless network. In other words, anyone will be able to participate in network validation in the future.\n“At Stripe, we care about high-throughput, low-latency payments use cases,” wrote Stripe CEO Patrick Collison. “As the use of stablecoins (and crypto more broadly) grows across Stripe, Bridge, and Privy, we found that existing blockchains are not optimized for them.”\nStripe’s incubation of Tempo will rival layer-1 network plans from Google and Circle, as crypto becomes increasingly intertwined with traditional finance.\nThe payments giant acquired crypto wallet infrastructure firm Privy in June, less than one year after spending $1.1 billion to snatch up stablecoin payment platform, Bridge.\nTempo wasn't the only stablecoin network announcement on Thursday, either. Crypto infrastructure firm Fireblocks also launched its Fireblocks Network, which is supported by USDC issuer Circle and more than 40 other providers.", "content_hash": "4c05ef950b41dfb58c5222b7ef584f77", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

It will have a track dedicated to helping local businesses compete, and local governments find the AI talent they need to better serve their constituents,\" Simo said.\nShe didn't elaborate further on details regarding the platform, but a company spokesperson told TechCrunch that it expects to launch the service by mid-2026.\nAdditionally, OpenAI will introduce a new certification program in connection with its \"OpenAI Academy,\" an online learning platform that teaches workers how to use AI on the job better. This could also put it in competition with LinkedIn's learning platform, which also offers video courses across business, technology and creative fields, with certifications.\n\"[W]e're going to expand the Academy by offering certifications for different levels of AI fluency, from the basics of using AI at work all the way up to AI-custom jobs and prompt engineering,\" Simo said, adding that the program will utilize ChatGPT's Study mode. The study feature turns the chatbot into a teacher that questions, hints and provides feedback, instead of giving direct answers.\nOrganizations will be able to make the certificate part of their own learning and development programs, with OpenAI already working with Walmart, the largest private employer in the U.S. OpenAI said it plans to certify 10 million Americans by 2030.\nThe plans come amid fears about how AI is impacting the labor market. Business leaders like Salesforce's Marc Benioff have recently announced layoffs due to AI, while new studies have linked the technology to mass job loss for certain workers.\nSimo acknowledged the \"disruptive\" force of AI in her post, saying jobs and companies will look different and need to adapt.\n\"[W]hat we can do is help more people become fluent in AI and connect them with companies that need their skills, to give people more economic opportunities.\nRecent research from labor market data company Lightcast found that roles that require AI skills pay higher salaries on average than those that don't.\nThe new initiatives were also said to come as part of OpenAI's \"commitment to the White House's efforts toward expanding AI literacy.\"\nThe company has been strengthening ties with Washington, launching a new offering called OpenAI for Government on June 16, the same day it was awarded a contract of up to $200 million by the U.S. Department of Defense. OpenAI is also part of the $500 billion Stargate project, which aims to invest in AI infrastructure in the U.S. over the next four years.\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman was part of a group of tech leaders that met with U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday to discuss topics including the development of artificial intelligence.\nBefore the dinner, first lady Melania Trump made a speech highlighting the importance of AI in education and American progress, but that \"we must manage AI's growth responsibly.\"", "content_hash": "fd8dd5e295c5c419619e67e100832049", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Sign up to receive future editions.\nOverview: Every step to take-off counts\nIf launching a rocket's a prime feast, opening the doors to the vehicle's launch pad is a healthy appetizer.\nLast week, Rocket Lab introduced Launch Complex 3 — the intended take-off pad of its Neutron rocket — located within the Virginia Spaceport Authority's Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport. Neutron itself will arrive a little later to this party, with a first flight targeted this year – but the premiere of the launch site marks a major step for Rocket Lab specifically and for a space industry that's overall hungry for further launch vehicles.\nThe company already produces the small-lift Electron launch vehicle, which was performing its first commercial flights by late 2018. The 141-foot-tall Neutron is an upgrade in scale: a medium-lift reusable rocket that burns liquid methane and oxygen designed to carry payloads up to 13,000 kilograms to low Earth orbit (LEO) and 1,500 kilograms for trips to Mars or Venus.\nThe market scale for global carrier rockets — which are designed to launch a payload on a particular route or orbit — is seen set to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9% between this year and 2034. Forgive the pun, but launch demand's only risen meteorically, with payloads ranging from space exploration and research equipment to humans and defense and telecommunication satellites for fast-evolving networks.\nFor years, the industry bemoaned the limited scale of take-off capacity, with European Space Agency's Director Josef Aschbacher last year acknowledging a \"launcher crisis\" in Europe that the agency sought to resolve with the launch of the Ariane-6.\nMuch of that world's launch capacity is in the hands of Elon Musk's SpaceX, whose take-off cadence last year exceeded that of both commercial competitors and national programs. In 2024, the company saw through more than 130 flights of its workhorse medium-lift Falcon 9, which reuses its first-stage booster and payload fairings. That's just over half of the 259 orbital launches undertaken over the period globally — and could increase to more than 180 Falcon 9 launches this year, according to Musk's estimate of December. An August launch even carried Kuiper satellites for Amazon, whose owner Jeff Bezos' rival Blue Origin unleashed the New Glenn on its maiden orbital voyage in January.\nIt's not taking away from SpaceX's success story to acknowledge the drawbacks of overreliance on a single provider. Toward the middle of the year, U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to cancel government Musk's government contracts in the midst of an explosive public row led the tech billionaire to fleetingly float the possibility of decommissioning SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft — potentially stranding U.S. crew without a ride to and from the International Space Station at the time. The waters have calmed since, and SpaceX and NASA are continuing their partnership, but the incident's driven home the critical downsides of market dominance.\nWe've been over this: getting a brand new rocket model off the ground's no feat for the feeble. Moscow's still planning to push through the all-Russian Soyuz-5 by the end of the year, and Relativity Space's reusable Terran R and Firefly Aerospace's Eclipse are both currently penciled in for liftoff in 2026. Last month, our collective breaths were held as we watched intently whether the second-iteration Starship variant would prevail in the rocket's 10th test flight, or face another fiery setback. (Elon Musk's giant won the day.)\nBut, when the global satellite market is projected to expand seven-fold by 2035, it's hard not to see why all eyes are glued when space companies reveal their latest and greatest in brand new rockets — or their launch pads.\nWhat's up\n- Canada prepares its first lunar rover — Canadensys Aerospace is developing the first Canada-built rover to investigate the Moon — a \"logical first step\" for future space exploration ambitions, according to the company's CEO. — BBC\n- Senate hears NASA doubts over return to Moon timeline — A former NASA administrator told senators it was unlikely that the space agency would be able to put men back on the Moon ahead of Beijing, which has embarked on similar efforts. — Space News\n- ESA spacecraft undertakes Venus flyby — The European Space Agency's JUICE spacecraft has completed a Venus flyby en route to explore Jupiter's icy moons and gather data about the planet's Ganymede, Callisto and Europa moons. — Space.com\nIndustry maneuvers\n- Trump says Space Command HQ to move to Alabama — U.S. President Donald Trump said the U.S. Space Command's headquarters will move to Alabama from Colorado, citing the latter state's mail-in voting system. — NBC News\n- White House axes labor unions at NASA — Washington has moved to eliminate collective bargaining rights for several government institutions, including NASA, citing national security. — White House executive order\nMarket movers\n- Rocket Lab reveals new pad ahead of first Neutron rocket launch — Rocket Lab unveiled its new Launch Complex 3 pad at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport in Wallops Island, which will be used to test and launch the reusable Neutron rocket that could debut as soon as the end of the year. — Defense News\n- Andoya Space, Rheinmetall to bolster efforts to boost satellite launch — Andoya Space and Rheinmetall have agreed to strengthen their combined efforts to bolster satellite launch and space capabilities. — Defence Industry Europe\n- NordSpace's Taiga launch delayed by tech, weather issues — Ontario-based tech startup NordSpace has postponed the launch of its Taiga rocket — intended as the first ever commercial rocket take-off from Canadian soil — after a safety system fault and weather disruptions.

You probably are hearing we'll be putting a fairly substantial tariff, or not that high, but a fairly substantial tariff.\"\nTrump had said last month during an event with Cook that he would impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports, while exempting products from companies that move their manufacturing to the U.S. At the time, Apple pledged to spend an additional $100 billion on a domestic manufacturing initiative, adding on a $500 billion announcement that Apple made in February.\nDuring Thursday's event, Trump noted that \"Tim Cook would be in pretty good shape,\" regarding the potential import levies.\nThe U.S. has been working to onshore its semiconductor supply chain for many years now. Since 2020, the world's largest semiconductor companies, such as TSMC and Samsung Electronics, have committed hundreds of billions of dollars to building plants in the U.S.\nThus, these major semiconductor companies are expected to receive exemptions under Trump's potential tariffs. However, many aspects of the tariffs and exceptions for companies investing in the U.S. remain unclear.\nTrump offered few details on Thursday, saying simply that \"if they're coming in, building, planning to come in, there will not be a tariff.\"\nThe rest of the dinner saw tech leaders from OpenAI's Sam Altman to Google co-founder Sergey Brin shower praise on the President for his pro-business and AI stances.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, who had a public spat with Trump in June this year, was not present at the dinner.

During the visit, Altman said India was OpenAI's second-largest market by number of users.\nHe has subsequently said that AI adoption in India is \"amazing to watch.\"\n\"We love to see the explosion of creativity--india is outpacing the world,\" he said on X earlier this year.\nIndia is one of ChatGPT's fastest-growing markets globally, Nick Patience, practice lead for AI at tech research and analysis firm Futurum Group, told CNBC. \"OpenAI's India focus is a strategic move to gain a competitive edge,\" he added.\nHere's a rundown of how OpenAI is expanding in India.\nChatGPT explosion\nChatGPT, OpenAI's core product, has seen strong growth in India. The app was downloaded 10.2 million times in India in August, a huge jump from the 2.5 million downloads seen during the same month last year, according to analytics firm Appfigures.\nSince its launch, ChatGPT has 111 million downloads in India, ahead of its 80 million downloads in the U.S, Appfigures data shows.\nDownloads do not necessarily equal daily or monthly users, but the figures emphasise OpenAI's growth trajectory in the country.\nThe download numbers are also far ahead of rivals, including Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude. The closest challenger was Perplexity, Appfigures said, which had 6.4 million downloads in August.\nIndia-specific product\nUser spending on ChatGPT has been increasing. To date, Indian users have spent $21.3 million on ChatGPT, Appfigures data shows. In comparison, U.S. users have spent $784 million.\nThat underlines the fact that while the number of users in India is huge, it remains a price-sensitive market.\nTo address this, OpenAI in August launched ChatGPT Go, a low-cost 399-rupees-($4.53)-a-month plan for its AI app.\n\"It's a classic wedge strategy to capture a price-sensitive market and build a user base that will be difficult for local players to dislodge later,\" Futurum Group's Patience said of the strategy.\nInfrastructure and hiring\nAccording to Bloomberg, OpenAI is scouting a location in India for a data center with at least 1-gigawatt capacity. The facility will be part of OpenAI's Stargate-branded infrastructure push, Bloomberg said this week, although CNBC was unable to verify the report.\nThe ChatGPT developer said last month that it would open a local office in the market and is currently advertising three sales roles in India.\nIt also announced last month an education program in India that will include funding for research and provide half a million ChatGPT licenses for educators and students across the country.\nIndia challenges\nWhile India doesn't have a home-grown artificial intelligence company as big as OpenAI, there are some challengers in the form of domestic startups, including Sarvam AI and Krutrim, and other American tech giants like Google and Meta.\nContinued geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and India over trade, however, have the potential to cause complications if there's any backlash from New Delhi against American tech firms.\nOpenAI is also locked in a legal battle with Asian News International in India, which has accused the ChatGPT developer of using copyrighted material illegally. It's a closely-watched case in the country for how copyright laws apply in the AI era.\n\"OpenAI's success in India is not guaranteed and depends heavily on its ability to navigate these legal and political hurdles,\" Futurum Group's Patience said.\n\"While the Indian market is vast, its diversity in languages and user needs presents challenges. OpenAI's ability to deliver a truly localized product and its long-term impact on India's AI talent remain uncertain.\"", "content_hash": "2cc597ecf6d6154ddb53c663447feaee", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Today it's two euros, tomorrow it's going to be four euros. You're not going to give up on your coffee.\"\nItaly has become a top relocation destination for the wealthy in Europe this year, according to Henley & Partners, which markets citizenship and residency-by-investment schemes.\nThough the millionaire migration figures have raised some questions, and global wealth flows are notoriously difficult to track, a number of high-profile figures have made the move to Italy over recent months. These include Egypt's richest man and co-owner of Aston Villa Football Club Nassef Sawiris, and the vice-chair of Goldman Sachs, Richard Gnodde.\nThe total number of new high-net-worth arrivals in Italy so far this year could be as high as 3,600, according to Henley & Partners estimates.\nMilan's millionaire boom\nItaly's flat-tax regime was introduced in 2017 as part of a wider push by the then center-left government to attract foreign investors while encouraging homegrown talent to return to the country following the euro zone debt crisis.\nThat, in turn, has sparked a new wave of businesses looking to cater to the fresh wealth influx, particularly in the country's financial and fashion hub, Milan. Among those are newly opened members club The Wilde and, prior to that, Casa Cipriani.\n\"We really thought it was a good time to come back to Italy,\" Anna Cipriani, director of membership at Casa Cipriani Milano, told CNBC of the group's 2022 opening.\n\"Milan has evolved a lot over the years,\" she said. \"Before, it used to be known more for its industrial character and, of course, the fashion houses, while over the last few years it became more and more attractive also for creatives, for investors and for [an] international crowd.\"\nItaly's wealthy arrivals, meanwhile, have led to a surge in real estate prices across some of the country's most desirable locations, from Tuscany and the Italian Riviera to cities such as Rome, Venice and Florence. Milan, and the surrounding lakes region, however, have emerged as a firm favorite.\n\"We are at all-time high prices at the moment,\" said Pella, who is based in BHHS' Lake Como office.\n\"In five years, we had an increase [of] double-digit percentages. For the upcoming years, we're probably going to look at a steady 3% to 4% type of increase here in Lake Como.\"\nProperty prices in Milan have risen 49% since the country's flat-tax regime was introduced in 2017, compared to 10.9% across the rest of Italy's big cities, according to real estate group Tecnocasa. Global property consultancy Knight Frank now expects the city's prime real estate market to record a further 3.5% price growth in 2025.\n\"It's about those who can afford it, because prices are not necessarily down to their street market logic as an investment,\" Pella said.\n\"They like a property with their guts. Then they do a little bit of math, of course, but they're ready to spend and sometimes to overspend just to secure a one-of-a-kind view or a one-of-a-kind position.\"\nUHNW migration\nMillionaires have been migrating in droves to new residences, as more and more jurisdictions offer options to those willing to pay.\nOver the past decade, the number of high-net-worth individuals relocating abroad is estimated to have almost tripled, reaching record highs in 2024.\nThat trend looks set to continue in 2025 and 2026, as a divide deepens between countries seeking to attract the uber-rich and those clamping down in a bid to combat perceived inequality.\nFrance has deliberated expanding its wealth tax, while Switzerland is weighing new changes to inheritance tax.\nMeanwhile, the U.K. in April abolished its over 200-year-old non-dom tax regime, which exempted wealthy foreigners living in Britain from paying U.K. tax on their overseas income and gains. It follows an outflow of London-based banks and financiers to other European capitals, such as Milan, following the 2016 Brexit vote.\nThat has left other countries looking to fill the gap.\n\"There are countries literally around the world coming to us and saying: 'We want the U.K.'s millionaires and billionaires. What can we do? How can we bring them to our country?'\" Stuart Wakeling, managing partner at Henley & Partners U.K., said.\nWhile such citizenship and residence regimes vary vastly, and can include stringent investment requirements, part of the appeal of Italy's system is its simplicity. The one-off payment offers foreign individuals, or nationals who have lived overseas for at least nine years, exemption from wider taxes on income and assets for up to 15 years.\nWorsening wealth divides\nItaly's new surge of arrivals has nevertheless raised questions about the impact on the wider economy.\nSome have warned of worsening wealth inequalities, with the overall tax take from the regime minimal compared to the country's overall deficit, and much of the newly generated wealth concentrated in specific areas.\nMeanwhile, critics suggest that attempts to emulate the scheme elsewhere could lead to a race to the bottom and an erosion of the tax base.\nStill, businesses say they are hopeful that the increased activity and new job creation in industries from finance and private equity to hospitality and services will ultimately reap benefits across Milan and the wider country.\n\"It's kind of a wheel, you know, that keeps rolling. You have all these people moving in and you have all these hotels opening and you have more and more people that then decide to come to town because now that they think about it more,\" Cipriani, from private members club Casa Cipriani Milano, said.\n\"When you have a lot of investments into a city, the economy creates more job opportunities also for the people.\"\n— CNBC's Gaelle Legrand contributed to this report.", "content_hash": "af32b3f2ce1db46d9d995c471a578dad", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently commented that, while he has worked seven days a week since the pandemic, \"the zoomers don't show up\" — referring to Gen Z professionals.\nBritish businessman Lord Alan Sugar, 78, said young people \"just want to sit at home,\" and that they need to get back to the office.\nDespite this, young workers say they're keen on more in-person interactions and are coming to the office an average of three days a week, more than all other age groups, according to a recent global study of 12,000 employees by real estate firm JLL.\nAs older professionals shirk the office, young people are finding they're often either alone when coming into work premises, or surrounded by peers of a similar age.\nThis has given rise to a series of new workplace trends from the viral \"Gen Z stare\", to the \"office siren\" aesthetic and even TikTok slang like \"ick\" becoming normalized in professional lingo.\n\"We're blurring the boundaries between just being a colleague to also being friends, and it just makes it more comfortable for us as well to work with people.\"Weirong LiCommunications Professional\n\"Gen Z is reshaping workplace norms by introducing new ways of working that reflect their values, digital fluency, and desire for authenticity,\" Dan Schawbel, managing partner of Workplace Intelligence, told CNBC.\nIntentional networking\nSenior professionals' prefer to work from home and this has eroded much of the water-cooler chat and mentorship culture that young workers are seeking. Gen Z are becoming more intentional to fill the gap.\nTwenty-five-year-old Weirong Li, a communications professional who graduated from NYU's Stern School of Business, said she was going into the office five days a week, while more senior colleagues would stick to a hybrid or remote schedule. Li noted that the people who do come into the office are generally of a similar age to her.\n\"With this hybrid schedule, it's based on your hierarchy, so if you are higher up...you have more of a slack to not come into the office because you're in a position where you've already proven yourself and you don't need to build a network.\"\nThis has taught Li to be thoughtful about how she approaches colleagues, including taking advantage of both virtual and in-person opportunities.\n\"Most of the connections that I've had with older colleagues, if it wasn't in the office, has built from first being online and virtual because I didn't know these people. I would reach out to people on LinkedIn or even cold email people,\" Li explained.\nShe added she takes water-cooler chats \"quite seriously\" because she views them as an opportunity to strike up a conversation and meet someone new.\nSome Gen Zers are deliberately signing up to professional networking events to try to bridge the gap and mingle in a structured environment, as CNBC previously reported.\nTwenty-five-year-old Vivek Haria, a senior tax advisor at a financial services firm, told CNBC Make It at the time that he's attended 10 events for young professionals organized by London's business district Canary Wharf because it felt lonely in the office, as older workers were not showing up.\nBringing your whole personality to work\nGen Z workers aren't shy about bringing their personalities to work and blurring the boundaries between personal and professional, including dressing more casually and being unfiltered in meetings and conversations.\nTwenty-seven-year-old PR manager Mady Lanni, prioritizes dressing comfortably and brings \"her whole self to work,\" she said. \"'I'm not coming into work with dress pants and heels on.

It makes communications easier. We don't really want to always be communicating so formally, 24/7.\"\nLanni said she also reached out to colleagues who seem overwhelmed or stressed, adding that Gen Z is more open about discussing mental well-being in the workplace.\nLanni, who works at the office three days a week, added that younger generations are \"pushing for the need of including mental health services and benefits... taking a mental health day is becoming more and more accepted.\"\nEmbracing AI\nGen Z are leaning into generative AI at a faster pace than other workers and are using the tech to get ahead at work.\nTwenty-five-year-old Gracie Lissick, a PR manager, said that younger generations can help normalize the use of AI amongst their teams.\n\"We really have this awesome kind of Michael Jordan moment to help our teams implement AI,\" she said. \"We can be that resource as much as we can.\"\nAround 57% of Gen Zs are already using AI in their daily work for a variety of tasks, whether it's content creation, data analysis, project management, or something else, and most view it positively, per Deloitte.\nLissick said that adopting AI is an advantage because it shows your ability to be tech agile and forward-thinking to managers.\nLi said young people like herself are using AI to save time and improve their work.\n\"The goal is to have more time to do other stuff later on and so I think that we're a quite focused generation contrary to what other people think. We're also always experimenting with new tools, especially in the AI world, that can help us be more efficient at our work,\" she said.\nWorkplace Intelligence's Schawbel added: \"Many Gen Z workers are using AI to bridge gaps in knowledge, confidence, and professional support, treating it almost like a digital coach or co-pilot. While it can't fully replace human mentorship, for Gen Z, AI is emerging as a reliable stand-in — available 24/7, judgment-free, and often more responsive than a busy boss.\"", "content_hash": "04fedf449910b3ba6db790d6d315dbe7", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

So, when he discovered an investment vehicle called a search fund while studying for his MBA, he went all in.\nAs millions of baby boomers prepare to retire, a quiet crisis — and an unexpected business opportunity — is unfolding across the economy. Today, over half of all U.S. small businesses are owned by people aged 55 and over, yet most lack a succession plan, according to Gallup.\nThese businesses are often unglamorous, but essential to keep society running: plumbers, equipment rental companies and pest control.\n\"They're the types of companies that if they drop what they do, it would really hurt,\" said Jon Staenberg, founder & CEO of Agate Hound Fund.\nEnter the next generation of entrepreneurs — millennials and Gen Zers — who are seizing this moment not by launching startups, but by buying companies through search funds. In doing so, they're revitalizing Main Street businesses and solving a looming succession crisis, all while building wealth in a turbulent economy.\nWhat is a search fund?\nFirst conceived in 1984, search funds — also known as \"entrepreneurship through acquisition\" — let individuals — or \"searchers\" — raise money from a small group of investors to buy and operate a small or medium-sized private company.\nA 2024 study by the Stanford Graduate School of Business describes the process in four steps:\n- Stage one: Raise initial capital (about 2 to 6 months)\n- Stage two: Search for and acquire company (about 12 to 24 months)\n- Stage three: Operation and value creation (about 4 to 7+ years)\n- Stage four: Exit (about 6 months)\nThe goal is to grow these businesses and exit with a profit — often to a private equity firm.\nIt's a compelling model: lower risk than starting from scratch, since the business already has customers, revenue, and a product-market fit.\nAcquisition targets are typically businesses with recurring revenue, low overhead, minimal regulatory risk, and stable customer bases.\n\"These are businesses that are, frankly, hard to break,\" said Jackson, who is now a search fund investor. \"It's very forgiving for the first-time CEO.\"\nBesides \"core\" search funds, other variants include self-funded, single-investor models, while others prioritize a larger pool of capital committed at launch, or a longer holding period of between 10 and 20 years.\nIn 2023, a record 94 core search funds were launched across the U.S. and Canada, while international interest also set new milestones, with 59 new core funds outside North America, according to studies conducted by Stanford and IESE Business School.\n'Safe port in a storm'\nSearch funds have grown popular as traditional career paths feel less secure, with layoffs, automation and artificial intelligence reshaping industries.\n\"There is a big displacement of young professionals who are in the middle of their career,\" said Aik Chuan Goh, managing partner of Singapore-based search fund Garlic Equity Capital. Many of these \"ambitious young professionals no longer see corporate life as their future,\" he added.\nOn the other hand, many business owners are looking to retire. \"When you put one and one together, you have a great match,\" said Goh.\nWe live in such a tumultuous time with change happening so fast, this feels like a very safe port in a storm.Jon StaenbergFounder and CEO, Agate Hound Fund\nInvestors are taking notice too. Amid downturns in the venture capital and private equity markets, search funds have emerged as an alternative asset class.\n\"Venture [capital] is so crowded now. Search funds still remain small, while the opportunity set is so big — it's the only thing I want to do for the rest of my career. You look at the returns, they've been phenomenal. They've been outsized,\" said Staenberg.\nStanford's 2024 study of 681 search funds formed in the U.S. and Canada since 1984 found that their internal rate of return was 35.1%, with a 4.5 times return on investment.\n\"Over the last 40 years, the stock market has been somewhere [around] 8.5% annual returns ... Then you go to private equity or venture over that same 40-year period ... and the returns are somewhere around 13% to 14%. So [when] you start looking at the outsized returns of 35% for search, it's a bit of a head scratcher,\" said Staenberg.\n\"We live in such a tumultuous time with change happening so fast, this feels like a very safe port in a storm.\"\nCheckbook, phonebook, playbook\nMeanwhile, search funds have also offered a risk-adjusted way for aspiring business owners to pursue their CEO dreams, such as Jackson, who, together with his friend Olaide Lawal, started their search fund in 2015.\nAbout 18 months later, the duo raised more than $5 million and acquired three dental practices from a dentist who was in his 50s. Over the next six years, Jackson ran Unified Dental Care as CEO and grew the company to seven locations before selling the business to a strategic buyer in 2023.\nBut Jackson did not come from wealth. Growing up in Champaign, Illinois, he didn't see many business success stories around him.\n\"It was normal for me to literally see in front of my door, gang fights [break] out ... and so I did not have as much access to seeing entrepreneurs,\" said Jackson.\n\"I saw the barber shop that was down the street, or I saw the person that owned the barbecue shop ... [and] people that were making an honest living, but barely livable wages,\" said Jackson.\nSo it was a risk adjusted path for me as a minority entrepreneur that didn't come with a lot of resources to have ... a successful exit.Jason JacksonFormer CEO, Unified Dental Care\n\"For me, the idea [of a search fund] was fantastic, because ... I didn't have the startup idea, so it was an opportunity for me to buy an existing business,\" he said.\nWhat makes search funds unique, he said, is that his investors also become his mentors.\n\"What separates search fund investors is that they provide, principally, three things to the entrepreneur. The first thing that they provide is [a] checkbook... This is something that I didn't have access to,\" said Jackson.\n\"Second thing that they provide access to is a phone book, meaning call me or call my network anytime ... and the third thing that they provide [is a] playbook, meaning, here's how you execute once you buy this business,\" Jackson added.\n\"So it was a risk-adjusted path for me as a minority entrepreneur that didn't come with a lot of resources to have ... a successful exit,\" said Jackson.\nThe new American dream?\nBut running a search fund isn't all smooth sailing. In fact, Jackson uncovered fraud two weeks into running the business: the seller had inflated revenue by millions.\n\"We thought we were buying a $7 million revenue company and $1.5 million in EBITDA,\" said Jackson. \"What we discovered was that the business was really doing $5 million in revenue and losing $500,000 a year after adjusting for the fraud.\"\nDespite the rocky start, Jackson turned the business around. He exited successfully, more than doubling his investment and earning seven figures altogether from his tenure as CEO and from the deal, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.\n\"We eventually were able to sell the business at a decent multiple. It's decent for the search fund industry. It's really good compared to private equity, but it's really great compared to where my partner and I came from. He came from Lagos, Nigeria. I came from an under-resourced community,\" said Jackson.\nToday, Jackson runs the Black Search Network, which he co-founded in 2020. He spends his time investing in and passing on the knowledge he's gained through his own journey to other aspiring entrepreneurs and searchers.\nIt also allows people who are gritty, who are hungry, who are willing to be coached, to pursue what we used to call the American dream — to build a business into even more success and have an exit and then come back and help others do the same thing.Jon StaenbergFounder and CEO, Agate Hound Fund\nSearch funds are not a silver bullet. Besides dealing with rejection, searchers have to find a good business to buy, convincing the owner to entrust you with their life's work, and of course, learning how to run a business for the first time.\nBut for a generation looking for stability and purpose, they may offer something rare in today's economy: a practical, profitable, and supported route to owning a business.\n\"It truly is the life cycle of entrepreneurship,\" said Staenberg. \"It also allows people who are gritty, who are hungry, who are willing to be coached, to pursue what we used to call the American dream — to build a business into even more success and have an exit and then come back and help others do the same thing.\"\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

The agreement reached in July had included Japan purchasing 100 Boeing planes, 75% higher imports of U.S. rice and $8 billion worth of agricultural and crop products.\nWashington will apply a baseline 15% tariff on nearly all Japanese imports, with separate sector-specific levies for automobiles and parts (also 15%), aerospace products, generic pharmaceutical goods and natural resources, according to the executive order.\nThe Thursday order prevents Trump's country-specific tariffs on top of existing levies. The lower tariffs will apply retroactively to Japanese goods \"entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 7, 2025,\" the order stated. The tariff relief on automobiles is set to take effect after seven days.\nTrump's global tariff campaign has thrown the global supply chain into disarray, in particular Japan's massive auto sector. Last month, Toyota warned that it expected a hit of nearly $10 billion as Trump's tariffs on autos weighed on its sales to the U.S., forcing it to slash by 16% its forecast for full-year operating profits.\nTariffs are expected to hit rivals as well, with Ford's pre-tax adjusted profit reportedly set to drop $3 billion while GM projects $4 billion to $5 billion hit for the year.\nJapan's top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, who was in Washington, delivered a letter from Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba inviting Trump to visit his country, Kyoto News reported. The Japanese official had reportedly canceled his trip to the U.S. last month as some sticking points required \"further technical discussion.\"\nPolitical tides\nThe finalizing of the deal came as political pressure for the Japanese leader mounts at home. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party earlier this week released a long-awaited report on why it lost seats in the upper house election in July.\nThe report ascribed the loss to the lack of appeal for the party's measures aimed at taming inflation, previous political scandals and weak mobilization of young voters.\nLocal media reports suggested many key members of the LDP have signaled their intention to resign to the prime minister, while Ishiba has said he intends to stay on amid calls within his party for choosing another leader.\nThough the reports have avoided naming individuals, they signal an \"implicit indictment of Ishiba's leadership of the party,\" said James Brady, vice president at political consultancy Teneo.\nAnalysts at Eurasia Group suggested in a report Friday that Ishiba is unlikely to survive a challenge from within the party next Monday, when a vote on whether to bring forward a leadership election is expected to take place.\n\"Ishiba's poor performance as party leader in lower and upper house elections and events in recent days, including former prime minister Aso Taro announcing his support for the special election, have turned the tide against Ishiba,\" analysts said, predicting a 60% odd of Ishiba's defeat in the election, with him possibly resigning before the vote takes place as internal discontent grows.", "content_hash": "f6d82ea4737a68384b0cbe9cbf00590e", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The ticketing data in this CNBC report was sourced from that document.\nThe NFL requires every team to give 34% of ticket revenue and the licensing amount of a club seat to the league based on an internal formula, according to several NFL executives who asked to remain unnamed so they could speak freely about private conversations.

Copper alone is estimated to represent $16 billion, more than all non-mining sectors combined.\nMajor players including BHP, Glencore and Rio Tinto are among those making bold bets on Argentina's copper and lithium potential, with top executives from Glencore and Rio Tinto recently traveling to meet with Milei on a trip to Buenos Aires.\nRo Dhawan, CEO of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), a trade body representing roughly one-third of the global industry, described Argentina as \"arguably the most exciting new copper story today.\"\nThere are other countries and jurisdictions which may be more geologically rich, Dhawan said, but not one that sits at the intersection of a stable domestic political environment, and the provision of basic infrastructure and facilities and sufficient other investments complementary to the mining industry.\nAmong the most notable copper projects in Argentina is BHP and Lundin's Vicuna joint venture.\nSituated along the Chile-Argentina border, the Vicuna District is regarded as a geologically prospective region. Indeed, the deposits at Vicuna's Josemaria and Filo del Sol mines are estimated to contain 13 million metric tons of measured copper and 25 million tons of inferred copper.\nPolicy consistency and social licence will determine whether this is Argentina's mining moment or another mirage.Mariano MachadoAmericas principal analyst at Verisk Maplecroft\nFor ICMM's Dhawan, the potential significance of BHP and Lundin's Vicuna copper project is extraordinary.\n\"It's of the same importance to copper as Western Australia was to iron ore — and I don't say that lightly. It is a bold comparison to make but it is one that I do genuinely believe in,\" Dhawan said.\nA spokesperson for BHP and Lundin's Vicuna copper project said last month that the two companies intend to apply to receive benefits under RIGI, Reuters reported.\nA $47 billion opportunity\nArgentina's renewed mining focus comes as global copper demand is expected to skyrocket over the coming years, dramatically outstripping supply amid an artificial intelligence boom and a shift away from fossil fuels.\nAnalysts at consultancy CRU Group have estimated that the pipeline of Argentina's potential copper projects could represent a roughly $47 billion opportunity for the economy through to 2040.\nThis cumulative impact is comparable to the record $44-billion bailout loan Argentina received from the International Monetary Fund.\nA government spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment when contacted by CNBC.\nRead more\nAsked whether Argentina's long history of boom-and-bust economic cycles means Argentina's copper dreams could crumble once again, ICMM's Dhawan said: \"Where doesn't have that risk is the question I would ask?\"\nHe added: \"I just think that people have adjusted to a new normal expectation of quite significant volatility and that has almost worked in Argentina's favor. I think two things have happened, I think Argentina's stability has gone up and the world's stability has gone down.\"\nDhawan said it's not possible to predict which way Argentina will go, but investors appear to be prepared for different political and economic scenarios and that sovereign risk has been priced in.\nArgentina's mining moment?\nMariano Machado, principal analyst for the Americas at Verisk Maplecroft, said that while Argentina does possess the minerals needed to reshape its export base, \"policy consistency and social licence will determine whether this is Argentina's mining moment or another mirage.\"\n\"The country's policy swings have kept investment below potential levels, and the government's failure to persuade lawmakers from the opposition Union for the Homeland (UP) to vote for the RIGI means there is a risk that less private sector-friendly sectors will dispute its provisions if they make a comeback,\" Machado told CNBC by email.\n\"A new mining boom could also stoke anti-mining activism,\" he added. \"Issues around water, protection of glaciers and broader human rights underscore persistent challenges for companies to secure durable social licence to operate.\"", "content_hash": "4b52d00da89126336f2614c771ade18c", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Honeywell announced Thursday that its quantum computing company, Quantinuum, has raised another $600 million in funding at an approximately $10 billion valuation. The latest round, which doubles Quantinuum's valuation of $ 5 billion last seen in January 2024 , sets the privately held firm up for a highly anticipated initial public offering — a key step in unlocking value for Club holding Honeywell as its majority shareholder. Honeywell CFO Mike Stepniak said so himself in reaction to the fresh capital raise during an industry event on Thursday morning. \"I'm excited about commercializing this business and ultimately I think this really [gets us to an] IPO,\" Stepniak said at an industrials conferenced hosted by Jefferies. \"Our intent is to IPO this business.\" In July, Honeywell CEO Vimal Kapur said that the company is looking to bring Quantinuum public in 2027. A successful IPO would help show that Honeywell's long-term investment into Quantinuum will have been worth it. Quantinuum was formed back in 2021 following a merger of Honeywell's Quantum Solutions with Cambridge Quantum. However, it has never been a source of significant revenue or profits for the industrial conglomerate given quantum computing technology is still in the early innings and a ways off from widespread commercial use. In 2024, Honeywell reported a loss of $454 million for the segment that houses its stake in Quantinuum. Still, there's a lot of potential value to unlock for Honeywell because of the promise that many see in quantum computing, which can solve complex tasks far beyond the abilities of traditional computers due to fundamentally different architectures. Technology stalwarts including Alphabet and IBM are among those pursuing the nascent technology — in fact, it was a breakthrough quantum chip from Alphabet's Google in late 2024 that catalyzed a new wave of interest in the industry and sent stocks of publicly traded quantum firms on a major tear. Club name Nvidia has shown an increased focus on quantum , and its venture capital arm participated in Quantinuum's capital raise. Other new investors include Quant Computer, QED investors, and existing shareholders like JPMorgan Chase , Mitsui, among others. Financial services is one industry that sees a lot of potential in quantum computing, and JPMorgan even as an internal research group that focuses on the technology. Honeywell benefits from Quantinuum by more than just capitalizing on this trend, though. The market seems to have not realized Quantinuum's value to the industrial conglomerate yet either, according to Bank of America's Andrew Obin. \"What we've said is that the market doesn't seem to be assigning a particular value to their stake in Quantinuum, so risk/reward is definitely skewed to the upside,\" Obin told CNBC in an interview Thursday afternoon. Case in point: Shares of Honeywell were up only slightly on the Thursday announcement. Plus, Obin added that Quantinuum is just one of the ways \"you can win with Honeywell stock.\" The Club believes another is the company's forthcoming business spin-offs, which we have long argued will unlock more value for shareholders as Honeywell becomes a more streamlined company and its crown jewel aerospace segment gets to operate on its own. Honeywell's advanced materials business is on track to be spun off in the fourth quarter of this year, while the aerospace separation is tracking for next year.

Kennedy Jr. doubled down on false claims about vaccines and claimed he isn't limiting access to Covid shots during his Senate testimony on Thursday, as senators grilled him on his sweeping changes to immunization policy and federal health agencies.\nKennedy said he supports a statement made by a newly appointed member of a key government vaccine panel that mRNA vaccines pose a dangerous risk to people. Numerous studies have demonstrated that shots using mRNA technology, including Covid vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, are safe and effective, and serious side effects have happened in extremely rare cases.\nSen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., noted that the committee member, Dr. Retsef Levi, has said that evidence is mounting that mRNA vaccines cause \"serious harm, including death, especially among young people,\" apparently referring to a post pinned on Levi's X account. Kennedy appointed Levi to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine recommendations and insurance coverage.\nKennedy said he wasn't aware of Levi's comments, but added, \"I agree with it.\"\nHe also claimed that anyone could get a Covid booster shot, while also acknowledging that access \"depends on the state\" and that the government no longer recommends the vaccines for healthy people.\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved a fresh round of Covid shots with new limits, only clearing them for adults aged 65 and older and people with a medical condition that puts them at risk of a severe illness. The CDC and its vaccine panel will decide who to recommend the shots to later this month.\n\"I'm not taking them away from people,\" Kennedy said, referring to the vaccines.\nBut Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., argued that not everyone can walk into a pharmacy and get a Covid shot now.\nThe FDA's new limits have complicated Covid shot access in the U.S., which now depends on a patient's age and risk level, laws and policies in their state, insurance coverage, and health-care provider. Pending CDC guidance, some pharmacies have added prescription requirements for Covid vaccines in certain states.\n\"You clearly are taking away vaccines,\" she said after a prolonged shouting match with Kennedy.\nKennedy's comments before the Senate Finance Committee come after he repeatedly promised the panel in January that he would do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it more difficult or discourages people from taking vaccines. Since then, he has canceled funding for mRNA shot development and made other vaccine policy changes that could limit access to immunizations, including gutting the CDC vaccine panel and dropping Covid shot recommendations for certain groups.\nHis comments also follow a leadership shake-up at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The White House last week fired CDC Director Susan Monarez, and four senior agency officials resigned shortly after, with some of them citing the politicization of the agency and a threat to public health. In an opinion piece on Thursday, Monarez accused Kennedy of \"a deliberate effort to weaken America's public-health system and vaccine protections.\"\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X in support of Kennedy on Thursday, writing that he \"is taking flak because he's over the target\" and saying Democrats were attacking the Trump administration's \"commonsense effort.\"\nKennedy touted skepticism around Covid vaccines, despite evidence of their safety and effectiveness.\n\"We were told again and again the vaccines would prevent transmission, they prevent infection. It wasn't true. They knew it from the start,\" Kennedy said.\nHe also said he does not know how many people died of Covid and whether the vaccines prevented deaths from the virus.\n\"I would like to see the data and talk about the data,\" Kennedy said.\nBut data is readily available from dozens of studies. One paper in August estimates that Covid vaccines saved more than 2 million lives, mostly among older adults, worldwide between 2020 and October 2024.\nThe CDC website also says that Covid vaccines from the 2023 to 2024 season reduced the risk of severe illness from Covid by almost 70% in the first two months after vaccination in adults ages 18 and older, with protection gradually declining over time.\nThose shots also decreased the risk of hospitalization due to Covid by around 50% in the first two months of vaccination in that same population. The Covid vaccines showed similar benefits in older adults.\nKennedy also defended his decision to fire all 17 previous members of the CDC vaccine panel, saying he didn't politicize the committee.\n\"What we did is we got rid of the conflicts of interest. ... We depoliticized and put great scientists on it from a very diverse group,\" the HHS secretary said. \"They are very, very pro-vaccine.\"\nBut a new analysis published last month from USC researchers found that conflicts of interest on that panel had been at \"historic lows for years\" before Kennedy restacked it with new members, some of whom are widely known vaccine critics.\nCorrection: Kennedy testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday.

For those with at least two AI skills, the premium was 43% higher.\nThe study also noted three fields with the largest premium: customer and client support, sales, and manufacturing and production.\nJoshua Woo, founder of Recruit Fast, an employment agency in Singapore, made a similar observation that \"AI skills are paying above average in this market.\"\nHe added that they are no longer just nice to have, \"they're a differentiator.\"\nMore accessible\nLightcast's report identified over 300 AI skills ranging from AI ethics and generative AI to machine learning.\nThe study also found that different career areas required fundamentally different AI skills. For example, roles in transportation were likely to require autonomous driving skills, while maintenance positions prioritized robotics capabilities.\nThough many of the AI skills required high technical expertise, the most commonly-listed ones were often quite general, such as proficiency in the use of ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot.\nThese basic skills are becoming more prevalent and accessible in the job market, according to Bridget Wong, head of human relations at Accenture Singapore.\n\"While positions like decision scientist or LLM/data architect demand deep technical expertise, many operational and junior employees are also being equipped to work effectively with AI-enabled processes,\" Wong said.\nThus, \"there is no wrong stage in a career to learn AI—opportunities exist at every level, and organizations should invest in training and exposure to empower employees,\" she added.\nDemand in non-tech roles\nNotably, Lightcast's study found that demand for AI skills was higher in non-tech sectors than in IT and computer science, which are normally associated with AI.\nSince 2022, the year OpenAI launched ChatGPT, job postings mentioning generative AI skills were up 800% for non-tech roles, the study found.\nWhile IT and computer science still reigned the list of sectors demanding AI skills, marketing and public relations came in second place. This was followed by science & research, and social analysis and planning.\n\"It's not just software developers or the data scientists that are benefiting from AI skills; It's something people in everything from marketing to finance to HR should be thinking about,\" Magrini said.\n'Be prepared'\nAI skills \"are coming to every job function, to every career area, but at different paces,\" which means everybody needs a layer of AI literacy, Magrini said.\nRecruit Fast's Woo noted that AI skills are likely less relevant as prerequisites in blue-collar jobs as compared to other fields.\nStill, Magrini said that \"AI is coming, but we don't need to be scared.

It can't be too slow, nor can it be too hot.\nWall Street is on edge heading into Friday's nonfarm payrolls. Economists polled by Dow Jones are forecasting the U.S. economy added 75,000 jobs last month, a weak estimate that's only slightly higher than the dismal 73,000 headline number in the July report. The unemployment rate is also projected to tick higher, to 4.3% from 4.2%.\nInvestors may be able to shrug off a soft report so long as the headline number manages to hit a sweet spot, one that is cool enough to justify a September rate cut, but not so weak as to add to recession fears. Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge puts an \"ideal\" range that fulfills those two requirements between 70,000 and 95,000.\nThe August jobs report will also be heavily scrutinized for another reason. It will be the first after the poor jobs data and accompanying revisions last month prompted President Donald Trump to fire the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner. It's a decision that has spurred fears of government overreach and cast doubt over federal economic data.\nTrump nominated conservative economist E.J. Antoni to be the new head of the BLS. William Wiatrowski is acting commissioner until Antoni is confirmed.\nMarket reaction\nThe stock market could come under pressure if the jobs figure is outside of the expected range from traders. Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, worries a downside surprise is coming in the jobs data, one that will ding markets. Just not quite yet.\nThe economist, who is projecting nonfarm payrolls growth of 75,000 in August, said that he expects a negative jobs number will come in the second half of the year at some point. He said it's possible that the weak number could even come Friday.\nKKM Financial investment chief Jeff Kilburg worries Friday's jobs data could come in stronger than expected, given the low expectations heading into the report, and that could boost interest rates and reduce the chances the Fed cuts as many times as expected this year. Many traders are hoping for three rate cuts between now and year's end.\nUltimately, Wall Street is hoping for greater clarity on the labor market, one that is alarming some who have noted companies are abstaining from hiring or firing workers in a troubling pattern.\n\"Is this just a case of, sort of, a 'low hires, low fires,' kind of stagnant labor market, or is there some real deterioration that's starting to unfold?\" said John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Growth Innovators ETF. \"And historically, when the labor market has started to deteriorate, it has a tendency to quickly deteriorate further.\"\nADP's private employment report, which can sometimes be a precursor to the official figures that follow, was weaker-than expected on Thursday, but within a comfortable range that didn't panic markets. It showed an addition of just 54,000 private payrolls last month. The stock market gained on Thursday following the figures.", "content_hash": "5b4ebfbdb7ab64f3570f9c035031b511", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona, introduced a bill on Thursday — titled the You Earn It, You Keep it Act — to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits. A House version of the bill was introduced by Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minnesota, in April.\nGallego's bill would permanently eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits.\nIt would also expand the Social Security payroll tax to apply to annual earnings over $250,000. Currently, the maximum earnings subject to Social Security payroll taxes is $176,100 in 2025. Consequently, high earners may only pay into the program for part of the year.\n\"Despite decades of paying into the system, seniors are still forced to pay taxes on their hard-earned benefits — all while the ultra wealthy barely pay into the system,\" Gallego said in a statement.\nHow Social Security benefits are taxed\nSocial Security recipients may owe federal income taxes on their benefits depending on their income.\nHow much they may owe is based on a formula known as combined income — the sum of adjusted gross income, tax-exempt interest income and half of Social Security benefits.\nUp to 50% of benefits may be taxed for individual tax filers with between $25,000 and $34,000 in combined income, or married couples who file jointly with between $32,000 and $44,000.\nUp to 85% of benefits may be taxable for individuals with more than $34,000 in combined income or couples with more than $44,000.\nHow the 'big beautiful' tax law helps seniors\nRepublicans' new \"big beautiful\" law includes a new senior deduction aimed at helping to defray the effects of federal taxes on Social Security benefits.\nAdults aged 65 and over may be able to claim an additional deduction of up to $6,000.\nWhether beneficiaries will benefit from the change will depend on their income.\nThe full deduction will be available to individual taxpayers with up to $75,000 in modified adjusted gross income or married couples with up to $150,000. The deduction will gradually phase out for taxpayers with incomes above those thresholds.\nThe temporary deduction — which will be in effect for tax years 2025 through 2028 — will be available to eligible taxpayers regardless of whether they take the standard deduction or itemize their returns.\nMiddle-income taxpayers stand to benefit the most from the policy, according to tax experts, since low earners may already be exempt from federal taxes on benefits and higher earners will be above the phaseout thresholds.\nHow 'You Earn It, You Keep It' may affect Social Security\nUnlike the temporary senior deduction recently signed into law, Gallego's You Earn It, You Keep It proposal would eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits for all beneficiaries.\nTo be sure, it remains to be seen whether it may get enough support to become law.\nThe proposal does have the support of The Senior Citizens League, a nonpartisan senior advocacy group that is petitioning Congress to stop taxing Social Security benefits. Eliminating federal taxes on Social Security benefits is a \"commonsense step to ensure older Americans can keep more of what they've earned,\" Senior Citizens League Executive Director Shannon Benton said in a statement.\nEfforts to change the federal taxation of Social Security benefits come as the program is facing a trust fund shortfall. Benefits may be reduced within the next decade unless Congress enacts changes sooner, according to projections from Social Security's trustees.\nBecause the \"big beautiful\" law did not include any offsets for the reduced revenue from federal taxes on benefits, it would accelerate the depletion dates, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\nIn contrast, the You Earned It, You Keep It proposal would extend the Social Security trust funds' ability to pay benefits in full and on time for 24 years, or until 2058, according to Gallego's office. That matches an analysis of Craig's House proposal by Social Security's chief actuary in April.", "content_hash": "c9191b29aba6f9e461228cb296b7877b", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

He pointed to the deals available at the Excalibur, one of MGM's resorts on the Las Vegas Strip: $85 rooms, including resort fee; $5 tables; $5 beers. But the $12 Starbucks coffee grabs the headline.\n\"There is value there, and there's always been value,\" Hornbuckle said. \"We let the narrative get away from us and shame on us. We need to do a better job.\"\nMGM and Las Vegas more broadly had posted several years of growth in visitation, room rates and profits before this year's slowdown.\nWhen asked whether the Vegas slump could be a canary in the coal mine for U.S. travel more broadly, Hornbuckle, who chairs the U.S. Travel Association, said it does seem to be a leading indicator. And the industry as a whole is facing some troubling obstacles.\nCanadian visitation to the U.S. has plummeted some 40% this year, following comments by President Donald Trump about Canada as a potential 51st U.S. state and evolving trade policies. The Canadian dollar has also weakened, lessening the buying power of visitors crossing the border into the U.S.\nHornbuckle also pointed to massive price hikes for a U.S. visa, from $100 to $350, where a family of four visiting for the Ryder Cup, World Cup or Olympics in 2028, for example, could pay $1,400 for visa documents alone.\n\"International travel in 2016 had a $50 billion U.S. surplus. Today it's a $50 billion deficit,\" Hornbuckle said.\nThe government's commitment to funding marketing and promotion of U.S. travel was also slashed by 80% in the most recent spending bill, to $20 million.\n\"We obviously find ourselves in a world that has a fair amount of uncertainty from a macroeconomic perspective, from a socio-political perspective,\" Marriott CEO Tony Capuano told investors at the BofA conference Thursday. \"Marriott, and the sector more broadly, thrives in times of certainty and stability. So that creates some measure of challenge.\"\nCapuano said there's been a slight uptick after Labor Day in some segments of travel. He said Marriott sees spending restrained in budget travelers and small businesses. But he described demand for luxury travel as \"sturdy.\"\nWyndham Hotel and Resorts CEO Geoff Ballotti laid out an optimistic view of the travel industry, noting robust demand for extended stay, driven in part by projects supporting the government's infrastructure spending.\n\"You're seeing incredible interest in investment right now,\" Ballotti told CNBC. \"Our new construction pipeline, 20 consecutive quarters of growth, is at an all-time high. We're seeing groundbreakings accelerate.

In order for AI models to continue improving, they require more computing power so they can process higher volumes of data at faster speeds.\nIn fact, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks the latest reasoning models, which spend more time \"thinking\" before rendering outputs, could drive an AI infrastructure spending boom worth $4 trillion by 2030. If that's the case, it might be a great idea for investors to own a slice of the semiconductor industry.\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX 1.03%) is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that invests exclusively in companies that supply chips and other computing hardware components. It manages a highly concentrated portfolio of just 30 stocks, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Nvidia, and Broadcom are among its top holdings.\nHere's how the ETF could turn a $250,000 investment into $1 million over the long term. But don't worry -- investors with any starting balance can earn a fourfold return if this scenario plays out.\nA complete portfolio of AI hardware stocks\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF invests in companies that design, manufacture, and distribute chips and components, but especially those that stand to benefit from megatrends like AI. Therefore, its top three holdings should come as no surprise:\nAMD's newest lineup of graphics processing units (GPUs), called the MI350 series, is being adopted by leading data center operators like Oracle. The company will up the ante in 2026 with the MI400, which could be 10 times more powerful. But AMD's AI opportunity transcends the data center, because it's also a leading supplier of AI chips for personal computers, which could be a major growth market in the future.\nDespite the competitive threat from AMD, Nvidia still has a decisive edge in data centers thanks to its latest Blackwell Ultra GPUs, which are the gold standard for AI reasoning models. These chips are 50 times more powerful than the company's original Hopper AI GPUs, which led the industry in 2023. Nvidia generates around 12 times more data center revenue than AMD, which highlights its incredible market share.\nBroadcom designs AI accelerators (a type of data center chip) for hyperscale cloud providers like Alphabet's Google Cloud. These chips can be customized to suit specific workloads, so they offer more flexibility than traditional GPUs. But Broadcom is also a leading supplier of data center networking equipment, like its latest Tomahawk Ultra Ethernet switch, which provides industry-leading low latency and high throughput to drive faster processing speeds in AI workloads.\nSince the beginning of 2023, which is when the AI boom started gathering momentum, the above three stocks have delivered an average return of 550%, with each of them crushing the S&P 500:\nAnd the iShares ETF holds a number of other top AI hardware stocks, including Micron Technology, which supplies some of the industry's best storage and memory chips, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which fabricates many of the AI chips designed by companies like Nvidia and AMD.\nTurning $250,000 into $1 million\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF has delivered a compound annual return of 11.4% since its inception in 2001, comfortably outpacing the average annual gain of 8.5% in the S&P 500 over the same period.\nAnd the fund generated an accelerated compound annual gain of 24.1% over the last 10 years, thanks to the proliferation of technologies like cloud computing, enterprise software, and AI, which continue to drive explosive demand for chips.\nHere's how long it could take the iShares ETF to turn an investment of $250,000 into $1 million, based on three different compound annual returns.\nA continued annual return of 24.1% over the long term would be a very big ask for this ETF -- or any ETF -- because there is no such thing as infinite growth. Nvidia, for instance, is already the world's largest company, and its revenue growth is starting to decelerate because there are only so many new customers capable of buying enough chips to move the needle.\nWith that said, the semiconductor industry as a whole can still grow materially from here if AI infrastructure spending hits $4 trillion by 2030, as Jensen Huang predicts, so the iShares ETF is likely still a great buy. Adding it to a diversified portfolio of other ETFs and individual stocks can protect against some of the volatility that is typical in high-growth industries like AI.", "content_hash": "62857c295e591c9947a17c448241d6b6", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Unlike traditional computers, which store their data in binary bits of zeros and ones, quantum computers can store those zeros and ones simultaneously in \"qubits.\" That difference enables them to process larger amounts of data at much faster speeds -- which makes them well-suited for crunching massive amounts of information for AI applications.\nTwo popular quantum computing stocks are Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT 1.44%), also known as QCi, and IonQ (IONQ 2.73%). Over the past 12 months, QCi's stock surged nearly 2,280% as IonQ's stock rallied more than 510%.\nLet's see which of these high-flying stocks is a better play on the quantum computing and AI markets.\nThe differences between QCi and IonQ\nQuantum computers are much faster than traditional servers and mainframes, but they're bigger, pricier, consume more power, and output a higher percentage of errors. To resolve those issues, companies like QCi and IonQ are developing new technologies that could make quantum processing units (QPUs) smaller, cheaper, and more scalable.\nMost quantum computers are powered by ions (individually charged atoms), electrons (subatomic particles with a negative charge), or photons (particles of light). In ion-driven systems, ions are trapped in electromagnetic fields and manipulated with lasers. In electron-driven systems, electrons are sped up in \"superconducting loops\" to process data. In photon-driven systems, light particles are used to transmit the data.\nQCi develops photonic chips, which operate at room temperature and can be produced at conventional chip fabs. It doesn't build any of its own quantum systems, but it provides a cloud-based platform for simulations.\nIonQ produces \"trapped ion\" chips, builds its own systems (its older Aria system, its flagship Forte system, its data center-oriented Forte Enterprise system, and its upcoming Tempo system), and provides its own cloud-based services. But unlike photonic systems, ion-driven systems still require moderate cooling.\nMeanwhile, electron-driven superconducting systems, like the ones produced by IBM and Rigetti Computing, can only function in cryogenic environments. That makes them the most expensive to maintain, but those chips are also the easiest to mass-produce with existing lithography technologies.\nWhich of these companies has a brighter future?\nQCi only started manufacturing and delivering its first photonics chips this year, so the technology remains in its infancy. So, while the idea of quantum chips functioning at room temperature sounds disruptive, it hasn't proven that its business model is sustainable yet. Its main customers are still small design firms and research institutions.\nFor 2025, analysts expect QCI to generate just $400,000 in revenue with a net loss of $39 million. But by 2027, they expect its revenue to more than quadruple to $1.85 billion with a net loss of $44 million as it scales up production of its photonic chips, rolls out its own Dirac-3 quantum system, and expands its Qatalyst cloud platform.\nIonQ's business is more mature. From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect its revenue to surge from $43 million to $315 million as its ion-driven systems are adopted across more industries. But they still expect its annual net loss to widen from $332 million to $552 million.\nFor now, IonQ is focused on increasing its total quantum computing power, which it measures in algorithmic qubits (AQ). It expects that figure to soar from 64-100 AQ in 2025 to 100-256 AQ in 2026, 10,000 AQ in 2027, 20,000 AQ in 2028, 200,000 AQ in 2029, and 2 million AQ in 2030.\nInvestors should take that ambitious outlook with a grain of salt, but IonQ hit its previous long-term AQ targets before. Its ongoing efforts to shrink the width of its QPUs with its trapped ion technology (from a few feet to a few inches) -- could support that explosive growth spurt. It's also been integrating Nvidia's CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) parallel computing platform into its own quantum systems to support a broader range of AI applications.\nThe better buy: IonQ\nQCi's photonics technology is promising, but its stock is already valued at more than 1,300 times its projected revenue for 2027. That meme stock valuation makes it a dangerous stock to own, and it could easily crash if it struggles to scale up its business. IonQ is also speculative, but it looks more reasonably valued at just over 40 times its estimated sales for 2027. Therefore, it's smarter to stick with IonQ than to pay a sky-high premium for QCi's potential growth.", "content_hash": "2b16fdef75818ede5a416d22c8f6be2e", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

That implies 122% upside from its current share price of $90.\nHere's what investors should know about CoreWeave.\nBulls say CoreWeave is a leading provider of cloud AI services\nCoreWeave provides cloud infrastructure and software services purpose built for artificial intelligence (AI), and its data centers exclusively use Nvidia GPUs. SemiAnalysis recently ranked CoreWeave as the best AI cloud on the market, awarding it a higher score than Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform. That praise reflects two competitive advantages.\nFirst, CoreWeave is frequently the first cloud platform to bring new chips to market because of its longstanding relationship with Nvidia. For instance, the company was the first to deploy Nvidia H100 and H200 systems, and it more recently became the first company to deploy Nvidia GB200 and GB300 systems. Early access to the latest technologies is a compelling reason to work with CoreWeave.\nSecond, CoreWeave often achieves top results at the MLPerf benchmarks, standardized tests that measure artificial intelligence systems across training and inference use cases. The company says its infrastructure and software expertise results in up to 20% higher GPU cluster performance than alternative solutions.\nCoreWeave reported tremendous demand in the second quarter. Revenue soared 207% to $1.2 billion and non-GAAP operating income increased 135% to $200 million. In addition, the company said its revenue backlog increased 86% because of expanded deals with OpenAI and an unnamed hyperscale company (possibly Google).\nBears say CoreWeave has a capital-intensive business model\nCoreWeave currently operates 33 data centers across the United States and Europe, with at least two more under construction, one in Pennsylvania and another in New Jersey. But operating data centers, especially when those data centers are filled with AI infrastructure, is very expensive.\nSo CoreWeave has taken on substantial debt. And while the company says it has done so responsibly -- never taking on debt unless a signed contract creates a need for additional infrastructure, and only if the contract covers the entire cost of the debt -- the interest payments associated with its debt are already cutting deeply into profitability.\nAs mentioned, CoreWeave said adjusted operating income increased 135% to $200 million in the second quarter. But that number excludes interest expense. When accounting for those costs, the company reported an adjusted net loss of $131 million, a much stepper loss than $5 million in the same quarter last year.\nImportantly, CoreWeave plans to unlock cost efficiencies by acquiring longtime partner Core Scientific, an infrastructure company that owns nine U.S. data centers. Management says the deal, expected to close in the fourth quarter, will eliminate more than $10 billion in future lease overhead, and result in additional annual cost savings of $500 million by the end of 2027.\nHowever, some analysts have raised questions about the terms of the all-stock deal, which stipulate Core Scientific stockholders get 0.1235 shares of CoreWeave for every share of Core Scientific. Those terms valued Core Scientific at $9 billion when the deal was announced. But CoreWeave stock has since dropped 44%.\nThe risk here is shareholder dilution. CoreWeave will probably have to renegotiate deal with a higher exchange ratio to account for the sharp decline in its own stock. In that scenario, current shareholders would be diluted even more extensively than under the original terms.\nCoreWeave trades at a reasonable valuation, but the stock is likely to be volatile\nCoreWeave shares have advanced 125% since its March IPO, but the stock has also fallen 44% from the record high it reached in July. Currently, shares trade at 10 times sales, a very reasonable multiple for a company whose revenue is forecast to increase at 127% annually through 2026.\nHowever, CoreWeave is not expected to be profitable until at least 2027, which means the stock is likely to be volatile in the interim. Only patient investors comfortable with that risk should consider buying this AI stock, and they should start with a very small position.", "content_hash": "a611886bb7ac0b8e075cbe6451f78cab", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The ruling, for instance, leaves intact the multibillion-dollar arrangement that makes Google the default on Apple devices -- a high-margin revenue stream that investors in the iPhone-maker have worried could be curtailed.\nThe market's read-through was simple: Alphabet's win reduces uncertainty for Apple, which reportedly receives around tens of billions of dollars annually from Alphabet to keep Google Search as the default on Safari. Those traffic-acquisition payments have long been a quiet but meaningful contributor to Apple's Services economics, so clarity on their continuation helps sentiment toward the stock.\nFor context, Alphabet shares also rose on the news, underscoring how central these agreements are across the ecosystem.\nApple investors can now pivot from \"Will the deal be killed?\" to \"What does Apple's business look like with the deal preserved?\"\nAdding to Apple's momentum\nThis news just adds to a growing bull case for Apple stock.\nThe tech company's most recent quarter -- fiscal Q3 -- was solid. Revenue rose 10% to $94 billion and earnings per share (EPS) increased 12% to $1.57 -- both June-quarter records. Capturing some of the quarter's key catalysts, Apple's services revenue reached an all-time high and iPhone posted double-digit growth.\nWith this legal overhang behind the company, investors can begin giving more weight to Apple's financial momentum in their analysis. The concern was big enough that it even came up in Apple's most recent earnings call. CEO Tim Cook explicitly conditioned Apple's forward-looking \"color\" on assumptions that \"the current revenue-share agreement with Google continues.\" That's unusually direct language for Apple, indicating the deal's materiality to near-term planning.\nInvestors don't need to model precise dollars to grasp the takeaway: the high-margin engine just avoided a forced reset. Apple's services business mix boasts higher margins than its hardware sales, so preserving the Google payments stabilizes a line item that helps EPS compounding. For the nine months ended June 28, for instance, Apple's services gross margin was 75% -- more than twice its hardware gross margin of 37%.\nWhy this week's ruling matters from here\nNear-term, the decision removes a key bear argument around Apple's services segment's durability. If you believed a ban on default payments would hit high-margin revenue and compress the multiple, that tail risk just faded. Wedbush called the outcome a \"monster win\" for Apple and a \"home run\" for Google -- language that captures why both stocks rallied, even if investors should still track any negotiated tweaks that emerge.\nOf course, with Apple stock rising sharply in recent weeks, valuation is more of a concern. Apple trades at a premium on trailing earnings -- about 36 times earnings as of this writing -- which means upside depends more on execution than multiple expansion from here. However, with the company's iPhone and services segments growing nicely, a clean balance sheet, and steady capital returns, shares still look attractive. But the market will need to see continued momentum in Apple's important services business.\nThe bigger picture for long-term holders is straightforward. This week's ruling kept a high-margin revenue source intact and aligned with what management had assumed on the third-quarter earnings call, reinforcing the base case for EPS growth. There are still risks. Appeal risk and Google's new data-sharing requirements, for instance, add some noise. But Apple now faces that future with one less black cloud and with fundamentals doing their part.", "content_hash": "af65fb1c66e752a6e82c2e347063dc39", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Each has a powerful commerce engine, a fast-growing cloud platform, and a significant opportunity in AI infrastructure and applications.\nBut when you strip away headlines and focus on the operating results and the playbook for the next few years, one option stands out as the clear winner.\nAmazon: broad-based, profitable growth\nAmazon's latest quarter showed healthy top-line growth and strong profit execution. Revenue rose double digits, with both its North America and international year-over-year growth rates in top-line revenue accelerating significantly, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) expanding at a rate of nearly 18% year over year. Operating income climbed sharply as the company continues to drive efficiency across fulfillment and cloud. It's the kind of combination long-term investors want: growth with expanding earnings power.\nFurthermore, AWS's momentum and scale are extraordinary. The cloud-computing business's annualized revenue run rate is now just over $123 billion. The business has powerful momentum in AI. For generative AI solutions, specifically, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in its second-quarter earnings call that it is growing sales by a triple-digit year-over-year percentage and has \"more demand than we have supplied for at the moment.\"\nHighlighting the benefit of Amazon's scale, the cloud computing segment's operating margin remains robust -- at 32.9% (adjusted to exclude the impact of foreign exchange headwinds) in Q2 -- even as Amazon steps up investment in data centers, networking, and accelerators to meet AI demand.\nMeanwhile, Amazon's online store segment, where the company records e-commerce sales, grew by 11% year over year in Q2 -- up from 5% growth in Q1. Similarly, the company's high-margin advertising business clearly accelerated because Amazon's other revenue segment, which primarily consists of advertising sales, grew 19% year over year in Q2 -- up from a growth rate of 4% in Q1.\nAlibaba: A cheaper valuation -- but for a reason\nAlibaba's latest quarter gave investors a clear (and bullish) data point: accelerated cloud growth and the stock ripped higher. Revenue in its cloud intelligence segment rose 26% year over year, powered by an eighth quarter in a row of triple-digit year-over-year growth in AI-related product revenue.\nThe overall picture of Alibaba's business, however, is more nuanced. Total revenue increased just 2% year over year, or 10% when excluding sales in the year-ago quarter from recently sold businesses. Further, Alibaba's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITDA) fell 14% year over year as the e-commerce and cloud-computing company leaned into what it calls \"quick commerce,\" or ultra-fast delivery, broader user experience investments, and AI. These heavy investments also meant that free cash flow went from positive in the year-ago quarter to negative.\nA clear winner\nBoth stocks could end up being long-term winners. But Amazon ultimately offers the better risk-reward.\nAlibaba is cheaper on traditional valuation multiples (but more expensive than it used to be after its recent sharp move higher) and is returning significant capital via buybacks and dividends. This lower valuation helps make up for the company's lower growth and some of the risks associated with China's weak macroeconomic backdrop. Indeed, given how cheap the stock's valuations is (it currently trades at just 15 times earnings), Alibaba could end up being a bargain in hindsight. But only if China's economy picks up speed and consumer and enterprise spending reaccelerate. If this happens, the upside in the stock price could be massive. But the company still has some things it needs to prove to investors to command a higher valuation multiple; it needs to demonstrate scalability, shown by operating margin expansion and free cash flow improvement, as Alibaba grows. We're not there yet.\nUltimately, Amazon offers the cleaner, more reliable setup. The company has three growth vectors that reinforce one another: retail, advertising, and cloud -- and each of these drivers will likely contribute substantially to Amazon's business in the coming years. Retail keeps getting faster and more convenient, ads help further monetize the company's e-commerce customers, and AWS offers investors a fast-growing, high-margin catalyst for the business. Together, Amazon's broad-based catalyst of scaled and profitable business segments provides investors with more certainty when thinking about the company's long-term potential.\nIf I had to pick just one of these two growth stocks today, I'd choose Amazon -- despite its higher valuation of about 35 times earnings. The operating momentum is better, the AI strategy is tied to an already scaled platform, and the cash generation gives the company room to invest through cycles. Alibaba is investable and improving, but the execution bar (and ultimately the risk) is higher.", "content_hash": "3a73d7a5744c1c5677f9f7480385dff9", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The president said that those investing in the US could be exempt from new tariffs.\nThe US President sent out a warning about semiconductor tariffs during a dinner at the White House on Thursday, where he hosted a high-powered group of tech executives.\nThe president has been vocal about wanting to see substantial domestic investment from big tech companies. Trump said that he would soon impose “fairly substantial” tariffs on semiconductor imports, but noted that companies relocating their manufacturing to the US could see their products exempted from the next levy.\n“We’ll be putting a tariff very shortly. You probably are hearing we’ll be putting a fairly substantial tariff,\" the president said, adding that it concerns companies that do not shift production to the US.\n“We’ll be putting tariffs on companies that aren’t coming in,” Trump said. He also mentioned the Apple CEO by name, saying that, regarding the new levies, \"Tim Cook would be in pretty good shape.\"\nNew tariffs for semiconductor imports\nIn August, the US President already talked about imposing a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports during an event with Apple CEO Tim Cook. The tech giant pledged to make an additional $100 billion (€85.7bn) investment in domestic manufacturing at the time, on top of a previously approved $500bn (€428.5bn).\nDuring the dinner at the White House on Thursday, the likes of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Apple CEO Tim Cook found themselves as the centre of attention when Trump asked guests around the table how much they were investing in the country.\nMeta's Mark Zuckerberg, who sat to Trump's right, said $600bn (€514.2bn), Apple's Tim Cook quoted the same and Google's Sundar Pichai promised $250bn (€214.2bn).\n“What about Microsoft?” Trump said. “That's a big number.”\nCEO Satya Nadella said it was up to $80bn (€68.6bn) per year.\n“Good,” Trump responded. “Very good.”\nNotably absent from the guest list was Elon Musk.

Based on estimates from Mordor Intelligence, the global retail industry will grow from an estimated $27.3 trillion this year to about $36.9 trillion by the turn of the decade.\nWith an addressable market this massive, it should come as no surprise that retail is one of the most competitive industries on the planet. However, there are a handful of retail standouts, including e-commerce giant Amazon, superstore chain Walmart, and of course warehouse club Costco Wholesale (COST 0.64%).\nWhile Amazon and Walmart have (mostly) grown their respective businesses traditionally, Costco is the oddball of the bunch. It's known for its quirky deals, such as the $1.50 hot-dog combo for members, generous return policy, and its penchant for selling one-of-a-kind and unexpected items, such as gold bars and luxury jewelry.\nCostco's 79.6 million paying members, as of the end of the fiscal third quarter (May 11, 2025), have come to expect these perks and surprises. But a new rule is a complete game-changer for many of its paying cardholders.\nCostco's executive members just earned a lucrative new perk\nTo shop in one of Costco's more than 900 warehouse locations, you'll need a membership. Approximately 42 million of its paid membership are gold star and business level, which each carry a $65 annual cost. The remaining 37.6 million are executive level, which carries twice the annual cost ($130), but also lays on the perks.\nAccording to Costco, its executive members can earn up to 2% back on most purchases totaling up to $1,250 annually, as well as receive a monthly credit of $10 for eligible delivery orders topping $150. Executive cardholders may also qualify for discounts on Costco travel packages.\nThe reason the company caters to this group is because they're responsible for the bulk of net sales. Despite accounting for \"just\" 47% of total memberships, executive cardholders were responsible for approximately 73% of sales during the fiscal third quarter. Keeping these folks happy and sustaining annual renewal rates above 90% is key to Costco's success.\nBut a newly announced perk for executive members, which was unveiled in June but only fully implemented earlier this week, is bound to turn heads.\nOn June 11, Costco revealed plans to allow its executive cardholders exclusive shopping hours seven days a week in its more than 600 U.S. warehouses. On weekdays and Sundays, only executive members will be allowed to enter its warehouses from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., with this exclusive shopping window narrowed to 30 minutes (9 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.) on Saturdays. Though this policy technically went into effect at the end of June, there had been a two-month grace period where gold star and business members were allowed in. This isn't the case any longer.\nWhile some non-executive members have expressed frustration with this new policy, it's a smart move by Costco to put the proverbial carrot at the end of the stick and encourage existing gold star and business members to upgrade.\nMembership fees are a key ingredient to Costco's competitive edge\nThough membership fees aren't the only factor responsible for making Costco such a successful growth stock and phenomenal multidecade investment, they play an undeniably important role.\nGroceries act as the primary lure responsible for getting people into Costco's warehouses. However, food and beverages traditionally sport razor-thin margins. Since membership fees flow almost entirely to Costco's bottom line, they can be used as something of a buffer to offset the minuscule margins tied to groceries.\nArguably even more important, membership fees afford Costco a pricing buffer. Management understands fully that members of all levels expect various perks, including prices on most groceries that'll undercut traditional mom and pop shops and national grocery chains. The membership fees Costco receives are one of the reasons it can keep prices on basic need goods so comparatively low. It's something of a repeating cycle that works in the company's favor.\nCostco Wholesale's size shouldn't be overlooked, either. When a company has deep pockets, it's often able to buy products in bulk, which reduces the per-unit cost for each item. These lower costs can then be passed along to its members as a key perk to shopping in its warehouses.\nEven though cardholders are likely heading to Costco for groceries and other household necessities, it only takes a handful of higher-margin discretionary purchases for the company to benefit. It also doesn't hurt when members buy Costco's private-label brand, Kirkland Signature, which tends to boast premium margins, relative to comparable products.\nThere's no denying this formula works. Just over 90% of its worldwide customers renewed their memberships, based on fiscal third-quarter data, with an even higher 92.7% renewal rate in the U.S. and Canada. It also boasts exceptional membership pricing power, with the number of paid memberships growing following a fee increase on Sept. 1, 2024.\nThere's a reason investors have been paying a traditionally head-scratching (for a retail company) forward-year earnings multiple of 47 to buy shares of Costco stock. Given its array of competitive advantages, and the exceptional loyalty of its shoppers, there's a good likelihood this new perk is going to mint even more executive level cardholders in the quarters that lie ahead.", "content_hash": "cda69b4754487e45f02c700f686e0666", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

I just wanted to talk about the AI business, specifically the XPU. When you said you're going to grow significantly faster than what you had thought a quarter ago, what's changed? Is it just the impressive prospect moving to a customer definition, or is it stronger demand across the existing three customers? A: I think it's both. But to a large extent, it's the fourth customer that we now add to our roster, which we will ship pretty strongly in 2026. So a combination of increasing volumes from existing three customers and the addition of a fourth customer with immediate and substantial demand really changes our outlook for 2026.\nQ: Near term, from the cyclical bottom, how should we think about the magnitude of the cyclical upturn in the non-AI semiconductor business? Are you seeing continued order improvements in the non-AI segment, which would point to continued cyclical recovery into next fiscal year? A: From a year-on-year Q4 guidance, we are actually up slightly. The only consistent trend we've seen over the last three quarters that is moving up strongly is broadband. Non-AI semiconductor is slow to recover, and Q4 year-on-year is maybe low single digit. I'm expecting to see more of a U-shaped recovery in non-AI, perhaps by late mid '26, late '26.\nQ: Can you help us quantify what is the new fiscal '26 AI guidance? And do you expect the custom versus networking mix to stay broadly what it has been this past year or evolve more towards custom? A: We are expecting and seeing 2026 to accelerate more than the growth rate we see in '25. Regarding the mix, as we gain more experience among four customers, the networking percentage of the pool will be a declining percentage going into '26.\nQ: Could you give some color on the $110 billion backlog? How much of that is AI versus non-AI versus software? A: We generally don't break up backlog, but it's largely driven by AI in terms of growth. Software continues to add steadily, and non-AI has grown double digits. Fully 50% of it at least is semiconductors, and it's fair to say that semiconductor piece is much more AI than non-AI.\nQ: How is the dialogue going beyond these four customers? Are you hearing from others, and how is the trend going with the other three prospects? A: We have identified seven prospects, four of which are now customers. We are very picky and careful about who qualifies, and we may see one more prospect. But right now, for sure, we have seven, and that is pretty much what we have.", "content_hash": "e66039ced60cfdbe0939fcd855381170", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

A quick look at the world's most valuable companies shows that nine of the top 10 are pioneers in AI, all jockeying for a shot at the title.\nNvidia recently made headlines by becoming the world's first $4 trillion company and currently clocks in at $4.1 trillion. Microsoft and Apple are close on its heels, with market caps of $3.7 trillion and $3.5 trillion, respectively. Rounding out the top five are Alphabet and Amazon, worth $2.7 trillion and $2.4 trillion, respectively.\nWith a current market cap of just $372 billion, it may seem premature to suggest that Palantir Technologies (PLTR 0.79%) could soar 169% to earn its place in the $1 trillion club. Yet while many companies are still working to comprehend this paradigm shift, Palantir is helping businesses profit from AI and enriching shareholders along the way.\nDecades of AI expertise\nYears before the company went public, Palantir had been toiling away on advanced AI algorithms for defense and intelligence agencies within the U.S. government. In recent years, the company has also focused on enterprise software that saves businesses time and money.\nBut it was Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform that catapulted the company to AI stardom, as the system leverages generative AI to develop real-time solutions to company-specific problems.\nThe two biggest stumbling blocks to adopting AI are knowing exactly where to begin and getting a solid return on investment (ROI). Palantir was able to solve both of those challenges with a simple strategy.\nPalantir invites developers and business leaders to attend \"boot camps,\" or workshops that show AIP in action. During these interactive sessions, users work side-by-side with Palantir engineers to develop solutions to their real-world business problems.\nThis strategy is a clear winner. In the second quarter, Palantir's revenue of $1 billion climbed 48% year over year and 14% sequentially. The star of the show was its U.S. commercial revenue, which surged 93% to $306 million, representing nearly 31% of total revenue, fueled by ongoing demand for AIP. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.16, which surged 78%.\nThe segment ended the quarter with contract value of $843 million, up 222% year over year. This helped drive Palantir's remaining performance obligation (RPO) -- or contractually obligated sales that aren't yet included in revenue -- up a whopping 77% to $2.4 billion.\nPalantir also boosted its full-year guidance, forecasting at least 85% growth for the U.S. commercial segment (namely AIP) for 2025, up from its previous outlook for 68% growth.\nThe path to $1 trillion\nPalantir's decades of experience and its groundbreaking AI solutions have created a windfall for shareholders, and there could be much more to come.\nAccording to Wall Street, Palantir is expected to generate sales of $4.1 billion in 2025, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of about 89 (not a typo). Assuming its P/S remains constant, Palantir would have to generate revenue of more than $11 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap.\nWall Street is forecasting annual revenue growth of 38.7% for Palantir over the next five years. If the company is able to grow at that pace, it could reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2028. But if Palantir's sales and profit growth continue to accelerate, it could achieve that benchmark even sooner.\nI'm not the only one who thinks so. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has run the models and calculated that Palantir's market cap could hit $1 trillion sometime in 2027 or 2028. Ives argues that investors focused solely on valuation have missed \"every transformational tech stock over the past 20 years.\" He goes on to say that AI will be the driving factor behind Palantir's success.\nPalantir's operational and financial trajectory seems to back up that assertion, as the company continues to announce new and larger customer wins and its sales and profits continue to accelerate.\nEvery rose has its thorns\nLest there be any doubt, and as promising as Palantir is, there are also plenty of things that could go wrong. The development of AI could stall, the economy could hit a rough patch, or Palantir could fail to capitalize on the tremendous opportunity that is AI -- and any of these could send the stock careening lower. Let's not forget the company's valuation, which is extreme, to say the least.\nPalantir is currently selling for 66 times next year's sales and 184 times next year's earnings. History shows that the higher the multiple, the more extreme the volatility, and Palantir isn't immune. Investors should prepare themselves for significant stock price movements, which aren't for the faint of heart.\nEstimates abound for the potential of generative AI, but the software opportunity alone is intriguing. Cathie Wood, founder and CEO of Ark Investment Management, suggests that if software purveyors are able to capture 10% of the value created by their AI-focused products, it could generate as much as $14 trillion in revenue in 2030.\nIf Palantir continues along its current trajectory, helping companies drive positive ROI for their AI spending -- and I believe it can -- it could achieve a $1 trillion market cap sooner than many expect.", "content_hash": "dbb9de435376779d026bc8e18dbf2f4e", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Apple’s marquee iPhones accounted for a majority of the sales, and demand for MacBook computers also surged.\nThe outsized jump — which hasn’t been previously reported — is a boost for the Cupertino, California-based company at a time it’s grappling with plateauing mobile device sales around the world. While India represents still a fraction of its overall business, the company is investing in a country it expects to become a key market in coming years.\nThat’s particularly important given volatile consumption in and geopolitical uncertainty around China, today its largest overseas base.

It’s also is planning to launch a new outlet in Noida, on the outskirts of Delhi, and another in Mumbai early next year.\nThe US company in 2023 reshuffled management of its international businesses, making India its own sales region due to the growth potential the market offers with its rising incomes and a burgeoning middle class. IPhones, viewed by many Indians as a status symbol, currently account for about 7% of the local smartphone market, according to Tarun Pathak of Counterpoint Research.\nIndia’s local sourcing requirements prevented Apple from opening its iconic stores in the South Asian nation for years. As the policy eased, Apple finally launched its online store in India in 2020.

The goal is to give high net worth investors access to private funds, primarily in private equity, that aren't typically among the options offered by most wealth managers. In other words, it's finding even more exclusive opportunities in an already exclusive market.\nREAD MORE:\nSeparately,\nMeanwhile,\nAll in for alts\nThe firms' announcements\nWhatever the pitfalls, numerous surveys and reports suggest investor demand for alternatives is running high. The investment bank Robert A. Stanger reported in January that $122 billion was raised for alts from everyday \"retail\" investors in 2024, topping the previous high of $105 billion set in 2022.\nMeanwhile Bank of America Private Bank found last year that demand for alternatives is particularly strong among investors between the ages of 21 and 43. Drawing on results from a\nThat cohort's allocation is already higher than older clients' — 17% of their total portfolios vs. 5% for investors 44 and older. And they want more.\nMerrill and Bank of America Private Bank's offering for the ultrarich\nBank of America Private Bank and Merrill is among the many large wealth managers scrambling to meet this demand with an array of new products and offerings. Its Alts Expanded Access Program for investors with $50 million or more \"will be supplemental to the core alternative platform that we already have, and ultimately, it'll allow us to bring more offerings to market than we do today,\" said Mark Sutterlin, head of alternative investments.\nSutterlin said Merrill and the private bank are working with a third-party firm — which he declined to name — to find harder-to-access private investments that may be of interest to ultrahigh net worth clients.\nSometimes these opportunities will come with smaller-than-usual capacity allotments, meaning the percentage of a fund set aside for investors at a particular institution. Also unlike standard investments in private equity, the offerings will allow investors to become limited partners in the funds they're putting money into. As a result, they will have greater responsibility for vetting the various opportunities they're presented with. Sutterlin said that doesn't mean Merill and the private bank are abandoning their fiduciary duties to investors. Ultimately, he said, and that they will still be responsible for making sure anything they recommend is in their clients' best interests.\n\"But I would say that the ability for investors to do independent diligence, and the expectation that these investors are going to have more experience in private markets and a higher level of expertise in terms of private market investing, is part of what allows us to do a broader based offering for these types of funds,\" Sutterlin said.\nSutterlin said advisors at Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank are now learning about the Alts Expanded Access Program and they'll begin to introduce clients to funds through it starting this fall. He said there are no plans now to offer it to investors below the $50 million asset threshold.\nGoldman and the push to allow alts in retirement plans\nElsewhere, though, a movement is afoot to bring more of the so-called mass affluent into private and alternative markets — and it's\nPresident Donald Trump\nThe order provoked an outcry. American Retirement Association CEO Brian Graff argued that fiduciaries, not the government, should be the ones deciding if an investment class is appropriate for plan participants.\n\"Professional retirement plan fiduciaries that are subject to strict fiduciary standards — not the federal government — are in the best position to assess developments in the financial markets and determine what is in the financial best interest of retirement plan participants and beneficiaries,\" Graff said in a statement in response to Trump's executive order.\nDee Sawyer, head of global distribution at T. Rowe Price, said the target date funds are still being designed for release by the middle of next year so it's hard to say now exactly what strategies they will employ.\n\"Everybody is unique, but at different points in time, you can have an exposure to different types of solutions, including private markets, and we think that there's opportunities to have that across the spectrum,\" Sawyer said.\nSawyer said she and her colleagues at T. Rowe Price welcomed Trump's order calling on the DOL to reconsider its fiduciary guidelines for private investments in retirement plans.\n\"And the reason for that is because it allows more plan sponsors the ability to offer these solutions from a fiduciary perspective, without a concern of litigation risk, which is a real concern of plan sponsors,\" she said.\nMeanwhile,\nGreg Wilson, head of retirement for\n\"Companies are staying private longer,\" Wilson said. \"So when you look at private equity returns over a 10-, 15- and 20-year basis, they've outperformed public equity equivalents. Making these available to the primary source of retirement savings today, which is in the 401(k) plan, we think is absolutely appropriate within a professionally managed portfolio.\"\nWells sees the value in simplicity even with complex products\nMeanwhile,\nWells is working with the wealth technology firm InvestCloud to offer UMA clients access not only to alternative markets but trading strategies involving derivatives and long and short positions that can be used to reduce investing risks. Previously, Maddox said, Wells advisors had to manage clients' allocations to private markets separate from all their other investments.\nBy bringing it all into one system, advisors should have an easier time with tasks like rebalancing — or buying and selling assets to make sure they maintain a certain proportion to each other in a portfolio. To be included in the UMA, alternative investments and other products also can't charge clients separate sales commissions; everything has to be paid for using a simple fee.\n\"This just makes it very simple for advisors and clients to understand where it's just one account wrap fee,\" Maddox said.\n\"This consolidation of different investment product types into one platform, one program, one advisory relationship, is an industry trend,\" he added. \"I think that will continue. We'll start to see everything kind of collapse into these single-platform sources.\"\nThe biggest barrier to getting into alts\nTo Brian Griggs, the head of portfolio strategy and solutions at the investment management firm Nuveen, the biggest barrier to bringing more regular investors into private markets is a simple lack of understanding. One of Nuveen's lines of business is working with wealth managers at registered investment advisors and other firms and helping them provide opportunities in alternatives and other markets.\nTo better shed light on the benefits but also possible risks of alts, Nuveen has started what it calls its\n\"I would say 5% might be too little,\" Griggs said. \"It might not be worth the extra effort of understanding these assets if you're just going to allocate 5%. But then we also work with some family offices and RIAs that have some of their clients with anywhere up to 50% in private markets.\"\nThe biggest of those factors is an investor's likely need for cash at any given moment. One of the knocks against private investments is that they are often \"illiquid\" — or harder to pull money out of than stocks and bonds.\n\"I think most advisors would say most of their clients don't need 100% of their portfolio in liquid stocks and bonds,\" Griggs said. \"So if you can answer that question with confidence, then all of a sudden it opens up the opportunity to put more of the portfolio in these more diversifying private markets.\"", "content_hash": "ff52bd4a2156c00207f2d1c866bcd60a", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Clients will eventually gain direct access to data rooms and fund information, a nod to the institutionalization of private wealth.\nBut this move isn't happening in isolation. Wall Street's biggest players are all repositioning. Goldman Sachs (GS) just committed up to $1 billion to partner with T.

Morgan Stanley has already entered the arena with a fund focused on co-investments and secondaries in the lower-middle market.

That's left firms like Apollo (NYSE:APO), Ares (NYSE:ARES), Blackstone (NYSE:BX), and KKR (NYSE:KKR) hunting for new capital. The next frontier? Mini-millionaires.

Under the deal, BlackRock will take over portfolio management duties for thousands of Citi's high-net-worth clients, while Citi retains advisory control. About 100 staff, including CIO Robert Jasminski, will make the jump. Completion is targeted for year-end.\nThis isn't just another asset management outsourcing. It's a structural bet.

This was followed by Fidelity’s FETH, which added $65.8 million, and Grayscale’s lower-fee Mini Trust, which attracted $62.5 million.\nBitwise logged $20.8 million in fresh inflows, while other issuers such as VanEck, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, and Invesco saw no major changes.\nDespite the setback, cumulative inflows across all Ethereum ETFs remain positive at $13.34 billion, with BlackRock accounting for about $13 billion of that total.\nThe surge reverses a trend from August, when Ethereum funds dominated activity. ETH products attracted $3.87 billion in inflows last month compared with $751 million in Bitcoin outflows.\nTrading volumes showed the divergence, with Ethereum ETF activity jumping to $58.3 billion in August, nearly double July’s total, while Bitcoin volumes slipped to $78.1 billion.\nEthereum also posted a new all-time high of $4,953 in August, supported by corporate treasuries holding a combined $119.6 billion of ETH by the end of the month.\nBut September is telling a different story. On August 29, Ethereum ETFs logged $164.6 million in outflows, breaking a five-day inflow streak that had added $1.5 billion.\nCumulative inflows remain positive at $13.34 billion, almost entirely concentrated in BlackRock’s ETHA, which accounts for $13.1 billion. Analysts note Ethereum historically struggles in September, citing $46.5 million in ETF outflows during the same month in 2024.\nBitcoin, by contrast, gained $1.26 billion that September, benefiting from risk-off positioning.\nWhales Scoop Up $620M in Ether as Institutions Boost Exposure\nDespite the latest ETF withdrawals, whale and institutional activity suggest a sustained appetite for Ether.\nLast week, nine large addresses purchased $456.8 million worth of ETH, with five wallets receiving transfers from custodian BitGo and others acquiring coins through Galaxy Digital.\nLookonchain data added that newly created wallets accumulated another 35,948 ETH, worth $164 million, within eight hours, with tokens sourced from FalconX and Galaxy Digital.\nInstitutions are also active. Bitmine received 14,665 ETH worth $65.3 million from Galaxy Digital, while three wallets received 65,662 ETH, valued at $293 million, from FalconX.\nMeanwhile, BlackRock deposited 33,884 ETH, worth $148.6 million, into Coinbase Prime. The activity follows reports that the firm sold $151.4 million in ETH while doubling its Bitcoin purchases, illustrating shifting allocations between the two assets.\nEthereum’s relative strength adds context. Over the past month, Ether has gained 18.5%, while Bitcoin has slipped 6.4%. ETH now trades 6.7% below its record high, while Bitcoin remains more than 10% off its $124,500 all-time high earlier this year\nAnalysts pointed out that some long-term Bitcoin holders are taking profits. A whale who bought BTC in 2013 at $332 recently moved 750 coins, worth $83.3 million, to Binance. On-chain watchers suggested the funds could rotate into Ethereum, echoing earlier transactions where whales sold Bitcoin to buy Ether.\nOne such trade this month saw 670 BTC, worth $76 million, converted into 68,130 ETH valued at $295 million. Another long-dormant address withdrew 6,334 ETH, worth $28 million, from Kraken after years of inactivity.\nBitcoin Consolidates as Binance Futures Volume Hits $2.6 Trillion\nBitcoin (BTC) is trading at $110,778, down 0.7% in the past 24 hours and 1.9% over the week. The asset remains 10.5% below its $124,500 all-time high.\nNotably, over the weekend, BTC dropped to $107,400, its lowest level in seven weeks, before rebounding to $112,000.\nGlassnode data shows the correction cooled the “euphoric phase” that began in mid-August, when 100% of Bitcoin’s supply was in profit.\nSustaining such conditions typically requires strong inflows, which faded by late August. Currently, 90% of supply remains in profit, within the $104,100–$114,300 cost basis range.\nGlassnode noted that a break below $104,100 could trigger another post-ATH drawdown, while a recovery above $114,300 would indicate renewed demand.\nShort-term holders saw profits collapse from above 90% to just 42% during the decline. While the rebound restored profitability to over 60% of their supply, analysts warned that the recovery is fragile.\nGlassnode said only a move above $114,000–$116,000, where 75% of short-term holders would be in profit, could restore confidence for a fresh rally.\nResistance remains heavy in the $111,700–$115,500 zone, which aligns with the 50-day and 100-day simple moving averages.\n“BTC has been consolidating below its previous local range and has failed to retake it,” trader Daan Crypto Trades noted on X, adding that the $107,000 monthly low may not hold if selling pressure intensifies.\nSource: Daan Crypto Trades\nMeanwhile, Binance futures trading surged to a record $2.62 trillion in August, up from $2.55 trillion in July, according to CryptoQuant. The spike reflects heightened volatility, increased hedge fund and institutional participation, and rising open interest.\nAnalysts cautioned that while strong derivatives activity indicates liquidity, futures-driven momentum without stable spot inflows often precedes sharp corrections.\nFor now, Bitcoin remains range-bound, with bulls needing to reclaim $114,000 to confirm a stronger recovery.\n- New ChatGPT AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Avalanche and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana and Pepe by the End of 2025\n- Perplexity AI Predicts the Price of XRP, World Liberty Financial and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Why Is Crypto Down Today? – September 4, 2025\n- XRP Price Prediction: Gaming Giant Expands to XRP Ledger – Shocking Move to $10 Starting Now\n- New ChatGPT AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Avalanche and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana and Pepe by the End of 2025\n- Perplexity AI Predicts the Price of XRP, World Liberty Financial and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Why Is Crypto Down Today? – September 4, 2025\n- XRP Price Prediction: Gaming Giant Expands to XRP Ledger – Shocking Move to $10 Starting Now", "content_hash": "aecc8ce34dfcf2eac1eaa48e377df0bd", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

And we’ve seen behavioral change on items that have gone up in cost because of tariffs, where they’re switching from one item to the other. Some of the behavioral stuff that you always see during times of pressure.\n“But generally speaking, people have held up really well and we expect the same thing to happen for the balance of the year,” he said. “Big picture, customers want low prices, a really broad assortment, a great experience buying it and they want to do business with somebody they trust. And e-commerce changed the game, obviously, as it relates to retail. The assortment that you can get is incredible. And the delivery, accuracy, and speed, we’re all learning how to improve as it relates to that.”\nWalmart isn’t alone in trying to fine-tune after refocusing its business — it’s kind of a mini-trend right now.\nLevi Strauss & Co. has really been pushing its evolution into a much more retail-oriented business and has gotten a lot of spotlight over the last year with its Beyoncé Knowles-Carter ads.\nNow the brand has to follow up on the Queen Bey.\nHarmit Singh, chief financial and growth officer at Levi’s, said the denim giant plans to sustain the marketing momentum.\n“This year was about music,” Singh said. “Next year, we’ve got the Super Bowl at the Levi’s Stadium, we’ve got the World Cup at the Levi’s Stadium. There are definitely a couple of things that we feel over time will continue to maintain the sustained growth that we’re seeing, we’d like to be a mid-digit-growth company, which is about 5 percent.”\nLike many other brands, Levi’s is more cautious going into the second half, but feeling good about what it can control.\n“We’re very confident about our product offers and our marketing,” Singh said. “There are probably going to be winners and losers as the macroeconomics play out, I think we’ll be in the winners category because we have the product, we have the people, we have the stores and we have great marketing.”\nThat’s a playbook a lot of the big companies are working from.\nStefan Larsson, CEO at PVH Corp., has been rebuilding the approach at the company’s two mega brands: Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger.\n“We lean into the iconic brand love,” Larsson told analysts. “We lean into the biggest and most iconic categories. We put a lot of innovation into the most important products. We amplify it with cut-through campaigns. In Calvin in the second quarter, you saw where we have put innovation into underwear, we’re up 14 percent. Where we have put innovation into new denim, we’re up 19 percent.”\nIt hasn’t always been an easy transition, especially as Calvin Klein looked to centralize its design in New York.\n“Calvin Klein two, three years ago had a completely decentralized product creation,” the CEO said. “So we pulled it together and built global product creation capabilities, same as we already have for Tommy. And we were overconfident — took too many parts of this together in one season. And the team realized that they were on their heels in the middle of a product season, and it had a big negative impact on the gross margin this year. It’s super frustrating.”\nBut he said the company rolled up its sleeves and is now much better set for the long term.\n“There is not a single successful competitor that doesn’t have a global product capability,” Larsson said. “We had to do it, and we hit some turbulence and then we fixed it. But that’s why I wanted to just shout out to say, it was painful to share last quarter. It’s less painful today because we have fixed it.”", "content_hash": "6ff9fb4bc4846e636ce3d09bff986f56", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

PME, another major Dutch fund, is reevaluating a 5 billion mandate with BlackRock, following months of pressure from climate advocacy group Fossil Free Netherlands. The nonprofit's Break with BlackRock campaign has gained momentum, urging savers to push their funds to cut ties with managers perceived to be backtracking on climate stewardship. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) said it offers clients the ability to participate in proxy voting, while L&G reaffirmed its long-term commitment to responsible investing. But in this case, PFZW decided that wasn't enough.\nWith the reshuffle, PFZW is handing its 50 billion equity portfolio to a new lineup that includes Robeco, Man Numeric, Acadian, Lazard, Schroders, M&G, UBS, and PGGM. AQR declined to commentbut it's worth noting that only 80% of its $146 billion AUM reportedly integrates ESG signals, and Asness himself once suggested that doing good and generating returns might not always go hand in hand. For PFZW, that kind of nuance may no longer cut it. The direction is clear: if you're not evolving on ESG, you're out of the room.", "content_hash": "3897eaf71228bdd6219a622bbb60a408", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Much of today’s crypto stack either explicitly or implicitly caters to trading (a highly valuable use case in its own right) but is comparatively underoptimized for payments,” wrote Matt Huang, Paradigm’s founder and the lead at Tempo.\nIn addition to low fees and its payments-centric experience, the network expects to enable more than 100,000 transactions per second (TPS) with privacy features that will allow users to keep some transaction details hidden. It will also make use of an automated market maker (AMM) that allows transaction fees to be paid via any stablecoin.\nThrilled to team up with @Tempo as a design partner to see what’s possible with a payments-first blockchain. The pace of crypto innovation is incredible at this time, and we’re ready to learn and build alongside them. https://t.co/1LmfXeDZxI\n— Andy Fang (@andyfang) September 4, 2025\n“Tempo eases the path to bringing real-world flows on-chain,” Huang posted on X, highlighting Tempo’s potential for onboarding global payrolls, remittances, microtransactions, and agentic payments to blockchain.\nThe network is currently in private testnet, as the team experiments with use cases like e-commerce and cross-boarder payments with its global partners, according to its website.\nSome of its design partners are also acting as validators for the network, but Tempo will eventually transition to an open, permissionless network. In other words, anyone will be able to participate in network validation in the future.\n“At Stripe, we care about high-throughput, low-latency payments use cases,” wrote Stripe CEO Patrick Collison. “As the use of stablecoins (and crypto more broadly) grows across Stripe, Bridge, and Privy, we found that existing blockchains are not optimized for them.”\nStripe’s incubation of Tempo will rival layer-1 network plans from Google and Circle, as crypto becomes increasingly intertwined with traditional finance.\nThe payments giant acquired crypto wallet infrastructure firm Privy in June, less than one year after spending $1.1 billion to snatch up stablecoin payment platform, Bridge.\nTempo wasn't the only stablecoin network announcement on Thursday, either. Crypto infrastructure firm Fireblocks also launched its Fireblocks Network, which is supported by USDC issuer Circle and more than 40 other providers.", "content_hash": "4c05ef950b41dfb58c5222b7ef584f77", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for payrolls to rise by 75,000.\nThe report showed a marked slowdown from the July increase of 79,000, which was revised up by 6,000. Revisions also showed a net loss of 13,000 in June after the prior estimate was lowered by 27,000.\n\"The job market is stalling short of the runway,\" said Daniel Zhao, chief economist at jobs site Glassdoor. \"The labor market is losing lift, and August's report, along with downward revisions, suggests we're heading into turbulence without the soft landing achieved.\"\nMarkets largely disregarded the report, with stocks up at the open and Treasury yields sharply lower. Traders in the futures markets raised the probability of a quarter percentage point Fed rate cut to 100% and went even further, pricing in a 12% probability of a half-point move, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge.\nThe payrolls count was the first since President Donald Trump fired former BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following the release of the July jobs report a month ago. The move came after the report showed not just a weak level of job creation but also dramatic reductions in previous months' totals.\nIn McEntarfer's place, the president nominated economist E.J. Antoni, a Trump loyalist from the Heritage Foundation who previously had criticized the BLS numbers as being politically distorted. William Wiatrowski is serving as acting BLS commissioner.\nWhile the pace of hiring was slow, average hourly earnings increased 0.3% for the month, meeting the estimate, though the annual gain of 3.7% was slightly below the forecast for 3.8%.\nHiring was held back by a payroll reduction in the federal government, which reported a decline of 15,000.\nHealth care again led sectors, adding 31,000 jobs, while social assistance contributed 16,000. Wholesale trade and manufacturing both saw declines of 12,000 on the month.\nThe report comes as markets widely expect the Fed to lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point when it releases its next decision Sept. 17. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his fellow policymakers also have been under heavy criticism from the president as they have been on hold since last cutting in December 2024.\nThough most economic indicators indicate continued expansion, Fed officials have expressed concern about a slowdown in hiring even as layoffs have held fairly steady. At the same time, policymakers worry that Trump's tariffs could reignite inflation, with data indicating a slow but steady increase in prices over recent months.\n\"The warning bell that rang in the labor market a month ago just got louder. A weaker-than-expected jobs report all but seals a 25-basis-point rate cut later this month,\" said Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings. \"Four straight months of manufacturing job losses stand out. It's hard to argue that tariff uncertainty isn't a key driver of this weakness.\"\nWhile the establishment survey showed weak job creation, the more volatile household count, used to calculate the unemployment rate, held better news.\nThat report showed an increase of 288,000 employed, though the ranks of the unemployed also rose by 148,000. The labor force participation rate edged higher to 62.3% while the labor force swelled by 436,000, accounting for the tick higher in the unemployment rate.\nA broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons climbed to 8.1%, a 0.2 percentage point increase and the highest level since October 2021.\nAlong with the jobs numbers tally, the BLS on Tuesday will release the initial estimate for annual benchmark revisions to the numbers dating back one year from March 2025.\nRevisions have been a source of controversy, particularly in the post-Covid era as the response rate has declined, particularly for the headline establishment survey that asks businesses and government agencies to detail the pace of hiring.\nThe BLS typically releases its initial estimate with the first batch of survey responses it gets, then updates two times as it gets more information. However, Trump has accused the BLS of being politically biased. The firing of McEntarfer drew widespread criticism in the economics and markets community.\nIn a CNBC interview, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said he expects the August payrolls count to get revised higher. In the past three years, the initial August count actually was revised lower from the initial estimate.\nCorrection: The BLS on Tuesday will release the initial estimate for annual benchmark revisions to the numbers dating back one year from March 2025.

It would also give Musk increased voting power over the EV maker and aspiring robotics titan, which he has publicly demanded since early 2024.\nTesla Chairwoman Robyn Denholm told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin the plan was designed to keep the CEO \"motivated and focused on delivering for the company.\"\n\"If he performs, if he hits the super ambitious milestones that are in the plan then he gets equity — it's 1% for each half a trillion dollars of market cap, plus operational milestones he has to hit in order to do that,\" Denholm said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\nThe full award would give Musk more than 423 million additional shares. He currently holds about a 13% stake in the company.\nDenholm confirmed that the Tesla CEO pay plan, if approved by shareholders, would not put any limit on where and how Musk spends his time or require him to spend any minimum number of hours per week on Tesla business.\nTo obtain the first award in the plan, Musk and Tesla would need to almost double their current market cap to reach $2 trillion. The final benchmark is reaching an $8.5 trillion market cap.\nThe operational milestones in the 2025 CEO Performance Award include: 20 million Tesla vehicles delivered, 10 million active FSD Subscriptions, 1 million robots delivered, 1 million Robotaxis in commercial operation and a series of adjusted EBITDA benchmarks.\nMusk has remained politically embroiled, while also running a collection of companies, including aerospace and defense contractor SpaceX, drilling venture The Boring Company, health tech company Neuralink and the artificial intelligence venture, xAI, which has merged with his social network, X.\nTesla also said in the filing Friday that it will ask shareholders at the Nov. 6 meeting to vote on whether the company should invest in Musk's newest venture, xAI.\nMusk first floated the idea publicly with an informal poll on X last July, asking whether Tesla should invest $5 billion into xAI.\nFounded in early 2023 in Nevada, xAI merged with Musk's social network X earlier this year. The company now operates a massive data center in Memphis, and plans to build out another facility there to help train and run its large language models and a chatbot called Grok.\nPay plan controversy\nThe new pay proposal for Musk comes after the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled last year that his 2018 pay plan was excessive, had been improperly granted by the Tesla board and must be rescinded.\nIn that case, Tornetta v. Musk, a judge found that the Tesla CEO had controlled pay negotiations at the automaker, and his board of directors failed to give shareholders information that they were legally entitled to before telling them they should vote to approve Musk's performance-based pay plan.\nThe case is now on appeal.", "content_hash": "09f593d3e7974c4e760a806746de481c", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Analysts quickly pointed to OpenAI.\nFollowing a better-than-expected earnings report late Thursday, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan told analysts that a fourth large customer had put in orders for $10 billion in custom artificial intelligence chips, which the company calls XPUs.\n\"One of these prospects released production orders to Broadcom, and we have accordingly characterized them as a qualified customer for XPUs,\" Tan said. He added that the order increased Broadcom's forecast for AI revenue next year, when shipments will begin.\nAnalysts at Mizuho, Cantor Fitzgerald and KeyBanc all said they think AI startup OpenAI is the customer. The Financial Times reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the partnership, that the two companies co-designed a chip that will hit the market next year.\nOpenAI declined to comment on the report.\nWhile Broadcom doesn't name its large web-scale customers, analysts have said dating back to last year that its first three clients were Google, Meta and TikTok parent ByteDance.\n\"During the call, the company surprised us by noting that it had secured a $10B order from a fourth XPU customer (we believe this is OpenAI), adding significant upside to the company's three current XPU customers (Google, Meta, and ByteDance),\" analysts at Cantor wrote in a note late Thursday. \"Shipments are expected to commence in 2026.\"\nBroadcom's stock has been on a tear of late as the company has joined Nvidia at the front of the race to build the kinds of processors and infrastructures needed for massive AI workloads. The stock is up about 130% in the past year, lifting Broadcom's market cap past $1.6 trillion.\nFor the fiscal third quarter, Broadcom reported earnings and revenue that topped estimates. The company said it expects $17.4 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, higher than the $17.02 billion expected by Wall Street analysts, with AI revenue reaching $6.2 billion.\nBut news of an incoming $10 billion customer is what got Wall Street excited.\nTan said on the call that \"immediate and fairly substantial demand\" boosts the outlook for next year, \"and really changes our thinking of what 2026 would be starting to look like.\"\nThe company didn't provide specific guidance for next year, but Tan suggested that growth in its AI could be above the 50% to 60% range he'd offered in the prior call.\nAnalysts at Mizuho raised their AI revenue growth estimate for next year to 76% up from about 60%, which would bring the total to $35 billion. Total revenue for the year ending in October 2026 is expected to increase about 30% to $81.8 billion from $63.1 billion this fiscal year, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG.\nIn addition to hardware, Broadcom has a large software business, keyed by its $61 billion acquisition of server virtualization software vendor VMware in 2023. Revenue in the infrastructure software business, which includes VMWare, rose 43% to $6.79 billion.\n— CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report.\nWATCH: Broadcom shares spike", "content_hash": "1948b6cfdbabd890fbb2e757b4e3642a", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The 35-page report includes data on tickets sold, net ticket receipts, the visiting team's share of gate receipts and club seat premiums, gross general admission ticket prices, and the premium paid for club seats for the preseason and regular season for all 32 teams. The ticketing data in this CNBC report was sourced from that document.\nThe NFL requires every team to give 34% of ticket revenue and the licensing amount of a club seat to the league based on an internal formula, according to several NFL executives who asked to remain unnamed so they could speak freely about private conversations. This pool, known as the visiting team's share, or VTS, is mostly redistributed equally among the 32 teams. In 2024, each team received $27 million, up from $25 million the previous year, according to the league executives.\nStory continues after interactive chart.\nThe VTS money not redistributed is used by the NFL to fund league-level lending programs that go toward the private financing of new stadiums and renovations. Some teams are granted waivers by the NFL on a portion of their VTS contribution if they are using stadium revenue to finance construction or renovations. The Las Vegas Raiders and Los Angeles Rams, for example, received waivers of $23.4 million and $12.2 million, respectively, for their new stadiums, according to the NFL executives.\nThe league's 32 teams collected an average of $433 million in national revenue in 2024 from media, licensing and sponsorship agreements, said the executives. National revenue made up about two-thirds of overall league revenue. Local revenue — including tickets, suites, stadium sponsorships, concessions, parking and non-NFL stadium events — accounted for the remainder.\nThe San Francisco 49ers led the league in net ticket receipts — the amount the team keeps after taxes, fees and surcharges — with $176.5 million in 2024.

It will sideline major store renovations and development in the meantime.\nWhile the changes will vary based on the location, expect more seating, dark wood paneling and other tweaks that make its cafes cozier. The renovations will also include changes like less harsh lighting that won't affect customers with light sensitivity.\n\"We're uplifting more than 1,000 coffeehouses over the next year, blending our global heritage with local relevance to create spaces that are immersive, inclusive, and deeply human,\" Dawn Clark, Starbucks senior vice president of coffeehouse design and concepts, said in a statement to CNBC.\n\"Whether it's the laid-back warmth of the Palisades or the urban energy of Manhattan, intentional design encourages customers to stay longer, connect more, and return often — and translates into meaningful business impact,\" Clark said.\nStarbucks is planning to spend about $150,000 on each \"uplift,\" without closing the stores down. The company started with locations in New York, followed by cafes in Southern California.\nThe makeovers are intended to make the stores more welcoming, returning Starbucks to its prior status as a \"third place\" for customers to hang out between home and work. In recent years, Starbucks had lost that reputation, fueled by decisions like removing seats as mobile ordering become popular and getting rid of outlets to discourage lingering.\nUnder CEO Brian Niccol, the chain plans to reverse many of those decisions as it tries to break a sales slump. For example, he previously told employees in June that he plans to add back the 30,000 seats that had been removed from cafes.\nBut trying to appeal to a wider swath of customers isn't new for the company. Starbucks first unveiled an accessible store design in early 2024, before Niccol's tenure. At the time, the company said that the design took about two years and included input from baristas.\nTake a look inside a recently renovated New York City cafe near Manhattan's Union Square.\nBefore the renovation, the location lacked many decorative touches, besides some large-scale photos of the chain's Hacienda Alsacia, its coffee and research farm in Costa Rica.\nWith such sparse seating, the cafe's concrete floors were more obvious. Harsh lighting didn't help the store's appearance either.\nThe location now features much more seating near the entrance. Leather accents to the wraparound booth make the seats more comfortable. The tables are easily movable and at an accessible height for wheelchair users.\nStarbucks also brought back the electrical outlets that disappeared in prior makeovers. Now customers who want to study or work from the location can charge their laptops or phones, encouraging them to stay longer.\nLarge area rugs bring a cozy touch, in addition to dampening some of the cafe's ambient noise. Live plants also add to the homey vibe of the space.\nHigh-top tables, positioned closer to the barista bar, offer a seating option for customers looking to sit down with companions. The makeover adds 16 more seats to the location.\nStarbucks also changed out its lightbulbs to soften the store's lighting and reduce glare, giving it a warmer atmosphere. The improved lighting helps highlight an existing mural, seen on the right of the photo above.\nBehind the barista bar, the company added a large shelving unit that highlights bags of its coffee, plus decorative burlap sacks that hold beans. Touches of purple are a nod to the nearby New York University.\nCustomers waiting to pick up their drinks can sit off to the side. Previously, the area was a standing bar that wasn't accessible to wheelchair users.\nIn addition to adding rugs, Starbucks also improved the location's overall insulation to cut down on the clamor of a busy coffee shop. For baristas, the change means that conversations among customers are less likely to disturb their work, whether that's hearing an order correctly or focusing on making a latte.", "content_hash": "d6decec73068e181c917c3e83fd6eca7", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Broadcom saw a dramatic acceleration in spending on AI chips and is adding new customers beyond TikTok parent ByteDance, Meta, and Alphabet . The chipmaker posted a beat and raise Thursday after the bell, but the stock didn't really take off until CEO Hock Tan talked about $10 billion in custom AI-related orders from a new customer. VMWare, the software giant Broadcom bought for $69 billion nearly two years ago, was strong too. We raised our price target on shares, which are up 15% this morning. 4. Lululemon is disappointing again, with the stock plunging nearly 20% after the company gave a worse-than-expected full-year outlook. Too expensive and too much competition. No more de minimis exception, which allowed packages under a certain value to enter the U.S. without paying tariffs. Multiple downgrades on the Street. The end of athleisure or on to the next buzzy brand? 5. UnitedHealth caught a price target raise at Bernstein, which went to $379 from $337. It was the second PT boost this week for the health insurer. Is the bottom in? The analysts also raised CVS Health to $77 from $72. 6. JPMorgan cut its FedEx price target to $285 from $290 heading into the company's Sept. 18 earnings. The firm said estimates for fiscal Q1 could come in weak thanks to \"stagnant\" business-to-business demand. 7 . Wells Fargo raised its price target on American Express to $375 from $350 — remains incredibly strong. I've been a fan of this one for ages. 8. DoorDash 's price target was raised to $306 from $280 at Wells, which raised its 2026 EBITDA estimates. 9. J.B. Hunt downgraded to hold from buy at UBS, noting that a pricing inflection in the truckload market is less likely in the near term. No demand catalyst in sight. 10. Barclays lowered its price target on Adobe to $460 from $567 heading into its earnings report next week. The firm kept an overweight buy rating, though. Adobe uses the same model as struggling Club stock Salesforce — they charge too much.

It also anticipates full-year revenue of $10.85 billion to $11 billion, compared with Wall Street expectations of $11.18 billion.\n\"We are facing yet another shift today within the industry related to tariffs and the cost of doing business,\" CEO Calvin McDonald said on a call with analysts. \"The increased rates and removal of the de minimis provisions have played a large part in our guidance reduction for the year.\"\nTune in at 10 a.m. ET: Lululemon CEO Calvin McDonald joins CNBC to discuss the company's earnings.

Gross margin decreased 1.1 percentage points to 58.5%, and operating margin decreased 210 basis points to 20.7%.\nChief Financial Officer Meghan Frank said on the call that the removal of the de minimis exemption, which excluded some smaller shipments from tariffs, will significantly affect the company, representing roughly 1.7 percentage points of the 2.2 percentage-point tariff-related decline in profit expected for the year.\nSame-store sales in the Americas were down 4%. Overall comparable sales increased just 1% compared to Wall Street estimates of 2.2%. Lululemon said it added 14 net new stores during the second quarter, bringing its total to 784 stores.\n\"My view is that it's now time to reset many of our practices related to how we develop and create the range of products that will fuel the next phase of our growth,\" McDonald said Thursday. \"We have seen that when we get our product right, everything else can follow.\"\nLululemon projects third-quarter revenue will come in between $2.47 billion and $2.50 billion compared to Wall Street estimates of $2.57 billion. The company said it expects earnings per share in the next quarter to come in between $2.18 and $2.23 per share, compared to an estimate of $2.93 per share.\nMcDonald said on the Thursday call that he believes the company has let its product lifecycles \"run too long,\" particularly in its lounge and social categories.\n\"We have become too predictable within our casual offerings and missed opportunities to create new trends,\" he said, identifying those issues as the \"root causes\" of the company's product challenges in the U.S.\n\"Our lounge and social product offerings have become stale and have not been resonating with guests,\" McDonald added.\nTo regain its U.S. momentum, McDonald said the company plans to increase its new styles from 23% of its overall assortment to 35% next spring, and improve its fast-track design capabilities. He said Lululemon will not make any short-term decisions that \"could hurt or damage\" the brand in the long term.\n\"We are not satisfied with the results for the quarter, and we know our brand can and will perform better than these results,\" McDonald said.", "content_hash": "64ec4d2fc42de764869a621a3994da42", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

In other words, when they underperform their benchmark, that underperformance is relatively large.\nConversely, active managers generally fare better in less liquid areas of the market, like fixed income, real estate, and small-cap and emerging-market stocks, Armour said.\nFor example, 43% of actively managed high-yield bond mutual funds and ETFs beat their index counterparts in the past 10-year period, according to Morningstar.\nFees are the key\nFees are the key driver of index funds' success when compared to active funds, Armour said.\nIndex funds carry a 0.11% average asset-weighted annual fee, while active funds carry a 0.59% fee, according to Morningstar.\nActive funds need to have higher relative returns just to overcome that fee differential.\nBeyond that, higher fees also eat into investor earnings. For example, an investor with $100,000 who earns 4% per year and pays a 0.25% fund fee would have $208,000 after 20 years, while the same investor paying a 1% fee would have $179,000, or $29,000 less, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSince index funds own all the securities in a broad market index, they are guaranteed to own the relative winners and losers. While active managers may own more of the winners than their index counterparts, they also risk missing out, Armour said.\nMany active managers took risk off the table in April when President Donald Trump first announced so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs, but the market then proceeded to rebound quickly, Armour said.", "content_hash": "c2a9d0a6130efefe94053158e8e00dbe", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The agreement reached in July had included Japan purchasing 100 Boeing planes, 75% higher imports of U.S. rice and $8 billion worth of agricultural and crop products.\nWashington will apply a baseline 15% tariff on nearly all Japanese imports, with separate sector-specific levies for automobiles and parts (also 15%), aerospace products, generic pharmaceutical goods and natural resources, according to the executive order.\nThe Thursday order prevents Trump's country-specific tariffs on top of existing levies. The lower tariffs will apply retroactively to Japanese goods \"entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 7, 2025,\" the order stated. The tariff relief on automobiles is set to take effect after seven days.\nTrump's global tariff campaign has thrown the global supply chain into disarray, in particular Japan's massive auto sector. Last month, Toyota warned that it expected a hit of nearly $10 billion as Trump's tariffs on autos weighed on its sales to the U.S., forcing it to slash by 16% its forecast for full-year operating profits.\nTariffs are expected to hit rivals as well, with Ford's pre-tax adjusted profit reportedly set to drop $3 billion while GM projects $4 billion to $5 billion hit for the year.\nJapan's top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, who was in Washington, delivered a letter from Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba inviting Trump to visit his country, Kyoto News reported. The Japanese official had reportedly canceled his trip to the U.S. last month as some sticking points required \"further technical discussion.\"\nPolitical tides\nThe finalizing of the deal came as political pressure for the Japanese leader mounts at home. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party earlier this week released a long-awaited report on why it lost seats in the upper house election in July.\nThe report ascribed the loss to the lack of appeal for the party's measures aimed at taming inflation, previous political scandals and weak mobilization of young voters.\nLocal media reports suggested many key members of the LDP have signaled their intention to resign to the prime minister, while Ishiba has said he intends to stay on amid calls within his party for choosing another leader.\nThough the reports have avoided naming individuals, they signal an \"implicit indictment of Ishiba's leadership of the party,\" said James Brady, vice president at political consultancy Teneo.\nAnalysts at Eurasia Group suggested in a report Friday that Ishiba is unlikely to survive a challenge from within the party next Monday, when a vote on whether to bring forward a leadership election is expected to take place.\n\"Ishiba's poor performance as party leader in lower and upper house elections and events in recent days, including former prime minister Aso Taro announcing his support for the special election, have turned the tide against Ishiba,\" analysts said, predicting a 60% odd of Ishiba's defeat in the election, with him possibly resigning before the vote takes place as internal discontent grows.", "content_hash": "f6d82ea4737a68384b0cbe9cbf00590e", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

And what you see here is only the first car of a series of models, which employs the same technologies,\" Zipse said.\nBMW has sought to revolutionize the digital offering of its new models by focusing on a so-called \"superbrain architecture,\" which replaces hardware with a centralized computer system.\nThe company says an \"all-new digital nervous system\" for the Neue Klasse platform has more than 20 times the computing power of its current vehicle generation.\nThese digital platforms provide the computing capacity for automated driving and infotainment functions, as well as basic car functions, such as climate control and comfort features.\nThe push to highlight the firm's technological development comes as legacy European car manufacturers scramble to close the gap with leading players of software-defined vehicles. U.S. EV-maker Tesla, alongside Chinese manufacturers including Xpeng and BYD, currently dominate this space.\n\"There is fierce competition, especially price competition in China. There are a lot of new players in the market [and] there is a tough fight about market share,\" Zipse said.\nOn the other hand, Zipse said the company has just over 3% market share worldwide and doesn't have to compete in every market segment.

Kennedy Jr. doubled down on false claims about vaccines and claimed he isn't limiting access to Covid shots during his Senate testimony on Thursday, as senators grilled him on his sweeping changes to immunization policy and federal health agencies.\nKennedy said he supports a statement made by a newly appointed member of a key government vaccine panel that mRNA vaccines pose a dangerous risk to people. Numerous studies have demonstrated that shots using mRNA technology, including Covid vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, are safe and effective, and serious side effects have happened in extremely rare cases.\nSen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., noted that the committee member, Dr. Retsef Levi, has said that evidence is mounting that mRNA vaccines cause \"serious harm, including death, especially among young people,\" apparently referring to a post pinned on Levi's X account. Kennedy appointed Levi to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine recommendations and insurance coverage.\nKennedy said he wasn't aware of Levi's comments, but added, \"I agree with it.\"\nHe also claimed that anyone could get a Covid booster shot, while also acknowledging that access \"depends on the state\" and that the government no longer recommends the vaccines for healthy people.\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved a fresh round of Covid shots with new limits, only clearing them for adults aged 65 and older and people with a medical condition that puts them at risk of a severe illness. The CDC and its vaccine panel will decide who to recommend the shots to later this month.\n\"I'm not taking them away from people,\" Kennedy said, referring to the vaccines.\nBut Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., argued that not everyone can walk into a pharmacy and get a Covid shot now.\nThe FDA's new limits have complicated Covid shot access in the U.S., which now depends on a patient's age and risk level, laws and policies in their state, insurance coverage, and health-care provider. Pending CDC guidance, some pharmacies have added prescription requirements for Covid vaccines in certain states.\n\"You clearly are taking away vaccines,\" she said after a prolonged shouting match with Kennedy.\nKennedy's comments before the Senate Finance Committee come after he repeatedly promised the panel in January that he would do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it more difficult or discourages people from taking vaccines. Since then, he has canceled funding for mRNA shot development and made other vaccine policy changes that could limit access to immunizations, including gutting the CDC vaccine panel and dropping Covid shot recommendations for certain groups.\nHis comments also follow a leadership shake-up at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The White House last week fired CDC Director Susan Monarez, and four senior agency officials resigned shortly after, with some of them citing the politicization of the agency and a threat to public health. In an opinion piece on Thursday, Monarez accused Kennedy of \"a deliberate effort to weaken America's public-health system and vaccine protections.\"\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X in support of Kennedy on Thursday, writing that he \"is taking flak because he's over the target\" and saying Democrats were attacking the Trump administration's \"commonsense effort.\"\nKennedy touted skepticism around Covid vaccines, despite evidence of their safety and effectiveness.\n\"We were told again and again the vaccines would prevent transmission, they prevent infection. It wasn't true. They knew it from the start,\" Kennedy said.\nHe also said he does not know how many people died of Covid and whether the vaccines prevented deaths from the virus.\n\"I would like to see the data and talk about the data,\" Kennedy said.\nBut data is readily available from dozens of studies. One paper in August estimates that Covid vaccines saved more than 2 million lives, mostly among older adults, worldwide between 2020 and October 2024.\nThe CDC website also says that Covid vaccines from the 2023 to 2024 season reduced the risk of severe illness from Covid by almost 70% in the first two months after vaccination in adults ages 18 and older, with protection gradually declining over time.\nThose shots also decreased the risk of hospitalization due to Covid by around 50% in the first two months of vaccination in that same population. The Covid vaccines showed similar benefits in older adults.\nKennedy also defended his decision to fire all 17 previous members of the CDC vaccine panel, saying he didn't politicize the committee.\n\"What we did is we got rid of the conflicts of interest. ...

During the visit, Altman said India was OpenAI's second-largest market by number of users.\nHe has subsequently said that AI adoption in India is \"amazing to watch.\"\n\"We love to see the explosion of creativity--india is outpacing the world,\" he said on X earlier this year.\nIndia is one of ChatGPT's fastest-growing markets globally, Nick Patience, practice lead for AI at tech research and analysis firm Futurum Group, told CNBC. \"OpenAI's India focus is a strategic move to gain a competitive edge,\" he added.\nHere's a rundown of how OpenAI is expanding in India.\nChatGPT explosion\nChatGPT, OpenAI's core product, has seen strong growth in India. The app was downloaded 10.2 million times in India in August, a huge jump from the 2.5 million downloads seen during the same month last year, according to analytics firm Appfigures.\nSince its launch, ChatGPT has 111 million downloads in India, ahead of its 80 million downloads in the U.S, Appfigures data shows.\nDownloads do not necessarily equal daily or monthly users, but the figures emphasise OpenAI's growth trajectory in the country.\nThe download numbers are also far ahead of rivals, including Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude. The closest challenger was Perplexity, Appfigures said, which had 6.4 million downloads in August.\nIndia-specific product\nUser spending on ChatGPT has been increasing. To date, Indian users have spent $21.3 million on ChatGPT, Appfigures data shows. In comparison, U.S. users have spent $784 million.\nThat underlines the fact that while the number of users in India is huge, it remains a price-sensitive market.\nTo address this, OpenAI in August launched ChatGPT Go, a low-cost 399-rupees-($4.53)-a-month plan for its AI app.\n\"It's a classic wedge strategy to capture a price-sensitive market and build a user base that will be difficult for local players to dislodge later,\" Futurum Group's Patience said of the strategy.\nInfrastructure and hiring\nAccording to Bloomberg, OpenAI is scouting a location in India for a data center with at least 1-gigawatt capacity. The facility will be part of OpenAI's Stargate-branded infrastructure push, Bloomberg said this week, although CNBC was unable to verify the report.\nThe ChatGPT developer said last month that it would open a local office in the market and is currently advertising three sales roles in India.\nIt also announced last month an education program in India that will include funding for research and provide half a million ChatGPT licenses for educators and students across the country.\nIndia challenges\nWhile India doesn't have a home-grown artificial intelligence company as big as OpenAI, there are some challengers in the form of domestic startups, including Sarvam AI and Krutrim, and other American tech giants like Google and Meta.\nContinued geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and India over trade, however, have the potential to cause complications if there's any backlash from New Delhi against American tech firms.\nOpenAI is also locked in a legal battle with Asian News International in India, which has accused the ChatGPT developer of using copyrighted material illegally. It's a closely-watched case in the country for how copyright laws apply in the AI era.\n\"OpenAI's success in India is not guaranteed and depends heavily on its ability to navigate these legal and political hurdles,\" Futurum Group's Patience said.\n\"While the Indian market is vast, its diversity in languages and user needs presents challenges. OpenAI's ability to deliver a truly localized product and its long-term impact on India's AI talent remain uncertain.\"", "content_hash": "2cc597ecf6d6154ddb53c663447feaee", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona, introduced a bill on Thursday — titled the You Earn It, You Keep it Act — to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits. A House version of the bill was introduced by Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minnesota, in April.\nGallego's bill would permanently eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits.\nIt would also expand the Social Security payroll tax to apply to annual earnings over $250,000. Currently, the maximum earnings subject to Social Security payroll taxes is $176,100 in 2025. Consequently, high earners may only pay into the program for part of the year.\n\"Despite decades of paying into the system, seniors are still forced to pay taxes on their hard-earned benefits — all while the ultra wealthy barely pay into the system,\" Gallego said in a statement.\nHow Social Security benefits are taxed\nSocial Security recipients may owe federal income taxes on their benefits depending on their income.\nHow much they may owe is based on a formula known as combined income — the sum of adjusted gross income, tax-exempt interest income and half of Social Security benefits.\nUp to 50% of benefits may be taxed for individual tax filers with between $25,000 and $34,000 in combined income, or married couples who file jointly with between $32,000 and $44,000.\nUp to 85% of benefits may be taxable for individuals with more than $34,000 in combined income or couples with more than $44,000.\nHow the 'big beautiful' tax law helps seniors\nRepublicans' new \"big beautiful\" law includes a new senior deduction aimed at helping to defray the effects of federal taxes on Social Security benefits.\nAdults aged 65 and over may be able to claim an additional deduction of up to $6,000.\nWhether beneficiaries will benefit from the change will depend on their income.\nThe full deduction will be available to individual taxpayers with up to $75,000 in modified adjusted gross income or married couples with up to $150,000. The deduction will gradually phase out for taxpayers with incomes above those thresholds.\nThe temporary deduction — which will be in effect for tax years 2025 through 2028 — will be available to eligible taxpayers regardless of whether they take the standard deduction or itemize their returns.\nMiddle-income taxpayers stand to benefit the most from the policy, according to tax experts, since low earners may already be exempt from federal taxes on benefits and higher earners will be above the phaseout thresholds.\nHow 'You Earn It, You Keep It' may affect Social Security\nUnlike the temporary senior deduction recently signed into law, Gallego's You Earn It, You Keep It proposal would eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits for all beneficiaries.\nTo be sure, it remains to be seen whether it may get enough support to become law.\nThe proposal does have the support of The Senior Citizens League, a nonpartisan senior advocacy group that is petitioning Congress to stop taxing Social Security benefits. Eliminating federal taxes on Social Security benefits is a \"commonsense step to ensure older Americans can keep more of what they've earned,\" Senior Citizens League Executive Director Shannon Benton said in a statement.\nEfforts to change the federal taxation of Social Security benefits come as the program is facing a trust fund shortfall. Benefits may be reduced within the next decade unless Congress enacts changes sooner, according to projections from Social Security's trustees.\nBecause the \"big beautiful\" law did not include any offsets for the reduced revenue from federal taxes on benefits, it would accelerate the depletion dates, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\nIn contrast, the You Earned It, You Keep It proposal would extend the Social Security trust funds' ability to pay benefits in full and on time for 24 years, or until 2058, according to Gallego's office. That matches an analysis of Craig's House proposal by Social Security's chief actuary in April.", "content_hash": "c9191b29aba6f9e461228cb296b7877b", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

And the industry as a whole is facing some troubling obstacles.\nCanadian visitation to the U.S. has plummeted some 40% this year, following comments by President Donald Trump about Canada as a potential 51st U.S. state and evolving trade policies. The Canadian dollar has also weakened, lessening the buying power of visitors crossing the border into the U.S.\nHornbuckle also pointed to massive price hikes for a U.S. visa, from $100 to $350, where a family of four visiting for the Ryder Cup, World Cup or Olympics in 2028, for example, could pay $1,400 for visa documents alone.\n\"International travel in 2016 had a $50 billion U.S. surplus. Today it's a $50 billion deficit,\" Hornbuckle said.\nThe government's commitment to funding marketing and promotion of U.S. travel was also slashed by 80% in the most recent spending bill, to $20 million.\n\"We obviously find ourselves in a world that has a fair amount of uncertainty from a macroeconomic perspective, from a socio-political perspective,\" Marriott CEO Tony Capuano told investors at the BofA conference Thursday. \"Marriott, and the sector more broadly, thrives in times of certainty and stability. So that creates some measure of challenge.\"\nCapuano said there's been a slight uptick after Labor Day in some segments of travel. He said Marriott sees spending restrained in budget travelers and small businesses. But he described demand for luxury travel as \"sturdy.\"\nWyndham Hotel and Resorts CEO Geoff Ballotti laid out an optimistic view of the travel industry, noting robust demand for extended stay, driven in part by projects supporting the government's infrastructure spending.\n\"You're seeing incredible interest in investment right now,\" Ballotti told CNBC. \"Our new construction pipeline, 20 consecutive quarters of growth, is at an all-time high.

In turn, those bogus valuations helped Trump's company get better terms on loans and other financial benefits, the judge ruled.\nEngoron cited those findings in imposing the massive fine on Trump and other defendants.\nThe notice of appeal filed on Thursday is brief and does not detail the arguments for why James believes the decision should be overturned. Those arguments will be laid out in future filings.\nA spokeswoman for James had no comment on the filing.\nA spokesman for Trump's legal team, in a statement, said, \"New York AG Letitia James' political crusade against President Trump, which is barred by the Statute of Limitations, where she valued Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, FL, which is worth at least $2 billion dollars, at a ridiculous $18 million, and engaged in a ton of other fatal errors, was already annihilated by the New York Appellate Division, First Department.\"\n\"Tish James should focus on her own problems and stop wasting New York State taxpayers' hard earned dollars on her failed Witch Hunt against President Trump, his family, and the magnificent business that he built,\" the spokesman said.\nThis is breaking news.

The next step in this program will occur on Tuesday, September 9 when Porsche customers will gain soft launch access to the Tesla Supercharger network. This means Porsche owners will have access to 23,500 Tesla Superchargers in North America – helping them find even more convenient places to charge.\nAccess to the Tesla Supercharger network will be possible though Porsche-supplied NACS DC adapter being made available to Porsche customers. At this soft launch stage, Porsche customers will utilize the Tesla app to enable charging. Charging through the My Porsche app and plug-and-charge is expected to follow in the coming months.\n“We are continually working to make every aspect of Porsche ownership as convenient as possible for our customers – and this news represents a significant step for owners of our electrified cars,” said Timo Resch, President and CEO of Porsche Cars North America. “As we launch this offering, in the coming months, we will be adding more features to make the process even more seamless.”\nThe adapter\nGoing forward, all new model year 2026 Porsche Taycan and Macan Electric models will include Porsche NACS DC adapter at no additional fee. Model year 2025 Taycan owners and all existing Macan Electric owners are eligible for a complimentary adapter. This group of owners will receive notification via their My Porsche to reserve their free Porsche NACS DC adapter shortly.\nModel year 2024 and older Taycan customers can elect to purchase the Porsche NACS DC adapter from the Porsche Online Shop and at local Porsche Centers starting today. The MSRP of the adapter is $185 and enables Porsche owners to charge their CCS-equipped Taycan and Macan Electric models at DC fast charging stations equipped with NACS/J3400 compatible cables, including select Tesla Superchargers.\nHow it works\nThis soft launch will allow customer access the Tesla Supercharger network ahead of the full operational launch – with enhanced features such as access via the Porsche app and plug & charge capability – following in the coming months.\nCustomers connecting to a NACS Tesla Supercharger will need to take two simple steps – the first being to download and register on the Tesla app to activate Tesla Supercharger stations.\nOther stations, such as Ionna and Electrify America with NACS handles, can be activated via the My Porsche app. Next, they will use their new Porsche NACS DC adapter to connect to the charging station cable before it can then be plugged into the car.\nCharge planning software\nAll model year 2026 Taycan and Macan Electric variants will come with the necessary navigation features to incorporate the location of additional chargers. Model year 2024 and 2025 Macan Electric models will receive this software update before the end of the year, while model year 2025 and earlier Taycan variants will receive their upgrade thereafter. All charge-planning software updates will be complimentary.", "content_hash": "03dbae534a223b3e01fbbffe618ab2d0", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s shares jumped by 3.3% on Wednesday after a major headwind disappeared in the form of search engine giant Google’s troubles with the Justice Department. The shares were higher as a court ruled that Google could continue to pay companies to push its Search service on devices. For Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), this meant that its deal with Google, reportedly valued at $20 billion, to push Google Search on the iPhone. Cramer discussed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) before the news of the court ruling broke:\n“Well that’s why I think that China remains the wildcard and all of this is just setting up for very, very difficult, tough negotiation. So therefore you have to look at Apple, you have to look at NVIDIA and people are just saying, alright I’ve looked, I’ve judged, sell. That’s too simple. These are great companies and they will figure out a way to make money.”\nPreviously, Cramer discussed how Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the only major company that isn’t spending heavily on NVIDIA’s AI GPUs:\n“Apple is the only one of these heavy hitters that isn’t writing huge checks to NVIDIA, simply because they don’t have an AI strategy. Apple stock, by the way, is the poorest performer of the big tech stocks. Will that change after tonight’s numbers? Will Apple turn out to have the last laugh while all the others fall flat on their faces?… Listen, we heard the same thing about the dot-com survivors at the turn of the millennium.”\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) helped lay the foundation for the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The demand for these processors has been off the charts, driving an unprecedented surge in revenue and profits. This fueled blistering gains in the stock price, which vaulted Nvidia's market cap to $4 trillion, the first company to ever surpass that lofty benchmark.\nHowever, after several years of stellar gains, Nvidia investors are looking beyond the buzz and wondering if the stock has simply come too far, too fast. Many are looking for evidence that AI will live up to the hype, fueling greater adoption in the months and years to come.\nBroadcom (AVGO 10.00%) just provided proof positive that the adoption of AI continues unfettered.\nBlockbuster results\nBroadcom announced the results of its fiscal 2025 third quarter (ended Aug. 3), and the results were robust by every important measure. Record revenue of $15.95 billion climbed 22% year over year, fueling adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.69, which jumped 36%.\nFor context, analysts' consensus estimates called for revenue of $15.82 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.66, so Broadcom cleared expectations with room to spare.\nDemand for AI was the driving force behind the stellar results, as AI-centric revenue accelerated 63% year over year to $5.2 billion. This also marked the company's 10th consecutive quarter of AI-fueled growth. Free cash flow clocked in at $7 billion, up 47% year over year.\nBroadcom gave investors other reasons to celebrate. CEO Hock Tan revealed that beyond its three existing hyperscale customers, one prospective customer had ordered production of its custom AI accelerators, becoming a \"qualified customer,\" something Broadcom has been signaling for months. The combination of higher demand and the new customer increased the company's backlog to $110 billion.\nThe chief executive also boosted Broadcom's fourth-quarter outlook and is now guiding for revenue of $17.4 billion, an increase of 24% compared to the prior-year quarter. For context, analysts' consensus estimates were calling for Q4 revenue of $17.01 billion. This illustrates that despite an already robust outlook, demand for AI continues to outpace expectations. Tan went on to say that while Broadcom originally expected its 2026 growth to mirror 2025, he now sees growth accelerating.\nIn a bonus announcement, Tan reported that the board of directors had extended his tenure as CEO until at least 2030.\n\"Broad\"er implications\nBeyond the positive implications for Broadcom investors, the results provide additional insight into the general state of AI. Investors have been concerned that the AI hype machine may have gotten ahead of actual adoption. Broadcom's accelerating results add weight to Nvidia's quarterly report, confirming the company's assertion that demand for AI continues at a rapid rate.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during the company's earnings call that he expects data center spending fueled by AI will reach between $3 trillion and $4 trillion by 2030, fueled by accelerating demand for AI, up from estimates of $600 billion this year.\nFurthermore, Broadcom noted that its increasing backlog was partially the result of increasing demand from its existing hyperscale customers, suggesting that cloud infrastructure providers are boosting their capital expenditures (capex), above and beyond the increases previously announced.\nBy extension, this will likely translate to additional growth for Nvidia, as its GPUs are the gold standard for AI, controlling a dominant 92% of the data center GPU market, according to IoT Analytics. Furthermore, as AI expands downstream beyond the hyperscale data center, Nvidia is the logical choice when it comes to the processors needed for both AI training and inference.\nSince the dawn of the AI revolution in early 2023, Nvidia stock has soared more than 1,070% (as of this writing). In recent months, however, the popular narrative suggests the implementation of AI is slowing, despite Nvidia and Broadcom both posting accelerating results. The evidence is clear that AI adoption continues at a remarkable pace.\nOn the bright side, Nvidia stock is currently trading for just 27 times next year's expected earnings, which is an attractive price to pay for a company expected to grow revenue by 58% during its current fiscal year.\nAs the leading provider of data center GPUs, Nvidia has staked out a vast territory in the AI landscape and despite the stock's blistering gains, the evidence suggests its run is far from over.", "content_hash": "5f41972080125d0938b77863a15585ab", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Allie Canal outlines what you need to know.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief.\nWell, Tesla is putting a jaw-dropping new pay package on the table for CEO Elon Musk, potentially worth up to 1 trillion dollars over the next decade.\nThe deal laid out in Tesla's latest proxy filing is entirely performance-based. Musk won't see a dime in salary or bonuses. Instead, he'll only earn stock awards if he hits a series of ambitious targets.\nThat includes things like deploying a million robo taxis, delivering 20 million vehicles, rolling out AI robots and growing Tesla's market cap to at least 8.5 trillion.\nIf Musk achieves every milestone, his stake in Tesla could rise to around 25%, cementing his control over the company.\nThe proposal will go to a shareholder vote at Tesla's annual meeting on November 6th. It does come after a Delaware court struck down Musk's latest record setting pay package from 2018, valued at roughly 50 billion, a ruling that Tesla is still appealing.\nThe incentives in the new plan aim to keep Musk's focus on Tesla while it pursues growth in newer markets including robotics and artificial intelligence.\nFriday's filing also included a non-binding shareholder proposal for Tesla to take a stake in Musk's XAI startup, an idea that Musk himself has previously discussed.", "content_hash": "7c119d24c9e7c98e1049f4df08dc0c69", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

That sent the stock up nearly 10% over the past two days, putting it within striking distance of a $3 trillion market value. With the case now out of the way, investors are turning their attention back to the potential for gains in Alphabet’s stock, which is the cheapest among the Magnificent Seven despite the recent rally.\n“What it does is it clears the runway for additional growth opportunities,” said Neville Javeri, senior fund manager at Allspring Global Investments, referring to the ruling. He sees an “incredible opportunity” in the stock as the decision “sets them up for a growth opportunity that might have been taken away.”\nThe ruling caps a strong stretch for Alphabet shares that began after its second-quarter earnings showed demand for artificial intelligence products is lifting sales. At the same time, its AI offerings continue to boost investor confidence in Alphabet’s ability to fend off competition from rivals like OpenAI.\nShares rose 0.3% on Friday.\nThe stock has gained more than 20% since the July 23 earnings report, vaulting Alphabet into the top third of performers in the Nasdaq 100 Index this year, after months of struggles amid concerns about antitrust risks and fears that AI upstarts could eat away at its Google search business, which accounts for more than half of revenue. As recently as June, Alphabet shares were down more than 10% while the Nasdaq 100 was in positive territory.\nThough the debate over AI is unlikely to be settled anytime soon, Wall Street is increasingly confident Alphabet can defend its turf. It debuted AI functions that were widely praised earlier this year, and the latest version of its Pixel phones, which come loaded with AI features, were also well received. Sales of handsets from both Alphabet and Samsung Electronics indicate consumers are willing to switch to devices that use Google’s Android operating system.\nApproaching a Milestone\n“Given new AI Search features and GOOG’s rapidly scaling Gemini app, we expect Google will maintain its leadership in traditional search,” TD Cowen analyst John Blackledge wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.\nWith a market capitalization of $2.82 trillion, Alphabet is roughly 7% shy of the $3 trillion mark, a level that’s only been reached by Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Nvidia Corp.\nClosing that gap may not be much of a stretch. Alphabet trades around 21 times estimated earnings, compared with 26 times for the Nasdaq 100, and its revenues are expected to grow 14% this year, outpacing the benchmark.\n“The stock still looks attractive, since it has so many high-quality businesses growing at fast rates,” said Liam McGarrity, US investment analyst at Harris Oakmark, which has Alphabet as its largest holding.\nDespite the improving sentiment, Alphabet’s momentum could be difficult to sustain in the near term. The stock’s 14-day relative strength index jumped above 83, its highest since 2017 and well above 70, the level where technical traders consider a security overbought. The shares are trading even with average analyst price target, suggesting Wall Street doesn’t see much upside from here.\nInvestors “understandably are relieved that near-term risks are dissipated,” but “long-term concerns about competitive risks to search will constrain the multiple,” Rosenblatt Securities analyst Barton Crockett wrote in a note to clients Wednesday, reiterating his neutral rating on the stock.\nFor McGarrity, owning Alphabet comes down to believing in its ability to stay ahead of AI rivals and maintain growth.\n“When you consider it is cheaper than the market even though it has industry-leading AI and significant potential in businesses like Google Cloud and Waymo, then it seems like it is trading at a significant discount,” he said.\nTech Chart of the Day\nBroadcom Inc. shares rallied on Friday, hitting a record high as the chipmaker is said to be helping OpenAI design and produce an artificial intelligence accelerator from 2026. Separately, the company said that its AI outlook will improve “significantly” in fiscal 2026, helping allay concerns about slowing growth.\nTop Tech Stories\nApple Inc.’s annual sales in India hit a record of nearly $9 billion in the last fiscal year, signaling growing consumer demand for its flagship devices as the company ramps up its retail footprint in the world’s most populous country.\nTikTok rival Xiaohongshu Technology Co. is on track to triple its profit to $3 billion this year, making progress with commercialization on the way to a potential public listing.\nAnthropic is blocking its services from Chinese-controlled companies, saying it’s taking steps to prevent a US adversary from advancing in AI and threatening American national security.\nDeepSeek is developing an artificial intelligence model with more advanced AI agent features to compete with US rivals like OpenAI in a newer frontier of the technology, according to people familiar with the matter.\nPresident Donald Trump said he would be imposing tariffs on semiconductor imports “very shortly” but spare goods from companies like Apple Inc. that have pledged to boost their US investments.\nTrump’s administration just tore up a quiet compromise that some of the world’s biggest chipmakers have relied on to maintain crucial operations in China. That tees up four months of complex policy talks to satisfy US national security concerns while avoiding disruptions to supply chains that underpin the global electronics market.\nEarnings Due Friday\nNo major earnings expected\n--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke, Subrat Patnaik, David Watkins and Brandon Harden.", "content_hash": "6e8ce2b2b4a1caaa698fa74e01843378", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Uber’s 2027 EBITDA forecast was raised 6%, with analysts noting that “we see most upside to consensus ’26/’27 EBITDA forecasts for DASH & UBER.”\nRideshare advertising is said to remain “in early innings” with penetration below 20% in 2025, but Wells Fargo expects contribution to incremental margins to expand from 80 basis points in 2025 to 300 basis points in 2027.\nFor Instacart, the bank lifted 2027 EBITDA by 4% but kept its forecast 2% below consensus, citing margin risks from a mix shift toward off-platform ads. Lyft was described as having “the most runway remaining,” with penetration at just 25%.\nRelated articles\nWells Fargo lifts EBITDA for rideshare, delivery on ad momentum\nSilver: Global Markets Show Signs of a Gold-Like Bullish Run With $44 in Sight\nEUR/USD Could Rebound as Bond-Driven US Dollar Strength Looks Overdone", "content_hash": "5d92d97cebc375067a7dc4b7c0e1406a", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Tariffs should contribute to ongoing price increases in household furnishings, apparel, and recreation commodities,” BofA said.\nAnalysts expect tariff-related goods inflation to persist over the coming quarters.\nNon-housing services are also anticipated to remain firm. BofA noted that “non-housing core services prices rose 0.4% month-on-month, after a 0.5% increase in July. Airfares likely increased again owing to another strong seasonal factor, and lodging away from home should also climb.”\nThese gains reflect both mean-reversion after earlier declines and higher summer travel activity.\nBased on these CPI forecasts, BofA expects core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation to rise to 3.0% year-on-year in August.\n“Our preliminary estimate for core PCE inflation in July is 0.27% month-on-month.

The credit card and banking giant is benefiting from increased market optimism as the Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates.\nThe credit card for the affluent customer\nAmerican Express has carved out a niche as an elite credit card provider, servicing an upscale clientele with fee-based products that come with a coveted rewards program. Although it has only a fraction of competitor Visa's card membership, it has nearly double Visa's revenue. Its cardmembers are high spenders, and they're more resilient when there's pressure, making American Express resilient, too.\nIn the 2025 second quarter, revenue increased 9% year over year (currency neutral), and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were up 17%.\nAmerican Express stands out from other credit card networks in several ways. One is the focus on the affluent consumer, and another is its closed-loop model. Instead of working with partnering banks or financial institutions to provide the credit for its customers to make purchases on its network, it acts as its own bank. That gives it greater control over the model and expands its platform. In contrast with other networks, it has a large and varied stream of revenue.\nIt also makes money on deposits, which leads to higher net interest income and higher overall net income.\nAnother way the company differentiates itself is with its robust rewards program and accompanying annual fees. Fee revenue increased 20% year over year in the second quarter and accounted for more than 13% of revenue.\nLow interest rates should boost business\nLower interest rates generally boost economic activity, because money is cheaper and therefore easier to come by. Companies can borrow more easily, and they tend to expand their operations when money is plentiful. Individuals tend to spend more when it's cheaper to service their credit.\nThis works in American Express' favor in several ways. Higher economic activity is good for spending, and people with money are also more likely to take out new fee-based cards. It also means its default rates should go lower. They're generally best-in-class, and since interest rates have started to come down from highs, they're already improving.\nAmerican Express has been a reliable stock for decades, and it also pays a growing dividend. It's one of Warren Buffett's favorite and longest-held stocks, and it can still provide value for new and current shareholders.", "content_hash": "86462599efb8024102999e55003622bc", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

I’ve been writing about the uptick in CFO turnover. The latest high-profile departure is at multibillionaire Elon Musk’s xAI.\nMike Liberatore stepped down abruptly as the finance chief of Musk’s artificial intelligence startup, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal citing anonymous sources. Liberatore was hired in April and reportedly left in late July. The reasons for his departure are not known, but he followed other high-profile exits from xAI of late. The company did not immediately respond to my request for comment.\nBefore joining xAI, Liberatore worked at Airbnb for almost nine years—most recently as VP of finance and corporate development—and had previously served in several business unit CFO roles. He’s also worked at Intel, eBay, and PayPal. During his brief tenure at xAI, he reportedly helped raise $10 billion in funding and expanded data center operations.\nLaunched by Musk in July 2023, xAI is a competitor of OpenAI. Both companies develop large language models and AI assistants—OpenAI with ChatGPT, xAI with Grok—that target overlapping user bases.\nLiberatore’s departure follows a wave of exits, including cofounder Igor Babuschkin (who left to start a VC firm focused on AI safety), General Counsel Robert Keele after one year, and senior lawyer Raghu Rao. xAI’s leadership is highly centralized under Musk, with no publicly disclosed independent board.\nMichael Morris, a professor at Columbia Business School, shared his assessment with me. He noted that Keele cited differences in worldview with Musk and family priorities in his LinkedIn post about leaving. Of course, Musk also played a key role in the Trump White House earlier this year.\nMorris also observed that executive turnover among Musk’s direct reports at Tesla is 44%, compared to about 9% at Meta, Amazon, and Netflix; overall, Tesla’s executive turnover rate is 27%, nearly double the industry average.\n“Analysts point to Musk’s demanding, high-contact leadership style—managing up to 18 direct reports at once—as a key reason for the trend,” Morris said. “This pattern is visible not only at Tesla but also at X and xAI, suggesting structural factors rather than isolated events.”\nHe added that many executives leave rather than risk being blamed when new initiatives encounter regulatory hurdles: “Executives don’t want to become the ‘fall guy.’”\nWhat fuels mass exits?\nxAI isn’t alone in seeing mass executive departures. Last year, OpenAI also saw multiple senior departures—such as cofounder John Schulman and CTO Mira Murati. Also in 2024, at the DNA testing startup 23andMe, all seven independent directors resigned simultaneously, citing major disagreements with CEO Anne Wojcicki and her plans to take the company private.", "content_hash": "40f37b2e78d15b9510890ef5a1213582", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

If purchased via stablecoins, fees would be $0.50 or much lower - a huge spread.\nThat’s the opportunity that Stripe sees, and they’re clearly moving quickly.\nTheir advantage here is their purpose-built chain (along with their laundry list of launch partners and beta testers).\nMany of today’s big chains were optimized for trading, while Tempo optimizes for payments, the largest real-world use case for crypto.\nIf it works, on-chain dollars become the default rail for payouts and commerce.\nAnd that’s a boon for the broader crypto space. More stablecoins grow the overall crypto pie and bring more users on-chain.\nBut it doesn’t necessarily mean your favorite L1 blockchain’s token is going to go up in price…\n🌎 Macro Crypto and Memes\nA few Crypto and Web3 headlines that caught my eye:\n- Crypto majors are mostly even with BTC leading; BTC +1% at $112,300, ETH even at $4,420, XRP even at $2.84, SOL -1% at $207\n- M (+26%), PUMP (+10%) and XDC (+5%) led top movers\n- The Bitcoin ETFs saw $220M in net outflows on Thursday, breaking a big 2-day inflow streak; the ETH ETFs saw $167M in net outflows\n- The SEC set a pro-crypto agenda, unveiling rulemakings to define digital-asset offers/sales and ease listings on U.S. exchanges\n- Stripe + Paradigm revealed their Tempo blockchain aimed at low-cost stablecoin settlement with partners including Visa, Deutsche Bank, OpenAI\n- Kraken announced a buyout of Breakout, planning to integrate the trader-native platform into Kraken Pro\n- WLFI blacklisted Justin Sun's address from selling his 595M unlocked tokens, citing activity concerns that broke WLFI rules (WLFI +15% since the news)\n- Gary Gensler’s text messages from Oct 2022 to Sept 2023 have been “lost” according to a recent audit\nIn Corporate Treasuries\n- Crypto treasury stocks slumped after the Nasdaq announced heightened scrutiny of equity raises to fund crypto purchases\n- Public firms now hold over 1,000,000 BTC (~$110B) led by Strategy at ~636K BTC\n- American Bitcoin stock fell below its IPO price in trading Thursday\nIn Memes\n- Memecoin leaders are slightly green on the day; DOGE +1%, Shiba +1%, PEPE +1%, PENGU -1%, BONK +2%, TRUMP +1%, SPX +4%, and FARTCOIN -1%\n- NEET (+20%), BITTY (+30%), SPARK (+15%) and TOKABU (+13%) led onchain movers\n💰 Token, Airdrop & Protocol Tracker\nHere's a rundown of major token, protocol and airdrop news from the day:\n- Pump Fun did another $12M in buybacks over the past week, representing 98% of their revenue\n- Myriad announced two new UX enhancements, including direct sign-in w/ MetaMask, Rabby & Rainbow wallets and easier bridging directly within Myriad, along with confirmation that USDC predictions will \"be considered at TGE\"\n- Arbitrum launched DRIP, its $40M DeFi incentive program, targeting leveraged looping with 24M ARB in rewards\n- Fireblocks launched a stablecoin payments network, connecting 40+ participants to streamline B2B stablecoin flows\n🤖 AI x Crypto\nSection dedicated to headlines in the AI sector of crypto:\n- Overall market cap even at $12.7B, leaders were mixed\n- FARTCOIN (-1%), VIRTUAL (+1%), TIBBIR (+5%), aixbt (+3%) & ai16z (+1%)\n- VADER (+33%) and VIRGEN (+22%) led top movers\n🚚 What is happening in NFTs?\nHere is the list of other notable headlines from the day in NFTs:\n- ETH NFT leaders were mixed; Punks +2% at 48.9 ETH, Pudgy -1% at 9.8, BAYC -1% at 9.1 ETH\n- HV-MTL up 230% were a notable top mover\n- Abstract NFTs were mostly red, led by Roach Racing (+7%)\n- Pudgy Penguins announced that OpenSea will be its official home, along with the PENGU token\n- The Pudgy Party soulbound token can now be claimed inside MetaMask portfolio\n- NFL All Day revamped its collector experience, rolling out verified digital autographed rookie highlight moments and partnering with four NFL teams on in-person activations to onboard more fans", "content_hash": "b1d6045bfafe48ff5b5802522276af48", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The company acquired stablecoin infrastructure firm Bridge for $1.1 billion and crypto wallet developer Privy, creating end-to-end payment solutions spanning wallets, stablecoins, and now blockchain processing infrastructure.\nStripe’s Crypto Stack Completion Strategy\nStripe’s blockchain development completes a comprehensive crypto infrastructure buildout that began with strategic acquisitions.\nThe Bridge acquisition provided stablecoin payment capabilities across 70 countries, while Privy added wallet infrastructure for seamless user onboarding.\nThe company initially supported Bitcoin transactions in 2014 before halting crypto services due to network inefficiencies.\nStripe rebuilt its blockchain team in 2021 and accelerated initiatives throughout 2024 following regulatory clarity brought by the Trump administration.\nStablecoin Financial Accounts launched across 101 countries, enabling companies to hold and transact digital dollars.\nThe platform currently supports Circle’s USDC and Bridge’s USDB tokens with plans for stablecoin neutrality across Tempo.\nEarlier this year, Stripe partnered with Ramp to launch stablecoin-backed corporate cards, which aim to address cross-border payment delays and currency volatility.\nThe cards were initially deployed in Latin American markets before expanding to Europe, Africa, and Asia.\nCEO Patrick Collison has previously testified to Congress that Stripe sees “meaningful business interest in stablecoins as the underlying technology has matured.”\nThe GENIUS Act’s federal regulatory framework spurred corporate adoption across the billion-dollar stablecoin sector.\nTempo enables Stripe to capture transaction processing revenue directly rather than paying fees to external networks.\nParticularly, the company’s extensive merchant network spanning millions of businesses worldwide perfectly positions Tempo for rapid adoption through existing payment flows.\nFinancial Giants Race Into the Blockchain Industry\nThe stablecoin sector experienced explosive growth following regulatory clarity, with market capitalization exceeding $288 billion.\nIn fact, among many others, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse projects the growth of the stablecoin market to around $1-2 trillion.\nAmid the corporate adoption race, MetaMask announced plans earlier last month to launch “MetaMask USD” through Stripe’s payment infrastructure.\nThe proposal builds on the M⁰ network, which has regulatory backing and fiat reserves.\nWestern Union has also announced pilot programs in South America and Africa for stablecoin-powered remittances.\nJust yesterday, Ripple announced its extension of its US dollar-backed stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD), into Africa.\nApproximately 20 million addresses now transact stablecoins on public blockchains.\nRecognizing this massive growth potential, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller noted that 99% of stablecoin market capitalization is tied to the US dollar.\nHe believes “stablecoins can keep the dollar the world’s reserve currency” by increasing global accessibility.\nLooking forward, Tempo’s validator set will begin with independent, diverse participants before transitioning toward permissionless validation.\nThe blockchain maintains neutrality regarding stablecoin issuers, allowing any compliant stablecoin to be used for payments and gas fees.\n- New ChatGPT AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Avalanche and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana and Pepe by the End of 2025\n- Perplexity AI Predicts the Price of XRP, World Liberty Financial and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Why Is Crypto Down Today? – September 4, 2025\n- XRP Price Prediction: Gaming Giant Expands to XRP Ledger – Shocking Move to $10 Starting Now\n- New ChatGPT AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Avalanche and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana and Pepe by the End of 2025\n- Perplexity AI Predicts the Price of XRP, World Liberty Financial and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Why Is Crypto Down Today? – September 4, 2025\n- XRP Price Prediction: Gaming Giant Expands to XRP Ledger – Shocking Move to $10 Starting Now", "content_hash": "2348bb8a6d02d0c99aaa2ed251dc0ef8", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The fallout depends on hyperscaler capital expenditure trends. Analysts expect a deceleration in late 2025 or 2026, though guidance keeps rising.\nAnother day, another record high for the S&P 500, and another investment bank has a research note asking whether AI stocks are in a bubble. Today it is the turn of Goldman Sachs, where Ryan Hammond and his team have made a lengthy and thoughtful attempt to assess whether Nvidia et al. are heading for a crash.\nTheir conclusion: We’re not there yet.\nThe S&P was up 0.83% to 6,502.08 yesterday, a new record.\nValuations are high, but they are actually lower than they were in the dotcom boom of 2000, Goldman says. There is one danger looming, the bank notes, and that is the “inevitable slowdown” in capital expenditures by the “hyperscaler” AI companies, (Amazon, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle).\nUnder what Goldman calls “an extreme scenario in which the hyperscalers cut capex back to 2022 levels,” the “lost” revenues to AI companies would represent a 30% cut to Goldman’s estimate of $1 trillion in total sales growth across the S&P 500 companies next year. In turn, “a reversion of long-term growth estimates back to early 2023 levels would imply 15%–20% downside to the current valuation multiple of the S&P 500.”\nAI stocks rose 32% in 2024 and 17% year to date, Goldman says, and “investors increasingly ask us whether current U.S. equity prices are reflective of overly optimistic investor expectations.” But tech stocks are currently trading below historic bubble levels, Hammond’s team wrote. “The five largest stocks in the index (NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN) trade at P/E multiple of 28x, compared with 40x at the peak in 2021 and 50x at the peak in the Tech Bubble [of 2000].”\nThe factor keeping valuations reasonable is the huge amount of real money that companies serving the hyperscalers are taking in as revenues. Goldman estimates that hyperscaler capex has totaled $368 billion so far this year.\nThe question then becomes, when does the slowdown in AI spending happen? “Analysts currently assume a sharp deceleration in 4Q 2025 and 2026,” Goldman says. But expect that date to slip: Hyperscaler companies keep revising their capex guidance upward.\nThe note also suggests that as well as a deceleration (after all, spending will have to plateau at some point) investors are going to want to see more meaningful results as time goes on. With regard to so-called Phase 3 companies, for example, those which will benefit from the ripple effect of the technology, the analysts write: “We expect the AI trade will eventually broaden out to some Phase 3 companies, but investors will likely require evidence of a tangible near-term impact on earnings … Our equity analysts acknowledge that there has been limited value creation in enterprise software applications thus far.”", "content_hash": "1d92008f9adc4b43a28c28c8e3759d27", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for payrolls to rise by 75,000.\nThe report showed a marked slowdown from the July increase of 79,000, which was revised up by 6,000. Revisions also showed a net loss of 13,000 in June after the prior estimate was lowered by 27,000.\n\"The job market is stalling short of the runway,\" said Daniel Zhao, chief economist at jobs site Glassdoor. \"The labor market is losing lift, and August's report, along with downward revisions, suggests we're heading into turbulence without the soft landing achieved.\"\nMarkets largely disregarded the report, with stocks up at the open and Treasury yields sharply lower. Traders in the futures markets raised the probability of a quarter percentage point Fed rate cut to 100% and went even further, pricing in a 12% probability of a half-point move, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge.\nThe payrolls count was the first since President Donald Trump fired former BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following the release of the July jobs report a month ago. The move came after the report showed not just a weak level of job creation but also dramatic reductions in previous months' totals.\nIn McEntarfer's place, the president nominated economist E.J. Antoni, a Trump loyalist from the Heritage Foundation who previously had criticized the BLS numbers as being politically distorted. William Wiatrowski is serving as acting BLS commissioner.\nWhile the pace of hiring was slow, average hourly earnings increased 0.3% for the month, meeting the estimate, though the annual gain of 3.7% was slightly below the forecast for 3.8%.\nHiring was held back by a payroll reduction in the federal government, which reported a decline of 15,000.\nHealth care again led sectors, adding 31,000 jobs, while social assistance contributed 16,000. Wholesale trade and manufacturing both saw declines of 12,000 on the month.\nThe report comes as markets widely expect the Fed to lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point when it releases its next decision Sept. 17. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his fellow policymakers also have been under heavy criticism from the president as they have been on hold since last cutting in December 2024.\nThough most economic indicators indicate continued expansion, Fed officials have expressed concern about a slowdown in hiring even as layoffs have held fairly steady. At the same time, policymakers worry that Trump's tariffs could reignite inflation, with data indicating a slow but steady increase in prices over recent months.\n\"The warning bell that rang in the labor market a month ago just got louder. A weaker-than-expected jobs report all but seals a 25-basis-point rate cut later this month,\" said Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings. \"Four straight months of manufacturing job losses stand out. It's hard to argue that tariff uncertainty isn't a key driver of this weakness.\"\nWhile the establishment survey showed weak job creation, the more volatile household count, used to calculate the unemployment rate, held better news.\nThat report showed an increase of 288,000 employed, though the ranks of the unemployed also rose by 148,000. The labor force participation rate edged higher to 62.3% while the labor force swelled by 436,000, accounting for the tick higher in the unemployment rate.\nA broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons climbed to 8.1%, a 0.2 percentage point increase and the highest level since October 2021.\nAlong with the jobs numbers tally, the BLS on Tuesday will release the initial estimate for annual benchmark revisions to the numbers dating back one year from March 2025.\nRevisions have been a source of controversy, particularly in the post-Covid era as the response rate has declined, particularly for the headline establishment survey that asks businesses and government agencies to detail the pace of hiring.\nThe BLS typically releases its initial estimate with the first batch of survey responses it gets, then updates two times as it gets more information. However, Trump has accused the BLS of being politically biased. The firing of McEntarfer drew widespread criticism in the economics and markets community.\nIn a CNBC interview, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said he expects the August payrolls count to get revised higher. In the past three years, the initial August count actually was revised lower from the initial estimate.\nCorrection: The BLS on Tuesday will release the initial estimate for annual benchmark revisions to the numbers dating back one year from March 2025.

It would also give Musk increased voting power over the EV maker and aspiring robotics titan, which he has publicly demanded since early 2024.\nTesla Chairwoman Robyn Denholm told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin the plan was designed to keep the CEO \"motivated and focused on delivering for the company.\"\n\"If he performs, if he hits the super ambitious milestones that are in the plan then he gets equity — it's 1% for each half a trillion dollars of market cap, plus operational milestones he has to hit in order to do that,\" Denholm said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\nThe full award would give Musk more than 423 million additional shares. He currently holds about a 13% stake in the company.\nDenholm confirmed that the Tesla CEO pay plan, if approved by shareholders, would not put any limit on where and how Musk spends his time or require him to spend any minimum number of hours per week on Tesla business.\nTo obtain the first award in the plan, Musk and Tesla would need to almost double their current market cap to reach $2 trillion. The final benchmark is reaching an $8.5 trillion market cap.\nThe operational milestones in the 2025 CEO Performance Award include: 20 million Tesla vehicles delivered, 10 million active FSD Subscriptions, 1 million robots delivered, 1 million Robotaxis in commercial operation and a series of adjusted EBITDA benchmarks.\nMusk has remained politically embroiled, while also running a collection of companies, including aerospace and defense contractor SpaceX, drilling venture The Boring Company, health tech company Neuralink and the artificial intelligence venture, xAI, which has merged with his social network, X.\nTesla also said in the filing Friday that it will ask shareholders at the Nov. 6 meeting to vote on whether the company should invest in Musk's newest venture, xAI.\nMusk first floated the idea publicly with an informal poll on X last July, asking whether Tesla should invest $5 billion into xAI.\nFounded in early 2023 in Nevada, xAI merged with Musk's social network X earlier this year. The company now operates a massive data center in Memphis, and plans to build out another facility there to help train and run its large language models and a chatbot called Grok.\nPay plan controversy\nThe new pay proposal for Musk comes after the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled last year that his 2018 pay plan was excessive, had been improperly granted by the Tesla board and must be rescinded.\nIn that case, Tornetta v. Musk, a judge found that the Tesla CEO had controlled pay negotiations at the automaker, and his board of directors failed to give shareholders information that they were legally entitled to before telling them they should vote to approve Musk's performance-based pay plan.\nThe case is now on appeal.", "content_hash": "09f593d3e7974c4e760a806746de481c", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

He added that the order increased Broadcom's forecast for AI revenue next year, when shipments will begin.\nAnalysts at Mizuho, Cantor Fitzgerald and KeyBanc all said they think AI startup OpenAI is the customer. The Financial Times reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the partnership, that the two companies co-designed a chip that will hit the market next year.\nOpenAI declined to comment on the report.\nWhile Broadcom doesn't name its large web-scale customers, analysts have said dating back to last year that its first three clients were Google, Meta and TikTok parent ByteDance.\n\"During the call, the company surprised us by noting that it had secured a $10B order from a fourth XPU customer (we believe this is OpenAI), adding significant upside to the company's three current XPU customers (Google, Meta, and ByteDance),\" analysts at Cantor wrote in a note late Thursday. \"Shipments are expected to commence in 2026.\"\nBroadcom's stock has been on a tear of late as the company has joined Nvidia at the front of the race to build the kinds of processors and infrastructures needed for massive AI workloads.

The company said it expects $17.4 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, higher than the $17.02 billion expected by Wall Street analysts, with AI revenue reaching $6.2 billion.\nBut news of an incoming $10 billion customer is what got Wall Street excited.\nTan said on the call that \"immediate and fairly substantial demand\" boosts the outlook for next year, \"and really changes our thinking of what 2026 would be starting to look like.\"\nThe company didn't provide specific guidance for next year, but Tan suggested that growth in its AI could be above the 50% to 60% range he'd offered in the prior call.\nAnalysts at Mizuho raised their AI revenue growth estimate for next year to 76% up from about 60%, which would bring the total to $35 billion. Total revenue for the year ending in October 2026 is expected to increase about 30% to $81.8 billion from $63.1 billion this fiscal year, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG.\nIn addition to hardware, Broadcom has a large software business, keyed by its $61 billion acquisition of server virtualization software vendor VMware in 2023. Revenue in the infrastructure software business, which includes VMWare, rose 43% to $6.79 billion.\n— CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report.\nWATCH: Broadcom shares spike", "content_hash": "1948b6cfdbabd890fbb2e757b4e3642a", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The ticketing data in this CNBC report was sourced from that document.\nThe NFL requires every team to give 34% of ticket revenue and the licensing amount of a club seat to the league based on an internal formula, according to several NFL executives who asked to remain unnamed so they could speak freely about private conversations. This pool, known as the visiting team's share, or VTS, is mostly redistributed equally among the 32 teams. In 2024, each team received $27 million, up from $25 million the previous year, according to the league executives.\nStory continues after interactive chart.\nThe VTS money not redistributed is used by the NFL to fund league-level lending programs that go toward the private financing of new stadiums and renovations. Some teams are granted waivers by the NFL on a portion of their VTS contribution if they are using stadium revenue to finance construction or renovations. The Las Vegas Raiders and Los Angeles Rams, for example, received waivers of $23.4 million and $12.2 million, respectively, for their new stadiums, according to the NFL executives.\nThe league's 32 teams collected an average of $433 million in national revenue in 2024 from media, licensing and sponsorship agreements, said the executives.

It will sideline major store renovations and development in the meantime.\nWhile the changes will vary based on the location, expect more seating, dark wood paneling and other tweaks that make its cafes cozier. The renovations will also include changes like less harsh lighting that won't affect customers with light sensitivity.\n\"We're uplifting more than 1,000 coffeehouses over the next year, blending our global heritage with local relevance to create spaces that are immersive, inclusive, and deeply human,\" Dawn Clark, Starbucks senior vice president of coffeehouse design and concepts, said in a statement to CNBC.\n\"Whether it's the laid-back warmth of the Palisades or the urban energy of Manhattan, intentional design encourages customers to stay longer, connect more, and return often — and translates into meaningful business impact,\" Clark said.\nStarbucks is planning to spend about $150,000 on each \"uplift,\" without closing the stores down. The company started with locations in New York, followed by cafes in Southern California.\nThe makeovers are intended to make the stores more welcoming, returning Starbucks to its prior status as a \"third place\" for customers to hang out between home and work. In recent years, Starbucks had lost that reputation, fueled by decisions like removing seats as mobile ordering become popular and getting rid of outlets to discourage lingering.\nUnder CEO Brian Niccol, the chain plans to reverse many of those decisions as it tries to break a sales slump. For example, he previously told employees in June that he plans to add back the 30,000 seats that had been removed from cafes.\nBut trying to appeal to a wider swath of customers isn't new for the company. Starbucks first unveiled an accessible store design in early 2024, before Niccol's tenure. At the time, the company said that the design took about two years and included input from baristas.\nTake a look inside a recently renovated New York City cafe near Manhattan's Union Square.\nBefore the renovation, the location lacked many decorative touches, besides some large-scale photos of the chain's Hacienda Alsacia, its coffee and research farm in Costa Rica.\nWith such sparse seating, the cafe's concrete floors were more obvious. Harsh lighting didn't help the store's appearance either.\nThe location now features much more seating near the entrance. Leather accents to the wraparound booth make the seats more comfortable. The tables are easily movable and at an accessible height for wheelchair users.\nStarbucks also brought back the electrical outlets that disappeared in prior makeovers. Now customers who want to study or work from the location can charge their laptops or phones, encouraging them to stay longer.\nLarge area rugs bring a cozy touch, in addition to dampening some of the cafe's ambient noise. Live plants also add to the homey vibe of the space.\nHigh-top tables, positioned closer to the barista bar, offer a seating option for customers looking to sit down with companions. The makeover adds 16 more seats to the location.\nStarbucks also changed out its lightbulbs to soften the store's lighting and reduce glare, giving it a warmer atmosphere. The improved lighting helps highlight an existing mural, seen on the right of the photo above.\nBehind the barista bar, the company added a large shelving unit that highlights bags of its coffee, plus decorative burlap sacks that hold beans.

President Donald Trump meets, touts, and tortures. During a dinner at the White House Thursday night with more than two dozen tech execs, Trump again warned he would soon impose \"fairly substantial\" semiconductor tariffs without indicating how they will work or what it means. Apple and Meta seem most favored. 2. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 22,000 in August versus analysts' estimate of 75,000, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report Friday. Stock futures rose on the expectation that weaker numbers will push the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in September. Conversation about a 50 basis point cut may pick up from here. 3. Broadcom saw a dramatic acceleration in spending on AI chips and is adding new customers beyond TikTok parent ByteDance, Meta, and Alphabet . The chipmaker posted a beat and raise Thursday after the bell, but the stock didn't really take off until CEO Hock Tan talked about $10 billion in custom AI-related orders from a new customer. VMWare, the software giant Broadcom bought for $69 billion nearly two years ago, was strong too. We raised our price target on shares, which are up 15% this morning. 4. Lululemon is disappointing again, with the stock plunging nearly 20% after the company gave a worse-than-expected full-year outlook. Too expensive and too much competition. No more de minimis exception, which allowed packages under a certain value to enter the U.S. without paying tariffs. Multiple downgrades on the Street. The end of athleisure or on to the next buzzy brand? 5. UnitedHealth caught a price target raise at Bernstein, which went to $379 from $337. It was the second PT boost this week for the health insurer. Is the bottom in? The analysts also raised CVS Health to $77 from $72. 6. JPMorgan cut its FedEx price target to $285 from $290 heading into the company's Sept. 18 earnings. The firm said estimates for fiscal Q1 could come in weak thanks to \"stagnant\" business-to-business demand. 7 . Wells Fargo raised its price target on American Express to $375 from $350 — remains incredibly strong. I've been a fan of this one for ages. 8. DoorDash 's price target was raised to $306 from $280 at Wells, which raised its 2026 EBITDA estimates. 9. J.B. Hunt downgraded to hold from buy at UBS, noting that a pricing inflection in the truckload market is less likely in the near term. No demand catalyst in sight. 10. Barclays lowered its price target on Adobe to $460 from $567 heading into its earnings report next week. The firm kept an overweight buy rating, though. Adobe uses the same model as struggling Club stock Salesforce — they charge too much.

Gross margin decreased 1.1 percentage points to 58.5%, and operating margin decreased 210 basis points to 20.7%.\nChief Financial Officer Meghan Frank said on the call that the removal of the de minimis exemption, which excluded some smaller shipments from tariffs, will significantly affect the company, representing roughly 1.7 percentage points of the 2.2 percentage-point tariff-related decline in profit expected for the year.\nSame-store sales in the Americas were down 4%. Overall comparable sales increased just 1% compared to Wall Street estimates of 2.2%. Lululemon said it added 14 net new stores during the second quarter, bringing its total to 784 stores.\n\"My view is that it's now time to reset many of our practices related to how we develop and create the range of products that will fuel the next phase of our growth,\" McDonald said Thursday. \"We have seen that when we get our product right, everything else can follow.\"\nLululemon projects third-quarter revenue will come in between $2.47 billion and $2.50 billion compared to Wall Street estimates of $2.57 billion. The company said it expects earnings per share in the next quarter to come in between $2.18 and $2.23 per share, compared to an estimate of $2.93 per share.\nMcDonald said on the Thursday call that he believes the company has let its product lifecycles \"run too long,\" particularly in its lounge and social categories.\n\"We have become too predictable within our casual offerings and missed opportunities to create new trends,\" he said, identifying those issues as the \"root causes\" of the company's product challenges in the U.S.\n\"Our lounge and social product offerings have become stale and have not been resonating with guests,\" McDonald added.\nTo regain its U.S. momentum, McDonald said the company plans to increase its new styles from 23% of its overall assortment to 35% next spring, and improve its fast-track design capabilities. He said Lululemon will not make any short-term decisions that \"could hurt or damage\" the brand in the long term.\n\"We are not satisfied with the results for the quarter, and we know our brand can and will perform better than these results,\" McDonald said.", "content_hash": "64ec4d2fc42de764869a621a3994da42", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

In other words, when they underperform their benchmark, that underperformance is relatively large.\nConversely, active managers generally fare better in less liquid areas of the market, like fixed income, real estate, and small-cap and emerging-market stocks, Armour said.\nFor example, 43% of actively managed high-yield bond mutual funds and ETFs beat their index counterparts in the past 10-year period, according to Morningstar.\nFees are the key\nFees are the key driver of index funds' success when compared to active funds, Armour said.\nIndex funds carry a 0.11% average asset-weighted annual fee, while active funds carry a 0.59% fee, according to Morningstar.\nActive funds need to have higher relative returns just to overcome that fee differential.\nBeyond that, higher fees also eat into investor earnings. For example, an investor with $100,000 who earns 4% per year and pays a 0.25% fund fee would have $208,000 after 20 years, while the same investor paying a 1% fee would have $179,000, or $29,000 less, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSince index funds own all the securities in a broad market index, they are guaranteed to own the relative winners and losers. While active managers may own more of the winners than their index counterparts, they also risk missing out, Armour said.\nMany active managers took risk off the table in April when President Donald Trump first announced so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs, but the market then proceeded to rebound quickly, Armour said.", "content_hash": "c2a9d0a6130efefe94053158e8e00dbe", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

And what you see here is only the first car of a series of models, which employs the same technologies,\" Zipse said.\nBMW has sought to revolutionize the digital offering of its new models by focusing on a so-called \"superbrain architecture,\" which replaces hardware with a centralized computer system.\nThe company says an \"all-new digital nervous system\" for the Neue Klasse platform has more than 20 times the computing power of its current vehicle generation.\nThese digital platforms provide the computing capacity for automated driving and infotainment functions, as well as basic car functions, such as climate control and comfort features.\nThe push to highlight the firm's technological development comes as legacy European car manufacturers scramble to close the gap with leading players of software-defined vehicles. U.S. EV-maker Tesla, alongside Chinese manufacturers including Xpeng and BYD, currently dominate this space.\n\"There is fierce competition, especially price competition in China. There are a lot of new players in the market [and] there is a tough fight about market share,\" Zipse said.\nOn the other hand, Zipse said the company has just over 3% market share worldwide and doesn't have to compete in every market segment. What will help in the areas that it does compete, Zipse said, is the firm's brand value.\n\"BMW is a promise. The brand is a promise to have the highest possible quality, to have the latest technology, and to be very customer orientated. I think that is very important,\" Zipse said.\nShares of BMW are up around 13% year-to-date.", "content_hash": "ddadf3048eed6eb13261506017a6d291", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Kennedy Jr. doubled down on false claims about vaccines and claimed he isn't limiting access to Covid shots during his Senate testimony on Thursday, as senators grilled him on his sweeping changes to immunization policy and federal health agencies.\nKennedy said he supports a statement made by a newly appointed member of a key government vaccine panel that mRNA vaccines pose a dangerous risk to people. Numerous studies have demonstrated that shots using mRNA technology, including Covid vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, are safe and effective, and serious side effects have happened in extremely rare cases.\nSen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., noted that the committee member, Dr. Retsef Levi, has said that evidence is mounting that mRNA vaccines cause \"serious harm, including death, especially among young people,\" apparently referring to a post pinned on Levi's X account. Kennedy appointed Levi to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine recommendations and insurance coverage.\nKennedy said he wasn't aware of Levi's comments, but added, \"I agree with it.\"\nHe also claimed that anyone could get a Covid booster shot, while also acknowledging that access \"depends on the state\" and that the government no longer recommends the vaccines for healthy people.\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved a fresh round of Covid shots with new limits, only clearing them for adults aged 65 and older and people with a medical condition that puts them at risk of a severe illness. The CDC and its vaccine panel will decide who to recommend the shots to later this month.\n\"I'm not taking them away from people,\" Kennedy said, referring to the vaccines.\nBut Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., argued that not everyone can walk into a pharmacy and get a Covid shot now.\nThe FDA's new limits have complicated Covid shot access in the U.S., which now depends on a patient's age and risk level, laws and policies in their state, insurance coverage, and health-care provider. Pending CDC guidance, some pharmacies have added prescription requirements for Covid vaccines in certain states.\n\"You clearly are taking away vaccines,\" she said after a prolonged shouting match with Kennedy.\nKennedy's comments before the Senate Finance Committee come after he repeatedly promised the panel in January that he would do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it more difficult or discourages people from taking vaccines. Since then, he has canceled funding for mRNA shot development and made other vaccine policy changes that could limit access to immunizations, including gutting the CDC vaccine panel and dropping Covid shot recommendations for certain groups.\nHis comments also follow a leadership shake-up at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The White House last week fired CDC Director Susan Monarez, and four senior agency officials resigned shortly after, with some of them citing the politicization of the agency and a threat to public health. In an opinion piece on Thursday, Monarez accused Kennedy of \"a deliberate effort to weaken America's public-health system and vaccine protections.\"\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X in support of Kennedy on Thursday, writing that he \"is taking flak because he's over the target\" and saying Democrats were attacking the Trump administration's \"commonsense effort.\"\nKennedy touted skepticism around Covid vaccines, despite evidence of their safety and effectiveness.\n\"We were told again and again the vaccines would prevent transmission, they prevent infection. It wasn't true. They knew it from the start,\" Kennedy said.\nHe also said he does not know how many people died of Covid and whether the vaccines prevented deaths from the virus.\n\"I would like to see the data and talk about the data,\" Kennedy said.\nBut data is readily available from dozens of studies. One paper in August estimates that Covid vaccines saved more than 2 million lives, mostly among older adults, worldwide between 2020 and October 2024.\nThe CDC website also says that Covid vaccines from the 2023 to 2024 season reduced the risk of severe illness from Covid by almost 70% in the first two months after vaccination in adults ages 18 and older, with protection gradually declining over time.\nThose shots also decreased the risk of hospitalization due to Covid by around 50% in the first two months of vaccination in that same population. The Covid vaccines showed similar benefits in older adults.\nKennedy also defended his decision to fire all 17 previous members of the CDC vaccine panel, saying he didn't politicize the committee.\n\"What we did is we got rid of the conflicts of interest. ... We depoliticized and put great scientists on it from a very diverse group,\" the HHS secretary said. \"They are very, very pro-vaccine.\"\nBut a new analysis published last month from USC researchers found that conflicts of interest on that panel had been at \"historic lows for years\" before Kennedy restacked it with new members, some of whom are widely known vaccine critics.\nCorrection: Kennedy testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday.

During the visit, Altman said India was OpenAI's second-largest market by number of users.\nHe has subsequently said that AI adoption in India is \"amazing to watch.\"\n\"We love to see the explosion of creativity--india is outpacing the world,\" he said on X earlier this year.\nIndia is one of ChatGPT's fastest-growing markets globally, Nick Patience, practice lead for AI at tech research and analysis firm Futurum Group, told CNBC. \"OpenAI's India focus is a strategic move to gain a competitive edge,\" he added.\nHere's a rundown of how OpenAI is expanding in India.\nChatGPT explosion\nChatGPT, OpenAI's core product, has seen strong growth in India. The app was downloaded 10.2 million times in India in August, a huge jump from the 2.5 million downloads seen during the same month last year, according to analytics firm Appfigures.\nSince its launch, ChatGPT has 111 million downloads in India, ahead of its 80 million downloads in the U.S, Appfigures data shows.\nDownloads do not necessarily equal daily or monthly users, but the figures emphasise OpenAI's growth trajectory in the country.\nThe download numbers are also far ahead of rivals, including Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude. The closest challenger was Perplexity, Appfigures said, which had 6.4 million downloads in August.\nIndia-specific product\nUser spending on ChatGPT has been increasing. To date, Indian users have spent $21.3 million on ChatGPT, Appfigures data shows. In comparison, U.S. users have spent $784 million.\nThat underlines the fact that while the number of users in India is huge, it remains a price-sensitive market.\nTo address this, OpenAI in August launched ChatGPT Go, a low-cost 399-rupees-($4.53)-a-month plan for its AI app.\n\"It's a classic wedge strategy to capture a price-sensitive market and build a user base that will be difficult for local players to dislodge later,\" Futurum Group's Patience said of the strategy.\nInfrastructure and hiring\nAccording to Bloomberg, OpenAI is scouting a location in India for a data center with at least 1-gigawatt capacity. The facility will be part of OpenAI's Stargate-branded infrastructure push, Bloomberg said this week, although CNBC was unable to verify the report.\nThe ChatGPT developer said last month that it would open a local office in the market and is currently advertising three sales roles in India.\nIt also announced last month an education program in India that will include funding for research and provide half a million ChatGPT licenses for educators and students across the country.\nIndia challenges\nWhile India doesn't have a home-grown artificial intelligence company as big as OpenAI, there are some challengers in the form of domestic startups, including Sarvam AI and Krutrim, and other American tech giants like Google and Meta.\nContinued geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and India over trade, however, have the potential to cause complications if there's any backlash from New Delhi against American tech firms.\nOpenAI is also locked in a legal battle with Asian News International in India, which has accused the ChatGPT developer of using copyrighted material illegally. It's a closely-watched case in the country for how copyright laws apply in the AI era.\n\"OpenAI's success in India is not guaranteed and depends heavily on its ability to navigate these legal and political hurdles,\" Futurum Group's Patience said.\n\"While the Indian market is vast, its diversity in languages and user needs presents challenges. OpenAI's ability to deliver a truly localized product and its long-term impact on India's AI talent remain uncertain.\"", "content_hash": "2cc597ecf6d6154ddb53c663447feaee", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona, introduced a bill on Thursday — titled the You Earn It, You Keep it Act — to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits. A House version of the bill was introduced by Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minnesota, in April.\nGallego's bill would permanently eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits.\nIt would also expand the Social Security payroll tax to apply to annual earnings over $250,000. Currently, the maximum earnings subject to Social Security payroll taxes is $176,100 in 2025. Consequently, high earners may only pay into the program for part of the year.\n\"Despite decades of paying into the system, seniors are still forced to pay taxes on their hard-earned benefits — all while the ultra wealthy barely pay into the system,\" Gallego said in a statement.\nHow Social Security benefits are taxed\nSocial Security recipients may owe federal income taxes on their benefits depending on their income.\nHow much they may owe is based on a formula known as combined income — the sum of adjusted gross income, tax-exempt interest income and half of Social Security benefits.\nUp to 50% of benefits may be taxed for individual tax filers with between $25,000 and $34,000 in combined income, or married couples who file jointly with between $32,000 and $44,000.\nUp to 85% of benefits may be taxable for individuals with more than $34,000 in combined income or couples with more than $44,000.\nHow the 'big beautiful' tax law helps seniors\nRepublicans' new \"big beautiful\" law includes a new senior deduction aimed at helping to defray the effects of federal taxes on Social Security benefits.\nAdults aged 65 and over may be able to claim an additional deduction of up to $6,000.\nWhether beneficiaries will benefit from the change will depend on their income.\nThe full deduction will be available to individual taxpayers with up to $75,000 in modified adjusted gross income or married couples with up to $150,000. The deduction will gradually phase out for taxpayers with incomes above those thresholds.\nThe temporary deduction — which will be in effect for tax years 2025 through 2028 — will be available to eligible taxpayers regardless of whether they take the standard deduction or itemize their returns.\nMiddle-income taxpayers stand to benefit the most from the policy, according to tax experts, since low earners may already be exempt from federal taxes on benefits and higher earners will be above the phaseout thresholds.\nHow 'You Earn It, You Keep It' may affect Social Security\nUnlike the temporary senior deduction recently signed into law, Gallego's You Earn It, You Keep It proposal would eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits for all beneficiaries.\nTo be sure, it remains to be seen whether it may get enough support to become law.\nThe proposal does have the support of The Senior Citizens League, a nonpartisan senior advocacy group that is petitioning Congress to stop taxing Social Security benefits. Eliminating federal taxes on Social Security benefits is a \"commonsense step to ensure older Americans can keep more of what they've earned,\" Senior Citizens League Executive Director Shannon Benton said in a statement.\nEfforts to change the federal taxation of Social Security benefits come as the program is facing a trust fund shortfall. Benefits may be reduced within the next decade unless Congress enacts changes sooner, according to projections from Social Security's trustees.\nBecause the \"big beautiful\" law did not include any offsets for the reduced revenue from federal taxes on benefits, it would accelerate the depletion dates, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\nIn contrast, the You Earned It, You Keep It proposal would extend the Social Security trust funds' ability to pay benefits in full and on time for 24 years, or until 2058, according to Gallego's office. That matches an analysis of Craig's House proposal by Social Security's chief actuary in April.", "content_hash": "c9191b29aba6f9e461228cb296b7877b", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

He pointed to the deals available at the Excalibur, one of MGM's resorts on the Las Vegas Strip: $85 rooms, including resort fee; $5 tables; $5 beers. But the $12 Starbucks coffee grabs the headline.\n\"There is value there, and there's always been value,\" Hornbuckle said. \"We let the narrative get away from us and shame on us. We need to do a better job.\"\nMGM and Las Vegas more broadly had posted several years of growth in visitation, room rates and profits before this year's slowdown.\nWhen asked whether the Vegas slump could be a canary in the coal mine for U.S. travel more broadly, Hornbuckle, who chairs the U.S. Travel Association, said it does seem to be a leading indicator. And the industry as a whole is facing some troubling obstacles.\nCanadian visitation to the U.S. has plummeted some 40% this year, following comments by President Donald Trump about Canada as a potential 51st U.S. state and evolving trade policies. The Canadian dollar has also weakened, lessening the buying power of visitors crossing the border into the U.S.\nHornbuckle also pointed to massive price hikes for a U.S. visa, from $100 to $350, where a family of four visiting for the Ryder Cup, World Cup or Olympics in 2028, for example, could pay $1,400 for visa documents alone.\n\"International travel in 2016 had a $50 billion U.S. surplus. Today it's a $50 billion deficit,\" Hornbuckle said.\nThe government's commitment to funding marketing and promotion of U.S. travel was also slashed by 80% in the most recent spending bill, to $20 million.\n\"We obviously find ourselves in a world that has a fair amount of uncertainty from a macroeconomic perspective, from a socio-political perspective,\" Marriott CEO Tony Capuano told investors at the BofA conference Thursday. \"Marriott, and the sector more broadly, thrives in times of certainty and stability. So that creates some measure of challenge.\"\nCapuano said there's been a slight uptick after Labor Day in some segments of travel. He said Marriott sees spending restrained in budget travelers and small businesses. But he described demand for luxury travel as \"sturdy.\"\nWyndham Hotel and Resorts CEO Geoff Ballotti laid out an optimistic view of the travel industry, noting robust demand for extended stay, driven in part by projects supporting the government's infrastructure spending.\n\"You're seeing incredible interest in investment right now,\" Ballotti told CNBC. \"Our new construction pipeline, 20 consecutive quarters of growth, is at an all-time high. We're seeing groundbreakings accelerate. We're seeing a new construction pipeline accelerate, and we're seeing it more so here domestically than we are anywhere else in the world.\"", "content_hash": "020989cb6f7ffff916b022c9ebe4af5c", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Ford is seeing the surge, with EV sales up 19.3% in August from the same period last year.

It canceled plans for a three-row electric SUV a year ago and said at the time it would prioritize the development of hybrid models.\n\"We are out of sync, in a good way, with our competitors who are now fully loaded with all their EVs, and they'll have to commit to them,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley said on the company's latest earnings call with analysts at the end of July.\nIt's also a sign that some consumers are still willing to spend on large vehicles. The most popular models of the Expedition start at around $74,000, Ford said Thursday, and can go up from there. Ford said its most popular models are the Platinum, Tremor and King Ranch, at the higher end of the lineup.\nThe automaker unveiled the latest model of the Expedition in October, and it started shipping the SUV about five months ago. It's assembled at the company's Kentucky Truck Plant.\nFord's main rival in the segment has long been GM, with its Chevrolet Tahoe, Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon vehicles.

The next step in this program will occur on Tuesday, September 9 when Porsche customers will gain soft launch access to the Tesla Supercharger network. This means Porsche owners will have access to 23,500 Tesla Superchargers in North America – helping them find even more convenient places to charge.\nAccess to the Tesla Supercharger network will be possible though Porsche-supplied NACS DC adapter being made available to Porsche customers. At this soft launch stage, Porsche customers will utilize the Tesla app to enable charging. Charging through the My Porsche app and plug-and-charge is expected to follow in the coming months.\n“We are continually working to make every aspect of Porsche ownership as convenient as possible for our customers – and this news represents a significant step for owners of our electrified cars,” said Timo Resch, President and CEO of Porsche Cars North America. “As we launch this offering, in the coming months, we will be adding more features to make the process even more seamless.”\nThe adapter\nGoing forward, all new model year 2026 Porsche Taycan and Macan Electric models will include Porsche NACS DC adapter at no additional fee. Model year 2025 Taycan owners and all existing Macan Electric owners are eligible for a complimentary adapter. This group of owners will receive notification via their My Porsche to reserve their free Porsche NACS DC adapter shortly.\nModel year 2024 and older Taycan customers can elect to purchase the Porsche NACS DC adapter from the Porsche Online Shop and at local Porsche Centers starting today. The MSRP of the adapter is $185 and enables Porsche owners to charge their CCS-equipped Taycan and Macan Electric models at DC fast charging stations equipped with NACS/J3400 compatible cables, including select Tesla Superchargers.\nHow it works\nThis soft launch will allow customer access the Tesla Supercharger network ahead of the full operational launch – with enhanced features such as access via the Porsche app and plug & charge capability – following in the coming months.\nCustomers connecting to a NACS Tesla Supercharger will need to take two simple steps – the first being to download and register on the Tesla app to activate Tesla Supercharger stations.\nOther stations, such as Ionna and Electrify America with NACS handles, can be activated via the My Porsche app. Next, they will use their new Porsche NACS DC adapter to connect to the charging station cable before it can then be plugged into the car.\nCharge planning software\nAll model year 2026 Taycan and Macan Electric variants will come with the necessary navigation features to incorporate the location of additional chargers. Model year 2024 and 2025 Macan Electric models will receive this software update before the end of the year, while model year 2025 and earlier Taycan variants will receive their upgrade thereafter. All charge-planning software updates will be complimentary.", "content_hash": "03dbae534a223b3e01fbbffe618ab2d0", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

(NASDAQ:AAPL)’s shares jumped by 3.3% on Wednesday after a major headwind disappeared in the form of search engine giant Google’s troubles with the Justice Department. The shares were higher as a court ruled that Google could continue to pay companies to push its Search service on devices. For Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), this meant that its deal with Google, reportedly valued at $20 billion, to push Google Search on the iPhone. Cramer discussed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) before the news of the court ruling broke:\n“Well that’s why I think that China remains the wildcard and all of this is just setting up for very, very difficult, tough negotiation. So therefore you have to look at Apple, you have to look at NVIDIA and people are just saying, alright I’ve looked, I’ve judged, sell. That’s too simple. These are great companies and they will figure out a way to make money.”\nPreviously, Cramer discussed how Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the only major company that isn’t spending heavily on NVIDIA’s AI GPUs:\n“Apple is the only one of these heavy hitters that isn’t writing huge checks to NVIDIA, simply because they don’t have an AI strategy. Apple stock, by the way, is the poorest performer of the big tech stocks. Will that change after tonight’s numbers? Will Apple turn out to have the last laugh while all the others fall flat on their faces?… Listen, we heard the same thing about the dot-com survivors at the turn of the millennium.”\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) helped lay the foundation for the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The demand for these processors has been off the charts, driving an unprecedented surge in revenue and profits. This fueled blistering gains in the stock price, which vaulted Nvidia's market cap to $4 trillion, the first company to ever surpass that lofty benchmark.\nHowever, after several years of stellar gains, Nvidia investors are looking beyond the buzz and wondering if the stock has simply come too far, too fast. Many are looking for evidence that AI will live up to the hype, fueling greater adoption in the months and years to come.\nBroadcom (AVGO 10.66%) just provided proof positive that the adoption of AI continues unfettered.\nBlockbuster results\nBroadcom announced the results of its fiscal 2025 third quarter (ended Aug. 3), and the results were robust by every important measure. Record revenue of $15.95 billion climbed 22% year over year, fueling adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.69, which jumped 36%.\nFor context, analysts' consensus estimates called for revenue of $15.82 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.66, so Broadcom cleared expectations with room to spare.\nDemand for AI was the driving force behind the stellar results, as AI-centric revenue accelerated 63% year over year to $5.2 billion. This also marked the company's 10th consecutive quarter of AI-fueled growth. Free cash flow clocked in at $7 billion, up 47% year over year.\nBroadcom gave investors other reasons to celebrate. CEO Hock Tan revealed that beyond its three existing hyperscale customers, one prospective customer had ordered production of its custom AI accelerators, becoming a \"qualified customer,\" something Broadcom has been signaling for months. The combination of higher demand and the new customer increased the company's backlog to $110 billion.\nThe chief executive also boosted Broadcom's fourth-quarter outlook and is now guiding for revenue of $17.4 billion, an increase of 24% compared to the prior-year quarter. For context, analysts' consensus estimates were calling for Q4 revenue of $17.01 billion. This illustrates that despite an already robust outlook, demand for AI continues to outpace expectations. Tan went on to say that while Broadcom originally expected its 2026 growth to mirror 2025, he now sees growth accelerating.\nIn a bonus announcement, Tan reported that the board of directors had extended his tenure as CEO until at least 2030.\n\"Broad\"er implications\nBeyond the positive implications for Broadcom investors, the results provide additional insight into the general state of AI. Investors have been concerned that the AI hype machine may have gotten ahead of actual adoption. Broadcom's accelerating results add weight to Nvidia's quarterly report, confirming the company's assertion that demand for AI continues at a rapid rate.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during the company's earnings call that he expects data center spending fueled by AI will reach between $3 trillion and $4 trillion by 2030, fueled by accelerating demand for AI, up from estimates of $600 billion this year.\nFurthermore, Broadcom noted that its increasing backlog was partially the result of increasing demand from its existing hyperscale customers, suggesting that cloud infrastructure providers are boosting their capital expenditures (capex), above and beyond the increases previously announced.\nBy extension, this will likely translate to additional growth for Nvidia, as its GPUs are the gold standard for AI, controlling a dominant 92% of the data center GPU market, according to IoT Analytics. Furthermore, as AI expands downstream beyond the hyperscale data center, Nvidia is the logical choice when it comes to the processors needed for both AI training and inference.\nSince the dawn of the AI revolution in early 2023, Nvidia stock has soared more than 1,070% (as of this writing). In recent months, however, the popular narrative suggests the implementation of AI is slowing, despite Nvidia and Broadcom both posting accelerating results. The evidence is clear that AI adoption continues at a remarkable pace.\nOn the bright side, Nvidia stock is currently trading for just 27 times next year's expected earnings, which is an attractive price to pay for a company expected to grow revenue by 58% during its current fiscal year.\nAs the leading provider of data center GPUs, Nvidia has staked out a vast territory in the AI landscape and despite the stock's blistering gains, the evidence suggests its run is far from over.", "content_hash": "488038dfaafab17ccd50f995c1e3eea1", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Allie Canal outlines what you need to know.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief.\nWell, Tesla is putting a jaw-dropping new pay package on the table for CEO Elon Musk, potentially worth up to 1 trillion dollars over the next decade.\nThe deal laid out in Tesla's latest proxy filing is entirely performance-based. Musk won't see a dime in salary or bonuses. Instead, he'll only earn stock awards if he hits a series of ambitious targets.\nThat includes things like deploying a million robo taxis, delivering 20 million vehicles, rolling out AI robots and growing Tesla's market cap to at least 8.5 trillion.\nIf Musk achieves every milestone, his stake in Tesla could rise to around 25%, cementing his control over the company.\nThe proposal will go to a shareholder vote at Tesla's annual meeting on November 6th. It does come after a Delaware court struck down Musk's latest record setting pay package from 2018, valued at roughly 50 billion, a ruling that Tesla is still appealing.\nThe incentives in the new plan aim to keep Musk's focus on Tesla while it pursues growth in newer markets including robotics and artificial intelligence.\nFriday's filing also included a non-binding shareholder proposal for Tesla to take a stake in Musk's XAI startup, an idea that Musk himself has previously discussed.", "content_hash": "7c119d24c9e7c98e1049f4df08dc0c69", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

That sent the stock up nearly 10% over the past two days, putting it within striking distance of a $3 trillion market value. With the case now out of the way, investors are turning their attention back to the potential for gains in Alphabet’s stock, which is the cheapest among the Magnificent Seven despite the recent rally.\n“What it does is it clears the runway for additional growth opportunities,” said Neville Javeri, senior fund manager at Allspring Global Investments, referring to the ruling. He sees an “incredible opportunity” in the stock as the decision “sets them up for a growth opportunity that might have been taken away.”\nThe ruling caps a strong stretch for Alphabet shares that began after its second-quarter earnings showed demand for artificial intelligence products is lifting sales. At the same time, its AI offerings continue to boost investor confidence in Alphabet’s ability to fend off competition from rivals like OpenAI.\nShares rose 0.3% on Friday.\nThe stock has gained more than 20% since the July 23 earnings report, vaulting Alphabet into the top third of performers in the Nasdaq 100 Index this year, after months of struggles amid concerns about antitrust risks and fears that AI upstarts could eat away at its Google search business, which accounts for more than half of revenue. As recently as June, Alphabet shares were down more than 10% while the Nasdaq 100 was in positive territory.\nThough the debate over AI is unlikely to be settled anytime soon, Wall Street is increasingly confident Alphabet can defend its turf. It debuted AI functions that were widely praised earlier this year, and the latest version of its Pixel phones, which come loaded with AI features, were also well received. Sales of handsets from both Alphabet and Samsung Electronics indicate consumers are willing to switch to devices that use Google’s Android operating system.\nApproaching a Milestone\n“Given new AI Search features and GOOG’s rapidly scaling Gemini app, we expect Google will maintain its leadership in traditional search,” TD Cowen analyst John Blackledge wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.\nWith a market capitalization of $2.82 trillion, Alphabet is roughly 7% shy of the $3 trillion mark, a level that’s only been reached by Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Nvidia Corp.\nClosing that gap may not be much of a stretch. Alphabet trades around 21 times estimated earnings, compared with 26 times for the Nasdaq 100, and its revenues are expected to grow 14% this year, outpacing the benchmark.\n“The stock still looks attractive, since it has so many high-quality businesses growing at fast rates,” said Liam McGarrity, US investment analyst at Harris Oakmark, which has Alphabet as its largest holding.\nDespite the improving sentiment, Alphabet’s momentum could be difficult to sustain in the near term. The stock’s 14-day relative strength index jumped above 83, its highest since 2017 and well above 70, the level where technical traders consider a security overbought. The shares are trading even with average analyst price target, suggesting Wall Street doesn’t see much upside from here.\nInvestors “understandably are relieved that near-term risks are dissipated,” but “long-term concerns about competitive risks to search will constrain the multiple,” Rosenblatt Securities analyst Barton Crockett wrote in a note to clients Wednesday, reiterating his neutral rating on the stock.\nFor McGarrity, owning Alphabet comes down to believing in its ability to stay ahead of AI rivals and maintain growth.\n“When you consider it is cheaper than the market even though it has industry-leading AI and significant potential in businesses like Google Cloud and Waymo, then it seems like it is trading at a significant discount,” he said.\nTech Chart of the Day\nBroadcom Inc. shares rallied on Friday, hitting a record high as the chipmaker is said to be helping OpenAI design and produce an artificial intelligence accelerator from 2026. Separately, the company said that its AI outlook will improve “significantly” in fiscal 2026, helping allay concerns about slowing growth.\nTop Tech Stories\nApple Inc.’s annual sales in India hit a record of nearly $9 billion in the last fiscal year, signaling growing consumer demand for its flagship devices as the company ramps up its retail footprint in the world’s most populous country.\nTikTok rival Xiaohongshu Technology Co. is on track to triple its profit to $3 billion this year, making progress with commercialization on the way to a potential public listing.\nAnthropic is blocking its services from Chinese-controlled companies, saying it’s taking steps to prevent a US adversary from advancing in AI and threatening American national security.\nDeepSeek is developing an artificial intelligence model with more advanced AI agent features to compete with US rivals like OpenAI in a newer frontier of the technology, according to people familiar with the matter.\nPresident Donald Trump said he would be imposing tariffs on semiconductor imports “very shortly” but spare goods from companies like Apple Inc. that have pledged to boost their US investments.\nTrump’s administration just tore up a quiet compromise that some of the world’s biggest chipmakers have relied on to maintain crucial operations in China. That tees up four months of complex policy talks to satisfy US national security concerns while avoiding disruptions to supply chains that underpin the global electronics market.\nEarnings Due Friday\nNo major earnings expected\n--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke, Subrat Patnaik, David Watkins and Brandon Harden.", "content_hash": "6e8ce2b2b4a1caaa698fa74e01843378", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Tariffs should contribute to ongoing price increases in household furnishings, apparel, and recreation commodities,” BofA said.\nAnalysts expect tariff-related goods inflation to persist over the coming quarters.\nNon-housing services are also anticipated to remain firm. BofA noted that “non-housing core services prices rose 0.4% month-on-month, after a 0.5% increase in July. Airfares likely increased again owing to another strong seasonal factor, and lodging away from home should also climb.”\nThese gains reflect both mean-reversion after earlier declines and higher summer travel activity.\nBased on these CPI forecasts, BofA expects core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation to rise to 3.0% year-on-year in August.\n“Our preliminary estimate for core PCE inflation in July is 0.27% month-on-month.

The credit card and banking giant is benefiting from increased market optimism as the Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates.\nThe credit card for the affluent customer\nAmerican Express has carved out a niche as an elite credit card provider, servicing an upscale clientele with fee-based products that come with a coveted rewards program. Although it has only a fraction of competitor Visa's card membership, it has nearly double Visa's revenue. Its cardmembers are high spenders, and they're more resilient when there's pressure, making American Express resilient, too.\nIn the 2025 second quarter, revenue increased 9% year over year (currency neutral), and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were up 17%.\nAmerican Express stands out from other credit card networks in several ways. One is the focus on the affluent consumer, and another is its closed-loop model. Instead of working with partnering banks or financial institutions to provide the credit for its customers to make purchases on its network, it acts as its own bank. That gives it greater control over the model and expands its platform. In contrast with other networks, it has a large and varied stream of revenue.\nIt also makes money on deposits, which leads to higher net interest income and higher overall net income.\nAnother way the company differentiates itself is with its robust rewards program and accompanying annual fees. Fee revenue increased 20% year over year in the second quarter and accounted for more than 13% of revenue.\nLow interest rates should boost business\nLower interest rates generally boost economic activity, because money is cheaper and therefore easier to come by. Companies can borrow more easily, and they tend to expand their operations when money is plentiful. Individuals tend to spend more when it's cheaper to service their credit.\nThis works in American Express' favor in several ways. Higher economic activity is good for spending, and people with money are also more likely to take out new fee-based cards. It also means its default rates should go lower. They're generally best-in-class, and since interest rates have started to come down from highs, they're already improving.\nAmerican Express has been a reliable stock for decades, and it also pays a growing dividend. It's one of Warren Buffett's favorite and longest-held stocks, and it can still provide value for new and current shareholders.", "content_hash": "ad72fb7aa9d9d6144d5a466b3de56077", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

I’ve been writing about the uptick in CFO turnover. The latest high-profile departure is at multibillionaire Elon Musk’s xAI.\nMike Liberatore stepped down abruptly as the finance chief of Musk’s artificial intelligence startup, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal citing anonymous sources. Liberatore was hired in April and reportedly left in late July. The reasons for his departure are not known, but he followed other high-profile exits from xAI of late. The company did not immediately respond to my request for comment.\nBefore joining xAI, Liberatore worked at Airbnb for almost nine years—most recently as VP of finance and corporate development—and had previously served in several business unit CFO roles. He’s also worked at Intel, eBay, and PayPal. During his brief tenure at xAI, he reportedly helped raise $10 billion in funding and expanded data center operations.\nLaunched by Musk in July 2023, xAI is a competitor of OpenAI. Both companies develop large language models and AI assistants—OpenAI with ChatGPT, xAI with Grok—that target overlapping user bases.\nLiberatore’s departure follows a wave of exits, including cofounder Igor Babuschkin (who left to start a VC firm focused on AI safety), General Counsel Robert Keele after one year, and senior lawyer Raghu Rao. xAI’s leadership is highly centralized under Musk, with no publicly disclosed independent board.\nMichael Morris, a professor at Columbia Business School, shared his assessment with me. He noted that Keele cited differences in worldview with Musk and family priorities in his LinkedIn post about leaving. Of course, Musk also played a key role in the Trump White House earlier this year.\nMorris also observed that executive turnover among Musk’s direct reports at Tesla is 44%, compared to about 9% at Meta, Amazon, and Netflix; overall, Tesla’s executive turnover rate is 27%, nearly double the industry average.\n“Analysts point to Musk’s demanding, high-contact leadership style—managing up to 18 direct reports at once—as a key reason for the trend,” Morris said. “This pattern is visible not only at Tesla but also at X and xAI, suggesting structural factors rather than isolated events.”\nHe added that many executives leave rather than risk being blamed when new initiatives encounter regulatory hurdles: “Executives don’t want to become the ‘fall guy.’”\nWhat fuels mass exits?\nxAI isn’t alone in seeing mass executive departures. Last year, OpenAI also saw multiple senior departures—such as cofounder John Schulman and CTO Mira Murati. Also in 2024, at the DNA testing startup 23andMe, all seven independent directors resigned simultaneously, citing major disagreements with CEO Anne Wojcicki and her plans to take the company private.", "content_hash": "40f37b2e78d15b9510890ef5a1213582", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

If purchased via stablecoins, fees would be $0.50 or much lower - a huge spread.\nThat’s the opportunity that Stripe sees, and they’re clearly moving quickly.\nTheir advantage here is their purpose-built chain (along with their laundry list of launch partners and beta testers).\nMany of today’s big chains were optimized for trading, while Tempo optimizes for payments, the largest real-world use case for crypto.\nIf it works, on-chain dollars become the default rail for payouts and commerce.\nAnd that’s a boon for the broader crypto space. More stablecoins grow the overall crypto pie and bring more users on-chain.\nBut it doesn’t necessarily mean your favorite L1 blockchain’s token is going to go up in price…\n🌎 Macro Crypto and Memes\nA few Crypto and Web3 headlines that caught my eye:\n- Crypto majors are mostly even with BTC leading; BTC +1% at $112,300, ETH even at $4,420, XRP even at $2.84, SOL -1% at $207\n- M (+26%), PUMP (+10%) and XDC (+5%) led top movers\n- The Bitcoin ETFs saw $220M in net outflows on Thursday, breaking a big 2-day inflow streak; the ETH ETFs saw $167M in net outflows\n- The SEC set a pro-crypto agenda, unveiling rulemakings to define digital-asset offers/sales and ease listings on U.S. exchanges\n- Stripe + Paradigm revealed their Tempo blockchain aimed at low-cost stablecoin settlement with partners including Visa, Deutsche Bank, OpenAI\n- Kraken announced a buyout of Breakout, planning to integrate the trader-native platform into Kraken Pro\n- WLFI blacklisted Justin Sun's address from selling his 595M unlocked tokens, citing activity concerns that broke WLFI rules (WLFI +15% since the news)\n- Gary Gensler’s text messages from Oct 2022 to Sept 2023 have been “lost” according to a recent audit\nIn Corporate Treasuries\n- Crypto treasury stocks slumped after the Nasdaq announced heightened scrutiny of equity raises to fund crypto purchases\n- Public firms now hold over 1,000,000 BTC (~$110B) led by Strategy at ~636K BTC\n- American Bitcoin stock fell below its IPO price in trading Thursday\nIn Memes\n- Memecoin leaders are slightly green on the day; DOGE +1%, Shiba +1%, PEPE +1%, PENGU -1%, BONK +2%, TRUMP +1%, SPX +4%, and FARTCOIN -1%\n- NEET (+20%), BITTY (+30%), SPARK (+15%) and TOKABU (+13%) led onchain movers\n💰 Token, Airdrop & Protocol Tracker\nHere's a rundown of major token, protocol and airdrop news from the day:\n- Pump Fun did another $12M in buybacks over the past week, representing 98% of their revenue\n- Myriad announced two new UX enhancements, including direct sign-in w/ MetaMask, Rabby & Rainbow wallets and easier bridging directly within Myriad, along with confirmation that USDC predictions will \"be considered at TGE\"\n- Arbitrum launched DRIP, its $40M DeFi incentive program, targeting leveraged looping with 24M ARB in rewards\n- Fireblocks launched a stablecoin payments network, connecting 40+ participants to streamline B2B stablecoin flows\n🤖 AI x Crypto\nSection dedicated to headlines in the AI sector of crypto:\n- Overall market cap even at $12.7B, leaders were mixed\n- FARTCOIN (-1%), VIRTUAL (+1%), TIBBIR (+5%), aixbt (+3%) & ai16z (+1%)\n- VADER (+33%) and VIRGEN (+22%) led top movers\n🚚 What is happening in NFTs?\nHere is the list of other notable headlines from the day in NFTs:\n- ETH NFT leaders were mixed; Punks +2% at 48.9 ETH, Pudgy -1% at 9.8, BAYC -1% at 9.1 ETH\n- HV-MTL up 230% were a notable top mover\n- Abstract NFTs were mostly red, led by Roach Racing (+7%)\n- Pudgy Penguins announced that OpenSea will be its official home, along with the PENGU token\n- The Pudgy Party soulbound token can now be claimed inside MetaMask portfolio\n- NFL All Day revamped its collector experience, rolling out verified digital autographed rookie highlight moments and partnering with four NFL teams on in-person activations to onboard more fans", "content_hash": "b1d6045bfafe48ff5b5802522276af48", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The company acquired stablecoin infrastructure firm Bridge for $1.1 billion and crypto wallet developer Privy, creating end-to-end payment solutions spanning wallets, stablecoins, and now blockchain processing infrastructure.\nStripe’s Crypto Stack Completion Strategy\nStripe’s blockchain development completes a comprehensive crypto infrastructure buildout that began with strategic acquisitions.\nThe Bridge acquisition provided stablecoin payment capabilities across 70 countries, while Privy added wallet infrastructure for seamless user onboarding.\nThe company initially supported Bitcoin transactions in 2014 before halting crypto services due to network inefficiencies.\nStripe rebuilt its blockchain team in 2021 and accelerated initiatives throughout 2024 following regulatory clarity brought by the Trump administration.\nStablecoin Financial Accounts launched across 101 countries, enabling companies to hold and transact digital dollars.\nThe platform currently supports Circle’s USDC and Bridge’s USDB tokens with plans for stablecoin neutrality across Tempo.\nEarlier this year, Stripe partnered with Ramp to launch stablecoin-backed corporate cards, which aim to address cross-border payment delays and currency volatility.\nThe cards were initially deployed in Latin American markets before expanding to Europe, Africa, and Asia.\nCEO Patrick Collison has previously testified to Congress that Stripe sees “meaningful business interest in stablecoins as the underlying technology has matured.”\nThe GENIUS Act’s federal regulatory framework spurred corporate adoption across the billion-dollar stablecoin sector.\nTempo enables Stripe to capture transaction processing revenue directly rather than paying fees to external networks.\nParticularly, the company’s extensive merchant network spanning millions of businesses worldwide perfectly positions Tempo for rapid adoption through existing payment flows.\nFinancial Giants Race Into the Blockchain Industry\nThe stablecoin sector experienced explosive growth following regulatory clarity, with market capitalization exceeding $288 billion.\nIn fact, among many others, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse projects the growth of the stablecoin market to around $1-2 trillion.\nAmid the corporate adoption race, MetaMask announced plans earlier last month to launch “MetaMask USD” through Stripe’s payment infrastructure.\nThe proposal builds on the M⁰ network, which has regulatory backing and fiat reserves.\nWestern Union has also announced pilot programs in South America and Africa for stablecoin-powered remittances.\nJust yesterday, Ripple announced its extension of its US dollar-backed stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD), into Africa.\nApproximately 20 million addresses now transact stablecoins on public blockchains.\nRecognizing this massive growth potential, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller noted that 99% of stablecoin market capitalization is tied to the US dollar.\nHe believes “stablecoins can keep the dollar the world’s reserve currency” by increasing global accessibility.\nLooking forward, Tempo’s validator set will begin with independent, diverse participants before transitioning toward permissionless validation.\nThe blockchain maintains neutrality regarding stablecoin issuers, allowing any compliant stablecoin to be used for payments and gas fees.\n- New ChatGPT AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Avalanche and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana and Pepe by the End of 2025\n- Perplexity AI Predicts the Price of XRP, World Liberty Financial and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Why Is Crypto Down Today? – September 4, 2025\n- XRP Price Prediction: Gaming Giant Expands to XRP Ledger – Shocking Move to $10 Starting Now\n- New ChatGPT AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Avalanche and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana and Pepe by the End of 2025\n- Perplexity AI Predicts the Price of XRP, World Liberty Financial and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Why Is Crypto Down Today? – September 4, 2025\n- XRP Price Prediction: Gaming Giant Expands to XRP Ledger – Shocking Move to $10 Starting Now", "content_hash": "2348bb8a6d02d0c99aaa2ed251dc0ef8", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

As a result, 4Q/4Q growth increases to 1.5%,” BofA analysts wrote in their latest U.S. Economic Weekly note.\nThe bank said the labour market remains the key downside risk, though it argued that “supply factors explain much of the recent slowdown.”\nAt the same time, inflation pressures are expected to persist. “Core PCE inflation should get stuck in the low 3s for about a year,” BofA said, adding that long-end rates could rise if the Federal Reserve cuts rates in such an environment, “indicating a policy mistake.”\nBofA highlighted that the ISM indexes rose in August, consistent with its view of a rebound in the second half of the year, though auto sales slipped to 16.1 million after a July surge tied to expiring EV tax credits.\nAnalysts described their “cautious optimism” as premised on labour market resilience, calling today’s August jobs report “pivotal.”\nLooking ahead, BofA expects August CPI and PPI to each rise 0.3 percent month-on-month, with core CPI running at 3.1 percent year-on-year. “Based on this, we currently expect Aug core PCE to advance to 3.0%,” it said.\nRelated articles\nBofA lifts U.S. Q3 growth view to 1.5% on stronger consumption\n8 Warren Buffett-Backed Stocks to Navigate September Volatility\nApollo economist warns: AI bubble now bigger than 1990s tech mania", "content_hash": "fcc943960f3615b1697220a4c1934283", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The fallout depends on hyperscaler capital expenditure trends. Analysts expect a deceleration in late 2025 or 2026, though guidance keeps rising.\nAnother day, another record high for the S&P 500, and another investment bank has a research note asking whether AI stocks are in a bubble. Today it is the turn of Goldman Sachs, where Ryan Hammond and his team have made a lengthy and thoughtful attempt to assess whether Nvidia et al. are heading for a crash.\nTheir conclusion: We’re not there yet.\nThe S&P was up 0.83% to 6,502.08 yesterday, a new record.\nValuations are high, but they are actually lower than they were in the dotcom boom of 2000, Goldman says. There is one danger looming, the bank notes, and that is the “inevitable slowdown” in capital expenditures by the “hyperscaler” AI companies, (Amazon, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle).\nUnder what Goldman calls “an extreme scenario in which the hyperscalers cut capex back to 2022 levels,” the “lost” revenues to AI companies would represent a 30% cut to Goldman’s estimate of $1 trillion in total sales growth across the S&P 500 companies next year. In turn, “a reversion of long-term growth estimates back to early 2023 levels would imply 15%–20% downside to the current valuation multiple of the S&P 500.”\nAI stocks rose 32% in 2024 and 17% year to date, Goldman says, and “investors increasingly ask us whether current U.S. equity prices are reflective of overly optimistic investor expectations.” But tech stocks are currently trading below historic bubble levels, Hammond’s team wrote. “The five largest stocks in the index (NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN) trade at P/E multiple of 28x, compared with 40x at the peak in 2021 and 50x at the peak in the Tech Bubble [of 2000].”\nThe factor keeping valuations reasonable is the huge amount of real money that companies serving the hyperscalers are taking in as revenues. Goldman estimates that hyperscaler capex has totaled $368 billion so far this year.\nThe question then becomes, when does the slowdown in AI spending happen? “Analysts currently assume a sharp deceleration in 4Q 2025 and 2026,” Goldman says. But expect that date to slip: Hyperscaler companies keep revising their capex guidance upward.\nThe note also suggests that as well as a deceleration (after all, spending will have to plateau at some point) investors are going to want to see more meaningful results as time goes on. With regard to so-called Phase 3 companies, for example, those which will benefit from the ripple effect of the technology, the analysts write: “We expect the AI trade will eventually broaden out to some Phase 3 companies, but investors will likely require evidence of a tangible near-term impact on earnings … Our equity analysts acknowledge that there has been limited value creation in enterprise software applications thus far.”", "content_hash": "1d92008f9adc4b43a28c28c8e3759d27", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for payrolls to rise by 75,000.\nThe report showed a marked slowdown from the July increase of 79,000, which was revised up by 6,000. Revisions also showed a net loss of 13,000 in June after the prior estimate was lowered by 27,000.\n\"The job market is stalling short of the runway,\" said Daniel Zhao, chief economist at jobs site Glassdoor. \"The labor market is losing lift, and August's report, along with downward revisions, suggests we're heading into turbulence without the soft landing achieved.\"\nMarkets largely disregarded the report, with stocks up at the open and Treasury yields sharply lower. Traders in the futures markets raised the probability of a quarter percentage point Fed rate cut to 100% and went even further, pricing in a 12% probability of a half-point move, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge.\nThe payrolls count was the first since President Donald Trump fired former BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following the release of the July jobs report a month ago. The move came after the report showed not just a weak level of job creation but also dramatic reductions in previous months' totals.\nIn McEntarfer's place, the president nominated economist E.J. Antoni, a Trump loyalist from the Heritage Foundation who previously had criticized the BLS numbers as being politically distorted. William Wiatrowski is serving as acting BLS commissioner.\nWhile the pace of hiring was slow, average hourly earnings increased 0.3% for the month, meeting the estimate, though the annual gain of 3.7% was slightly below the forecast for 3.8%.\nHiring was held back by a payroll reduction in the federal government, which reported a decline of 15,000.\nHealth care again led sectors, adding 31,000 jobs, while social assistance contributed 16,000. Wholesale trade and manufacturing both saw declines of 12,000 on the month.\nThe report comes as markets widely expect the Fed to lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point when it releases its next decision Sept. 17. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his fellow policymakers also have been under heavy criticism from the president as they have been on hold since last cutting in December 2024.\nThough most economic indicators indicate continued expansion, Fed officials have expressed concern about a slowdown in hiring even as layoffs have held fairly steady. At the same time, policymakers worry that Trump's tariffs could reignite inflation, with data indicating a slow but steady increase in prices over recent months.\n\"The warning bell that rang in the labor market a month ago just got louder. A weaker-than-expected jobs report all but seals a 25-basis-point rate cut later this month,\" said Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings. \"Four straight months of manufacturing job losses stand out. It's hard to argue that tariff uncertainty isn't a key driver of this weakness.\"\nWhile the establishment survey showed weak job creation, the more volatile household count, used to calculate the unemployment rate, held better news.\nThat report showed an increase of 288,000 employed, though the ranks of the unemployed also rose by 148,000. The labor force participation rate edged higher to 62.3% while the labor force swelled by 436,000, accounting for the tick higher in the unemployment rate.\nA broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons climbed to 8.1%, a 0.2 percentage point increase and the highest level since October 2021.\nAlong with the jobs numbers tally, the BLS on Tuesday will release the initial estimate for annual benchmark revisions to the numbers dating back one year from March 2025.\nRevisions have been a source of controversy, particularly in the post-Covid era as the response rate has declined, particularly for the headline establishment survey that asks businesses and government agencies to detail the pace of hiring.\nThe BLS typically releases its initial estimate with the first batch of survey responses it gets, then updates two times as it gets more information. However, Trump has accused the BLS of being politically biased. The firing of McEntarfer drew widespread criticism in the economics and markets community.\nIn a CNBC interview, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said he expects the August payrolls count to get revised higher. In the past three years, the initial August count actually was revised lower from the initial estimate.\nCorrection: The BLS on Tuesday will release the initial estimate for annual benchmark revisions to the numbers dating back one year from March 2025.

It would also give Musk increased voting power over the EV maker and aspiring robotics titan, which he has publicly demanded since early 2024.\nTesla Chairwoman Robyn Denholm told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin the plan was designed to keep the CEO \"motivated and focused on delivering for the company.\"\n\"If he performs, if he hits the super ambitious milestones that are in the plan then he gets equity — it's 1% for each half a trillion dollars of market cap, plus operational milestones he has to hit in order to do that,\" Denholm said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\nThe full award would give Musk more than 423 million additional shares. He currently holds about a 13% stake in the company.\nDenholm confirmed that the Tesla CEO pay plan, if approved by shareholders, would not put any limit on where and how Musk spends his time or require him to spend any minimum number of hours per week on Tesla business.\nTo obtain the first award in the plan, Musk and Tesla would need to almost double their current market cap to reach $2 trillion. The final benchmark is reaching an $8.5 trillion market cap.\nThe operational milestones in the 2025 CEO Performance Award include: 20 million Tesla vehicles delivered, 10 million active FSD Subscriptions, 1 million robots delivered, 1 million Robotaxis in commercial operation and a series of adjusted EBITDA benchmarks.\nMusk has remained politically embroiled, while also running a collection of companies, including aerospace and defense contractor SpaceX, drilling venture The Boring Company, health tech company Neuralink and the artificial intelligence venture, xAI, which has merged with his social network, X.\nTesla also said in the filing Friday that it will ask shareholders at the Nov. 6 meeting to vote on whether the company should invest in Musk's newest venture, xAI.\nMusk first floated the idea publicly with an informal poll on X last July, asking whether Tesla should invest $5 billion into xAI.\nFounded in early 2023 in Nevada, xAI merged with Musk's social network X earlier this year. The company now operates a massive data center in Memphis, and plans to build out another facility there to help train and run its large language models and a chatbot called Grok.\nPay plan controversy\nThe new pay proposal for Musk comes after the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled last year that his 2018 pay plan was excessive, had been improperly granted by the Tesla board and must be rescinded.\nIn that case, Tornetta v. Musk, a judge found that the Tesla CEO had controlled pay negotiations at the automaker, and his board of directors failed to give shareholders information that they were legally entitled to before telling them they should vote to approve Musk's performance-based pay plan.\nThe case is now on appeal.", "content_hash": "09f593d3e7974c4e760a806746de481c", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

He added that the order increased Broadcom's forecast for AI revenue next year, when shipments will begin.\nAnalysts at Mizuho, Cantor Fitzgerald and KeyBanc all said they think AI startup OpenAI is the customer. The Financial Times reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the partnership, that the two companies co-designed a chip that will hit the market next year.\nOpenAI declined to comment on the report.\nWhile Broadcom doesn't name its large web-scale customers, analysts have said dating back to last year that its first three clients were Google, Meta and TikTok parent ByteDance.\n\"During the call, the company surprised us by noting that it had secured a $10B order from a fourth XPU customer (we believe this is OpenAI), adding significant upside to the company's three current XPU customers (Google, Meta, and ByteDance),\" analysts at Cantor wrote in a note late Thursday. \"Shipments are expected to commence in 2026.\"\nBroadcom's stock has been on a tear of late as the company has joined Nvidia at the front of the race to build the kinds of processors and infrastructures needed for massive AI workloads.

But maybe there is not enough planning among investors about what they should do to preserve the hefty gains embedded in market portfolios since the April low gave way to a new S&P 500 record. A rate cut is typically seen as a good thing for stocks, but a weakening labor market is also a sign that broader trouble for the economy could be ahead.\nGlobal equities are at all-time highs, 401(k) and IRA millionaire account numbers have surged to their own record, flows into equity ETFs are picking up, and investor sentiment data is getting \"a little hotter,\" according to Strategas Securities' technical strategist Todd Sohn, all signs that there could be a tipping point ahead for the market where bullishness becomes its own sign of overconfidence. But in Sohn's view, we're not there yet. September has had some rocky trading days already, and its long-term track record as a market month going back decades is not good, but \"the real lull,\" if it comes, will happen further into Q4, he said.\n\"That's when people can get hit with a speed bump like April, maybe not as quick or as big of a drawdown,\" Sohn shared on this week's \"ETF Edge.\" But he stressed that there are \"no signs of massive risk yet.\"\nThe market initially headed higher on Friday to yet another new record as traders bet a rate cut is coming, but then gave up those gains.\nFed chair Jerome Powell has himself signaled that a rate cut may be ahead, but that isn't really signaling anything the market didn't already know, and according to Bryant VanCronkhite, Allspring Global Investments' senior portfolio manager and co-head of its special global equity team — who joined Sohn on \"ETF Edge\" — the market may be overpricing the odds of a Fed rate cut even with the weakening labor market. Inflation, with core CPI at 3.1% in July, remains \"safely above target,\" he said — a reference to the Fed's longstanding policy approach of aiming for 2% inflation — and the uncertainty related to tariff impact on prices throughout the economy gives the Fed more reason to wait for more data before committing to a big change in policy.\nThat's a long way of saying that given the wiggle room still possible within the Fed's timing for a cut, and the uncertain economic outlook tied to the trade war, VanCronkhite and Sohn both say it is a good time for investors to take a look at defensive options with the stock market that may be underrepresented in their portfolios. It doesn't mean a major change in how an overall portfolio is constructed, but some tweaks on the edges to insulate overall returns from any damage that could be in the cards for the recent equity winners. They broke down that analysis into a few key points for investors to consider.\n1. Nothing new here, but you're portfolio still likely has too much tech\nFor years, investors have been warned that mega-cap tech stocks have become too dominant in the cap-weighted S&P 500, and that problem has not gone away, with Sohn noting that the weighting of the top eight mega-cap stocks is now close to 40% of the index (in an index of 500 stocks). The tech sector, as a whole, is currently 31% of the index as measured by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF.\nNvidia, the biggest of them all, was lower on Friday, its sixth losing day out of the last 7, and on track for its worst week since April, and fourth-consecutive losing week, according to CNBC data.\nSohn says the first step in dealing with tech concentration risk is for investors to make sure they don't have a core stock market index fund in addition to a large-cap growth and tech fund, which in the end, are all more or less replicating the same exposure and risk profile. If there is any tilt in the future to value stocks, that composition of a portfolio will exacerbate the pain for investors.\nIt should be said, this warning has been issued for years and the mega-cap, tech-led stock market has mostly continued up and to the right. Nevertheless, it makes sense to evaluate a portfolio's overall concentration risk with the prospect of major changes in rate policy and overall economic conditions ahead. So, where to look?\n2. Value and defensive stocks have been left behind, and that leaves opportunity ahead\nSohn and VanCronkhite both say that heading into 2026 it makes sense for investors to reposition ahead of any tilt in the market cycle towards value. \"Maybe not the bulk of a portfolio,\" Sohn said, but from his technical lens on the market, looking at the stocks and sectors that have not participated in the recent gains, corners of the stock market that have, in effect, been in their own bear market or stuck in a narrow trading range over the past few years. Sohn says that \"leaves us with lots of opportunities away from tech.\"\n\"Now is the time to begin shifting and broadening exposure,\" said VanCronkhite. \"Take some capital out of the past winners, like tech and financials,\" he said.\n3. Where exactly to move market money, starting with health care\nSohn said there has been \"absolutely no demand for defensives\" like healthcare, and VanCronkhite pointed to industrials and materials.\n\"Buy something different\" from among the \"desolate\" sectors of the market, Sohn said, adding that transports and small-caps are, on a relative basis at least, at attractive valuations.\nHealth care, in particular, is a focus for both ETF strategists. It has also been a recent focus for Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.\nWhile there are significant political and cyclical issues for the health care sector, VanCronkhite described it as \"being ignored\" right now by the market.\n\"There has been a mass exodus from health care,\" said Sohn, referring to flows out of the health care sector as its performance relative to the S&P 500 has hit \"bottom-decile\" on a historical basis. As a result, it would be \"hard to get much worse for health care,\" he said.\nSohn conceded that for health care to do better, the current market leaders will need to do worse. There won't be any \"sustained\" move in health care without a cost for \"everything else.\" He is not betting that there is any wholesale move into health care anytime soon because that would require a breakdown in the broader market. But he says it still makes sense \"as a differentiation hedge going forward, especially because no one is there.\"\nWatch the video above to learn more about the ETF experts' views on defensive positions.

Well the odds of having more for that much compensation, the odds of getting more people playing on the field every game as opposed to having it all on one or two, it's an opportunity for us,\" Jones said. \"It fits us right now.\"\nParsons, a four-time Pro Bowler, is in the final year of his rookie contract, worth about $24 million, according to Spotrac.\nHe has established himself as one of the top defensive players in the league, recording more than 12 sacks in each of the past four seasons.\n\"I'm proud for him, proud for Green Bay,\" Jones said.", "content_hash": "55e4b40e5807b57f3d6994c295b5284b", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The 35-page report includes data on tickets sold, net ticket receipts, the visiting team's share of gate receipts and club seat premiums, gross general admission ticket prices, and the premium paid for club seats for the preseason and regular season for all 32 teams. The ticketing data in this CNBC report was sourced from that document.\nThe NFL requires every team to give 34% of ticket revenue and the licensing amount of a club seat to the league based on an internal formula, according to several NFL executives who asked to remain unnamed so they could speak freely about private conversations. This pool, known as the visiting team's share, or VTS, is mostly redistributed equally among the 32 teams. In 2024, each team received $27 million, up from $25 million the previous year, according to the league executives.\nStory continues after interactive chart.\nThe VTS money not redistributed is used by the NFL to fund league-level lending programs that go toward the private financing of new stadiums and renovations. Some teams are granted waivers by the NFL on a portion of their VTS contribution if they are using stadium revenue to finance construction or renovations. The Las Vegas Raiders and Los Angeles Rams, for example, received waivers of $23.4 million and $12.2 million, respectively, for their new stadiums, according to the NFL executives.\nThe league's 32 teams collected an average of $433 million in national revenue in 2024 from media, licensing and sponsorship agreements, said the executives. National revenue made up about two-thirds of overall league revenue. Local revenue — including tickets, suites, stadium sponsorships, concessions, parking and non-NFL stadium events — accounted for the remainder.\nThe San Francisco 49ers led the league in net ticket receipts — the amount the team keeps after taxes, fees and surcharges — with $176.5 million in 2024. That's $40.8 million more than the No. 2 Dallas Cowboys and $67.5 million above the league average. The Tennessee Titans ranked last, at $81.2 million in net receipts. The Indianapolis Colts were next to last, at $83.3 million, and the Arizona Cardinals came in just above the Colts, at $83.4 million.\nThe 49ers also had the highest general admission ticket price, at $190.78 last season, followed by the Philadelphia Eagles, at $184.27, and the Las Vegas Raiders, at $165.58. The New England Patriots, who have won six Super Bowls but have not made the postseason since 2021, charged the highest club seat premium at $471.92 — more than double the NFL average.\nThe NFL declined to comment in response to CNBC's questions regarding the Summary of Attendance Statistics report.", "content_hash": "89d656d2711df0ac76209e82533fbe07", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The deals are being closed and financial statements showing losses will be filed by February, the company said.\n\"We recognize this outcome is disappointing,\" Yieldstreet said in the investor letter. \"Yieldstreet pursued this extensive recovery effort because we are committed to exhausting every reasonable avenue for investor recovery.\"\nYieldstreet put its investors into deals totaling $89 million in loans that were supposed to be backed by 13 ships, according to a lawsuit filed by the startup against the borrower in that project. The loans float money to companies that take apart ships for scrap metal; the vessels themselves are the collateral on the deals.\nYieldstreet lost track of the ships and then pursued the borrower, which it accused of fraud. While it won monetary awards in a number of jurisdictions outside the U.S., the borrower avoided paying the startup by concealing their assets, Yieldstreet said in the August investor letter.\nThe episode garnered media coverage and in 2020 contributed to the collapse of a high-profile partnership with BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager.\nThe news of this latest loss follows CNBC's report last month that Yieldstreet customers in four real estate deals worth $78 million have been wiped out, with roughly $300 million of other deals on watchlist for possible losses.\nThis year, Yieldstreet changed its CEO and announced a new business model that leans more on distributing private market funds provided by established Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs and the Carlyle Group.\nIn a statement provided to CNBC, Yieldstreet said the investor letters refer to marine loan deals from 2018 and 2019 in an asset class that the firm no longer offers.\n\"While substantially less than the amounts invested by the funds and ultimately the investors, this settlement allows us to bring closure to litigation that could otherwise continue indefinitely,\" Yieldstreet said in the statement.\nThe firm \"takes its fiduciary responsibilities seriously and, throughout the recovery effort, advanced its own funds in an effort to protect its investors and has absorbed significant losses alongside its investors,\" the startup said.\nBitter end\nArman, an investor who plowed $180,000 into marine loans in 2019, called the result a bitter disappointment.

It will sideline major store renovations and development in the meantime.\nWhile the changes will vary based on the location, expect more seating, dark wood paneling and other tweaks that make its cafes cozier. The renovations will also include changes like less harsh lighting that won't affect customers with light sensitivity.\n\"We're uplifting more than 1,000 coffeehouses over the next year, blending our global heritage with local relevance to create spaces that are immersive, inclusive, and deeply human,\" Dawn Clark, Starbucks senior vice president of coffeehouse design and concepts, said in a statement to CNBC.\n\"Whether it's the laid-back warmth of the Palisades or the urban energy of Manhattan, intentional design encourages customers to stay longer, connect more, and return often — and translates into meaningful business impact,\" Clark said.\nStarbucks is planning to spend about $150,000 on each \"uplift,\" without closing the stores down. The company started with locations in New York, followed by cafes in Southern California.\nThe makeovers are intended to make the stores more welcoming, returning Starbucks to its prior status as a \"third place\" for customers to hang out between home and work. In recent years, Starbucks had lost that reputation, fueled by decisions like removing seats as mobile ordering become popular and getting rid of outlets to discourage lingering.\nUnder CEO Brian Niccol, the chain plans to reverse many of those decisions as it tries to break a sales slump. For example, he previously told employees in June that he plans to add back the 30,000 seats that had been removed from cafes.\nBut trying to appeal to a wider swath of customers isn't new for the company. Starbucks first unveiled an accessible store design in early 2024, before Niccol's tenure. At the time, the company said that the design took about two years and included input from baristas.\nTake a look inside a recently renovated New York City cafe near Manhattan's Union Square.\nBefore the renovation, the location lacked many decorative touches, besides some large-scale photos of the chain's Hacienda Alsacia, its coffee and research farm in Costa Rica.\nWith such sparse seating, the cafe's concrete floors were more obvious. Harsh lighting didn't help the store's appearance either.\nThe location now features much more seating near the entrance. Leather accents to the wraparound booth make the seats more comfortable. The tables are easily movable and at an accessible height for wheelchair users.\nStarbucks also brought back the electrical outlets that disappeared in prior makeovers. Now customers who want to study or work from the location can charge their laptops or phones, encouraging them to stay longer.\nLarge area rugs bring a cozy touch, in addition to dampening some of the cafe's ambient noise. Live plants also add to the homey vibe of the space.\nHigh-top tables, positioned closer to the barista bar, offer a seating option for customers looking to sit down with companions. The makeover adds 16 more seats to the location.\nStarbucks also changed out its lightbulbs to soften the store's lighting and reduce glare, giving it a warmer atmosphere. The improved lighting helps highlight an existing mural, seen on the right of the photo above.\nBehind the barista bar, the company added a large shelving unit that highlights bags of its coffee, plus decorative burlap sacks that hold beans. Touches of purple are a nod to the nearby New York University.\nCustomers waiting to pick up their drinks can sit off to the side. Previously, the area was a standing bar that wasn't accessible to wheelchair users.\nIn addition to adding rugs, Starbucks also improved the location's overall insulation to cut down on the clamor of a busy coffee shop. For baristas, the change means that conversations among customers are less likely to disturb their work, whether that's hearing an order correctly or focusing on making a latte.", "content_hash": "d6decec73068e181c917c3e83fd6eca7", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

President Donald Trump meets, touts, and tortures. During a dinner at the White House Thursday night with more than two dozen tech execs, Trump again warned he would soon impose \"fairly substantial\" semiconductor tariffs without indicating how they will work or what it means. Apple and Meta seem most favored. 2. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 22,000 in August versus analysts' estimate of 75,000, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report Friday. Stock futures rose on the expectation that weaker numbers will push the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in September. Conversation about a 50 basis point cut may pick up from here. 3. Broadcom saw a dramatic acceleration in spending on AI chips and is adding new customers beyond TikTok parent ByteDance, Meta, and Alphabet . The chipmaker posted a beat and raise Thursday after the bell, but the stock didn't really take off until CEO Hock Tan talked about $10 billion in custom AI-related orders from a new customer. VMWare, the software giant Broadcom bought for $69 billion nearly two years ago, was strong too. We raised our price target on shares, which are up 15% this morning. 4. Lululemon is disappointing again, with the stock plunging nearly 20% after the company gave a worse-than-expected full-year outlook. Too expensive and too much competition. No more de minimis exception, which allowed packages under a certain value to enter the U.S. without paying tariffs. Multiple downgrades on the Street. The end of athleisure or on to the next buzzy brand? 5. UnitedHealth caught a price target raise at Bernstein, which went to $379 from $337. It was the second PT boost this week for the health insurer. Is the bottom in? The analysts also raised CVS Health to $77 from $72. 6. JPMorgan cut its FedEx price target to $285 from $290 heading into the company's Sept. 18 earnings. The firm said estimates for fiscal Q1 could come in weak thanks to \"stagnant\" business-to-business demand. 7 . Wells Fargo raised its price target on American Express to $375 from $350 — remains incredibly strong. I've been a fan of this one for ages. 8. DoorDash 's price target was raised to $306 from $280 at Wells, which raised its 2026 EBITDA estimates. 9. J.B. Hunt downgraded to hold from buy at UBS, noting that a pricing inflection in the truckload market is less likely in the near term. No demand catalyst in sight. 10. Barclays lowered its price target on Adobe to $460 from $567 heading into its earnings report next week. The firm kept an overweight buy rating, though. Adobe uses the same model as struggling Club stock Salesforce — they charge too much.

In other words, when they underperform their benchmark, that underperformance is relatively large.\nConversely, active managers generally fare better in less liquid areas of the market, like fixed income, real estate, and small-cap and emerging-market stocks, Armour said.\nFor example, 43% of actively managed high-yield bond mutual funds and ETFs beat their index counterparts in the past 10-year period, according to Morningstar.\nFees are the key\nFees are the key driver of index funds' success when compared to active funds, Armour said.\nIndex funds carry a 0.11% average asset-weighted annual fee, while active funds carry a 0.59% fee, according to Morningstar.\nActive funds need to have higher relative returns just to overcome that fee differential.\nBeyond that, higher fees also eat into investor earnings. For example, an investor with $100,000 who earns 4% per year and pays a 0.25% fund fee would have $208,000 after 20 years, while the same investor paying a 1% fee would have $179,000, or $29,000 less, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSince index funds own all the securities in a broad market index, they are guaranteed to own the relative winners and losers. While active managers may own more of the winners than their index counterparts, they also risk missing out, Armour said.\nMany active managers took risk off the table in April when President Donald Trump first announced so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs, but the market then proceeded to rebound quickly, Armour said.", "content_hash": "c2a9d0a6130efefe94053158e8e00dbe", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The agreement reached in July had included Japan purchasing 100 Boeing planes, 75% higher imports of U.S. rice and $8 billion worth of agricultural and crop products.\nWashington will apply a baseline 15% tariff on nearly all Japanese imports, with separate sector-specific levies for automobiles and parts (also 15%), aerospace products, generic pharmaceutical goods and natural resources, according to the executive order.\nThe Thursday order prevents Trump's country-specific tariffs on top of existing levies.

The ruling Liberal Democratic Party earlier this week released a long-awaited report on why it lost seats in the upper house election in July.\nThe report ascribed the loss to the lack of appeal for the party's measures aimed at taming inflation, previous political scandals and weak mobilization of young voters.\nLocal media reports suggested many key members of the LDP have signaled their intention to resign to the prime minister, while Ishiba has said he intends to stay on amid calls within his party for choosing another leader.\nThough the reports have avoided naming individuals, they signal an \"implicit indictment of Ishiba's leadership of the party,\" said James Brady, vice president at political consultancy Teneo.\nAnalysts at Eurasia Group suggested in a report Friday that Ishiba is unlikely to survive a challenge from within the party next Monday, when a vote on whether to bring forward a leadership election is expected to take place.\n\"Ishiba's poor performance as party leader in lower and upper house elections and events in recent days, including former prime minister Aso Taro announcing his support for the special election, have turned the tide against Ishiba,\" analysts said, predicting a 60% odd of Ishiba's defeat in the election, with him possibly resigning before the vote takes place as internal discontent grows.", "content_hash": "f6d82ea4737a68384b0cbe9cbf00590e", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Kennedy Jr. doubled down on false claims about vaccines and claimed he isn't limiting access to Covid shots during his Senate testimony on Thursday, as senators grilled him on his sweeping changes to immunization policy and federal health agencies.\nKennedy said he supports a statement made by a newly appointed member of a key government vaccine panel that mRNA vaccines pose a dangerous risk to people. Numerous studies have demonstrated that shots using mRNA technology, including Covid vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, are safe and effective, and serious side effects have happened in extremely rare cases.\nSen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., noted that the committee member, Dr. Retsef Levi, has said that evidence is mounting that mRNA vaccines cause \"serious harm, including death, especially among young people,\" apparently referring to a post pinned on Levi's X account. Kennedy appointed Levi to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine recommendations and insurance coverage.\nKennedy said he wasn't aware of Levi's comments, but added, \"I agree with it.\"\nHe also claimed that anyone could get a Covid booster shot, while also acknowledging that access \"depends on the state\" and that the government no longer recommends the vaccines for healthy people.\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved a fresh round of Covid shots with new limits, only clearing them for adults aged 65 and older and people with a medical condition that puts them at risk of a severe illness. The CDC and its vaccine panel will decide who to recommend the shots to later this month.\n\"I'm not taking them away from people,\" Kennedy said, referring to the vaccines.\nBut Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., argued that not everyone can walk into a pharmacy and get a Covid shot now.\nThe FDA's new limits have complicated Covid shot access in the U.S., which now depends on a patient's age and risk level, laws and policies in their state, insurance coverage, and health-care provider. Pending CDC guidance, some pharmacies have added prescription requirements for Covid vaccines in certain states.\n\"You clearly are taking away vaccines,\" she said after a prolonged shouting match with Kennedy.\nKennedy's comments before the Senate Finance Committee come after he repeatedly promised the panel in January that he would do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it more difficult or discourages people from taking vaccines. Since then, he has canceled funding for mRNA shot development and made other vaccine policy changes that could limit access to immunizations, including gutting the CDC vaccine panel and dropping Covid shot recommendations for certain groups.\nHis comments also follow a leadership shake-up at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The White House last week fired CDC Director Susan Monarez, and four senior agency officials resigned shortly after, with some of them citing the politicization of the agency and a threat to public health. In an opinion piece on Thursday, Monarez accused Kennedy of \"a deliberate effort to weaken America's public-health system and vaccine protections.\"\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X in support of Kennedy on Thursday, writing that he \"is taking flak because he's over the target\" and saying Democrats were attacking the Trump administration's \"commonsense effort.\"\nKennedy touted skepticism around Covid vaccines, despite evidence of their safety and effectiveness.\n\"We were told again and again the vaccines would prevent transmission, they prevent infection. It wasn't true. They knew it from the start,\" Kennedy said.\nHe also said he does not know how many people died of Covid and whether the vaccines prevented deaths from the virus.\n\"I would like to see the data and talk about the data,\" Kennedy said.\nBut data is readily available from dozens of studies. One paper in August estimates that Covid vaccines saved more than 2 million lives, mostly among older adults, worldwide between 2020 and October 2024.\nThe CDC website also says that Covid vaccines from the 2023 to 2024 season reduced the risk of severe illness from Covid by almost 70% in the first two months after vaccination in adults ages 18 and older, with protection gradually declining over time.\nThose shots also decreased the risk of hospitalization due to Covid by around 50% in the first two months of vaccination in that same population. The Covid vaccines showed similar benefits in older adults.\nKennedy also defended his decision to fire all 17 previous members of the CDC vaccine panel, saying he didn't politicize the committee.\n\"What we did is we got rid of the conflicts of interest. ... We depoliticized and put great scientists on it from a very diverse group,\" the HHS secretary said. \"They are very, very pro-vaccine.\"\nBut a new analysis published last month from USC researchers found that conflicts of interest on that panel had been at \"historic lows for years\" before Kennedy restacked it with new members, some of whom are widely known vaccine critics.\nCorrection: Kennedy testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday.

During the visit, Altman said India was OpenAI's second-largest market by number of users.\nHe has subsequently said that AI adoption in India is \"amazing to watch.\"\n\"We love to see the explosion of creativity--india is outpacing the world,\" he said on X earlier this year.\nIndia is one of ChatGPT's fastest-growing markets globally, Nick Patience, practice lead for AI at tech research and analysis firm Futurum Group, told CNBC. \"OpenAI's India focus is a strategic move to gain a competitive edge,\" he added.\nHere's a rundown of how OpenAI is expanding in India.\nChatGPT explosion\nChatGPT, OpenAI's core product, has seen strong growth in India. The app was downloaded 10.2 million times in India in August, a huge jump from the 2.5 million downloads seen during the same month last year, according to analytics firm Appfigures.\nSince its launch, ChatGPT has 111 million downloads in India, ahead of its 80 million downloads in the U.S, Appfigures data shows.\nDownloads do not necessarily equal daily or monthly users, but the figures emphasise OpenAI's growth trajectory in the country.\nThe download numbers are also far ahead of rivals, including Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude. The closest challenger was Perplexity, Appfigures said, which had 6.4 million downloads in August.\nIndia-specific product\nUser spending on ChatGPT has been increasing. To date, Indian users have spent $21.3 million on ChatGPT, Appfigures data shows. In comparison, U.S. users have spent $784 million.\nThat underlines the fact that while the number of users in India is huge, it remains a price-sensitive market.\nTo address this, OpenAI in August launched ChatGPT Go, a low-cost 399-rupees-($4.53)-a-month plan for its AI app.\n\"It's a classic wedge strategy to capture a price-sensitive market and build a user base that will be difficult for local players to dislodge later,\" Futurum Group's Patience said of the strategy.\nInfrastructure and hiring\nAccording to Bloomberg, OpenAI is scouting a location in India for a data center with at least 1-gigawatt capacity. The facility will be part of OpenAI's Stargate-branded infrastructure push, Bloomberg said this week, although CNBC was unable to verify the report.\nThe ChatGPT developer said last month that it would open a local office in the market and is currently advertising three sales roles in India.\nIt also announced last month an education program in India that will include funding for research and provide half a million ChatGPT licenses for educators and students across the country.\nIndia challenges\nWhile India doesn't have a home-grown artificial intelligence company as big as OpenAI, there are some challengers in the form of domestic startups, including Sarvam AI and Krutrim, and other American tech giants like Google and Meta.\nContinued geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and India over trade, however, have the potential to cause complications if there's any backlash from New Delhi against American tech firms.\nOpenAI is also locked in a legal battle with Asian News International in India, which has accused the ChatGPT developer of using copyrighted material illegally. It's a closely-watched case in the country for how copyright laws apply in the AI era.\n\"OpenAI's success in India is not guaranteed and depends heavily on its ability to navigate these legal and political hurdles,\" Futurum Group's Patience said.\n\"While the Indian market is vast, its diversity in languages and user needs presents challenges. OpenAI's ability to deliver a truly localized product and its long-term impact on India's AI talent remain uncertain.\"", "content_hash": "2cc597ecf6d6154ddb53c663447feaee", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona, introduced a bill on Thursday — titled the You Earn It, You Keep it Act — to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits. A House version of the bill was introduced by Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minnesota, in April.\nGallego's bill would permanently eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits.\nIt would also expand the Social Security payroll tax to apply to annual earnings over $250,000. Currently, the maximum earnings subject to Social Security payroll taxes is $176,100 in 2025. Consequently, high earners may only pay into the program for part of the year.\n\"Despite decades of paying into the system, seniors are still forced to pay taxes on their hard-earned benefits — all while the ultra wealthy barely pay into the system,\" Gallego said in a statement.\nHow Social Security benefits are taxed\nSocial Security recipients may owe federal income taxes on their benefits depending on their income.\nHow much they may owe is based on a formula known as combined income — the sum of adjusted gross income, tax-exempt interest income and half of Social Security benefits.\nUp to 50% of benefits may be taxed for individual tax filers with between $25,000 and $34,000 in combined income, or married couples who file jointly with between $32,000 and $44,000.\nUp to 85% of benefits may be taxable for individuals with more than $34,000 in combined income or couples with more than $44,000.\nHow the 'big beautiful' tax law helps seniors\nRepublicans' new \"big beautiful\" law includes a new senior deduction aimed at helping to defray the effects of federal taxes on Social Security benefits.\nAdults aged 65 and over may be able to claim an additional deduction of up to $6,000.\nWhether beneficiaries will benefit from the change will depend on their income.\nThe full deduction will be available to individual taxpayers with up to $75,000 in modified adjusted gross income or married couples with up to $150,000. The deduction will gradually phase out for taxpayers with incomes above those thresholds.\nThe temporary deduction — which will be in effect for tax years 2025 through 2028 — will be available to eligible taxpayers regardless of whether they take the standard deduction or itemize their returns.\nMiddle-income taxpayers stand to benefit the most from the policy, according to tax experts, since low earners may already be exempt from federal taxes on benefits and higher earners will be above the phaseout thresholds.\nHow 'You Earn It, You Keep It' may affect Social Security\nUnlike the temporary senior deduction recently signed into law, Gallego's You Earn It, You Keep It proposal would eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits for all beneficiaries.\nTo be sure, it remains to be seen whether it may get enough support to become law.\nThe proposal does have the support of The Senior Citizens League, a nonpartisan senior advocacy group that is petitioning Congress to stop taxing Social Security benefits. Eliminating federal taxes on Social Security benefits is a \"commonsense step to ensure older Americans can keep more of what they've earned,\" Senior Citizens League Executive Director Shannon Benton said in a statement.\nEfforts to change the federal taxation of Social Security benefits come as the program is facing a trust fund shortfall. Benefits may be reduced within the next decade unless Congress enacts changes sooner, according to projections from Social Security's trustees.\nBecause the \"big beautiful\" law did not include any offsets for the reduced revenue from federal taxes on benefits, it would accelerate the depletion dates, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\nIn contrast, the You Earned It, You Keep It proposal would extend the Social Security trust funds' ability to pay benefits in full and on time for 24 years, or until 2058, according to Gallego's office. That matches an analysis of Craig's House proposal by Social Security's chief actuary in April.", "content_hash": "c9191b29aba6f9e461228cb296b7877b", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

He pointed to the deals available at the Excalibur, one of MGM's resorts on the Las Vegas Strip: $85 rooms, including resort fee; $5 tables; $5 beers.

We need to do a better job.\"\nMGM and Las Vegas more broadly had posted several years of growth in visitation, room rates and profits before this year's slowdown.\nWhen asked whether the Vegas slump could be a canary in the coal mine for U.S. travel more broadly, Hornbuckle, who chairs the U.S. Travel Association, said it does seem to be a leading indicator. And the industry as a whole is facing some troubling obstacles.\nCanadian visitation to the U.S. has plummeted some 40% this year, following comments by President Donald Trump about Canada as a potential 51st U.S. state and evolving trade policies. The Canadian dollar has also weakened, lessening the buying power of visitors crossing the border into the U.S.\nHornbuckle also pointed to massive price hikes for a U.S. visa, from $100 to $350, where a family of four visiting for the Ryder Cup, World Cup or Olympics in 2028, for example, could pay $1,400 for visa documents alone.\n\"International travel in 2016 had a $50 billion U.S. surplus. Today it's a $50 billion deficit,\" Hornbuckle said.\nThe government's commitment to funding marketing and promotion of U.S. travel was also slashed by 80% in the most recent spending bill, to $20 million.\n\"We obviously find ourselves in a world that has a fair amount of uncertainty from a macroeconomic perspective, from a socio-political perspective,\" Marriott CEO Tony Capuano told investors at the BofA conference Thursday. \"Marriott, and the sector more broadly, thrives in times of certainty and stability.

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for payrolls to rise by 75,000.\nThe report showed a marked slowdown from the July increase of 79,000, which was revised up by 6,000. Revisions also showed a net loss of 13,000 in June after the prior estimate was lowered by 27,000.\n\"The job market is stalling short of the runway,\" said Daniel Zhao, chief economist at jobs site Glassdoor. \"The labor market is losing lift, and August's report, along with downward revisions, suggests we're heading into turbulence without the soft landing achieved.\"\nMarkets largely disregarded the report, with stocks up at the open and Treasury yields sharply lower. Traders in the futures markets raised the probability of a quarter percentage point Fed rate cut to 100% and went even further, pricing in a 12% probability of a half-point move, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge.\nThe payrolls count was the first since President Donald Trump fired former BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following the release of the July jobs report a month ago. The move came after the report showed not just a weak level of job creation but also dramatic reductions in previous months' totals.\nIn McEntarfer's place, the president nominated economist E.J. Antoni, a Trump loyalist from the Heritage Foundation who previously had criticized the BLS numbers as being politically distorted. William Wiatrowski is serving as acting BLS commissioner.\nWhile the pace of hiring was slow, average hourly earnings increased 0.3% for the month, meeting the estimate, though the annual gain of 3.7% was slightly below the forecast for 3.8%.\nHiring was held back by a payroll reduction in the federal government, which reported a decline of 15,000.\nHealth care again led sectors, adding 31,000 jobs, while social assistance contributed 16,000. Wholesale trade and manufacturing both saw declines of 12,000 on the month.\nThe report comes as markets widely expect the Fed to lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point when it releases its next decision Sept. 17. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his fellow policymakers also have been under heavy criticism from the president as they have been on hold since last cutting in December 2024.\nThough most economic indicators indicate continued expansion, Fed officials have expressed concern about a slowdown in hiring even as layoffs have held fairly steady. At the same time, policymakers worry that Trump's tariffs could reignite inflation, with data indicating a slow but steady increase in prices over recent months.\n\"The warning bell that rang in the labor market a month ago just got louder. A weaker-than-expected jobs report all but seals a 25-basis-point rate cut later this month,\" said Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings. \"Four straight months of manufacturing job losses stand out. It's hard to argue that tariff uncertainty isn't a key driver of this weakness.\"\nWhile the establishment survey showed weak job creation, the more volatile household count, used to calculate the unemployment rate, held better news.\nThat report showed an increase of 288,000 employed, though the ranks of the unemployed also rose by 148,000. The labor force participation rate edged higher to 62.3% while the labor force swelled by 436,000, accounting for the tick higher in the unemployment rate.\nA broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons climbed to 8.1%, a 0.2 percentage point increase and the highest level since October 2021.\nAlong with the jobs numbers tally, the BLS on Tuesday will release the initial estimate for annual benchmark revisions to the numbers dating back one year from March 2025.\nRevisions have been a source of controversy, particularly in the post-Covid era as the response rate has declined, particularly for the headline establishment survey that asks businesses and government agencies to detail the pace of hiring.\nThe BLS typically releases its initial estimate with the first batch of survey responses it gets, then updates two times as it gets more information. However, Trump has accused the BLS of being politically biased.

It would also give Musk increased voting power over the EV maker and aspiring robotics titan, which he has publicly demanded since early 2024.\nTesla Chairwoman Robyn Denholm told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin the plan was designed to keep the CEO \"motivated and focused on delivering for the company.\"\n\"If he performs, if he hits the super ambitious milestones that are in the plan then he gets equity — it's 1% for each half a trillion dollars of market cap, plus operational milestones he has to hit in order to do that,\" Denholm said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\nThe full award would give Musk more than 423 million additional shares. He currently holds about a 13% stake in the company.\nDenholm confirmed that the Tesla CEO pay plan, if approved by shareholders, would not put any limit on where and how Musk spends his time or require him to spend any minimum number of hours per week on Tesla business.\nTo obtain the first award in the plan, Musk and Tesla would need to almost double their current market cap to reach $2 trillion. The final benchmark is reaching an $8.5 trillion market cap.\nThe operational milestones in the 2025 CEO Performance Award include: 20 million Tesla vehicles delivered, 10 million active FSD Subscriptions, 1 million robots delivered, 1 million Robotaxis in commercial operation and a series of adjusted EBITDA benchmarks.\nMusk has remained politically embroiled, while also running a collection of companies, including aerospace and defense contractor SpaceX, drilling venture The Boring Company, health tech company Neuralink and the artificial intelligence venture, xAI, which has merged with his social network, X.\nTesla also said in the filing Friday that it will ask shareholders at the Nov. 6 meeting to vote on whether the company should invest in Musk's newest venture, xAI.\nMusk first floated the idea publicly with an informal poll on X last July, asking whether Tesla should invest $5 billion into xAI.\nFounded in early 2023 in Nevada, xAI merged with Musk's social network X earlier this year. The company now operates a massive data center in Memphis, and plans to build out another facility there to help train and run its large language models and a chatbot called Grok.\nPay plan controversy\nThe new pay proposal for Musk comes after the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled last year that his 2018 pay plan was excessive, had been improperly granted by the Tesla board and must be rescinded.\nIn that case, Tornetta v. Musk, a judge found that the Tesla CEO had controlled pay negotiations at the automaker, and his board of directors failed to give shareholders information that they were legally entitled to before telling them they should vote to approve Musk's performance-based pay plan.\nThe case is now on appeal.", "content_hash": "09f593d3e7974c4e760a806746de481c", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The company said it expects $17.4 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, higher than the $17.02 billion expected by Wall Street analysts, with AI revenue reaching $6.2 billion.\nBut news of an incoming $10 billion customer is what got Wall Street excited.\nTan said on the call that \"immediate and fairly substantial demand\" boosts the outlook for next year, \"and really changes our thinking of what 2026 would be starting to look like.\"\nThe company didn't provide specific guidance for next year, but Tan suggested that growth in its AI could be above the 50% to 60% range he'd offered in the prior call.\nAnalysts at Mizuho raised their AI revenue growth estimate for next year to 76% up from about 60%, which would bring the total to $35 billion. Total revenue for the year ending in October 2026 is expected to increase about 30% to $81.8 billion from $63.1 billion this fiscal year, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG.\nIn addition to hardware, Broadcom has a large software business, keyed by its $61 billion acquisition of server virtualization software vendor VMware in 2023.

But maybe there is not enough planning among investors about what they should do to preserve the hefty gains embedded in market portfolios since the April low gave way to a new S&P 500 record. A rate cut is typically seen as a good thing for stocks, but a weakening labor market is also a sign that broader trouble for the economy could be ahead.\nGlobal equities are at all-time highs, 401(k) and IRA millionaire account numbers have surged to their own record, flows into equity ETFs are picking up, and investor sentiment data is getting \"a little hotter,\" according to Strategas Securities' technical strategist Todd Sohn, all signs that there could be a tipping point ahead for the market where bullishness becomes its own sign of overconfidence. But in Sohn's view, we're not there yet. September has had some rocky trading days already, and its long-term track record as a market month going back decades is not good, but \"the real lull,\" if it comes, will happen further into Q4, he said.\n\"That's when people can get hit with a speed bump like April, maybe not as quick or as big of a drawdown,\" Sohn shared on this week's \"ETF Edge.\" But he stressed that there are \"no signs of massive risk yet.\"\nThe market initially headed higher on Friday to yet another new record as traders bet a rate cut is coming, but then gave up those gains.\nFed chair Jerome Powell has himself signaled that a rate cut may be ahead, but that isn't really signaling anything the market didn't already know, and according to Bryant VanCronkhite, Allspring Global Investments' senior portfolio manager and co-head of its special global equity team — who joined Sohn on \"ETF Edge\" — the market may be overpricing the odds of a Fed rate cut even with the weakening labor market. Inflation, with core CPI at 3.1% in July, remains \"safely above target,\" he said — a reference to the Fed's longstanding policy approach of aiming for 2% inflation — and the uncertainty related to tariff impact on prices throughout the economy gives the Fed more reason to wait for more data before committing to a big change in policy.\nThat's a long way of saying that given the wiggle room still possible within the Fed's timing for a cut, and the uncertain economic outlook tied to the trade war, VanCronkhite and Sohn both say it is a good time for investors to take a look at defensive options with the stock market that may be underrepresented in their portfolios. It doesn't mean a major change in how an overall portfolio is constructed, but some tweaks on the edges to insulate overall returns from any damage that could be in the cards for the recent equity winners. They broke down that analysis into a few key points for investors to consider.\n1. Nothing new here, but you're portfolio still likely has too much tech\nFor years, investors have been warned that mega-cap tech stocks have become too dominant in the cap-weighted S&P 500, and that problem has not gone away, with Sohn noting that the weighting of the top eight mega-cap stocks is now close to 40% of the index (in an index of 500 stocks). The tech sector, as a whole, is currently 31% of the index as measured by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF.\nNvidia, the biggest of them all, was lower on Friday, its sixth losing day out of the last 7, and on track for its worst week since April, and fourth-consecutive losing week, according to CNBC data.\nSohn says the first step in dealing with tech concentration risk is for investors to make sure they don't have a core stock market index fund in addition to a large-cap growth and tech fund, which in the end, are all more or less replicating the same exposure and risk profile. If there is any tilt in the future to value stocks, that composition of a portfolio will exacerbate the pain for investors.\nIt should be said, this warning has been issued for years and the mega-cap, tech-led stock market has mostly continued up and to the right. Nevertheless, it makes sense to evaluate a portfolio's overall concentration risk with the prospect of major changes in rate policy and overall economic conditions ahead. So, where to look?\n2. Value and defensive stocks have been left behind, and that leaves opportunity ahead\nSohn and VanCronkhite both say that heading into 2026 it makes sense for investors to reposition ahead of any tilt in the market cycle towards value. \"Maybe not the bulk of a portfolio,\" Sohn said, but from his technical lens on the market, looking at the stocks and sectors that have not participated in the recent gains, corners of the stock market that have, in effect, been in their own bear market or stuck in a narrow trading range over the past few years. Sohn says that \"leaves us with lots of opportunities away from tech.\"\n\"Now is the time to begin shifting and broadening exposure,\" said VanCronkhite. \"Take some capital out of the past winners, like tech and financials,\" he said.\n3. Where exactly to move market money, starting with health care\nSohn said there has been \"absolutely no demand for defensives\" like healthcare, and VanCronkhite pointed to industrials and materials.\n\"Buy something different\" from among the \"desolate\" sectors of the market, Sohn said, adding that transports and small-caps are, on a relative basis at least, at attractive valuations.\nHealth care, in particular, is a focus for both ETF strategists. It has also been a recent focus for Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.\nWhile there are significant political and cyclical issues for the health care sector, VanCronkhite described it as \"being ignored\" right now by the market.\n\"There has been a mass exodus from health care,\" said Sohn, referring to flows out of the health care sector as its performance relative to the S&P 500 has hit \"bottom-decile\" on a historical basis. As a result, it would be \"hard to get much worse for health care,\" he said.\nSohn conceded that for health care to do better, the current market leaders will need to do worse. There won't be any \"sustained\" move in health care without a cost for \"everything else.\" He is not betting that there is any wholesale move into health care anytime soon because that would require a breakdown in the broader market. But he says it still makes sense \"as a differentiation hedge going forward, especially because no one is there.\"\nWatch the video above to learn more about the ETF experts' views on defensive positions.

Deciding on the penalties this week, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled against the most severe consequences proposed by the DOJ, causing shares of the search company to jump.\n\"I'm glad it's over,\" Pichai responded to Trump, causing an eruption of laughter from the other table guests.\n\"It's a long process,\" Pichai said. \"Appreciate that your administration had a constructive dialogue, and we were able to get it to some resolution.\"\n\"Right,\" Trump replied.\n\"The AI moment is one of the most transformative moments any of us have ever seen or will see in our lifetimes, so making sure the U.S. is at the forefront — and I think your administration is investing a lot,\" Pichai said. \"Already the AI action plan under your leadership I think is a great start, and we look forward to working together. And thanks for your leadership.\"\nThe plan Pichai referred to is the administration's \"Winning the AI Race: America's AI Action Plan,\" launched in July, which claims to identify 90 federal policy actions across three pillars: the acceleration of innovation, building of artificial intelligence infrastructure, and leadership in international diplomacy and security. Part of that plan includes a July executive order that says AI models should not incorporate \"Woke AI\" or \"ideological dogmas such as DEI,\" meaning diversity, equity and inclusion.\nGoogle is also in discussions with Trump's lawyers for an ongoing lawsuit that the president filed more than four years ago, accusing the online video platform YouTube of unlawful censorship. The lawsuit stemmed from the suspension of Trump's accounts on social media sites after the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.\nEarlier Thursday, Pichai attended the White House \"AI Education Taskforce\" event hosted by first lady Melania Trump.\nTrump interrupted Pichai's Thursday evening response to say \"Biden was the one who prosecuted that lawsuit, you know that right?\" Trump said, referring to the search monopoly case.\nThe search case was brought by the DOJ while Trump was in office during his first term. Pichai did not correct him.", "content_hash": "bac32310f7c93fe033469f5f1b26f1a2", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The deals are being closed and financial statements showing losses will be filed by February, the company said.\n\"We recognize this outcome is disappointing,\" Yieldstreet said in the investor letter. \"Yieldstreet pursued this extensive recovery effort because we are committed to exhausting every reasonable avenue for investor recovery.\"\nYieldstreet put its investors into deals totaling $89 million in loans that were supposed to be backed by 13 ships, according to a lawsuit filed by the startup against the borrower in that project. The loans float money to companies that take apart ships for scrap metal; the vessels themselves are the collateral on the deals.\nYieldstreet lost track of the ships and then pursued the borrower, which it accused of fraud. While it won monetary awards in a number of jurisdictions outside the U.S., the borrower avoided paying the startup by concealing their assets, Yieldstreet said in the August investor letter.\nThe episode garnered media coverage and in 2020 contributed to the collapse of a high-profile partnership with BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager.\nThe news of this latest loss follows CNBC's report last month that Yieldstreet customers in four real estate deals worth $78 million have been wiped out, with roughly $300 million of other deals on watchlist for possible losses.\nThis year, Yieldstreet changed its CEO and announced a new business model that leans more on distributing private market funds provided by established Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs and the Carlyle Group.\nIn a statement provided to CNBC, Yieldstreet said the investor letters refer to marine loan deals from 2018 and 2019 in an asset class that the firm no longer offers.\n\"While substantially less than the amounts invested by the funds and ultimately the investors, this settlement allows us to bring closure to litigation that could otherwise continue indefinitely,\" Yieldstreet said in the statement.\nThe firm \"takes its fiduciary responsibilities seriously and, throughout the recovery effort, advanced its own funds in an effort to protect its investors and has absorbed significant losses alongside its investors,\" the startup said.\nBitter end\nArman, an investor who plowed $180,000 into marine loans in 2019, called the result a bitter disappointment. After receiving $16,000 from Yieldstreet in a class action settlement tied to the soured marine deals, he estimates that he lost more than 90% of his original investment.\nCNBC is withholding Arman's last name from publication at his request.\n\"My mother passed away in 2018, and I didn't know where to put the money,\" Arman said. \"I thought this was somewhere safe to put it, and it wasn't.\"\nThe Yieldstreet marine loan deal was supposed to mature in six months, a relatively short-term investment.\nInstead, it stretched into a six-year saga for Arman, who works as a firefighter and paramedic near the West Coast.\n\"They are now washing their hands of the whole thing,\" he said. \"They are taking $5 million to cover their own expenses, with no regard for investors.\"", "content_hash": "7e8dd8e421bdc51b893013e581885080", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

It will sideline major store renovations and development in the meantime.\nWhile the changes will vary based on the location, expect more seating, dark wood paneling and other tweaks that make its cafes cozier. The renovations will also include changes like less harsh lighting that won't affect customers with light sensitivity.\n\"We're uplifting more than 1,000 coffeehouses over the next year, blending our global heritage with local relevance to create spaces that are immersive, inclusive, and deeply human,\" Dawn Clark, Starbucks senior vice president of coffeehouse design and concepts, said in a statement to CNBC.\n\"Whether it's the laid-back warmth of the Palisades or the urban energy of Manhattan, intentional design encourages customers to stay longer, connect more, and return often — and translates into meaningful business impact,\" Clark said.\nStarbucks is planning to spend about $150,000 on each \"uplift,\" without closing the stores down. The company started with locations in New York, followed by cafes in Southern California.\nThe makeovers are intended to make the stores more welcoming, returning Starbucks to its prior status as a \"third place\" for customers to hang out between home and work. In recent years, Starbucks had lost that reputation, fueled by decisions like removing seats as mobile ordering become popular and getting rid of outlets to discourage lingering.\nUnder CEO Brian Niccol, the chain plans to reverse many of those decisions as it tries to break a sales slump. For example, he previously told employees in June that he plans to add back the 30,000 seats that had been removed from cafes.\nBut trying to appeal to a wider swath of customers isn't new for the company. Starbucks first unveiled an accessible store design in early 2024, before Niccol's tenure. At the time, the company said that the design took about two years and included input from baristas.\nTake a look inside a recently renovated New York City cafe near Manhattan's Union Square.\nBefore the renovation, the location lacked many decorative touches, besides some large-scale photos of the chain's Hacienda Alsacia, its coffee and research farm in Costa Rica.\nWith such sparse seating, the cafe's concrete floors were more obvious. Harsh lighting didn't help the store's appearance either.\nThe location now features much more seating near the entrance. Leather accents to the wraparound booth make the seats more comfortable. The tables are easily movable and at an accessible height for wheelchair users.\nStarbucks also brought back the electrical outlets that disappeared in prior makeovers. Now customers who want to study or work from the location can charge their laptops or phones, encouraging them to stay longer.\nLarge area rugs bring a cozy touch, in addition to dampening some of the cafe's ambient noise. Live plants also add to the homey vibe of the space.\nHigh-top tables, positioned closer to the barista bar, offer a seating option for customers looking to sit down with companions. The makeover adds 16 more seats to the location.\nStarbucks also changed out its lightbulbs to soften the store's lighting and reduce glare, giving it a warmer atmosphere. The improved lighting helps highlight an existing mural, seen on the right of the photo above.\nBehind the barista bar, the company added a large shelving unit that highlights bags of its coffee, plus decorative burlap sacks that hold beans. Touches of purple are a nod to the nearby New York University.\nCustomers waiting to pick up their drinks can sit off to the side. Previously, the area was a standing bar that wasn't accessible to wheelchair users.\nIn addition to adding rugs, Starbucks also improved the location's overall insulation to cut down on the clamor of a busy coffee shop. For baristas, the change means that conversations among customers are less likely to disturb their work, whether that's hearing an order correctly or focusing on making a latte.", "content_hash": "d6decec73068e181c917c3e83fd6eca7", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

President Donald Trump meets, touts, and tortures. During a dinner at the White House Thursday night with more than two dozen tech execs, Trump again warned he would soon impose \"fairly substantial\" semiconductor tariffs without indicating how they will work or what it means. Apple and Meta seem most favored. 2. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 22,000 in August versus analysts' estimate of 75,000, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report Friday. Stock futures rose on the expectation that weaker numbers will push the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in September. Conversation about a 50 basis point cut may pick up from here. 3. Broadcom saw a dramatic acceleration in spending on AI chips and is adding new customers beyond TikTok parent ByteDance, Meta, and Alphabet . The chipmaker posted a beat and raise Thursday after the bell, but the stock didn't really take off until CEO Hock Tan talked about $10 billion in custom AI-related orders from a new customer. VMWare, the software giant Broadcom bought for $69 billion nearly two years ago, was strong too. We raised our price target on shares, which are up 15% this morning. 4. Lululemon is disappointing again, with the stock plunging nearly 20% after the company gave a worse-than-expected full-year outlook. Too expensive and too much competition. No more de minimis exception, which allowed packages under a certain value to enter the U.S. without paying tariffs. Multiple downgrades on the Street. The end of athleisure or on to the next buzzy brand? 5. UnitedHealth caught a price target raise at Bernstein, which went to $379 from $337. It was the second PT boost this week for the health insurer. Is the bottom in? The analysts also raised CVS Health to $77 from $72. 6. JPMorgan cut its FedEx price target to $285 from $290 heading into the company's Sept. 18 earnings. The firm said estimates for fiscal Q1 could come in weak thanks to \"stagnant\" business-to-business demand. 7 . Wells Fargo raised its price target on American Express to $375 from $350 — remains incredibly strong. I've been a fan of this one for ages. 8. DoorDash 's price target was raised to $306 from $280 at Wells, which raised its 2026 EBITDA estimates. 9. J.B. Hunt downgraded to hold from buy at UBS, noting that a pricing inflection in the truckload market is less likely in the near term. No demand catalyst in sight. 10. Barclays lowered its price target on Adobe to $460 from $567 heading into its earnings report next week. The firm kept an overweight buy rating, though. Adobe uses the same model as struggling Club stock Salesforce — they charge too much.

In other words, when they underperform their benchmark, that underperformance is relatively large.\nConversely, active managers generally fare better in less liquid areas of the market, like fixed income, real estate, and small-cap and emerging-market stocks, Armour said.\nFor example, 43% of actively managed high-yield bond mutual funds and ETFs beat their index counterparts in the past 10-year period, according to Morningstar.\nFees are the key\nFees are the key driver of index funds' success when compared to active funds, Armour said.\nIndex funds carry a 0.11% average asset-weighted annual fee, while active funds carry a 0.59% fee, according to Morningstar.\nActive funds need to have higher relative returns just to overcome that fee differential.\nBeyond that, higher fees also eat into investor earnings. For example, an investor with $100,000 who earns 4% per year and pays a 0.25% fund fee would have $208,000 after 20 years, while the same investor paying a 1% fee would have $179,000, or $29,000 less, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSince index funds own all the securities in a broad market index, they are guaranteed to own the relative winners and losers.

The agreement reached in July had included Japan purchasing 100 Boeing planes, 75% higher imports of U.S. rice and $8 billion worth of agricultural and crop products.\nWashington will apply a baseline 15% tariff on nearly all Japanese imports, with separate sector-specific levies for automobiles and parts (also 15%), aerospace products, generic pharmaceutical goods and natural resources, according to the executive order.\nThe Thursday order prevents Trump's country-specific tariffs on top of existing levies. The lower tariffs will apply retroactively to Japanese goods \"entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 7, 2025,\" the order stated. The tariff relief on automobiles is set to take effect after seven days.\nTrump's global tariff campaign has thrown the global supply chain into disarray, in particular Japan's massive auto sector. Last month, Toyota warned that it expected a hit of nearly $10 billion as Trump's tariffs on autos weighed on its sales to the U.S., forcing it to slash by 16% its forecast for full-year operating profits.\nTariffs are expected to hit rivals as well, with Ford's pre-tax adjusted profit reportedly set to drop $3 billion while GM projects $4 billion to $5 billion hit for the year.\nJapan's top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, who was in Washington, delivered a letter from Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba inviting Trump to visit his country, Kyoto News reported. The Japanese official had reportedly canceled his trip to the U.S. last month as some sticking points required \"further technical discussion.\"\nPolitical tides\nThe finalizing of the deal came as political pressure for the Japanese leader mounts at home. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party earlier this week released a long-awaited report on why it lost seats in the upper house election in July.\nThe report ascribed the loss to the lack of appeal for the party's measures aimed at taming inflation, previous political scandals and weak mobilization of young voters.\nLocal media reports suggested many key members of the LDP have signaled their intention to resign to the prime minister, while Ishiba has said he intends to stay on amid calls within his party for choosing another leader.\nThough the reports have avoided naming individuals, they signal an \"implicit indictment of Ishiba's leadership of the party,\" said James Brady, vice president at political consultancy Teneo.\nAnalysts at Eurasia Group suggested in a report Friday that Ishiba is unlikely to survive a challenge from within the party next Monday, when a vote on whether to bring forward a leadership election is expected to take place.\n\"Ishiba's poor performance as party leader in lower and upper house elections and events in recent days, including former prime minister Aso Taro announcing his support for the special election, have turned the tide against Ishiba,\" analysts said, predicting a 60% odd of Ishiba's defeat in the election, with him possibly resigning before the vote takes place as internal discontent grows.", "content_hash": "f6d82ea4737a68384b0cbe9cbf00590e", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

And what you see here is only the first car of a series of models, which employs the same technologies,\" Zipse said.\nBMW has sought to revolutionize the digital offering of its new models by focusing on a so-called \"superbrain architecture,\" which replaces hardware with a centralized computer system.\nThe company says an \"all-new digital nervous system\" for the Neue Klasse platform has more than 20 times the computing power of its current vehicle generation.\nThese digital platforms provide the computing capacity for automated driving and infotainment functions, as well as basic car functions, such as climate control and comfort features.\nThe push to highlight the firm's technological development comes as legacy European car manufacturers scramble to close the gap with leading players of software-defined vehicles. U.S. EV-maker Tesla, alongside Chinese manufacturers including Xpeng and BYD, currently dominate this space.\n\"There is fierce competition, especially price competition in China.

Kennedy Jr. doubled down on false claims about vaccines and claimed he isn't limiting access to Covid shots during his Senate testimony on Thursday, as senators grilled him on his sweeping changes to immunization policy and federal health agencies.\nKennedy said he supports a statement made by a newly appointed member of a key government vaccine panel that mRNA vaccines pose a dangerous risk to people. Numerous studies have demonstrated that shots using mRNA technology, including Covid vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, are safe and effective, and serious side effects have happened in extremely rare cases.\nSen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., noted that the committee member, Dr. Retsef Levi, has said that evidence is mounting that mRNA vaccines cause \"serious harm, including death, especially among young people,\" apparently referring to a post pinned on Levi's X account. Kennedy appointed Levi to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine recommendations and insurance coverage.\nKennedy said he wasn't aware of Levi's comments, but added, \"I agree with it.\"\nHe also claimed that anyone could get a Covid booster shot, while also acknowledging that access \"depends on the state\" and that the government no longer recommends the vaccines for healthy people.\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved a fresh round of Covid shots with new limits, only clearing them for adults aged 65 and older and people with a medical condition that puts them at risk of a severe illness. The CDC and its vaccine panel will decide who to recommend the shots to later this month.\n\"I'm not taking them away from people,\" Kennedy said, referring to the vaccines.\nBut Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., argued that not everyone can walk into a pharmacy and get a Covid shot now.\nThe FDA's new limits have complicated Covid shot access in the U.S., which now depends on a patient's age and risk level, laws and policies in their state, insurance coverage, and health-care provider. Pending CDC guidance, some pharmacies have added prescription requirements for Covid vaccines in certain states.\n\"You clearly are taking away vaccines,\" she said after a prolonged shouting match with Kennedy.\nKennedy's comments before the Senate Finance Committee come after he repeatedly promised the panel in January that he would do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it more difficult or discourages people from taking vaccines. Since then, he has canceled funding for mRNA shot development and made other vaccine policy changes that could limit access to immunizations, including gutting the CDC vaccine panel and dropping Covid shot recommendations for certain groups.\nHis comments also follow a leadership shake-up at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The White House last week fired CDC Director Susan Monarez, and four senior agency officials resigned shortly after, with some of them citing the politicization of the agency and a threat to public health. In an opinion piece on Thursday, Monarez accused Kennedy of \"a deliberate effort to weaken America's public-health system and vaccine protections.\"\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X in support of Kennedy on Thursday, writing that he \"is taking flak because he's over the target\" and saying Democrats were attacking the Trump administration's \"commonsense effort.\"\nKennedy touted skepticism around Covid vaccines, despite evidence of their safety and effectiveness.\n\"We were told again and again the vaccines would prevent transmission, they prevent infection. It wasn't true. They knew it from the start,\" Kennedy said.\nHe also said he does not know how many people died of Covid and whether the vaccines prevented deaths from the virus.\n\"I would like to see the data and talk about the data,\" Kennedy said.\nBut data is readily available from dozens of studies. One paper in August estimates that Covid vaccines saved more than 2 million lives, mostly among older adults, worldwide between 2020 and October 2024.\nThe CDC website also says that Covid vaccines from the 2023 to 2024 season reduced the risk of severe illness from Covid by almost 70% in the first two months after vaccination in adults ages 18 and older, with protection gradually declining over time.\nThose shots also decreased the risk of hospitalization due to Covid by around 50% in the first two months of vaccination in that same population. The Covid vaccines showed similar benefits in older adults.\nKennedy also defended his decision to fire all 17 previous members of the CDC vaccine panel, saying he didn't politicize the committee.\n\"What we did is we got rid of the conflicts of interest. ... We depoliticized and put great scientists on it from a very diverse group,\" the HHS secretary said. \"They are very, very pro-vaccine.\"\nBut a new analysis published last month from USC researchers found that conflicts of interest on that panel had been at \"historic lows for years\" before Kennedy restacked it with new members, some of whom are widely known vaccine critics.\nCorrection: Kennedy testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday.

The app was downloaded 10.2 million times in India in August, a huge jump from the 2.5 million downloads seen during the same month last year, according to analytics firm Appfigures.\nSince its launch, ChatGPT has 111 million downloads in India, ahead of its 80 million downloads in the U.S, Appfigures data shows.\nDownloads do not necessarily equal daily or monthly users, but the figures emphasise OpenAI's growth trajectory in the country.\nThe download numbers are also far ahead of rivals, including Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude. The closest challenger was Perplexity, Appfigures said, which had 6.4 million downloads in August.\nIndia-specific product\nUser spending on ChatGPT has been increasing. To date, Indian users have spent $21.3 million on ChatGPT, Appfigures data shows. In comparison, U.S. users have spent $784 million.\nThat underlines the fact that while the number of users in India is huge, it remains a price-sensitive market.\nTo address this, OpenAI in August launched ChatGPT Go, a low-cost 399-rupees-($4.53)-a-month plan for its AI app.\n\"It's a classic wedge strategy to capture a price-sensitive market and build a user base that will be difficult for local players to dislodge later,\" Futurum Group's Patience said of the strategy.\nInfrastructure and hiring\nAccording to Bloomberg, OpenAI is scouting a location in India for a data center with at least 1-gigawatt capacity. The facility will be part of OpenAI's Stargate-branded infrastructure push, Bloomberg said this week, although CNBC was unable to verify the report.\nThe ChatGPT developer said last month that it would open a local office in the market and is currently advertising three sales roles in India.\nIt also announced last month an education program in India that will include funding for research and provide half a million ChatGPT licenses for educators and students across the country.\nIndia challenges\nWhile India doesn't have a home-grown artificial intelligence company as big as OpenAI, there are some challengers in the form of domestic startups, including Sarvam AI and Krutrim, and other American tech giants like Google and Meta.\nContinued geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and India over trade, however, have the potential to cause complications if there's any backlash from New Delhi against American tech firms.\nOpenAI is also locked in a legal battle with Asian News International in India, which has accused the ChatGPT developer of using copyrighted material illegally. It's a closely-watched case in the country for how copyright laws apply in the AI era.\n\"OpenAI's success in India is not guaranteed and depends heavily on its ability to navigate these legal and political hurdles,\" Futurum Group's Patience said.\n\"While the Indian market is vast, its diversity in languages and user needs presents challenges. OpenAI's ability to deliver a truly localized product and its long-term impact on India's AI talent remain uncertain.\"", "content_hash": "2cc597ecf6d6154ddb53c663447feaee", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

And especially when you're dealing with a creative business like ours, that begins with being together in person.\"\nThe move could help Paramount thin the herd ahead of looming staffing cuts.\nVariety reported last month that the company is expected to lay off between 2,000 and 3,000 employees as part of its postmerger cost-cutting measures. These cuts are slated for early November, Variety reported.\nParamount is looking to take $2 billion in costs out of the conglomerate amid advertising losses and industrywide struggles with traditional cable networks.\nPhase one of Ellison's back-to-work plan will see employees in Los Angeles and New York returning to a full five-day workweek in the new year.\nPhase two will focus on offices outside LA and New York, including international locations. A similar buyout program will be offered in 2026 for those who operate in these locations.\n\"We recognize this represents a significant change for many, and we're committed to supporting you throughout this transition,\" Ellison wrote. \"We will work closely with managers to ensure you have the time and flexibility to make the necessary adjustments.\"", "content_hash": "8866292b5edce610dfa7c98fd815aa9e", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona, introduced a bill on Thursday — titled the You Earn It, You Keep it Act — to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits. A House version of the bill was introduced by Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minnesota, in April.\nGallego's bill would permanently eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits.\nIt would also expand the Social Security payroll tax to apply to annual earnings over $250,000. Currently, the maximum earnings subject to Social Security payroll taxes is $176,100 in 2025. Consequently, high earners may only pay into the program for part of the year.\n\"Despite decades of paying into the system, seniors are still forced to pay taxes on their hard-earned benefits — all while the ultra wealthy barely pay into the system,\" Gallego said in a statement.\nHow Social Security benefits are taxed\nSocial Security recipients may owe federal income taxes on their benefits depending on their income.\nHow much they may owe is based on a formula known as combined income — the sum of adjusted gross income, tax-exempt interest income and half of Social Security benefits.\nUp to 50% of benefits may be taxed for individual tax filers with between $25,000 and $34,000 in combined income, or married couples who file jointly with between $32,000 and $44,000.\nUp to 85% of benefits may be taxable for individuals with more than $34,000 in combined income or couples with more than $44,000.\nHow the 'big beautiful' tax law helps seniors\nRepublicans' new \"big beautiful\" law includes a new senior deduction aimed at helping to defray the effects of federal taxes on Social Security benefits.\nAdults aged 65 and over may be able to claim an additional deduction of up to $6,000.\nWhether beneficiaries will benefit from the change will depend on their income.\nThe full deduction will be available to individual taxpayers with up to $75,000 in modified adjusted gross income or married couples with up to $150,000. The deduction will gradually phase out for taxpayers with incomes above those thresholds.\nThe temporary deduction — which will be in effect for tax years 2025 through 2028 — will be available to eligible taxpayers regardless of whether they take the standard deduction or itemize their returns.\nMiddle-income taxpayers stand to benefit the most from the policy, according to tax experts, since low earners may already be exempt from federal taxes on benefits and higher earners will be above the phaseout thresholds.\nHow 'You Earn It, You Keep It' may affect Social Security\nUnlike the temporary senior deduction recently signed into law, Gallego's You Earn It, You Keep It proposal would eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits for all beneficiaries.\nTo be sure, it remains to be seen whether it may get enough support to become law.\nThe proposal does have the support of The Senior Citizens League, a nonpartisan senior advocacy group that is petitioning Congress to stop taxing Social Security benefits. Eliminating federal taxes on Social Security benefits is a \"commonsense step to ensure older Americans can keep more of what they've earned,\" Senior Citizens League Executive Director Shannon Benton said in a statement.\nEfforts to change the federal taxation of Social Security benefits come as the program is facing a trust fund shortfall. Benefits may be reduced within the next decade unless Congress enacts changes sooner, according to projections from Social Security's trustees.\nBecause the \"big beautiful\" law did not include any offsets for the reduced revenue from federal taxes on benefits, it would accelerate the depletion dates, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\nIn contrast, the You Earned It, You Keep It proposal would extend the Social Security trust funds' ability to pay benefits in full and on time for 24 years, or until 2058, according to Gallego's office. That matches an analysis of Craig's House proposal by Social Security's chief actuary in April.", "content_hash": "c9191b29aba6f9e461228cb296b7877b", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

He pointed to the deals available at the Excalibur, one of MGM's resorts on the Las Vegas Strip: $85 rooms, including resort fee; $5 tables; $5 beers. But the $12 Starbucks coffee grabs the headline.\n\"There is value there, and there's always been value,\" Hornbuckle said. \"We let the narrative get away from us and shame on us. We need to do a better job.\"\nMGM and Las Vegas more broadly had posted several years of growth in visitation, room rates and profits before this year's slowdown.\nWhen asked whether the Vegas slump could be a canary in the coal mine for U.S. travel more broadly, Hornbuckle, who chairs the U.S. Travel Association, said it does seem to be a leading indicator. And the industry as a whole is facing some troubling obstacles.\nCanadian visitation to the U.S. has plummeted some 40% this year, following comments by President Donald Trump about Canada as a potential 51st U.S. state and evolving trade policies. The Canadian dollar has also weakened, lessening the buying power of visitors crossing the border into the U.S.\nHornbuckle also pointed to massive price hikes for a U.S. visa, from $100 to $350, where a family of four visiting for the Ryder Cup, World Cup or Olympics in 2028, for example, could pay $1,400 for visa documents alone.\n\"International travel in 2016 had a $50 billion U.S. surplus. Today it's a $50 billion deficit,\" Hornbuckle said.\nThe government's commitment to funding marketing and promotion of U.S. travel was also slashed by 80% in the most recent spending bill, to $20 million.\n\"We obviously find ourselves in a world that has a fair amount of uncertainty from a macroeconomic perspective, from a socio-political perspective,\" Marriott CEO Tony Capuano told investors at the BofA conference Thursday. \"Marriott, and the sector more broadly, thrives in times of certainty and stability. So that creates some measure of challenge.\"\nCapuano said there's been a slight uptick after Labor Day in some segments of travel. He said Marriott sees spending restrained in budget travelers and small businesses. But he described demand for luxury travel as \"sturdy.\"\nWyndham Hotel and Resorts CEO Geoff Ballotti laid out an optimistic view of the travel industry, noting robust demand for extended stay, driven in part by projects supporting the government's infrastructure spending.\n\"You're seeing incredible interest in investment right now,\" Ballotti told CNBC. \"Our new construction pipeline, 20 consecutive quarters of growth, is at an all-time high. We're seeing groundbreakings accelerate. We're seeing a new construction pipeline accelerate, and we're seeing it more so here domestically than we are anywhere else in the world.\"", "content_hash": "020989cb6f7ffff916b022c9ebe4af5c", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

On Friday, directors proposed a 10-year pay package that could deliver Musk as much as $1 trillion in stock awards if the company clears a set of extraordinary performance hurdles.\nSuggested Reading\nThe deal would grant Musk roughly 423 million Tesla shares, currently worth about $143 billion, but the full value only materializes if Tesla executes on a series of rather ambitious targets.\nRelated Content\nThe first tranche would vest when Tesla’s market capitalization hits and sustains $2 trillion, with additional tranches tied to every $500 billion increment after that, up to $6.5 trillion. The final tranches vest if Tesla reaches $8.5 trillion in market value — a target that would make it far and away the most valuable publicly traded company on earth.\nBut valuation alone won’t do it. Under the pay package, Tesla must also deliver 20 million vehicles annually, put 1 million autonomous robotaxis into commercial service, deliver 1 million Optimus humanoid robots, and sign up 10 million active subscriptions for its Full Self-Driving software. On the financial side, the bar is just as high: Adjusted EBITDA must start at $50 billion and eventually reach $400 billion over four consecutive quarters, even as Tesla continues to pour billions into AI and robotics R&D.\nIf Musk clears all those hurdles, his ownership stake could more than double — from about 12% of outstanding shares today to more than 25%. That would give him even greater control over Tesla’s direction at a time when the company is trying to reinvent itself as an AI and robotics powerhouse, not just an electric carmaker.\nFor Tesla’s board, the calculation is simple: Musk is Tesla.\n“The biggest asset for Tesla is Musk,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a Friday note, maintaining his “Outperform” rating and sky-high $500 price target. He argued the package was “critical to keep Musk at the helm” through what he described as the company’s most consequential growth cycle, with autonomy and robotics “front and center.” The proxy filing also calls for a nonbinding shareholder vote on a strategic investment in Musk’s xAI startup, designed to accelerate Tesla’s AI development and create what the company claims could be one of the most powerful AI platforms in the world.\nLately, though, Tesla’s EV engine has sputtered, and that weakness has only magnified concerns about Musk’s attention span.\nTesla’s second-quarter deliveries fell 13% year over year to 384,122 vehicles, its second consecutive quarterly drop and the sharpest mid-year slowdown since 2022. Revenues slipped 12%, and profit fell 16%, with Europe and China showing the steepest losses. The stumbles come as rivals such as BYD extend their lead in China and European incumbents eat into Tesla’s market share. The company’s energy-storage business is still growing, but it’s nowhere near large enough to offset the shortfall in cars.\nAgainst that backdrop, Musk has been increasingly preoccupied with politics and side projects. He accepted a role heading President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), said he was starting a third political party (the “America Party”), name-called the president, and pushed controversial policies on X — all while Tesla’s core business has struggled.\nShareholders have noticed. Some have openly pressed Musk to commit at least 40 hours a week to Tesla, worried that his forays into Washington and social media are draining focus at a time when execution is critical. For the board, the trillion-dollar pay package is less a bonus than a tether — an attempt to bind Musk to Tesla through 2030 and assure investors that the CEO remains fully engaged in the company’s make-or-break pivot from EVs to autonomy and AI.\nThat means that this package carries major implications for Tesla’s governance and shareholder structure. If Musk meets its ambitious targets, his stake in the company could more than double, consolidating greater control in one individual as Tesla’s oversight faces legal scrutiny. A Delaware court voided Musk’s previous $56 billion compensation deal in January 2024, ruling that the board failed to exercise sufficient independence in approving it. That decision, now under appeal, forced Tesla to assemble a $29 billion interim award last month while it worked on a long-term plan.\nThe stakes extend beyond compensation. For Tesla, the package is a statement of intent about what the company is trying to become. The company, which once lived or died by Model 3 deliveries, is pitching itself as a leader in artificial intelligence, autonomy, and robotics — a transition that apparently requires both investor patience and Musk’s sustained involvement at the center of the company’s evolution, even as he juggles SpaceX, X, and a growing portfolio of AI ventures.\nThe plan now goes to shareholders, with a vote scheduled for Nov. 6. And those shareholders face a familiar question: How much turbulence are they willing to tolerate in exchange for growth? They’ve long accepted volatility, governance drama, and Musk’s distractions so long as Tesla kept climbing. This package asks them to double down.

The Dominican Republic is the first market in the Caribbean served by Amazon Air Cargo, the wholesale business unit established in late September 2024 help fill aircraft with heavy shipments independent from Amazon’s parcel ecosystem.\nALK Global Logistics was previously listed on Amazon Air Cargo’s website as a partner, but prior to Wednesday no details were available about what their contractual arrangement involved.\nAmazon Air manages a fleet of about 100 passenger-to-cargo converted aircraft to support next-day and two-day package delivery for the Amazon marketplace. Amazon Air Cargo is the direct sales channel to logistics providers and other businesses seeking to move general cargo by air.\nALK is the fourth Amazon Air Cargo customer that has been publicly promoted, although the company’s website lists a handful of other users. The flights connect Miami and Santo Domingo with seven weekly frequencies. Amazon outsources the flying to contractor 21 Air, according to flight activity on Flightradar24.\nAerodom, the operator of Las Américas International Airport (SDQ), is collaborating with ALK to fill the flights with cargo.\n“This new route positions us at the forefront of logistics in the region, allowing exporters and importers to benefit from faster and more reliable solutions,” said ALK Chief Executive Officer Alfonso Alemán, in a news release.\nSDQ is the Dominican Republic’s primary air cargo gateway and is experiencing an influx of e-commerce traffic. A new terminal is dedicated to express parcels and e-commerce shipments, with capacity for 4 million additional packages per year.\nIn the spring, Amazon began operating daily flights between Miami and Bogota, carrying e-commerce packages to Colombia and returning with shipments tendered by the cargo division of flag-carrier Avianca. Those flights are also operated by 21 Air.\nAmazon engages all-cargo airlines to operate its fleet because it doesn’t have an air operator’s certifcate.\nIn July, Air Premia, a passenger airline based in South Korea, entered into a transportation services agreement with Amazon Air Cargo under which it transfers belly cargo to Amazon at Honolulu airport for onward carriage to the continental United States. Those Amazon flights utilize Airbus A330-330 converted freighters operated by Hawaiian Airlines, which was acquired last year by Alaska Airlines. Once at U.S. hubs, the Air Premia shipments are relayed to 45 cities, including Atlanta and Houston, through the Amazon Air network.", "content_hash": "79e5437d42449b19b4257fabeedf1cda", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

His supporting statement reads:\nTesla’s integration of Grok into its vehicles demonstrates the tangible benefits of collaboration with xAI. As Tesla pivots toward AI-driven technologies, including Full Self-Driving and robotics, a strategic investment in xAI would secure access to advanced AI capabilities, enhance product innovation, and drive shareholder value.\nThe board, which often suggests investors vote against shareholder proposals, is neutral on this one.\nIf Tesla does end up investing in xAI, it would be the second of Musk’s companies to do so. SpaceX, Musk’s aerospace company, has committed to investing $2 billion in xAI as part of a $5 billion equity raise. Analysts have speculated that SpaceX’s involvement in xAI could signal the AI firm is having trouble raising from outside investors. (Musk also merged X, the company formerly known as Twitter, with xAI earlier this year.)\nSome Tesla shareholders have argued that xAI is a rival to Tesla, since Musk has often described his EV company as an AI company. Last year, shareholders sued Musk and the company for allowing Musk to startup a rival AI firm, but the case was dismissed.\nHawk’s proposal comes as Tesla grapples with weakening EV sales and a lackluster robotaxi rollout. The company has attempted to direct investor attention away from those headwinds and towards Tesla’s AI efforts, which center on testing and deploying autonomous vehicles and Optimus, its humanoid robot.\nMusk has argued that he requires more of a controlling stake in Tesla to lead the company’s AI efforts, rather than get distracted by his other AI company. Alongside the proposal to invest in xAI, shareholders will vote on a Tesla-backed 10-year compensation plan for Musk that could give him more than 25% control.\nThe filing comes as Tesla continues to appeal a Delaware judge’s decision to strike down Musk’s earlier $56 billion pay package. The new plan would tie Musk’s compensation to ambitious benchmarks, including boosting Tesla’s market value from about $1 trillion today to more than $8 trillion.\n“Tesla’s not going to get to $8 trillion market cap based on FSD and robotaxi. To get to that $8 trillion, you kind of need xAI,” Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, told TechCrunch. “We’re talking numbers that have historically been inconceivable. To get to those, we need things to happen that are inconceivable right now. And one of them is humanoid robots everywhere; that’s probably the biggest lever.”", "content_hash": "d5405478c9a35af2bdcfda28b0fefffa", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid roughly 0.6%. The declines mark a pullback from sizable gains earlier in the session.\nThe US economy added just 22,000 jobs in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was far short of expectations for 75,000 and adds more evidence to the narrative of a dramatically slowing US labor market. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, compared with 4.2% the previous month.\nRevisions to data from July and June in Friday's report suggest that over the last three months, the US economy has created fewer than 30,000 new jobs. The revisions also showed a negative print in June, the first labor market shrinkage since 2020.\nThe jobs report, the first since President Trump fired the head of the BLS, capped a week of data showing cracks in the labor market. That has fed Wall Street's certainty that a rate cut is coming at the Federal Reserve's September meeting. Traders are now pricing in a 100% chance of a reduction, and bets are rising on a \"jumbo,\" 50-basis-point cut.\nTreasury yields sank following the report, with the 30-year yield (^TYX) falling below 4.79% after nearing 5% earlier in the week. The benchmark 10-year yield (^TNX) dropped to 4.07%, its lowest since April.\nAfter the release, Trump voiced further criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell in a social media post. \"Jerome 'Too Late' Powell should have lowered rates long ago. As usual, he’s 'Too Late!'\" he wrote. His comment comes a day after a Senate hearing to confirm Trump pick Stephen Miran as Fed governor, as the White House tries to recast the Fed in pursuit of rate cuts.\nMeanwhile, AI trade hopes got a boost after an upbeat outlook from Broadcom (AVGO) and a report that the US company has signed a deal to build OpenAI's (OPAI.PVT) first chips. Its shares jumped over 10%.\nElsewhere in tech, shares of Tesla (TSLA) rose after the EV maker's board proposed paying CEO Elon Musk $1 trillion in compensation, if performance targets are met.\nRead more: The latest on Trump's tariffs\nLIVE 11 updates Tesla stock jumps amid Musk's $1 trillion pay package proposal\nTesla stock jumped as much as 4.9% Friday after the EV maker's board proposed a plan, outlined in a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, to compensate CEO Elon Musk with a pay package worth roughly $1 trillion if he achieves certain milestones.\nThose milestones include driving Tesla's market cap to $8.5 trillion and putting 1 million of its Robotaxis into commercial operation.\nThis pay package would provide Musk with an additional 423 million shares of common stock, or 12% of Tesla shares, meaning he would have roughly 25% voting power over the company's decisions, noted Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note to clients Friday.\nIves believes the added voting power provision \"was critical to keep Musk at the helm to lead Tesla through the most critical time in the company’s history.\"\n\"We believe this was the smart move by the Board as the biggest asset for Tesla is Musk,\" he said, adding, \"[T]his is a crucial time for Tesla ahead with autonomous and robotics front and center.\"\nThe stock pared gains shortly after the market open, up more than 2% mid morning.\nTech leads stocks higher at the open\nUS stocks jumped at the open on Friday as investors digested a weak August jobs report, which pushed investor confidence in a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting even higher.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.4%, coming off a fresh all-time closing high for the index on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.6%.\nTech stocks' surge was led by gains in Tesla (TSLA) and Broadcom (AVGO) shares, which added 3.6% and 12.8% at the start of Friday's trading session.\nRate cut bets surge after jobs report\nBets on coming Fed rate cuts are surging after the jobs report.\nCME Group had the odds of a cut very high before the report — around 97% to 3%. But after it confirmed the severe summer slowdown, the odds almost immediately shifted to 100% on a 25-point cut this month.\nSubsequently, traders piled into bets on a \"jumbo\" rate cut — 50 basis points. As of around 9:10 a.m. ET, about 88% of bets are on a 25-point cut, and 12% of bets are for 50 points.\nBets are also jumping on cuts in October and December. By the end of the year, a majority of traders expect the equivalent of three rate cuts.\nThe first negative jobs print since 2020\nThe revisions to the monthly jobs report have taken high focus lately. On Friday, we learned something very noteworthy from them: June 2025 was the first month of labor market shrinkage since 2020.\nJune's number was revised to show a net loss of 13,000 jobs. That's the first negative monthly jobs print since December 2020, in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs my colleague Jake Conley notes, this report's revisions found that, over the last three months, the US economy added 8,000 fewer jobs per month than had been previously reported.\nYou can see the slight dip in the chart below:\nUS economy adds just 22,000 jobs, unemployment rate rises\nThe US labor market continues to slow.\nThe August jobs report released Friday by the the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) showed there were just 22,000 new jobs added to the economy last month, far fewer than forecast and the latest sign that the US labor market slowed down through the summer. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in August.\nEconomists had expected the report to show 75,000 jobs created last month, with the unemployment rate forecast to rise to 4.3%, according to Bloomberg data.\nIn July, the economy created 73,000 new jobs. Those figures were revised on Friday to show 79,000 jobs created during the month. Revisions to June's data, however, were more negative, with those numbers now showing 13,000 jobs lost during the month. Revisions in early August had brought June's job growth down to 14,000.\nRead more here.\nGood morning.

The results are deserved, as people I talk to in retail have been super let down in Lululemon's product assortments in recent months. It will take time to reverse the lack of must-have items, they say.\nHere is the Street vibe on Lululemon this morning:\n\"Challenges from domestic market pressures and removal of the de minimis exemption are primary drivers of a meaningful cut to FY25 guidance (implying -4.4% lower 2H revenue and -22% lower 2H EPS at the midpoint). Acknowledgment of underperformance within the casual side of the business (40% revenue mix) is a starting point, though reigniting brand momentum in the U.S. is likely to take longer than we had previously anticipated.\" — Stifel analyst Peter McGoldrick\n\"It's very simple... With sales per foot 4x mall avg and margins near peak, LULU's fundamentals will get much worse ahead. The US drives the earnings and the US is fading fast here. We believe the guide is not low enough and continue to carry estimates well below the Street/company guide. Rising competition won't stop either, which means LULU's EPS is permanently impaired. With lower growth and brand strength fading, a lower multiple is warranted.\" — Jefferies analyst Randy Konik\nGold stays high after reaching record price\nGold (GC=F) has maintained its upward trajectory for a third week of consecutive gains.

The next step in this program will occur on Tuesday, September 9 when Porsche customers will gain soft launch access to the Tesla Supercharger network. This means Porsche owners will have access to 23,500 Tesla Superchargers in North America – helping them find even more convenient places to charge.\nAccess to the Tesla Supercharger network will be possible though Porsche-supplied NACS DC adapter being made available to Porsche customers. At this soft launch stage, Porsche customers will utilize the Tesla app to enable charging. Charging through the My Porsche app and plug-and-charge is expected to follow in the coming months.\n“We are continually working to make every aspect of Porsche ownership as convenient as possible for our customers – and this news represents a significant step for owners of our electrified cars,” said Timo Resch, President and CEO of Porsche Cars North America. “As we launch this offering, in the coming months, we will be adding more features to make the process even more seamless.”\nThe adapter\nGoing forward, all new model year 2026 Porsche Taycan and Macan Electric models will include Porsche NACS DC adapter at no additional fee. Model year 2025 Taycan owners and all existing Macan Electric owners are eligible for a complimentary adapter. This group of owners will receive notification via their My Porsche to reserve their free Porsche NACS DC adapter shortly.\nModel year 2024 and older Taycan customers can elect to purchase the Porsche NACS DC adapter from the Porsche Online Shop and at local Porsche Centers starting today. The MSRP of the adapter is $185 and enables Porsche owners to charge their CCS-equipped Taycan and Macan Electric models at DC fast charging stations equipped with NACS/J3400 compatible cables, including select Tesla Superchargers.\nHow it works\nThis soft launch will allow customer access the Tesla Supercharger network ahead of the full operational launch – with enhanced features such as access via the Porsche app and plug & charge capability – following in the coming months.\nCustomers connecting to a NACS Tesla Supercharger will need to take two simple steps – the first being to download and register on the Tesla app to activate Tesla Supercharger stations.\nOther stations, such as Ionna and Electrify America with NACS handles, can be activated via the My Porsche app. Next, they will use their new Porsche NACS DC adapter to connect to the charging station cable before it can then be plugged into the car.\nCharge planning software\nAll model year 2026 Taycan and Macan Electric variants will come with the necessary navigation features to incorporate the location of additional chargers. Model year 2024 and 2025 Macan Electric models will receive this software update before the end of the year, while model year 2025 and earlier Taycan variants will receive their upgrade thereafter.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s shares jumped by 3.3% on Wednesday after a major headwind disappeared in the form of search engine giant Google’s troubles with the Justice Department. The shares were higher as a court ruled that Google could continue to pay companies to push its Search service on devices. For Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), this meant that its deal with Google, reportedly valued at $20 billion, to push Google Search on the iPhone. Cramer discussed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) before the news of the court ruling broke:\n“Well that’s why I think that China remains the wildcard and all of this is just setting up for very, very difficult, tough negotiation. So therefore you have to look at Apple, you have to look at NVIDIA and people are just saying, alright I’ve looked, I’ve judged, sell. That’s too simple. These are great companies and they will figure out a way to make money.”\nPreviously, Cramer discussed how Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the only major company that isn’t spending heavily on NVIDIA’s AI GPUs:\n“Apple is the only one of these heavy hitters that isn’t writing huge checks to NVIDIA, simply because they don’t have an AI strategy. Apple stock, by the way, is the poorest performer of the big tech stocks. Will that change after tonight’s numbers? Will Apple turn out to have the last laugh while all the others fall flat on their faces?… Listen, we heard the same thing about the dot-com survivors at the turn of the millennium.”\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Tariffs should contribute to ongoing price increases in household furnishings, apparel, and recreation commodities,” BofA said.\nAnalysts expect tariff-related goods inflation to persist over the coming quarters.\nNon-housing services are also anticipated to remain firm. BofA noted that “non-housing core services prices rose 0.4% month-on-month, after a 0.5% increase in July. Airfares likely increased again owing to another strong seasonal factor, and lodging away from home should also climb.”\nThese gains reflect both mean-reversion after earlier declines and higher summer travel activity.\nBased on these CPI forecasts, BofA expects core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation to rise to 3.0% year-on-year in August.\n“Our preliminary estimate for core PCE inflation in July is 0.27% month-on-month.

The credit card and banking giant is benefiting from increased market optimism as the Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates.\nThe credit card for the affluent customer\nAmerican Express has carved out a niche as an elite credit card provider, servicing an upscale clientele with fee-based products that come with a coveted rewards program. Although it has only a fraction of competitor Visa's card membership, it has nearly double Visa's revenue. Its cardmembers are high spenders, and they're more resilient when there's pressure, making American Express resilient, too.\nIn the 2025 second quarter, revenue increased 9% year over year (currency neutral), and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were up 17%.\nAmerican Express stands out from other credit card networks in several ways. One is the focus on the affluent consumer, and another is its closed-loop model. Instead of working with partnering banks or financial institutions to provide the credit for its customers to make purchases on its network, it acts as its own bank. That gives it greater control over the model and expands its platform. In contrast with other networks, it has a large and varied stream of revenue.\nIt also makes money on deposits, which leads to higher net interest income and higher overall net income.\nAnother way the company differentiates itself is with its robust rewards program and accompanying annual fees. Fee revenue increased 20% year over year in the second quarter and accounted for more than 13% of revenue.\nLow interest rates should boost business\nLower interest rates generally boost economic activity, because money is cheaper and therefore easier to come by. Companies can borrow more easily, and they tend to expand their operations when money is plentiful. Individuals tend to spend more when it's cheaper to service their credit.\nThis works in American Express' favor in several ways. Higher economic activity is good for spending, and people with money are also more likely to take out new fee-based cards. It also means its default rates should go lower. They're generally best-in-class, and since interest rates have started to come down from highs, they're already improving.\nAmerican Express has been a reliable stock for decades, and it also pays a growing dividend. It's one of Warren Buffett's favorite and longest-held stocks, and it can still provide value for new and current shareholders.", "content_hash": "2b0a25eaa527e764bf365b0808c6fea7", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

I’ve been writing about the uptick in CFO turnover. The latest high-profile departure is at multibillionaire Elon Musk’s xAI.\nMike Liberatore stepped down abruptly as the finance chief of Musk’s artificial intelligence startup, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal citing anonymous sources. Liberatore was hired in April and reportedly left in late July. The reasons for his departure are not known, but he followed other high-profile exits from xAI of late. The company did not immediately respond to my request for comment.\nBefore joining xAI, Liberatore worked at Airbnb for almost nine years—most recently as VP of finance and corporate development—and had previously served in several business unit CFO roles. He’s also worked at Intel, eBay, and PayPal. During his brief tenure at xAI, he reportedly helped raise $10 billion in funding and expanded data center operations.\nLaunched by Musk in July 2023, xAI is a competitor of OpenAI. Both companies develop large language models and AI assistants—OpenAI with ChatGPT, xAI with Grok—that target overlapping user bases.\nLiberatore’s departure follows a wave of exits, including cofounder Igor Babuschkin (who left to start a VC firm focused on AI safety), General Counsel Robert Keele after one year, and senior lawyer Raghu Rao. xAI’s leadership is highly centralized under Musk, with no publicly disclosed independent board.\nMichael Morris, a professor at Columbia Business School, shared his assessment with me. He noted that Keele cited differences in worldview with Musk and family priorities in his LinkedIn post about leaving. Of course, Musk also played a key role in the Trump White House earlier this year.\nMorris also observed that executive turnover among Musk’s direct reports at Tesla is 44%, compared to about 9% at Meta, Amazon, and Netflix; overall, Tesla’s executive turnover rate is 27%, nearly double the industry average.\n“Analysts point to Musk’s demanding, high-contact leadership style—managing up to 18 direct reports at once—as a key reason for the trend,” Morris said. “This pattern is visible not only at Tesla but also at X and xAI, suggesting structural factors rather than isolated events.”\nHe added that many executives leave rather than risk being blamed when new initiatives encounter regulatory hurdles: “Executives don’t want to become the ‘fall guy.’”\nWhat fuels mass exits?\nxAI isn’t alone in seeing mass executive departures. Last year, OpenAI also saw multiple senior departures—such as cofounder John Schulman and CTO Mira Murati. Also in 2024, at the DNA testing startup 23andMe, all seven independent directors resigned simultaneously, citing major disagreements with CEO Anne Wojcicki and her plans to take the company private.", "content_hash": "40f37b2e78d15b9510890ef5a1213582", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

If purchased via stablecoins, fees would be $0.50 or much lower - a huge spread.\nThat’s the opportunity that Stripe sees, and they’re clearly moving quickly.\nTheir advantage here is their purpose-built chain (along with their laundry list of launch partners and beta testers).\nMany of today’s big chains were optimized for trading, while Tempo optimizes for payments, the largest real-world use case for crypto.\nIf it works, on-chain dollars become the default rail for payouts and commerce.\nAnd that’s a boon for the broader crypto space. More stablecoins grow the overall crypto pie and bring more users on-chain.\nBut it doesn’t necessarily mean your favorite L1 blockchain’s token is going to go up in price…\n🌎 Macro Crypto and Memes\nA few Crypto and Web3 headlines that caught my eye:\n- Crypto majors are mostly even with BTC leading; BTC +1% at $112,300, ETH even at $4,420, XRP even at $2.84, SOL -1% at $207\n- M (+26%), PUMP (+10%) and XDC (+5%) led top movers\n- The Bitcoin ETFs saw $220M in net outflows on Thursday, breaking a big 2-day inflow streak; the ETH ETFs saw $167M in net outflows\n- The SEC set a pro-crypto agenda, unveiling rulemakings to define digital-asset offers/sales and ease listings on U.S. exchanges\n- Stripe + Paradigm revealed their Tempo blockchain aimed at low-cost stablecoin settlement with partners including Visa, Deutsche Bank, OpenAI\n- Kraken announced a buyout of Breakout, planning to integrate the trader-native platform into Kraken Pro\n- WLFI blacklisted Justin Sun's address from selling his 595M unlocked tokens, citing activity concerns that broke WLFI rules (WLFI +15% since the news)\n- Gary Gensler’s text messages from Oct 2022 to Sept 2023 have been “lost” according to a recent audit\nIn Corporate Treasuries\n- Crypto treasury stocks slumped after the Nasdaq announced heightened scrutiny of equity raises to fund crypto purchases\n- Public firms now hold over 1,000,000 BTC (~$110B) led by Strategy at ~636K BTC\n- American Bitcoin stock fell below its IPO price in trading Thursday\nIn Memes\n- Memecoin leaders are slightly green on the day; DOGE +1%, Shiba +1%, PEPE +1%, PENGU -1%, BONK +2%, TRUMP +1%, SPX +4%, and FARTCOIN -1%\n- NEET (+20%), BITTY (+30%), SPARK (+15%) and TOKABU (+13%) led onchain movers\n💰 Token, Airdrop & Protocol Tracker\nHere's a rundown of major token, protocol and airdrop news from the day:\n- Pump Fun did another $12M in buybacks over the past week, representing 98% of their revenue\n- Myriad announced two new UX enhancements, including direct sign-in w/ MetaMask, Rabby & Rainbow wallets and easier bridging directly within Myriad, along with confirmation that USDC predictions will \"be considered at TGE\"\n- Arbitrum launched DRIP, its $40M DeFi incentive program, targeting leveraged looping with 24M ARB in rewards\n- Fireblocks launched a stablecoin payments network, connecting 40+ participants to streamline B2B stablecoin flows\n🤖 AI x Crypto\nSection dedicated to headlines in the AI sector of crypto:\n- Overall market cap even at $12.7B, leaders were mixed\n- FARTCOIN (-1%), VIRTUAL (+1%), TIBBIR (+5%), aixbt (+3%) & ai16z (+1%)\n- VADER (+33%) and VIRGEN (+22%) led top movers\n🚚 What is happening in NFTs?\nHere is the list of other notable headlines from the day in NFTs:\n- ETH NFT leaders were mixed; Punks +2% at 48.9 ETH, Pudgy -1% at 9.8, BAYC -1% at 9.1 ETH\n- HV-MTL up 230% were a notable top mover\n- Abstract NFTs were mostly red, led by Roach Racing (+7%)\n- Pudgy Penguins announced that OpenSea will be its official home, along with the PENGU token\n- The Pudgy Party soulbound token can now be claimed inside MetaMask portfolio\n- NFL All Day revamped its collector experience, rolling out verified digital autographed rookie highlight moments and partnering with four NFL teams on in-person activations to onboard more fans", "content_hash": "b1d6045bfafe48ff5b5802522276af48", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The company acquired stablecoin infrastructure firm Bridge for $1.1 billion and crypto wallet developer Privy, creating end-to-end payment solutions spanning wallets, stablecoins, and now blockchain processing infrastructure.\nStripe’s Crypto Stack Completion Strategy\nStripe’s blockchain development completes a comprehensive crypto infrastructure buildout that began with strategic acquisitions.\nThe Bridge acquisition provided stablecoin payment capabilities across 70 countries, while Privy added wallet infrastructure for seamless user onboarding.\nThe company initially supported Bitcoin transactions in 2014 before halting crypto services due to network inefficiencies.\nStripe rebuilt its blockchain team in 2021 and accelerated initiatives throughout 2024 following regulatory clarity brought by the Trump administration.\nStablecoin Financial Accounts launched across 101 countries, enabling companies to hold and transact digital dollars.\nThe platform currently supports Circle’s USDC and Bridge’s USDB tokens with plans for stablecoin neutrality across Tempo.\nEarlier this year, Stripe partnered with Ramp to launch stablecoin-backed corporate cards, which aim to address cross-border payment delays and currency volatility.\nThe cards were initially deployed in Latin American markets before expanding to Europe, Africa, and Asia.\nCEO Patrick Collison has previously testified to Congress that Stripe sees “meaningful business interest in stablecoins as the underlying technology has matured.”\nThe GENIUS Act’s federal regulatory framework spurred corporate adoption across the billion-dollar stablecoin sector.\nTempo enables Stripe to capture transaction processing revenue directly rather than paying fees to external networks.\nParticularly, the company’s extensive merchant network spanning millions of businesses worldwide perfectly positions Tempo for rapid adoption through existing payment flows.\nFinancial Giants Race Into the Blockchain Industry\nThe stablecoin sector experienced explosive growth following regulatory clarity, with market capitalization exceeding $288 billion.\nIn fact, among many others, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse projects the growth of the stablecoin market to around $1-2 trillion.\nAmid the corporate adoption race, MetaMask announced plans earlier last month to launch “MetaMask USD” through Stripe’s payment infrastructure.\nThe proposal builds on the M⁰ network, which has regulatory backing and fiat reserves.\nWestern Union has also announced pilot programs in South America and Africa for stablecoin-powered remittances.\nJust yesterday, Ripple announced its extension of its US dollar-backed stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD), into Africa.\nApproximately 20 million addresses now transact stablecoins on public blockchains.\nRecognizing this massive growth potential, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller noted that 99% of stablecoin market capitalization is tied to the US dollar.\nHe believes “stablecoins can keep the dollar the world’s reserve currency” by increasing global accessibility.\nLooking forward, Tempo’s validator set will begin with independent, diverse participants before transitioning toward permissionless validation.\nThe blockchain maintains neutrality regarding stablecoin issuers, allowing any compliant stablecoin to be used for payments and gas fees.\n- New ChatGPT AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Avalanche and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana and Pepe by the End of 2025\n- Perplexity AI Predicts the Price of XRP, World Liberty Financial and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Why Is Crypto Down Today? – September 4, 2025\n- XRP Price Prediction: Gaming Giant Expands to XRP Ledger – Shocking Move to $10 Starting Now\n- New ChatGPT AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Avalanche and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana and Pepe by the End of 2025\n- Perplexity AI Predicts the Price of XRP, World Liberty Financial and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Why Is Crypto Down Today? – September 4, 2025\n- XRP Price Prediction: Gaming Giant Expands to XRP Ledger – Shocking Move to $10 Starting Now", "content_hash": "2348bb8a6d02d0c99aaa2ed251dc0ef8", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

As a result, 4Q/4Q growth increases to 1.5%,” BofA analysts wrote in their latest U.S. Economic Weekly note.\nThe bank said the labour market remains the key downside risk, though it argued that “supply factors explain much of the recent slowdown.”\nAt the same time, inflation pressures are expected to persist. “Core PCE inflation should get stuck in the low 3s for about a year,” BofA said, adding that long-end rates could rise if the Federal Reserve cuts rates in such an environment, “indicating a policy mistake.”\nBofA highlighted that the ISM indexes rose in August, consistent with its view of a rebound in the second half of the year, though auto sales slipped to 16.1 million after a July surge tied to expiring EV tax credits.\nAnalysts described their “cautious optimism” as premised on labour market resilience, calling today’s August jobs report “pivotal.”\nLooking ahead, BofA expects August CPI and PPI to each rise 0.3 percent month-on-month, with core CPI running at 3.1 percent year-on-year. “Based on this, we currently expect Aug core PCE to advance to 3.0%,” it said.\nRelated articles\nBofA lifts U.S. Q3 growth view to 1.5% on stronger consumption\n8 Warren Buffett-Backed Stocks to Navigate September Volatility\nApollo economist warns: AI bubble now bigger than 1990s tech mania", "content_hash": "fcc943960f3615b1697220a4c1934283", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for payrolls to rise by 75,000.\nThe report showed a marked slowdown from the July increase of 79,000, which was revised up by 6,000. Revisions also showed a net loss of 13,000 in June after the prior estimate was lowered by 27,000.\n\"The job market is stalling short of the runway,\" said Daniel Zhao, chief economist at jobs site Glassdoor. \"The labor market is losing lift, and August's report, along with downward revisions, suggests we're heading into turbulence without the soft landing achieved.\"\nMarkets largely disregarded the report, with stocks up at the open and Treasury yields sharply lower. Traders in the futures markets raised the probability of a quarter percentage point Fed rate cut to 100% and went even further, pricing in a 12% probability of a half-point move, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge.\nThe payrolls count was the first since President Donald Trump fired former BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following the release of the July jobs report a month ago. The move came after the report showed not just a weak level of job creation but also dramatic reductions in previous months' totals.\nIn McEntarfer's place, the president nominated economist E.J. Antoni, a Trump loyalist from the Heritage Foundation who previously had criticized the BLS numbers as being politically distorted. William Wiatrowski is serving as acting BLS commissioner.\nWhile the pace of hiring was slow, average hourly earnings increased 0.3% for the month, meeting the estimate, though the annual gain of 3.7% was slightly below the forecast for 3.8%.\nHiring was held back by a payroll reduction in the federal government, which reported a decline of 15,000.\nHealth care again led sectors, adding 31,000 jobs, while social assistance contributed 16,000. Wholesale trade and manufacturing both saw declines of 12,000 on the month.\nThe report comes as markets widely expect the Fed to lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point when it releases its next decision Sept. 17. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his fellow policymakers also have been under heavy criticism from the president as they have been on hold since last cutting in December 2024.\nThough most economic indicators indicate continued expansion, Fed officials have expressed concern about a slowdown in hiring even as layoffs have held fairly steady. At the same time, policymakers worry that Trump's tariffs could reignite inflation, with data indicating a slow but steady increase in prices over recent months.\n\"The warning bell that rang in the labor market a month ago just got louder. A weaker-than-expected jobs report all but seals a 25-basis-point rate cut later this month,\" said Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings. \"Four straight months of manufacturing job losses stand out. It's hard to argue that tariff uncertainty isn't a key driver of this weakness.\"\nWhile the establishment survey showed weak job creation, the more volatile household count, used to calculate the unemployment rate, held better news.\nThat report showed an increase of 288,000 employed, though the ranks of the unemployed also rose by 148,000. The labor force participation rate edged higher to 62.3% while the labor force swelled by 436,000, accounting for the tick higher in the unemployment rate.\nA broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons climbed to 8.1%, a 0.2 percentage point increase and the highest level since October 2021.\nAlong with the jobs numbers tally, the BLS on Tuesday will release the initial estimate for annual benchmark revisions to the numbers dating back one year from March 2025.\nRevisions have been a source of controversy, particularly in the post-Covid era as the response rate has declined, particularly for the headline establishment survey that asks businesses and government agencies to detail the pace of hiring.\nThe BLS typically releases its initial estimate with the first batch of survey responses it gets, then updates two times as it gets more information. However, Trump has accused the BLS of being politically biased. The firing of McEntarfer drew widespread criticism in the economics and markets community.\nIn a CNBC interview, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said he expects the August payrolls count to get revised higher. In the past three years, the initial August count actually was revised lower from the initial estimate.\nCorrection: The BLS on Tuesday will release the initial estimate for annual benchmark revisions to the numbers dating back one year from March 2025.

It would also give Musk increased voting power over the EV maker and aspiring robotics titan, which he has publicly demanded since early 2024.\nTesla Chairwoman Robyn Denholm told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin the plan was designed to keep the CEO \"motivated and focused on delivering for the company.\"\n\"If he performs, if he hits the super ambitious milestones that are in the plan then he gets equity — it's 1% for each half a trillion dollars of market cap, plus operational milestones he has to hit in order to do that,\" Denholm said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\nThe full award would give Musk more than 423 million additional shares. He currently holds about a 13% stake in the company.\nDenholm confirmed that the Tesla CEO pay plan, if approved by shareholders, would not put any limit on where and how Musk spends his time or require him to spend any minimum number of hours per week on Tesla business.\nTo obtain the first award in the plan, Musk and Tesla would need to almost double their current market cap to reach $2 trillion. The final benchmark is reaching an $8.5 trillion market cap.\nThe operational milestones in the 2025 CEO Performance Award include: 20 million Tesla vehicles delivered, 10 million active FSD Subscriptions, 1 million robots delivered, 1 million Robotaxis in commercial operation and a series of adjusted EBITDA benchmarks.\nMusk has remained politically embroiled, while also running a collection of companies, including aerospace and defense contractor SpaceX, drilling venture The Boring Company, health tech company Neuralink and the artificial intelligence venture, xAI, which has merged with his social network, X.\nTesla also said in the filing Friday that it will ask shareholders at the Nov. 6 meeting to vote on whether the company should invest in Musk's newest venture, xAI.\nMusk first floated the idea publicly with an informal poll on X last July, asking whether Tesla should invest $5 billion into xAI.\nFounded in early 2023 in Nevada, xAI merged with Musk's social network X earlier this year. The company now operates a massive data center in Memphis, and plans to build out another facility there to help train and run its large language models and a chatbot called Grok.\nPay plan controversy\nThe new pay proposal for Musk comes after the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled last year that his 2018 pay plan was excessive, had been improperly granted by the Tesla board and must be rescinded.\nIn that case, Tornetta v. Musk, a judge found that the Tesla CEO had controlled pay negotiations at the automaker, and his board of directors failed to give shareholders information that they were legally entitled to before telling them they should vote to approve Musk's performance-based pay plan.\nThe case is now on appeal.", "content_hash": "09f593d3e7974c4e760a806746de481c", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

He added that the order increased Broadcom's forecast for AI revenue next year, when shipments will begin.\nAnalysts at Mizuho, Cantor Fitzgerald and KeyBanc all said they think AI startup OpenAI is the customer. The Financial Times reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the partnership, that the two companies co-designed a chip that will hit the market next year.\nOpenAI declined to comment on the report.\nWhile Broadcom doesn't name its large web-scale customers, analysts have said dating back to last year that its first three clients were Google, Meta and TikTok parent ByteDance.\n\"During the call, the company surprised us by noting that it had secured a $10B order from a fourth XPU customer (we believe this is OpenAI), adding significant upside to the company's three current XPU customers (Google, Meta, and ByteDance),\" analysts at Cantor wrote in a note late Thursday. \"Shipments are expected to commence in 2026.\"\nBroadcom's stock has been on a tear of late as the company has joined Nvidia at the front of the race to build the kinds of processors and infrastructures needed for massive AI workloads. The stock is up about 130% in the past year, lifting Broadcom's market cap past $1.6 trillion.\nFor the fiscal third quarter, Broadcom reported earnings and revenue that topped estimates. The company said it expects $17.4 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, higher than the $17.02 billion expected by Wall Street analysts, with AI revenue reaching $6.2 billion.\nBut news of an incoming $10 billion customer is what got Wall Street excited.\nTan said on the call that \"immediate and fairly substantial demand\" boosts the outlook for next year, \"and really changes our thinking of what 2026 would be starting to look like.\"\nThe company didn't provide specific guidance for next year, but Tan suggested that growth in its AI could be above the 50% to 60% range he'd offered in the prior call.\nAnalysts at Mizuho raised their AI revenue growth estimate for next year to 76% up from about 60%, which would bring the total to $35 billion. Total revenue for the year ending in October 2026 is expected to increase about 30% to $81.8 billion from $63.1 billion this fiscal year, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG.\nIn addition to hardware, Broadcom has a large software business, keyed by its $61 billion acquisition of server virtualization software vendor VMware in 2023.

But maybe there is not enough planning among investors about what they should do to preserve the hefty gains embedded in market portfolios since the April low gave way to a new S&P 500 record. A rate cut is typically seen as a good thing for stocks, but a weakening labor market is also a sign that broader trouble for the economy could be ahead.\nGlobal equities are at all-time highs, 401(k) and IRA millionaire account numbers have surged to their own record, flows into equity ETFs are picking up, and investor sentiment data is getting \"a little hotter,\" according to Strategas Securities' technical strategist Todd Sohn, all signs that there could be a tipping point ahead for the market where bullishness becomes its own sign of overconfidence. But in Sohn's view, we're not there yet. September has had some rocky trading days already, and its long-term track record as a market month going back decades is not good, but \"the real lull,\" if it comes, will happen further into Q4, he said.\n\"That's when people can get hit with a speed bump like April, maybe not as quick or as big of a drawdown,\" Sohn shared on this week's \"ETF Edge.\" But he stressed that there are \"no signs of massive risk yet.\"\nThe market initially headed higher on Friday to yet another new record as traders bet a rate cut is coming, but then gave up those gains.\nFed chair Jerome Powell has himself signaled that a rate cut may be ahead, but that isn't really signaling anything the market didn't already know, and according to Bryant VanCronkhite, Allspring Global Investments' senior portfolio manager and co-head of its special global equity team — who joined Sohn on \"ETF Edge\" — the market may be overpricing the odds of a Fed rate cut even with the weakening labor market. Inflation, with core CPI at 3.1% in July, remains \"safely above target,\" he said — a reference to the Fed's longstanding policy approach of aiming for 2% inflation — and the uncertainty related to tariff impact on prices throughout the economy gives the Fed more reason to wait for more data before committing to a big change in policy.\nThat's a long way of saying that given the wiggle room still possible within the Fed's timing for a cut, and the uncertain economic outlook tied to the trade war, VanCronkhite and Sohn both say it is a good time for investors to take a look at defensive options with the stock market that may be underrepresented in their portfolios. It doesn't mean a major change in how an overall portfolio is constructed, but some tweaks on the edges to insulate overall returns from any damage that could be in the cards for the recent equity winners. They broke down that analysis into a few key points for investors to consider.\n1. Nothing new here, but you're portfolio still likely has too much tech\nFor years, investors have been warned that mega-cap tech stocks have become too dominant in the cap-weighted S&P 500, and that problem has not gone away, with Sohn noting that the weighting of the top eight mega-cap stocks is now close to 40% of the index (in an index of 500 stocks). The tech sector, as a whole, is currently 31% of the index as measured by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF.\nNvidia, the biggest of them all, was lower on Friday, its sixth losing day out of the last 7, and on track for its worst week since April, and fourth-consecutive losing week, according to CNBC data.\nSohn says the first step in dealing with tech concentration risk is for investors to make sure they don't have a core stock market index fund in addition to a large-cap growth and tech fund, which in the end, are all more or less replicating the same exposure and risk profile. If there is any tilt in the future to value stocks, that composition of a portfolio will exacerbate the pain for investors.\nIt should be said, this warning has been issued for years and the mega-cap, tech-led stock market has mostly continued up and to the right. Nevertheless, it makes sense to evaluate a portfolio's overall concentration risk with the prospect of major changes in rate policy and overall economic conditions ahead. So, where to look?\n2. Value and defensive stocks have been left behind, and that leaves opportunity ahead\nSohn and VanCronkhite both say that heading into 2026 it makes sense for investors to reposition ahead of any tilt in the market cycle towards value. \"Maybe not the bulk of a portfolio,\" Sohn said, but from his technical lens on the market, looking at the stocks and sectors that have not participated in the recent gains, corners of the stock market that have, in effect, been in their own bear market or stuck in a narrow trading range over the past few years. Sohn says that \"leaves us with lots of opportunities away from tech.\"\n\"Now is the time to begin shifting and broadening exposure,\" said VanCronkhite. \"Take some capital out of the past winners, like tech and financials,\" he said.\n3. Where exactly to move market money, starting with health care\nSohn said there has been \"absolutely no demand for defensives\" like healthcare, and VanCronkhite pointed to industrials and materials.\n\"Buy something different\" from among the \"desolate\" sectors of the market, Sohn said, adding that transports and small-caps are, on a relative basis at least, at attractive valuations.\nHealth care, in particular, is a focus for both ETF strategists. It has also been a recent focus for Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.\nWhile there are significant political and cyclical issues for the health care sector, VanCronkhite described it as \"being ignored\" right now by the market.\n\"There has been a mass exodus from health care,\" said Sohn, referring to flows out of the health care sector as its performance relative to the S&P 500 has hit \"bottom-decile\" on a historical basis. As a result, it would be \"hard to get much worse for health care,\" he said.\nSohn conceded that for health care to do better, the current market leaders will need to do worse. There won't be any \"sustained\" move in health care without a cost for \"everything else.\" He is not betting that there is any wholesale move into health care anytime soon because that would require a breakdown in the broader market. But he says it still makes sense \"as a differentiation hedge going forward, especially because no one is there.\"\nWatch the video above to learn more about the ETF experts' views on defensive positions.

The ticketing data in this CNBC report was sourced from that document.\nThe NFL requires every team to give 34% of ticket revenue and the licensing amount of a club seat to the league based on an internal formula, according to several NFL executives who asked to remain unnamed so they could speak freely about private conversations. This pool, known as the visiting team's share, or VTS, is mostly redistributed equally among the 32 teams. In 2024, each team received $27 million, up from $25 million the previous year, according to the league executives.\nStory continues after interactive chart.\nThe VTS money not redistributed is used by the NFL to fund league-level lending programs that go toward the private financing of new stadiums and renovations. Some teams are granted waivers by the NFL on a portion of their VTS contribution if they are using stadium revenue to finance construction or renovations. The Las Vegas Raiders and Los Angeles Rams, for example, received waivers of $23.4 million and $12.2 million, respectively, for their new stadiums, according to the NFL executives.\nThe league's 32 teams collected an average of $433 million in national revenue in 2024 from media, licensing and sponsorship agreements, said the executives.

It will sideline major store renovations and development in the meantime.\nWhile the changes will vary based on the location, expect more seating, dark wood paneling and other tweaks that make its cafes cozier. The renovations will also include changes like less harsh lighting that won't affect customers with light sensitivity.\n\"We're uplifting more than 1,000 coffeehouses over the next year, blending our global heritage with local relevance to create spaces that are immersive, inclusive, and deeply human,\" Dawn Clark, Starbucks senior vice president of coffeehouse design and concepts, said in a statement to CNBC.\n\"Whether it's the laid-back warmth of the Palisades or the urban energy of Manhattan, intentional design encourages customers to stay longer, connect more, and return often — and translates into meaningful business impact,\" Clark said.\nStarbucks is planning to spend about $150,000 on each \"uplift,\" without closing the stores down. The company started with locations in New York, followed by cafes in Southern California.\nThe makeovers are intended to make the stores more welcoming, returning Starbucks to its prior status as a \"third place\" for customers to hang out between home and work. In recent years, Starbucks had lost that reputation, fueled by decisions like removing seats as mobile ordering become popular and getting rid of outlets to discourage lingering.\nUnder CEO Brian Niccol, the chain plans to reverse many of those decisions as it tries to break a sales slump. For example, he previously told employees in June that he plans to add back the 30,000 seats that had been removed from cafes.\nBut trying to appeal to a wider swath of customers isn't new for the company. Starbucks first unveiled an accessible store design in early 2024, before Niccol's tenure. At the time, the company said that the design took about two years and included input from baristas.\nTake a look inside a recently renovated New York City cafe near Manhattan's Union Square.\nBefore the renovation, the location lacked many decorative touches, besides some large-scale photos of the chain's Hacienda Alsacia, its coffee and research farm in Costa Rica.\nWith such sparse seating, the cafe's concrete floors were more obvious. Harsh lighting didn't help the store's appearance either.\nThe location now features much more seating near the entrance. Leather accents to the wraparound booth make the seats more comfortable. The tables are easily movable and at an accessible height for wheelchair users.\nStarbucks also brought back the electrical outlets that disappeared in prior makeovers. Now customers who want to study or work from the location can charge their laptops or phones, encouraging them to stay longer.\nLarge area rugs bring a cozy touch, in addition to dampening some of the cafe's ambient noise. Live plants also add to the homey vibe of the space.\nHigh-top tables, positioned closer to the barista bar, offer a seating option for customers looking to sit down with companions. The makeover adds 16 more seats to the location.\nStarbucks also changed out its lightbulbs to soften the store's lighting and reduce glare, giving it a warmer atmosphere. The improved lighting helps highlight an existing mural, seen on the right of the photo above.\nBehind the barista bar, the company added a large shelving unit that highlights bags of its coffee, plus decorative burlap sacks that hold beans. Touches of purple are a nod to the nearby New York University.\nCustomers waiting to pick up their drinks can sit off to the side. Previously, the area was a standing bar that wasn't accessible to wheelchair users.\nIn addition to adding rugs, Starbucks also improved the location's overall insulation to cut down on the clamor of a busy coffee shop. For baristas, the change means that conversations among customers are less likely to disturb their work, whether that's hearing an order correctly or focusing on making a latte.", "content_hash": "d6decec73068e181c917c3e83fd6eca7", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The market, however, turned modestly lower later in the morning as investors tried to balance concerns about a slowing labor market with hopes for Fed rate cuts. \"Rates are going lower,\" Jim said, predicting a different scenario than a year ago when the Fed cut rates three times, starting in September 2024, and bond yields went up. \"This time, I think they cut [and] the long end goes down,\" including mortgage rates, according to Jim, who has stood firm on the notion that 30-year fixed-rate mortgages need to fall below 6.5% to stimulate the housing market. \"That's why the housing stocks had a move yesterday that indicated that you are going to see a gigantic explosion in housing stocks,\" Jim said. \"Home Depot was the star of the show, and that made sense to me because they told you this time is for real.\" Jim was referring to positive comments about business in the back half of the year, alongside the home improvement giant's earnings report.

HD YTD mountain Home Depot YTD Shares of Home Depot were on a three-session winning streak to start the month of September after they gained nearly 11% in August.

Gross margin decreased 1.1 percentage points to 58.5%, and operating margin decreased 210 basis points to 20.7%.\nChief Financial Officer Meghan Frank said on the call that the removal of the de minimis exemption, which excluded some smaller shipments from tariffs, will significantly affect the company, representing roughly 1.7 percentage points of the 2.2 percentage-point tariff-related decline in profit expected for the year.\nSame-store sales in the Americas were down 4%.

Lululemon said it added 14 net new stores during the second quarter, bringing its total to 784 stores.\n\"My view is that it's now time to reset many of our practices related to how we develop and create the range of products that will fuel the next phase of our growth,\" McDonald said Thursday. \"We have seen that when we get our product right, everything else can follow.\"\nLululemon projects third-quarter revenue will come in between $2.47 billion and $2.50 billion compared to Wall Street estimates of $2.57 billion.

In other words, when they underperform their benchmark, that underperformance is relatively large.\nConversely, active managers generally fare better in less liquid areas of the market, like fixed income, real estate, and small-cap and emerging-market stocks, Armour said.\nFor example, 43% of actively managed high-yield bond mutual funds and ETFs beat their index counterparts in the past 10-year period, according to Morningstar.\nFees are the key\nFees are the key driver of index funds' success when compared to active funds, Armour said.\nIndex funds carry a 0.11% average asset-weighted annual fee, while active funds carry a 0.59% fee, according to Morningstar.\nActive funds need to have higher relative returns just to overcome that fee differential.\nBeyond that, higher fees also eat into investor earnings. For example, an investor with $100,000 who earns 4% per year and pays a 0.25% fund fee would have $208,000 after 20 years, while the same investor paying a 1% fee would have $179,000, or $29,000 less, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSince index funds own all the securities in a broad market index, they are guaranteed to own the relative winners and losers. While active managers may own more of the winners than their index counterparts, they also risk missing out, Armour said.\nMany active managers took risk off the table in April when President Donald Trump first announced so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs, but the market then proceeded to rebound quickly, Armour said.", "content_hash": "c2a9d0a6130efefe94053158e8e00dbe", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The agreement reached in July had included Japan purchasing 100 Boeing planes, 75% higher imports of U.S. rice and $8 billion worth of agricultural and crop products.\nWashington will apply a baseline 15% tariff on nearly all Japanese imports, with separate sector-specific levies for automobiles and parts (also 15%), aerospace products, generic pharmaceutical goods and natural resources, according to the executive order.\nThe Thursday order prevents Trump's country-specific tariffs on top of existing levies. The lower tariffs will apply retroactively to Japanese goods \"entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 7, 2025,\" the order stated. The tariff relief on automobiles is set to take effect after seven days.\nTrump's global tariff campaign has thrown the global supply chain into disarray, in particular Japan's massive auto sector. Last month, Toyota warned that it expected a hit of nearly $10 billion as Trump's tariffs on autos weighed on its sales to the U.S., forcing it to slash by 16% its forecast for full-year operating profits.\nTariffs are expected to hit rivals as well, with Ford's pre-tax adjusted profit reportedly set to drop $3 billion while GM projects $4 billion to $5 billion hit for the year.\nJapan's top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, who was in Washington, delivered a letter from Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba inviting Trump to visit his country, Kyoto News reported. The Japanese official had reportedly canceled his trip to the U.S. last month as some sticking points required \"further technical discussion.\"\nPolitical tides\nThe finalizing of the deal came as political pressure for the Japanese leader mounts at home. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party earlier this week released a long-awaited report on why it lost seats in the upper house election in July.\nThe report ascribed the loss to the lack of appeal for the party's measures aimed at taming inflation, previous political scandals and weak mobilization of young voters.\nLocal media reports suggested many key members of the LDP have signaled their intention to resign to the prime minister, while Ishiba has said he intends to stay on amid calls within his party for choosing another leader.\nThough the reports have avoided naming individuals, they signal an \"implicit indictment of Ishiba's leadership of the party,\" said James Brady, vice president at political consultancy Teneo.\nAnalysts at Eurasia Group suggested in a report Friday that Ishiba is unlikely to survive a challenge from within the party next Monday, when a vote on whether to bring forward a leadership election is expected to take place.\n\"Ishiba's poor performance as party leader in lower and upper house elections and events in recent days, including former prime minister Aso Taro announcing his support for the special election, have turned the tide against Ishiba,\" analysts said, predicting a 60% odd of Ishiba's defeat in the election, with him possibly resigning before the vote takes place as internal discontent grows.", "content_hash": "f6d82ea4737a68384b0cbe9cbf00590e", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Kennedy Jr. doubled down on false claims about vaccines and claimed he isn't limiting access to Covid shots during his Senate testimony on Thursday, as senators grilled him on his sweeping changes to immunization policy and federal health agencies.\nKennedy said he supports a statement made by a newly appointed member of a key government vaccine panel that mRNA vaccines pose a dangerous risk to people. Numerous studies have demonstrated that shots using mRNA technology, including Covid vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, are safe and effective, and serious side effects have happened in extremely rare cases.\nSen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., noted that the committee member, Dr. Retsef Levi, has said that evidence is mounting that mRNA vaccines cause \"serious harm, including death, especially among young people,\" apparently referring to a post pinned on Levi's X account. Kennedy appointed Levi to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine recommendations and insurance coverage.\nKennedy said he wasn't aware of Levi's comments, but added, \"I agree with it.\"\nHe also claimed that anyone could get a Covid booster shot, while also acknowledging that access \"depends on the state\" and that the government no longer recommends the vaccines for healthy people.\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved a fresh round of Covid shots with new limits, only clearing them for adults aged 65 and older and people with a medical condition that puts them at risk of a severe illness. The CDC and its vaccine panel will decide who to recommend the shots to later this month.\n\"I'm not taking them away from people,\" Kennedy said, referring to the vaccines.\nBut Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., argued that not everyone can walk into a pharmacy and get a Covid shot now.\nThe FDA's new limits have complicated Covid shot access in the U.S., which now depends on a patient's age and risk level, laws and policies in their state, insurance coverage, and health-care provider. Pending CDC guidance, some pharmacies have added prescription requirements for Covid vaccines in certain states.\n\"You clearly are taking away vaccines,\" she said after a prolonged shouting match with Kennedy.\nKennedy's comments before the Senate Finance Committee come after he repeatedly promised the panel in January that he would do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it more difficult or discourages people from taking vaccines. Since then, he has canceled funding for mRNA shot development and made other vaccine policy changes that could limit access to immunizations, including gutting the CDC vaccine panel and dropping Covid shot recommendations for certain groups.\nHis comments also follow a leadership shake-up at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The White House last week fired CDC Director Susan Monarez, and four senior agency officials resigned shortly after, with some of them citing the politicization of the agency and a threat to public health. In an opinion piece on Thursday, Monarez accused Kennedy of \"a deliberate effort to weaken America's public-health system and vaccine protections.\"\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X in support of Kennedy on Thursday, writing that he \"is taking flak because he's over the target\" and saying Democrats were attacking the Trump administration's \"commonsense effort.\"\nKennedy touted skepticism around Covid vaccines, despite evidence of their safety and effectiveness.\n\"We were told again and again the vaccines would prevent transmission, they prevent infection. It wasn't true. They knew it from the start,\" Kennedy said.\nHe also said he does not know how many people died of Covid and whether the vaccines prevented deaths from the virus.\n\"I would like to see the data and talk about the data,\" Kennedy said.\nBut data is readily available from dozens of studies. One paper in August estimates that Covid vaccines saved more than 2 million lives, mostly among older adults, worldwide between 2020 and October 2024.\nThe CDC website also says that Covid vaccines from the 2023 to 2024 season reduced the risk of severe illness from Covid by almost 70% in the first two months after vaccination in adults ages 18 and older, with protection gradually declining over time.\nThose shots also decreased the risk of hospitalization due to Covid by around 50% in the first two months of vaccination in that same population. The Covid vaccines showed similar benefits in older adults.\nKennedy also defended his decision to fire all 17 previous members of the CDC vaccine panel, saying he didn't politicize the committee.\n\"What we did is we got rid of the conflicts of interest. ... We depoliticized and put great scientists on it from a very diverse group,\" the HHS secretary said. \"They are very, very pro-vaccine.\"\nBut a new analysis published last month from USC researchers found that conflicts of interest on that panel had been at \"historic lows for years\" before Kennedy restacked it with new members, some of whom are widely known vaccine critics.\nCorrection: Kennedy testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday.

During the visit, Altman said India was OpenAI's second-largest market by number of users.\nHe has subsequently said that AI adoption in India is \"amazing to watch.\"\n\"We love to see the explosion of creativity--india is outpacing the world,\" he said on X earlier this year.\nIndia is one of ChatGPT's fastest-growing markets globally, Nick Patience, practice lead for AI at tech research and analysis firm Futurum Group, told CNBC. \"OpenAI's India focus is a strategic move to gain a competitive edge,\" he added.\nHere's a rundown of how OpenAI is expanding in India.\nChatGPT explosion\nChatGPT, OpenAI's core product, has seen strong growth in India. The app was downloaded 10.2 million times in India in August, a huge jump from the 2.5 million downloads seen during the same month last year, according to analytics firm Appfigures.\nSince its launch, ChatGPT has 111 million downloads in India, ahead of its 80 million downloads in the U.S, Appfigures data shows.\nDownloads do not necessarily equal daily or monthly users, but the figures emphasise OpenAI's growth trajectory in the country.\nThe download numbers are also far ahead of rivals, including Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude. The closest challenger was Perplexity, Appfigures said, which had 6.4 million downloads in August.\nIndia-specific product\nUser spending on ChatGPT has been increasing. To date, Indian users have spent $21.3 million on ChatGPT, Appfigures data shows. In comparison, U.S. users have spent $784 million.\nThat underlines the fact that while the number of users in India is huge, it remains a price-sensitive market.\nTo address this, OpenAI in August launched ChatGPT Go, a low-cost 399-rupees-($4.53)-a-month plan for its AI app.\n\"It's a classic wedge strategy to capture a price-sensitive market and build a user base that will be difficult for local players to dislodge later,\" Futurum Group's Patience said of the strategy.\nInfrastructure and hiring\nAccording to Bloomberg, OpenAI is scouting a location in India for a data center with at least 1-gigawatt capacity. The facility will be part of OpenAI's Stargate-branded infrastructure push, Bloomberg said this week, although CNBC was unable to verify the report.\nThe ChatGPT developer said last month that it would open a local office in the market and is currently advertising three sales roles in India.\nIt also announced last month an education program in India that will include funding for research and provide half a million ChatGPT licenses for educators and students across the country.\nIndia challenges\nWhile India doesn't have a home-grown artificial intelligence company as big as OpenAI, there are some challengers in the form of domestic startups, including Sarvam AI and Krutrim, and other American tech giants like Google and Meta.\nContinued geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and India over trade, however, have the potential to cause complications if there's any backlash from New Delhi against American tech firms.\nOpenAI is also locked in a legal battle with Asian News International in India, which has accused the ChatGPT developer of using copyrighted material illegally. It's a closely-watched case in the country for how copyright laws apply in the AI era.\n\"OpenAI's success in India is not guaranteed and depends heavily on its ability to navigate these legal and political hurdles,\" Futurum Group's Patience said.\n\"While the Indian market is vast, its diversity in languages and user needs presents challenges. OpenAI's ability to deliver a truly localized product and its long-term impact on India's AI talent remain uncertain.\"", "content_hash": "2cc597ecf6d6154ddb53c663447feaee", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona, introduced a bill on Thursday — titled the You Earn It, You Keep it Act — to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits. A House version of the bill was introduced by Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minnesota, in April.\nGallego's bill would permanently eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits.\nIt would also expand the Social Security payroll tax to apply to annual earnings over $250,000. Currently, the maximum earnings subject to Social Security payroll taxes is $176,100 in 2025. Consequently, high earners may only pay into the program for part of the year.\n\"Despite decades of paying into the system, seniors are still forced to pay taxes on their hard-earned benefits — all while the ultra wealthy barely pay into the system,\" Gallego said in a statement.\nHow Social Security benefits are taxed\nSocial Security recipients may owe federal income taxes on their benefits depending on their income.\nHow much they may owe is based on a formula known as combined income — the sum of adjusted gross income, tax-exempt interest income and half of Social Security benefits.\nUp to 50% of benefits may be taxed for individual tax filers with between $25,000 and $34,000 in combined income, or married couples who file jointly with between $32,000 and $44,000.\nUp to 85% of benefits may be taxable for individuals with more than $34,000 in combined income or couples with more than $44,000.\nHow the 'big beautiful' tax law helps seniors\nRepublicans' new \"big beautiful\" law includes a new senior deduction aimed at helping to defray the effects of federal taxes on Social Security benefits.\nAdults aged 65 and over may be able to claim an additional deduction of up to $6,000.\nWhether beneficiaries will benefit from the change will depend on their income.\nThe full deduction will be available to individual taxpayers with up to $75,000 in modified adjusted gross income or married couples with up to $150,000. The deduction will gradually phase out for taxpayers with incomes above those thresholds.\nThe temporary deduction — which will be in effect for tax years 2025 through 2028 — will be available to eligible taxpayers regardless of whether they take the standard deduction or itemize their returns.\nMiddle-income taxpayers stand to benefit the most from the policy, according to tax experts, since low earners may already be exempt from federal taxes on benefits and higher earners will be above the phaseout thresholds.\nHow 'You Earn It, You Keep It' may affect Social Security\nUnlike the temporary senior deduction recently signed into law, Gallego's You Earn It, You Keep It proposal would eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits for all beneficiaries.\nTo be sure, it remains to be seen whether it may get enough support to become law.\nThe proposal does have the support of The Senior Citizens League, a nonpartisan senior advocacy group that is petitioning Congress to stop taxing Social Security benefits. Eliminating federal taxes on Social Security benefits is a \"commonsense step to ensure older Americans can keep more of what they've earned,\" Senior Citizens League Executive Director Shannon Benton said in a statement.\nEfforts to change the federal taxation of Social Security benefits come as the program is facing a trust fund shortfall. Benefits may be reduced within the next decade unless Congress enacts changes sooner, according to projections from Social Security's trustees.\nBecause the \"big beautiful\" law did not include any offsets for the reduced revenue from federal taxes on benefits, it would accelerate the depletion dates, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\nIn contrast, the You Earned It, You Keep It proposal would extend the Social Security trust funds' ability to pay benefits in full and on time for 24 years, or until 2058, according to Gallego's office.

He pointed to the deals available at the Excalibur, one of MGM's resorts on the Las Vegas Strip: $85 rooms, including resort fee; $5 tables; $5 beers.

And the industry as a whole is facing some troubling obstacles.\nCanadian visitation to the U.S. has plummeted some 40% this year, following comments by President Donald Trump about Canada as a potential 51st U.S. state and evolving trade policies. The Canadian dollar has also weakened, lessening the buying power of visitors crossing the border into the U.S.\nHornbuckle also pointed to massive price hikes for a U.S. visa, from $100 to $350, where a family of four visiting for the Ryder Cup, World Cup or Olympics in 2028, for example, could pay $1,400 for visa documents alone.\n\"International travel in 2016 had a $50 billion U.S. surplus. Today it's a $50 billion deficit,\" Hornbuckle said.\nThe government's commitment to funding marketing and promotion of U.S. travel was also slashed by 80% in the most recent spending bill, to $20 million.\n\"We obviously find ourselves in a world that has a fair amount of uncertainty from a macroeconomic perspective, from a socio-political perspective,\" Marriott CEO Tony Capuano told investors at the BofA conference Thursday. \"Marriott, and the sector more broadly, thrives in times of certainty and stability.

On Friday, directors proposed a 10-year pay package that could deliver Musk as much as $1 trillion in stock awards if the company clears a set of extraordinary performance hurdles.\nSuggested Reading\nThe deal would grant Musk roughly 423 million Tesla shares, currently worth about $143 billion, but the full value only materializes if Tesla executes on a series of rather ambitious targets.\nRelated Content\nThe first tranche would vest when Tesla’s market capitalization hits and sustains $2 trillion, with additional tranches tied to every $500 billion increment after that, up to $6.5 trillion. The final tranches vest if Tesla reaches $8.5 trillion in market value — a target that would make it far and away the most valuable publicly traded company on earth.\nBut valuation alone won’t do it. Under the pay package, Tesla must also deliver 20 million vehicles annually, put 1 million autonomous robotaxis into commercial service, deliver 1 million Optimus humanoid robots, and sign up 10 million active subscriptions for its Full Self-Driving software. On the financial side, the bar is just as high: Adjusted EBITDA must start at $50 billion and eventually reach $400 billion over four consecutive quarters, even as Tesla continues to pour billions into AI and robotics R&D.\nIf Musk clears all those hurdles, his ownership stake could more than double — from about 12% of outstanding shares today to more than 25%. That would give him even greater control over Tesla’s direction at a time when the company is trying to reinvent itself as an AI and robotics powerhouse, not just an electric carmaker.\nFor Tesla’s board, the calculation is simple: Musk is Tesla.\n“The biggest asset for Tesla is Musk,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a Friday note, maintaining his “Outperform” rating and sky-high $500 price target. He argued the package was “critical to keep Musk at the helm” through what he described as the company’s most consequential growth cycle, with autonomy and robotics “front and center.” The proxy filing also calls for a nonbinding shareholder vote on a strategic investment in Musk’s xAI startup, designed to accelerate Tesla’s AI development and create what the company claims could be one of the most powerful AI platforms in the world.\nLately, though, Tesla’s EV engine has sputtered, and that weakness has only magnified concerns about Musk’s attention span.\nTesla’s second-quarter deliveries fell 13% year over year to 384,122 vehicles, its second consecutive quarterly drop and the sharpest mid-year slowdown since 2022. Revenues slipped 12%, and profit fell 16%, with Europe and China showing the steepest losses. The stumbles come as rivals such as BYD extend their lead in China and European incumbents eat into Tesla’s market share. The company’s energy-storage business is still growing, but it’s nowhere near large enough to offset the shortfall in cars.\nAgainst that backdrop, Musk has been increasingly preoccupied with politics and side projects. He accepted a role heading President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), said he was starting a third political party (the “America Party”), name-called the president, and pushed controversial policies on X — all while Tesla’s core business has struggled.\nShareholders have noticed. Some have openly pressed Musk to commit at least 40 hours a week to Tesla, worried that his forays into Washington and social media are draining focus at a time when execution is critical. For the board, the trillion-dollar pay package is less a bonus than a tether — an attempt to bind Musk to Tesla through 2030 and assure investors that the CEO remains fully engaged in the company’s make-or-break pivot from EVs to autonomy and AI.\nThat means that this package carries major implications for Tesla’s governance and shareholder structure. If Musk meets its ambitious targets, his stake in the company could more than double, consolidating greater control in one individual as Tesla’s oversight faces legal scrutiny. A Delaware court voided Musk’s previous $56 billion compensation deal in January 2024, ruling that the board failed to exercise sufficient independence in approving it. That decision, now under appeal, forced Tesla to assemble a $29 billion interim award last month while it worked on a long-term plan.\nThe stakes extend beyond compensation. For Tesla, the package is a statement of intent about what the company is trying to become. The company, which once lived or died by Model 3 deliveries, is pitching itself as a leader in artificial intelligence, autonomy, and robotics — a transition that apparently requires both investor patience and Musk’s sustained involvement at the center of the company’s evolution, even as he juggles SpaceX, X, and a growing portfolio of AI ventures.\nThe plan now goes to shareholders, with a vote scheduled for Nov. 6. And those shareholders face a familiar question: How much turbulence are they willing to tolerate in exchange for growth? They’ve long accepted volatility, governance drama, and Musk’s distractions so long as Tesla kept climbing. This package asks them to double down. If it passes, it would mark the richest compensation plan in corporate history and a high-stakes bet that Tesla’s next act can justify dangling a trillion-dollar prize.", "content_hash": "d087cdb69ecaf4ea4b0d46b63aae9eb1", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The Dominican Republic is the first market in the Caribbean served by Amazon Air Cargo, the wholesale business unit established in late September 2024 help fill aircraft with heavy shipments independent from Amazon’s parcel ecosystem.\nALK Global Logistics was previously listed on Amazon Air Cargo’s website as a partner, but prior to Wednesday no details were available about what their contractual arrangement involved.\nAmazon Air manages a fleet of about 100 passenger-to-cargo converted aircraft to support next-day and two-day package delivery for the Amazon marketplace. Amazon Air Cargo is the direct sales channel to logistics providers and other businesses seeking to move general cargo by air.\nALK is the fourth Amazon Air Cargo customer that has been publicly promoted, although the company’s website lists a handful of other users. The flights connect Miami and Santo Domingo with seven weekly frequencies. Amazon outsources the flying to contractor 21 Air, according to flight activity on Flightradar24.\nAerodom, the operator of Las Américas International Airport (SDQ), is collaborating with ALK to fill the flights with cargo.\n“This new route positions us at the forefront of logistics in the region, allowing exporters and importers to benefit from faster and more reliable solutions,” said ALK Chief Executive Officer Alfonso Alemán, in a news release.\nSDQ is the Dominican Republic’s primary air cargo gateway and is experiencing an influx of e-commerce traffic. A new terminal is dedicated to express parcels and e-commerce shipments, with capacity for 4 million additional packages per year.\nIn the spring, Amazon began operating daily flights between Miami and Bogota, carrying e-commerce packages to Colombia and returning with shipments tendered by the cargo division of flag-carrier Avianca. Those flights are also operated by 21 Air.\nAmazon engages all-cargo airlines to operate its fleet because it doesn’t have an air operator’s certifcate.\nIn July, Air Premia, a passenger airline based in South Korea, entered into a transportation services agreement with Amazon Air Cargo under which it transfers belly cargo to Amazon at Honolulu airport for onward carriage to the continental United States. Those Amazon flights utilize Airbus A330-330 converted freighters operated by Hawaiian Airlines, which was acquired last year by Alaska Airlines. Once at U.S. hubs, the Air Premia shipments are relayed to 45 cities, including Atlanta and Houston, through the Amazon Air network.", "content_hash": "79e5437d42449b19b4257fabeedf1cda", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

His supporting statement reads:\nTesla’s integration of Grok into its vehicles demonstrates the tangible benefits of collaboration with xAI. As Tesla pivots toward AI-driven technologies, including Full Self-Driving and robotics, a strategic investment in xAI would secure access to advanced AI capabilities, enhance product innovation, and drive shareholder value.\nThe board, which often suggests investors vote against shareholder proposals, is neutral on this one.\nIf Tesla does end up investing in xAI, it would be the second of Musk’s companies to do so. SpaceX, Musk’s aerospace company, has committed to investing $2 billion in xAI as part of a $5 billion equity raise. Analysts have speculated that SpaceX’s involvement in xAI could signal the AI firm is having trouble raising from outside investors. (Musk also merged X, the company formerly known as Twitter, with xAI earlier this year.)\nSome Tesla shareholders have argued that xAI is a rival to Tesla, since Musk has often described his EV company as an AI company. Last year, shareholders sued Musk and the company for allowing Musk to startup a rival AI firm, but the case was dismissed.\nHawk’s proposal comes as Tesla grapples with weakening EV sales and a lackluster robotaxi rollout. The company has attempted to direct investor attention away from those headwinds and towards Tesla’s AI efforts, which center on testing and deploying autonomous vehicles and Optimus, its humanoid robot.\nMusk has argued that he requires more of a controlling stake in Tesla to lead the company’s AI efforts, rather than get distracted by his other AI company. Alongside the proposal to invest in xAI, shareholders will vote on a Tesla-backed 10-year compensation plan for Musk that could give him more than 25% control.\nThe filing comes as Tesla continues to appeal a Delaware judge’s decision to strike down Musk’s earlier $56 billion pay package. The new plan would tie Musk’s compensation to ambitious benchmarks, including boosting Tesla’s market value from about $1 trillion today to more than $8 trillion.\n“Tesla’s not going to get to $8 trillion market cap based on FSD and robotaxi. To get to that $8 trillion, you kind of need xAI,” Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, told TechCrunch. “We’re talking numbers that have historically been inconceivable. To get to those, we need things to happen that are inconceivable right now. And one of them is humanoid robots everywhere; that’s probably the biggest lever.”", "content_hash": "d5405478c9a35af2bdcfda28b0fefffa", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid roughly 0.6%. The declines mark a pullback from sizable gains earlier in the session.\nThe US economy added just 22,000 jobs in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was far short of expectations for 75,000 and adds more evidence to the narrative of a dramatically slowing US labor market. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, compared with 4.2% the previous month.\nRevisions to data from July and June in Friday's report suggest that over the last three months, the US economy has created fewer than 30,000 new jobs. The revisions also showed a negative print in June, the first labor market shrinkage since 2020.\nThe jobs report, the first since President Trump fired the head of the BLS, capped a week of data showing cracks in the labor market. That has fed Wall Street's certainty that a rate cut is coming at the Federal Reserve's September meeting. Traders are now pricing in a 100% chance of a reduction, and bets are rising on a \"jumbo,\" 50-basis-point cut.\nTreasury yields sank following the report, with the 30-year yield (^TYX) falling below 4.79% after nearing 5% earlier in the week. The benchmark 10-year yield (^TNX) dropped to 4.07%, its lowest since April.\nAfter the release, Trump voiced further criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell in a social media post. \"Jerome 'Too Late' Powell should have lowered rates long ago. As usual, he’s 'Too Late!'\" he wrote. His comment comes a day after a Senate hearing to confirm Trump pick Stephen Miran as Fed governor, as the White House tries to recast the Fed in pursuit of rate cuts.\nMeanwhile, AI trade hopes got a boost after an upbeat outlook from Broadcom (AVGO) and a report that the US company has signed a deal to build OpenAI's (OPAI.PVT) first chips. Its shares jumped over 10%.\nElsewhere in tech, shares of Tesla (TSLA) rose after the EV maker's board proposed paying CEO Elon Musk $1 trillion in compensation, if performance targets are met.\nRead more: The latest on Trump's tariffs\nLIVE 11 updates Tesla stock rises after $1 trillion pay package for Musk is put forward\nTesla's (TSLA) stock popped as much as 4.9% on Friday after the EV maker's board put forward a plan to compensate CEO Elon Musk with a pay package worth roughly $1 trillion, if he achieves certain milestones.\nThose milestones include driving Tesla's market cap to $8.5 trillion and putting 1 million of its Robotaxis into commercial operation, according to the proposal outlined in an SEC filing.\nThis pay package would provide Musk with an additional 423 million shares of common stock, or 12% of Tesla shares. That means he would have roughly 25% voting power over the company's decisions, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients Friday.\nIves said the voting power provision was \"critical to keep Musk at the helm to lead Tesla through the most critical time in the company’s history.\"\n\"We believe this was the smart move by the Board as the biggest asset for Tesla is Musk,\" Ives said, adding: \"[T]his is a crucial time for Tesla ahead, with autonomous and robotics front and center.\"\nThe stock pared gains shortly after the market open, and was up more than 2% in mid-morning.\nTech leads stocks higher at the open\nUS stocks jumped at the open on Friday as investors digested a weak August jobs report, which pushed investor confidence in a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting even higher.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.4%, coming off a fresh all-time closing high for the index on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.6%.\nTech stocks' surge was led by gains in Tesla (TSLA) and Broadcom (AVGO) shares, which added 3.6% and 12.8% at the start of Friday's trading session.\nRate cut bets surge after jobs report\nBets on coming Fed rate cuts are surging after the jobs report.\nCME Group had the odds of a cut very high before the report — around 97% to 3%. But after it confirmed the severe summer slowdown, the odds almost immediately shifted to 100% on a 25-point cut this month.\nSubsequently, traders piled into bets on a \"jumbo\" rate cut — 50 basis points. As of around 9:10 a.m. ET, about 88% of bets are on a 25-point cut, and 12% of bets are for 50 points.\nBets are also jumping on cuts in October and December. By the end of the year, a majority of traders expect the equivalent of three rate cuts.\nThe first negative jobs print since 2020\nThe revisions to the monthly jobs report have taken high focus lately. On Friday, we learned something very noteworthy from them: June 2025 was the first month of labor market shrinkage since 2020.\nJune's number was revised to show a net loss of 13,000 jobs. That's the first negative monthly jobs print since December 2020, in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs my colleague Jake Conley notes, this report's revisions found that, over the last three months, the US economy added 8,000 fewer jobs per month than had been previously reported.\nYou can see the slight dip in the chart below:\nUS economy adds just 22,000 jobs, unemployment rate rises\nThe US labor market continues to slow.\nThe August jobs report released Friday by the the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) showed there were just 22,000 new jobs added to the economy last month, far fewer than forecast and the latest sign that the US labor market slowed down through the summer. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in August.\nEconomists had expected the report to show 75,000 jobs created last month, with the unemployment rate forecast to rise to 4.3%, according to Bloomberg data.\nIn July, the economy created 73,000 new jobs. Those figures were revised on Friday to show 79,000 jobs created during the month. Revisions to June's data, however, were more negative, with those numbers now showing 13,000 jobs lost during the month. Revisions in early August had brought June's job growth down to 14,000.\nRead more here.\nGood morning.

The results are deserved, as people I talk to in retail have been super let down in Lululemon's product assortments in recent months. It will take time to reverse the lack of must-have items, they say.\nHere is the Street vibe on Lululemon this morning:\n\"Challenges from domestic market pressures and removal of the de minimis exemption are primary drivers of a meaningful cut to FY25 guidance (implying -4.4% lower 2H revenue and -22% lower 2H EPS at the midpoint). Acknowledgment of underperformance within the casual side of the business (40% revenue mix) is a starting point, though reigniting brand momentum in the U.S. is likely to take longer than we had previously anticipated.\" — Stifel analyst Peter McGoldrick\n\"It's very simple... With sales per foot 4x mall avg and margins near peak, LULU's fundamentals will get much worse ahead. The US drives the earnings and the US is fading fast here. We believe the guide is not low enough and continue to carry estimates well below the Street/company guide. Rising competition won't stop either, which means LULU's EPS is permanently impaired. With lower growth and brand strength fading, a lower multiple is warranted.\" — Jefferies analyst Randy Konik\nGold stays high after reaching record price\nGold (GC=F) has maintained its upward trajectory for a third week of consecutive gains.

The next step in this program will occur on Tuesday, September 9 when Porsche customers will gain soft launch access to the Tesla Supercharger network. This means Porsche owners will have access to 23,500 Tesla Superchargers in North America – helping them find even more convenient places to charge.\nAccess to the Tesla Supercharger network will be possible though Porsche-supplied NACS DC adapter being made available to Porsche customers. At this soft launch stage, Porsche customers will utilize the Tesla app to enable charging. Charging through the My Porsche app and plug-and-charge is expected to follow in the coming months.\n“We are continually working to make every aspect of Porsche ownership as convenient as possible for our customers – and this news represents a significant step for owners of our electrified cars,” said Timo Resch, President and CEO of Porsche Cars North America. “As we launch this offering, in the coming months, we will be adding more features to make the process even more seamless.”\nThe adapter\nGoing forward, all new model year 2026 Porsche Taycan and Macan Electric models will include Porsche NACS DC adapter at no additional fee. Model year 2025 Taycan owners and all existing Macan Electric owners are eligible for a complimentary adapter. This group of owners will receive notification via their My Porsche to reserve their free Porsche NACS DC adapter shortly.\nModel year 2024 and older Taycan customers can elect to purchase the Porsche NACS DC adapter from the Porsche Online Shop and at local Porsche Centers starting today. The MSRP of the adapter is $185 and enables Porsche owners to charge their CCS-equipped Taycan and Macan Electric models at DC fast charging stations equipped with NACS/J3400 compatible cables, including select Tesla Superchargers.\nHow it works\nThis soft launch will allow customer access the Tesla Supercharger network ahead of the full operational launch – with enhanced features such as access via the Porsche app and plug & charge capability – following in the coming months.\nCustomers connecting to a NACS Tesla Supercharger will need to take two simple steps – the first being to download and register on the Tesla app to activate Tesla Supercharger stations.\nOther stations, such as Ionna and Electrify America with NACS handles, can be activated via the My Porsche app. Next, they will use their new Porsche NACS DC adapter to connect to the charging station cable before it can then be plugged into the car.\nCharge planning software\nAll model year 2026 Taycan and Macan Electric variants will come with the necessary navigation features to incorporate the location of additional chargers. Model year 2024 and 2025 Macan Electric models will receive this software update before the end of the year, while model year 2025 and earlier Taycan variants will receive their upgrade thereafter.

The shares were higher as a court ruled that Google could continue to pay companies to push its Search service on devices. For Apple Inc.

Will Apple turn out to have the last laugh while all the others fall flat on their faces?… Listen, we heard the same thing about the dot-com survivors at the turn of the millennium.”\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Tariffs should contribute to ongoing price increases in household furnishings, apparel, and recreation commodities,” BofA said.\nAnalysts expect tariff-related goods inflation to persist over the coming quarters.\nNon-housing services are also anticipated to remain firm. BofA noted that “non-housing core services prices rose 0.4% month-on-month, after a 0.5% increase in July. Airfares likely increased again owing to another strong seasonal factor, and lodging away from home should also climb.”\nThese gains reflect both mean-reversion after earlier declines and higher summer travel activity.\nBased on these CPI forecasts, BofA expects core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation to rise to 3.0% year-on-year in August.\n“Our preliminary estimate for core PCE inflation in July is 0.27% month-on-month.

The credit card and banking giant is benefiting from increased market optimism as the Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates.\nThe credit card for the affluent customer\nAmerican Express has carved out a niche as an elite credit card provider, servicing an upscale clientele with fee-based products that come with a coveted rewards program. Although it has only a fraction of competitor Visa's card membership, it has nearly double Visa's revenue. Its cardmembers are high spenders, and they're more resilient when there's pressure, making American Express resilient, too.\nIn the 2025 second quarter, revenue increased 9% year over year (currency neutral), and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were up 17%.\nAmerican Express stands out from other credit card networks in several ways. One is the focus on the affluent consumer, and another is its closed-loop model. Instead of working with partnering banks or financial institutions to provide the credit for its customers to make purchases on its network, it acts as its own bank. That gives it greater control over the model and expands its platform. In contrast with other networks, it has a large and varied stream of revenue.\nIt also makes money on deposits, which leads to higher net interest income and higher overall net income.\nAnother way the company differentiates itself is with its robust rewards program and accompanying annual fees. Fee revenue increased 20% year over year in the second quarter and accounted for more than 13% of revenue.\nLow interest rates should boost business\nLower interest rates generally boost economic activity, because money is cheaper and therefore easier to come by. Companies can borrow more easily, and they tend to expand their operations when money is plentiful. Individuals tend to spend more when it's cheaper to service their credit.\nThis works in American Express' favor in several ways. Higher economic activity is good for spending, and people with money are also more likely to take out new fee-based cards. It also means its default rates should go lower. They're generally best-in-class, and since interest rates have started to come down from highs, they're already improving.\nAmerican Express has been a reliable stock for decades, and it also pays a growing dividend. It's one of Warren Buffett's favorite and longest-held stocks, and it can still provide value for new and current shareholders.", "content_hash": "34b71ebb73933c17aa82293833dbf7bc", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

I’ve been writing about the uptick in CFO turnover. The latest high-profile departure is at multibillionaire Elon Musk’s xAI.\nMike Liberatore stepped down abruptly as the finance chief of Musk’s artificial intelligence startup, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal citing anonymous sources. Liberatore was hired in April and reportedly left in late July. The reasons for his departure are not known, but he followed other high-profile exits from xAI of late. The company did not immediately respond to my request for comment.\nBefore joining xAI, Liberatore worked at Airbnb for almost nine years—most recently as VP of finance and corporate development—and had previously served in several business unit CFO roles. He’s also worked at Intel, eBay, and PayPal. During his brief tenure at xAI, he reportedly helped raise $10 billion in funding and expanded data center operations.\nLaunched by Musk in July 2023, xAI is a competitor of OpenAI. Both companies develop large language models and AI assistants—OpenAI with ChatGPT, xAI with Grok—that target overlapping user bases.\nLiberatore’s departure follows a wave of exits, including cofounder Igor Babuschkin (who left to start a VC firm focused on AI safety), General Counsel Robert Keele after one year, and senior lawyer Raghu Rao. xAI’s leadership is highly centralized under Musk, with no publicly disclosed independent board.\nMichael Morris, a professor at Columbia Business School, shared his assessment with me. He noted that Keele cited differences in worldview with Musk and family priorities in his LinkedIn post about leaving. Of course, Musk also played a key role in the Trump White House earlier this year.\nMorris also observed that executive turnover among Musk’s direct reports at Tesla is 44%, compared to about 9% at Meta, Amazon, and Netflix; overall, Tesla’s executive turnover rate is 27%, nearly double the industry average.\n“Analysts point to Musk’s demanding, high-contact leadership style—managing up to 18 direct reports at once—as a key reason for the trend,” Morris said. “This pattern is visible not only at Tesla but also at X and xAI, suggesting structural factors rather than isolated events.”\nHe added that many executives leave rather than risk being blamed when new initiatives encounter regulatory hurdles: “Executives don’t want to become the ‘fall guy.’”\nWhat fuels mass exits?\nxAI isn’t alone in seeing mass executive departures. Last year, OpenAI also saw multiple senior departures—such as cofounder John Schulman and CTO Mira Murati. Also in 2024, at the DNA testing startup 23andMe, all seven independent directors resigned simultaneously, citing major disagreements with CEO Anne Wojcicki and her plans to take the company private.", "content_hash": "40f37b2e78d15b9510890ef5a1213582", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

If purchased via stablecoins, fees would be $0.50 or much lower - a huge spread.\nThat’s the opportunity that Stripe sees, and they’re clearly moving quickly.\nTheir advantage here is their purpose-built chain (along with their laundry list of launch partners and beta testers).\nMany of today’s big chains were optimized for trading, while Tempo optimizes for payments, the largest real-world use case for crypto.\nIf it works, on-chain dollars become the default rail for payouts and commerce.\nAnd that’s a boon for the broader crypto space. More stablecoins grow the overall crypto pie and bring more users on-chain.\nBut it doesn’t necessarily mean your favorite L1 blockchain’s token is going to go up in price…\n🌎 Macro Crypto and Memes\nA few Crypto and Web3 headlines that caught my eye:\n- Crypto majors are mostly even with BTC leading; BTC +1% at $112,300, ETH even at $4,420, XRP even at $2.84, SOL -1% at $207\n- M (+26%), PUMP (+10%) and XDC (+5%) led top movers\n- The Bitcoin ETFs saw $220M in net outflows on Thursday, breaking a big 2-day inflow streak; the ETH ETFs saw $167M in net outflows\n- The SEC set a pro-crypto agenda, unveiling rulemakings to define digital-asset offers/sales and ease listings on U.S. exchanges\n- Stripe + Paradigm revealed their Tempo blockchain aimed at low-cost stablecoin settlement with partners including Visa, Deutsche Bank, OpenAI\n- Kraken announced a buyout of Breakout, planning to integrate the trader-native platform into Kraken Pro\n- WLFI blacklisted Justin Sun's address from selling his 595M unlocked tokens, citing activity concerns that broke WLFI rules (WLFI +15% since the news)\n- Gary Gensler’s text messages from Oct 2022 to Sept 2023 have been “lost” according to a recent audit\nIn Corporate Treasuries\n- Crypto treasury stocks slumped after the Nasdaq announced heightened scrutiny of equity raises to fund crypto purchases\n- Public firms now hold over 1,000,000 BTC (~$110B) led by Strategy at ~636K BTC\n- American Bitcoin stock fell below its IPO price in trading Thursday\nIn Memes\n- Memecoin leaders are slightly green on the day; DOGE +1%, Shiba +1%, PEPE +1%, PENGU -1%, BONK +2%, TRUMP +1%, SPX +4%, and FARTCOIN -1%\n- NEET (+20%), BITTY (+30%), SPARK (+15%) and TOKABU (+13%) led onchain movers\n💰 Token, Airdrop & Protocol Tracker\nHere's a rundown of major token, protocol and airdrop news from the day:\n- Pump Fun did another $12M in buybacks over the past week, representing 98% of their revenue\n- Myriad announced two new UX enhancements, including direct sign-in w/ MetaMask, Rabby & Rainbow wallets and easier bridging directly within Myriad, along with confirmation that USDC predictions will \"be considered at TGE\"\n- Arbitrum launched DRIP, its $40M DeFi incentive program, targeting leveraged looping with 24M ARB in rewards\n- Fireblocks launched a stablecoin payments network, connecting 40+ participants to streamline B2B stablecoin flows\n🤖 AI x Crypto\nSection dedicated to headlines in the AI sector of crypto:\n- Overall market cap even at $12.7B, leaders were mixed\n- FARTCOIN (-1%), VIRTUAL (+1%), TIBBIR (+5%), aixbt (+3%) & ai16z (+1%)\n- VADER (+33%) and VIRGEN (+22%) led top movers\n🚚 What is happening in NFTs?\nHere is the list of other notable headlines from the day in NFTs:\n- ETH NFT leaders were mixed; Punks +2% at 48.9 ETH, Pudgy -1% at 9.8, BAYC -1% at 9.1 ETH\n- HV-MTL up 230% were a notable top mover\n- Abstract NFTs were mostly red, led by Roach Racing (+7%)\n- Pudgy Penguins announced that OpenSea will be its official home, along with the PENGU token\n- The Pudgy Party soulbound token can now be claimed inside MetaMask portfolio\n- NFL All Day revamped its collector experience, rolling out verified digital autographed rookie highlight moments and partnering with four NFL teams on in-person activations to onboard more fans", "content_hash": "b1d6045bfafe48ff5b5802522276af48", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The company acquired stablecoin infrastructure firm Bridge for $1.1 billion and crypto wallet developer Privy, creating end-to-end payment solutions spanning wallets, stablecoins, and now blockchain processing infrastructure.\nStripe’s Crypto Stack Completion Strategy\nStripe’s blockchain development completes a comprehensive crypto infrastructure buildout that began with strategic acquisitions.\nThe Bridge acquisition provided stablecoin payment capabilities across 70 countries, while Privy added wallet infrastructure for seamless user onboarding.\nThe company initially supported Bitcoin transactions in 2014 before halting crypto services due to network inefficiencies.\nStripe rebuilt its blockchain team in 2021 and accelerated initiatives throughout 2024 following regulatory clarity brought by the Trump administration.\nStablecoin Financial Accounts launched across 101 countries, enabling companies to hold and transact digital dollars.\nThe platform currently supports Circle’s USDC and Bridge’s USDB tokens with plans for stablecoin neutrality across Tempo.\nEarlier this year, Stripe partnered with Ramp to launch stablecoin-backed corporate cards, which aim to address cross-border payment delays and currency volatility.\nThe cards were initially deployed in Latin American markets before expanding to Europe, Africa, and Asia.\nCEO Patrick Collison has previously testified to Congress that Stripe sees “meaningful business interest in stablecoins as the underlying technology has matured.”\nThe GENIUS Act’s federal regulatory framework spurred corporate adoption across the billion-dollar stablecoin sector.\nTempo enables Stripe to capture transaction processing revenue directly rather than paying fees to external networks.\nParticularly, the company’s extensive merchant network spanning millions of businesses worldwide perfectly positions Tempo for rapid adoption through existing payment flows.\nFinancial Giants Race Into the Blockchain Industry\nThe stablecoin sector experienced explosive growth following regulatory clarity, with market capitalization exceeding $288 billion.\nIn fact, among many others, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse projects the growth of the stablecoin market to around $1-2 trillion.\nAmid the corporate adoption race, MetaMask announced plans earlier last month to launch “MetaMask USD” through Stripe’s payment infrastructure.\nThe proposal builds on the M⁰ network, which has regulatory backing and fiat reserves.\nWestern Union has also announced pilot programs in South America and Africa for stablecoin-powered remittances.\nJust yesterday, Ripple announced its extension of its US dollar-backed stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD), into Africa.\nApproximately 20 million addresses now transact stablecoins on public blockchains.\nRecognizing this massive growth potential, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller noted that 99% of stablecoin market capitalization is tied to the US dollar.\nHe believes “stablecoins can keep the dollar the world’s reserve currency” by increasing global accessibility.\nLooking forward, Tempo’s validator set will begin with independent, diverse participants before transitioning toward permissionless validation.\nThe blockchain maintains neutrality regarding stablecoin issuers, allowing any compliant stablecoin to be used for payments and gas fees.\n- New ChatGPT AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Avalanche and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana and Pepe by the End of 2025\n- Perplexity AI Predicts the Price of XRP, World Liberty Financial and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Why Is Crypto Down Today? – September 4, 2025\n- XRP Price Prediction: Gaming Giant Expands to XRP Ledger – Shocking Move to $10 Starting Now\n- New ChatGPT AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Avalanche and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana and Pepe by the End of 2025\n- Perplexity AI Predicts the Price of XRP, World Liberty Financial and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Why Is Crypto Down Today? – September 4, 2025\n- XRP Price Prediction: Gaming Giant Expands to XRP Ledger – Shocking Move to $10 Starting Now", "content_hash": "2348bb8a6d02d0c99aaa2ed251dc0ef8", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for payrolls to rise by 75,000.\nThe report showed a marked slowdown from the July increase of 79,000, which was revised up by 6,000. Revisions also showed a net loss of 13,000 in June after the prior estimate was lowered by 27,000.\n\"The job market is stalling short of the runway,\" said Daniel Zhao, chief economist at jobs site Glassdoor. \"The labor market is losing lift, and August's report, along with downward revisions, suggests we're heading into turbulence without the soft landing achieved.\"\nMarkets largely disregarded the report, with stocks up at the open and Treasury yields sharply lower. Traders in the futures markets raised the probability of a quarter percentage point Fed rate cut to 100% and went even further, pricing in a 12% probability of a half-point move, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge.\nThe payrolls count was the first since President Donald Trump fired former BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following the release of the July jobs report a month ago. The move came after the report showed not just a weak level of job creation but also dramatic reductions in previous months' totals.\nIn McEntarfer's place, the president nominated economist E.J. Antoni, a Trump loyalist from the Heritage Foundation who previously had criticized the BLS numbers as being politically distorted. William Wiatrowski is serving as acting BLS commissioner.\nWhile the pace of hiring was slow, average hourly earnings increased 0.3% for the month, meeting the estimate, though the annual gain of 3.7% was slightly below the forecast for 3.8%.\nHiring was held back by a payroll reduction in the federal government, which reported a decline of 15,000.\nHealth care again led sectors, adding 31,000 jobs, while social assistance contributed 16,000. Wholesale trade and manufacturing both saw declines of 12,000 on the month.\nThe report comes as markets widely expect the Fed to lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point when it releases its next decision Sept. 17. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his fellow policymakers also have been under heavy criticism from the president as they have been on hold since last cutting in December 2024.\nThough most economic indicators indicate continued expansion, Fed officials have expressed concern about a slowdown in hiring even as layoffs have held fairly steady. At the same time, policymakers worry that Trump's tariffs could reignite inflation, with data indicating a slow but steady increase in prices over recent months.\n\"The warning bell that rang in the labor market a month ago just got louder. A weaker-than-expected jobs report all but seals a 25-basis-point rate cut later this month,\" said Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings. \"Four straight months of manufacturing job losses stand out. It's hard to argue that tariff uncertainty isn't a key driver of this weakness.\"\nWhile the establishment survey showed weak job creation, the more volatile household count, used to calculate the unemployment rate, held better news.\nThat report showed an increase of 288,000 employed, though the ranks of the unemployed also rose by 148,000. The labor force participation rate edged higher to 62.3% while the labor force swelled by 436,000, accounting for the tick higher in the unemployment rate.\nA broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons climbed to 8.1%, a 0.2 percentage point increase and the highest level since October 2021.\nAlong with the jobs numbers tally, the BLS on Tuesday will release the initial estimate for annual benchmark revisions to the numbers dating back one year from March 2025.\nRevisions have been a source of controversy, particularly in the post-Covid era as the response rate has declined, particularly for the headline establishment survey that asks businesses and government agencies to detail the pace of hiring.\nThe BLS typically releases its initial estimate with the first batch of survey responses it gets, then updates two times as it gets more information. However, Trump has accused the BLS of being politically biased. The firing of McEntarfer drew widespread criticism in the economics and markets community.\nIn a CNBC interview, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said he expects the August payrolls count to get revised higher. In the past three years, the initial August count actually was revised lower from the initial estimate.\nCorrection: The BLS on Tuesday will release the initial estimate for annual benchmark revisions to the numbers dating back one year from March 2025.

It would also give Musk increased voting power over the EV maker and aspiring robotics titan, which he has publicly demanded since early 2024.\nTesla Chairwoman Robyn Denholm told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin the plan was designed to keep the CEO \"motivated and focused on delivering for the company.\"\n\"If he performs, if he hits the super ambitious milestones that are in the plan then he gets equity — it's 1% for each half a trillion dollars of market cap, plus operational milestones he has to hit in order to do that,\" Denholm said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\nThe full award would give Musk more than 423 million additional shares. He currently holds about a 13% stake in the company.\nDenholm confirmed that the Tesla CEO pay plan, if approved by shareholders, would not put any limit on where and how Musk spends his time or require him to spend any minimum number of hours per week on Tesla business.\nTo obtain the first award in the plan, Musk and Tesla would need to almost double their current market cap to reach $2 trillion. The final benchmark is reaching an $8.5 trillion market cap.\nThe operational milestones in the 2025 CEO Performance Award include: 20 million Tesla vehicles delivered, 10 million active FSD Subscriptions, 1 million robots delivered, 1 million Robotaxis in commercial operation and a series of adjusted EBITDA benchmarks.\nMusk has remained politically embroiled, while also running a collection of companies, including aerospace and defense contractor SpaceX, drilling venture The Boring Company, health tech company Neuralink and the artificial intelligence venture, xAI, which has merged with his social network, X.\nTesla also said in the filing Friday that it will ask shareholders at the Nov. 6 meeting to vote on whether the company should invest in Musk's newest venture, xAI.\nMusk first floated the idea publicly with an informal poll on X last July, asking whether Tesla should invest $5 billion into xAI.\nFounded in early 2023 in Nevada, xAI merged with Musk's social network X earlier this year. The company now operates a massive data center in Memphis, and plans to build out another facility there to help train and run its large language models and a chatbot called Grok.\nPay plan controversy\nThe new pay proposal for Musk comes after the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled last year that his 2018 pay plan was excessive, had been improperly granted by the Tesla board and must be rescinded.\nIn that case, Tornetta v. Musk, a judge found that the Tesla CEO had controlled pay negotiations at the automaker, and his board of directors failed to give shareholders information that they were legally entitled to before telling them they should vote to approve Musk's performance-based pay plan.\nThe case is now on appeal.", "content_hash": "09f593d3e7974c4e760a806746de481c", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

He added that the order increased Broadcom's forecast for AI revenue next year, when shipments will begin.\nAnalysts at Mizuho, Cantor Fitzgerald and KeyBanc all said they think AI startup OpenAI is the customer. The Financial Times reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the partnership, that the two companies co-designed a chip that will hit the market next year.\nOpenAI declined to comment on the report.\nWhile Broadcom doesn't name its large web-scale customers, analysts have said dating back to last year that its first three clients were Google, Meta and TikTok parent ByteDance.\n\"During the call, the company surprised us by noting that it had secured a $10B order from a fourth XPU customer (we believe this is OpenAI), adding significant upside to the company's three current XPU customers (Google, Meta, and ByteDance),\" analysts at Cantor wrote in a note late Thursday. \"Shipments are expected to commence in 2026.\"\nBroadcom's stock has been on a tear of late as the company has joined Nvidia at the front of the race to build the kinds of processors and infrastructures needed for massive AI workloads.

The company said it expects $17.4 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, higher than the $17.02 billion expected by Wall Street analysts, with AI revenue reaching $6.2 billion.\nBut news of an incoming $10 billion customer is what got Wall Street excited.\nTan said on the call that \"immediate and fairly substantial demand\" boosts the outlook for next year, \"and really changes our thinking of what 2026 would be starting to look like.\"\nThe company didn't provide specific guidance for next year, but Tan suggested that growth in its AI could be above the 50% to 60% range he'd offered in the prior call.\nAnalysts at Mizuho raised their AI revenue growth estimate for next year to 76% up from about 60%, which would bring the total to $35 billion. Total revenue for the year ending in October 2026 is expected to increase about 30% to $81.8 billion from $63.1 billion this fiscal year, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG.\nIn addition to hardware, Broadcom has a large software business, keyed by its $61 billion acquisition of server virtualization software vendor VMware in 2023.

But maybe there is not enough planning among investors about what they should do to preserve the hefty gains embedded in market portfolios since the April low gave way to a new S&P 500 record. A rate cut is typically seen as a good thing for stocks, but a weakening labor market is also a sign that broader trouble for the economy could be ahead.\nGlobal equities are at all-time highs, 401(k) and IRA millionaire account numbers have surged to their own record, flows into equity ETFs are picking up, and investor sentiment data is getting \"a little hotter,\" according to Strategas Securities' technical strategist Todd Sohn, all signs that there could be a tipping point ahead for the market where bullishness becomes its own sign of overconfidence. But in Sohn's view, we're not there yet. September has had some rocky trading days already, and its long-term track record as a market month going back decades is not good, but \"the real lull,\" if it comes, will happen further into Q4, he said.\n\"That's when people can get hit with a speed bump like April, maybe not as quick or as big of a drawdown,\" Sohn shared on this week's \"ETF Edge.\" But he stressed that there are \"no signs of massive risk yet.\"\nThe market initially headed higher on Friday to yet another new record as traders bet a rate cut is coming, but then gave up those gains.\nFed chair Jerome Powell has himself signaled that a rate cut may be ahead, but that isn't really signaling anything the market didn't already know, and according to Bryant VanCronkhite, Allspring Global Investments' senior portfolio manager and co-head of its special global equity team — who joined Sohn on \"ETF Edge\" — the market may be overpricing the odds of a Fed rate cut even with the weakening labor market. Inflation, with core CPI at 3.1% in July, remains \"safely above target,\" he said — a reference to the Fed's longstanding policy approach of aiming for 2% inflation — and the uncertainty related to tariff impact on prices throughout the economy gives the Fed more reason to wait for more data before committing to a big change in policy.\nThat's a long way of saying that given the wiggle room still possible within the Fed's timing for a cut, and the uncertain economic outlook tied to the trade war, VanCronkhite and Sohn both say it is a good time for investors to take a look at defensive options with the stock market that may be underrepresented in their portfolios. It doesn't mean a major change in how an overall portfolio is constructed, but some tweaks on the edges to insulate overall returns from any damage that could be in the cards for the recent equity winners. They broke down that analysis into a few key points for investors to consider.\n1. Nothing new here, but your portfolio still likely has too much tech\nFor years, investors have been warned that mega-cap tech stocks have become too dominant in the cap-weighted S&P 500, and that problem has not gone away, with Sohn noting that the weighting of the top eight mega-cap stocks is now close to 40% of the index (in an index of 500 stocks). The tech sector, as a whole, is currently 31% of the index as measured by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF.\nNvidia, the biggest of them all, was lower on Friday, its sixth losing day out of the last 7, and on track for its worst week since April, and fourth-consecutive losing week, according to CNBC data.\nSohn says the first step in dealing with tech concentration risk is for investors to make sure they don't have a core stock market index fund in addition to a large-cap growth and tech fund, which in the end, are all more or less replicating the same exposure and risk profile. If there is any tilt in the future to value stocks, that composition of a portfolio will exacerbate the pain for investors.\nIt should be said, this warning has been issued for years and the mega-cap, tech-led stock market has mostly continued up and to the right. Nevertheless, it makes sense to evaluate a portfolio's overall concentration risk with the prospect of major changes in rate policy and overall economic conditions ahead. So, where to look?\n2. Value and defensive stocks have been left behind, and that leaves opportunity ahead\nSohn and VanCronkhite both say that heading into 2026 it makes sense for investors to reposition ahead of any tilt in the market cycle towards value. \"Maybe not the bulk of a portfolio,\" Sohn said, but from his technical lens on the market, looking at the stocks and sectors that have not participated in the recent gains, corners of the stock market that have, in effect, been in their own bear market or stuck in a narrow trading range over the past few years. Sohn says that \"leaves us with lots of opportunities away from tech.\"\n\"Now is the time to begin shifting and broadening exposure,\" said VanCronkhite. \"Take some capital out of the past winners, like tech and financials,\" he said.\n3. Where exactly to move market money, starting with health care\nSohn said there has been \"absolutely no demand for defensives\" like healthcare, and VanCronkhite pointed to industrials and materials.\n\"Buy something different\" from among the \"desolate\" sectors of the market, Sohn said, adding that transports and small-caps are, on a relative basis at least, at attractive valuations.\nHealth care, in particular, is a focus for both ETF strategists. It has also been a recent focus for Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.\nWhile there are significant political and cyclical issues for the health care sector, VanCronkhite described it as \"being ignored\" right now by the market.\n\"There has been a mass exodus from health care,\" said Sohn, referring to flows out of the health care sector as its performance relative to the S&P 500 has hit \"bottom-decile\" on a historical basis. As a result, it would be \"hard to get much worse for health care,\" he said.\nSohn conceded that for health care to do better, the current market leaders will need to do worse. There won't be any \"sustained\" move in health care without a cost for \"everything else.\" He is not betting that there is any wholesale move into health care anytime soon because that would require a breakdown in the broader market. But he says it still makes sense \"as a differentiation hedge going forward, especially because no one is there.\"\nWatch the video above to learn more about the ETF experts' views on defensive positions.

Those relationships may help get your foot in the door when a job opportunity becomes available, she said.\nMore from Personal Finance:\n68 jobs may qualify for Trump's $25,000 'no tax on tips' deduction\nWhy coffee prices are so high — and where they're headed next\nRecord numbers of retirement savers are now 401(k) or IRA millionaires\nFind ways to show up at events with people in your industry, whether individuals you're meeting for the first time or with colleagues, she said.\nEven sending emails to former college professors and teachers could be productive, Indeed's Ullrich told CNBC.\nIt's also important to keep your skills \"sharp,\" by staying current on new software your industry may be using, for example, Woodruff-Santos said.\nShow off the skills and knowledge you already have to your professional network, leveraging online platforms like LinkedIn to talk about what you do or are passionate about, she added. It's a good way to get attention from people who may not remember you.\n\"You can create your own platform,\" Woodruff-Santos said. \"Use your voice.\"\nThe main thing is to keep \"moving forward and doing something,\" perhaps by getting a part-time job in the meantime or broadening your job search to sectors in which your skills are transferrable, Ullrich said. Even volunteer opportunities can look like work experience on a resume, which may show hiring managers you are adaptive, she added.\nAdditionally, don't overlook \"pivoting in place,\" Woodruff-Santos said. Seek out opportunities to advance internally at your current company, whether taking on more responsibility, seeking a promotion or shadowing someone to pick up new skill sets, she said. There are ways to be entrepreneurial in your current job to set you up for future success, she said.\n\"What people really need right now is patience,\" Woodruff-Santos said.\n\"You'll start to feel like there's no hope, but you can't let that cloud weigh you down,\" she said — lean on colleagues, friends, peers and coaching communities to help keep you going.", "content_hash": "ee738bf6b63591dc6ec1be92d0474e2c", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

It began to slow in 2022, but now economic uncertainty brought on by constantly changing tariff policy and persistently high inflation is taking a greater toll on this previously hot real estate sector.\nJust 27 million square feet of space was absorbed in the first half of this year, with demand falling by 11.3 million in the second quarter alone, the first quarterly drop since 2010, according to a report from NAIOP, a commercial real estate development association.\nSince the uncertainty is likely to continue through the end of this year, NAIOP therefore projects that net absorption will be \"nearly flat\" over the second half of this year.\n\"Demand for industrial space is expected to recover somewhat after occupiers have time to adjust to a new tariff regime,\" the report's authors said. \"However, higher tariffs and slowing employment growth will likely result in slower demand growth than that experienced from 2020 to 2022 or in the six years that preceded the pandemic.\nNAIOP predicts absorption will rebound starting in the second quarter of 2026, with full-year absorption totaling 119.3 million square feet. Another 109.7 million square feet of absorption is expected in the first half of 2027.\nAs for industrial property sales, this year they are just about matching last year's pace of $74.3 billion, up 14.7% from 2023, but down from the all-time high of $129.8 billion in 2021, according to a separate report from Yardi.\nPrice appreciation has also cooled after huge gains between 2019 and 2022, when the average sale price of an industrial property jumped 54%.\n\"Capital was cheap, and investors wanted to profit from record rent growth resulting from historically low industrial vacancy rates on top of supply falling behind,\" the report noted.\nSo far this year, the average sale price for completed industrial transactions was just 6% higher than the 2022 average.\nThe national industrial vacancy rate in July was 9.1%, up 10 basis points from June and up 270 basis points from July 2024. In-place rents, however, were still up 6.1% year over year.\n\"We've watched the industrial investment market move from darling to resilient over the past few years, but we anticipate activity and interest to ramp up with the expectation of economic clarity coupled with growing demand for space,\" said Peter Kolaczynski, director for Yardi Research, in a release.", "content_hash": "5dd039ed5fc5a000d6df59beff5e085d", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The deals are being closed and financial statements showing losses will be filed by February, the company said.\n\"We recognize this outcome is disappointing,\" Yieldstreet said in the investor letter. \"Yieldstreet pursued this extensive recovery effort because we are committed to exhausting every reasonable avenue for investor recovery.\"\nYieldstreet put its investors into deals totaling $89 million in loans that were supposed to be backed by 13 ships, according to a lawsuit filed by the startup against the borrower in that project. The loans float money to companies that take apart ships for scrap metal; the vessels themselves are the collateral on the deals.\nYieldstreet lost track of the ships and then pursued the borrower, which it accused of fraud. While it won monetary awards in a number of jurisdictions outside the U.S., the borrower avoided paying the startup by concealing their assets, Yieldstreet said in the August investor letter.\nThe episode garnered media coverage and in 2020 contributed to the collapse of a high-profile partnership with BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager.\nThe news of this latest loss follows CNBC's report last month that Yieldstreet customers in four real estate deals worth $78 million have been wiped out, with roughly $300 million of other deals on watchlist for possible losses.\nThis year, Yieldstreet changed its CEO and announced a new business model that leans more on distributing private market funds provided by established Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs and the Carlyle Group.\nIn a statement provided to CNBC, Yieldstreet said the investor letters refer to marine loan deals from 2018 and 2019 in an asset class that the firm no longer offers.\n\"While substantially less than the amounts invested by the funds and ultimately the investors, this settlement allows us to bring closure to litigation that could otherwise continue indefinitely,\" Yieldstreet said in the statement.\nThe firm \"takes its fiduciary responsibilities seriously and, throughout the recovery effort, advanced its own funds in an effort to protect its investors and has absorbed significant losses alongside its investors,\" the startup said.\nBitter end\nArman, an investor who plowed $180,000 into marine loans in 2019, called the result a bitter disappointment.

It will sideline major store renovations and development in the meantime.\nWhile the changes will vary based on the location, expect more seating, dark wood paneling and other tweaks that make its cafes cozier. The renovations will also include changes like less harsh lighting that won't affect customers with light sensitivity.\n\"We're uplifting more than 1,000 coffeehouses over the next year, blending our global heritage with local relevance to create spaces that are immersive, inclusive, and deeply human,\" Dawn Clark, Starbucks senior vice president of coffeehouse design and concepts, said in a statement to CNBC.\n\"Whether it's the laid-back warmth of the Palisades or the urban energy of Manhattan, intentional design encourages customers to stay longer, connect more, and return often — and translates into meaningful business impact,\" Clark said.\nStarbucks is planning to spend about $150,000 on each \"uplift,\" without closing the stores down. The company started with locations in New York, followed by cafes in Southern California.\nThe makeovers are intended to make the stores more welcoming, returning Starbucks to its prior status as a \"third place\" for customers to hang out between home and work. In recent years, Starbucks had lost that reputation, fueled by decisions like removing seats as mobile ordering become popular and getting rid of outlets to discourage lingering.\nUnder CEO Brian Niccol, the chain plans to reverse many of those decisions as it tries to break a sales slump. For example, he previously told employees in June that he plans to add back the 30,000 seats that had been removed from cafes.\nBut trying to appeal to a wider swath of customers isn't new for the company. Starbucks first unveiled an accessible store design in early 2024, before Niccol's tenure. At the time, the company said that the design took about two years and included input from baristas.\nTake a look inside a recently renovated New York City cafe near Manhattan's Union Square.\nBefore the renovation, the location lacked many decorative touches, besides some large-scale photos of the chain's Hacienda Alsacia, its coffee and research farm in Costa Rica.\nWith such sparse seating, the cafe's concrete floors were more obvious. Harsh lighting didn't help the store's appearance either.\nThe location now features much more seating near the entrance. Leather accents to the wraparound booth make the seats more comfortable. The tables are easily movable and at an accessible height for wheelchair users.\nStarbucks also brought back the electrical outlets that disappeared in prior makeovers. Now customers who want to study or work from the location can charge their laptops or phones, encouraging them to stay longer.\nLarge area rugs bring a cozy touch, in addition to dampening some of the cafe's ambient noise. Live plants also add to the homey vibe of the space.\nHigh-top tables, positioned closer to the barista bar, offer a seating option for customers looking to sit down with companions. The makeover adds 16 more seats to the location.\nStarbucks also changed out its lightbulbs to soften the store's lighting and reduce glare, giving it a warmer atmosphere. The improved lighting helps highlight an existing mural, seen on the right of the photo above.\nBehind the barista bar, the company added a large shelving unit that highlights bags of its coffee, plus decorative burlap sacks that hold beans. Touches of purple are a nod to the nearby New York University.\nCustomers waiting to pick up their drinks can sit off to the side. Previously, the area was a standing bar that wasn't accessible to wheelchair users.\nIn addition to adding rugs, Starbucks also improved the location's overall insulation to cut down on the clamor of a busy coffee shop. For baristas, the change means that conversations among customers are less likely to disturb their work, whether that's hearing an order correctly or focusing on making a latte.", "content_hash": "d6decec73068e181c917c3e83fd6eca7", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

An outsized 50-basis-point cut was starting to enter the conversation , though the odds on that were still low. The market, however, turned modestly lower later in the morning as investors tried to balance concerns about a slowing labor market with hopes for Fed rate cuts. \"Rates are going lower,\" Jim said, predicting a different scenario than a year ago when the Fed cut rates three times, starting in September 2024, and bond yields went up. \"This time, I think they cut [and] the long end goes down,\" including mortgage rates, according to Jim, who has stood firm on the notion that 30-year fixed-rate mortgages need to fall below 6.5% to stimulate the housing market. \"That's why the housing stocks had a move yesterday that indicated that you are going to see a gigantic explosion in housing stocks,\" Jim said. \"Home Depot was the star of the show, and that made sense to me because they told you this time is for real.\" Jim was referring to positive comments about business in the back half of the year, alongside the home improvement giant's earnings report.

You probably are hearing we'll be putting a fairly substantial tariff, or not that high, but a fairly substantial tariff.\"\nTrump had said last month during an event with Cook that he would impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports, while exempting products from companies that move their manufacturing to the U.S. At the time, Apple pledged to spend an additional $100 billion on a domestic manufacturing initiative, adding on a $500 billion announcement that Apple made in February.\nDuring Thursday's event, Trump noted that \"Tim Cook would be in pretty good shape,\" regarding the potential import levies.\nThe U.S. has been working to onshore its semiconductor supply chain for many years now. Since 2020, the world's largest semiconductor companies, such as TSMC and Samsung Electronics, have committed hundreds of billions of dollars to building plants in the U.S.\nThus, these major semiconductor companies are expected to receive exemptions under Trump's potential tariffs.

Gross margin decreased 1.1 percentage points to 58.5%, and operating margin decreased 210 basis points to 20.7%.\nChief Financial Officer Meghan Frank said on the call that the removal of the de minimis exemption, which excluded some smaller shipments from tariffs, will significantly affect the company, representing roughly 1.7 percentage points of the 2.2 percentage-point tariff-related decline in profit expected for the year.\nSame-store sales in the Americas were down 4%.

Lululemon said it added 14 net new stores during the second quarter, bringing its total to 784 stores.\n\"My view is that it's now time to reset many of our practices related to how we develop and create the range of products that will fuel the next phase of our growth,\" McDonald said Thursday. \"We have seen that when we get our product right, everything else can follow.\"\nLululemon projects third-quarter revenue will come in between $2.47 billion and $2.50 billion compared to Wall Street estimates of $2.57 billion. The company said it expects earnings per share in the next quarter to come in between $2.18 and $2.23 per share, compared to an estimate of $2.93 per share.\nMcDonald said on the Thursday call that he believes the company has let its product lifecycles \"run too long,\" particularly in its lounge and social categories.\n\"We have become too predictable within our casual offerings and missed opportunities to create new trends,\" he said, identifying those issues as the \"root causes\" of the company's product challenges in the U.S.\n\"Our lounge and social product offerings have become stale and have not been resonating with guests,\" McDonald added.\nTo regain its U.S. momentum, McDonald said the company plans to increase its new styles from 23% of its overall assortment to 35% next spring, and improve its fast-track design capabilities. He said Lululemon will not make any short-term decisions that \"could hurt or damage\" the brand in the long term.\n\"We are not satisfied with the results for the quarter, and we know our brand can and will perform better than these results,\" McDonald said.", "content_hash": "64ec4d2fc42de764869a621a3994da42", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

In other words, when they underperform their benchmark, that underperformance is relatively large.\nConversely, active managers generally fare better in less liquid areas of the market, like fixed income, real estate, and small-cap and emerging-market stocks, Armour said.\nFor example, 43% of actively managed high-yield bond mutual funds and ETFs beat their index counterparts in the past 10-year period, according to Morningstar.\nFees are the key\nFees are the key driver of index funds' success when compared to active funds, Armour said.\nIndex funds carry a 0.11% average asset-weighted annual fee, while active funds carry a 0.59% fee, according to Morningstar.\nActive funds need to have higher relative returns just to overcome that fee differential.\nBeyond that, higher fees also eat into investor earnings. For example, an investor with $100,000 who earns 4% per year and pays a 0.25% fund fee would have $208,000 after 20 years, while the same investor paying a 1% fee would have $179,000, or $29,000 less, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSince index funds own all the securities in a broad market index, they are guaranteed to own the relative winners and losers. While active managers may own more of the winners than their index counterparts, they also risk missing out, Armour said.\nMany active managers took risk off the table in April when President Donald Trump first announced so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs, but the market then proceeded to rebound quickly, Armour said.", "content_hash": "c2a9d0a6130efefe94053158e8e00dbe", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The agreement reached in July had included Japan purchasing 100 Boeing planes, 75% higher imports of U.S. rice and $8 billion worth of agricultural and crop products.\nWashington will apply a baseline 15% tariff on nearly all Japanese imports, with separate sector-specific levies for automobiles and parts (also 15%), aerospace products, generic pharmaceutical goods and natural resources, according to the executive order.\nThe Thursday order prevents Trump's country-specific tariffs on top of existing levies. The lower tariffs will apply retroactively to Japanese goods \"entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 7, 2025,\" the order stated. The tariff relief on automobiles is set to take effect after seven days.\nTrump's global tariff campaign has thrown the global supply chain into disarray, in particular Japan's massive auto sector. Last month, Toyota warned that it expected a hit of nearly $10 billion as Trump's tariffs on autos weighed on its sales to the U.S., forcing it to slash by 16% its forecast for full-year operating profits.\nTariffs are expected to hit rivals as well, with Ford's pre-tax adjusted profit reportedly set to drop $3 billion while GM projects $4 billion to $5 billion hit for the year.\nJapan's top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, who was in Washington, delivered a letter from Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba inviting Trump to visit his country, Kyoto News reported. The Japanese official had reportedly canceled his trip to the U.S. last month as some sticking points required \"further technical discussion.\"\nPolitical tides\nThe finalizing of the deal came as political pressure for the Japanese leader mounts at home. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party earlier this week released a long-awaited report on why it lost seats in the upper house election in July.\nThe report ascribed the loss to the lack of appeal for the party's measures aimed at taming inflation, previous political scandals and weak mobilization of young voters.\nLocal media reports suggested many key members of the LDP have signaled their intention to resign to the prime minister, while Ishiba has said he intends to stay on amid calls within his party for choosing another leader.\nThough the reports have avoided naming individuals, they signal an \"implicit indictment of Ishiba's leadership of the party,\" said James Brady, vice president at political consultancy Teneo.\nAnalysts at Eurasia Group suggested in a report Friday that Ishiba is unlikely to survive a challenge from within the party next Monday, when a vote on whether to bring forward a leadership election is expected to take place.\n\"Ishiba's poor performance as party leader in lower and upper house elections and events in recent days, including former prime minister Aso Taro announcing his support for the special election, have turned the tide against Ishiba,\" analysts said, predicting a 60% odd of Ishiba's defeat in the election, with him possibly resigning before the vote takes place as internal discontent grows.", "content_hash": "f6d82ea4737a68384b0cbe9cbf00590e", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., argued that not everyone can walk into a pharmacy and get a Covid shot now.\nThe FDA's new limits have complicated Covid shot access in the U.S., which now depends on a patient's age and risk level, laws and policies in their state, insurance coverage, and health-care provider. Pending CDC guidance, some pharmacies have added prescription requirements for Covid vaccines in certain states.\n\"You clearly are taking away vaccines,\" she said after a prolonged shouting match with Kennedy.\nKennedy's comments before the Senate Finance Committee come after he repeatedly promised the panel in January that he would do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it more difficult or discourages people from taking vaccines. Since then, he has canceled funding for mRNA shot development and made other vaccine policy changes that could limit access to immunizations, including gutting the CDC vaccine panel and dropping Covid shot recommendations for certain groups.\nHis comments also follow a leadership shake-up at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The White House last week fired CDC Director Susan Monarez, and four senior agency officials resigned shortly after, with some of them citing the politicization of the agency and a threat to public health. In an opinion piece on Thursday, Monarez accused Kennedy of \"a deliberate effort to weaken America's public-health system and vaccine protections.\"\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X in support of Kennedy on Thursday, writing that he \"is taking flak because he's over the target\" and saying Democrats were attacking the Trump administration's \"commonsense effort.\"\nKennedy touted skepticism around Covid vaccines, despite evidence of their safety and effectiveness.\n\"We were told again and again the vaccines would prevent transmission, they prevent infection. It wasn't true. They knew it from the start,\" Kennedy said.\nHe also said he does not know how many people died of Covid and whether the vaccines prevented deaths from the virus.\n\"I would like to see the data and talk about the data,\" Kennedy said.\nBut data is readily available from dozens of studies. One paper in August estimates that Covid vaccines saved more than 2 million lives, mostly among older adults, worldwide between 2020 and October 2024.\nThe CDC website also says that Covid vaccines from the 2023 to 2024 season reduced the risk of severe illness from Covid by almost 70% in the first two months after vaccination in adults ages 18 and older, with protection gradually declining over time.\nThose shots also decreased the risk of hospitalization due to Covid by around 50% in the first two months of vaccination in that same population. The Covid vaccines showed similar benefits in older adults.\nKennedy also defended his decision to fire all 17 previous members of the CDC vaccine panel, saying he didn't politicize the committee.\n\"What we did is we got rid of the conflicts of interest. ... We depoliticized and put great scientists on it from a very diverse group,\" the HHS secretary said. \"They are very, very pro-vaccine.\"\nBut a new analysis published last month from USC researchers found that conflicts of interest on that panel had been at \"historic lows for years\" before Kennedy restacked it with new members, some of whom are widely known vaccine critics.\nCorrection: Kennedy testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday.

During the visit, Altman said India was OpenAI's second-largest market by number of users.\nHe has subsequently said that AI adoption in India is \"amazing to watch.\"\n\"We love to see the explosion of creativity--india is outpacing the world,\" he said on X earlier this year.\nIndia is one of ChatGPT's fastest-growing markets globally, Nick Patience, practice lead for AI at tech research and analysis firm Futurum Group, told CNBC. \"OpenAI's India focus is a strategic move to gain a competitive edge,\" he added.\nHere's a rundown of how OpenAI is expanding in India.\nChatGPT explosion\nChatGPT, OpenAI's core product, has seen strong growth in India. The app was downloaded 10.2 million times in India in August, a huge jump from the 2.5 million downloads seen during the same month last year, according to analytics firm Appfigures.\nSince its launch, ChatGPT has 111 million downloads in India, ahead of its 80 million downloads in the U.S, Appfigures data shows.\nDownloads do not necessarily equal daily or monthly users, but the figures emphasise OpenAI's growth trajectory in the country.\nThe download numbers are also far ahead of rivals, including Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude. The closest challenger was Perplexity, Appfigures said, which had 6.4 million downloads in August.\nIndia-specific product\nUser spending on ChatGPT has been increasing. To date, Indian users have spent $21.3 million on ChatGPT, Appfigures data shows. In comparison, U.S. users have spent $784 million.\nThat underlines the fact that while the number of users in India is huge, it remains a price-sensitive market.\nTo address this, OpenAI in August launched ChatGPT Go, a low-cost 399-rupees-($4.53)-a-month plan for its AI app.\n\"It's a classic wedge strategy to capture a price-sensitive market and build a user base that will be difficult for local players to dislodge later,\" Futurum Group's Patience said of the strategy.\nInfrastructure and hiring\nAccording to Bloomberg, OpenAI is scouting a location in India for a data center with at least 1-gigawatt capacity. The facility will be part of OpenAI's Stargate-branded infrastructure push, Bloomberg said this week, although CNBC was unable to verify the report.\nThe ChatGPT developer said last month that it would open a local office in the market and is currently advertising three sales roles in India.\nIt also announced last month an education program in India that will include funding for research and provide half a million ChatGPT licenses for educators and students across the country.\nIndia challenges\nWhile India doesn't have a home-grown artificial intelligence company as big as OpenAI, there are some challengers in the form of domestic startups, including Sarvam AI and Krutrim, and other American tech giants like Google and Meta.\nContinued geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and India over trade, however, have the potential to cause complications if there's any backlash from New Delhi against American tech firms.\nOpenAI is also locked in a legal battle with Asian News International in India, which has accused the ChatGPT developer of using copyrighted material illegally. It's a closely-watched case in the country for how copyright laws apply in the AI era.\n\"OpenAI's success in India is not guaranteed and depends heavily on its ability to navigate these legal and political hurdles,\" Futurum Group's Patience said.\n\"While the Indian market is vast, its diversity in languages and user needs presents challenges. OpenAI's ability to deliver a truly localized product and its long-term impact on India's AI talent remain uncertain.\"", "content_hash": "2cc597ecf6d6154ddb53c663447feaee", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

A similar buyout program will be offered in 2026 for those who operate in these locations.\n\"We recognize this represents a significant change for many, and we're committed to supporting you throughout this transition,\" Ellison wrote. \"We will work closely with managers to ensure you have the time and flexibility to make the necessary adjustments.\"", "content_hash": "8866292b5edce610dfa7c98fd815aa9e", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona, introduced a bill on Thursday — titled the You Earn It, You Keep it Act — to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits. A House version of the bill was introduced by Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minnesota, in April.\nGallego's bill would permanently eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits.\nIt would also expand the Social Security payroll tax to apply to annual earnings over $250,000. Currently, the maximum earnings subject to Social Security payroll taxes is $176,100 in 2025. Consequently, high earners may only pay into the program for part of the year.\n\"Despite decades of paying into the system, seniors are still forced to pay taxes on their hard-earned benefits — all while the ultra wealthy barely pay into the system,\" Gallego said in a statement.\nHow Social Security benefits are taxed\nSocial Security recipients may owe federal income taxes on their benefits depending on their income.\nHow much they may owe is based on a formula known as combined income — the sum of adjusted gross income, tax-exempt interest income and half of Social Security benefits.\nUp to 50% of benefits may be taxed for individual tax filers with between $25,000 and $34,000 in combined income, or married couples who file jointly with between $32,000 and $44,000.\nUp to 85% of benefits may be taxable for individuals with more than $34,000 in combined income or couples with more than $44,000.\nHow the 'big beautiful' tax law helps seniors\nRepublicans' new \"big beautiful\" law includes a new senior deduction aimed at helping to defray the effects of federal taxes on Social Security benefits.\nAdults aged 65 and over may be able to claim an additional deduction of up to $6,000.\nWhether beneficiaries will benefit from the change will depend on their income.\nThe full deduction will be available to individual taxpayers with up to $75,000 in modified adjusted gross income or married couples with up to $150,000. The deduction will gradually phase out for taxpayers with incomes above those thresholds.\nThe temporary deduction — which will be in effect for tax years 2025 through 2028 — will be available to eligible taxpayers regardless of whether they take the standard deduction or itemize their returns.\nMiddle-income taxpayers stand to benefit the most from the policy, according to tax experts, since low earners may already be exempt from federal taxes on benefits and higher earners will be above the phaseout thresholds.\nHow 'You Earn It, You Keep It' may affect Social Security\nUnlike the temporary senior deduction recently signed into law, Gallego's You Earn It, You Keep It proposal would eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits for all beneficiaries.\nTo be sure, it remains to be seen whether it may get enough support to become law.\nThe proposal does have the support of The Senior Citizens League, a nonpartisan senior advocacy group that is petitioning Congress to stop taxing Social Security benefits. Eliminating federal taxes on Social Security benefits is a \"commonsense step to ensure older Americans can keep more of what they've earned,\" Senior Citizens League Executive Director Shannon Benton said in a statement.\nEfforts to change the federal taxation of Social Security benefits come as the program is facing a trust fund shortfall. Benefits may be reduced within the next decade unless Congress enacts changes sooner, according to projections from Social Security's trustees.\nBecause the \"big beautiful\" law did not include any offsets for the reduced revenue from federal taxes on benefits, it would accelerate the depletion dates, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\nIn contrast, the You Earned It, You Keep It proposal would extend the Social Security trust funds' ability to pay benefits in full and on time for 24 years, or until 2058, according to Gallego's office. That matches an analysis of Craig's House proposal by Social Security's chief actuary in April.", "content_hash": "c9191b29aba6f9e461228cb296b7877b", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

And the industry as a whole is facing some troubling obstacles.\nCanadian visitation to the U.S. has plummeted some 40% this year, following comments by President Donald Trump about Canada as a potential 51st U.S. state and evolving trade policies. The Canadian dollar has also weakened, lessening the buying power of visitors crossing the border into the U.S.\nHornbuckle also pointed to massive price hikes for a U.S. visa, from $100 to $350, where a family of four visiting for the Ryder Cup, World Cup or Olympics in 2028, for example, could pay $1,400 for visa documents alone.\n\"International travel in 2016 had a $50 billion U.S. surplus. Today it's a $50 billion deficit,\" Hornbuckle said.\nThe government's commitment to funding marketing and promotion of U.S. travel was also slashed by 80% in the most recent spending bill, to $20 million.\n\"We obviously find ourselves in a world that has a fair amount of uncertainty from a macroeconomic perspective, from a socio-political perspective,\" Marriott CEO Tony Capuano told investors at the BofA conference Thursday. \"Marriott, and the sector more broadly, thrives in times of certainty and stability. So that creates some measure of challenge.\"\nCapuano said there's been a slight uptick after Labor Day in some segments of travel. He said Marriott sees spending restrained in budget travelers and small businesses. But he described demand for luxury travel as \"sturdy.\"\nWyndham Hotel and Resorts CEO Geoff Ballotti laid out an optimistic view of the travel industry, noting robust demand for extended stay, driven in part by projects supporting the government's infrastructure spending.\n\"You're seeing incredible interest in investment right now,\" Ballotti told CNBC. \"Our new construction pipeline, 20 consecutive quarters of growth, is at an all-time high.

As of September 3, the stock was trading at $161.52, which means the new price target implies an upside of 31.87%.\nAccording to the analyst, customers are finally starting to take AMD seriously. Instead of just being a backup option or a bargaining chip against Nvidia, AMD is now being considered for some pretty large AI projects.\nStein argued that AMD’s situation today is a lot like when it first started gaining traction in the server chip space. Back then, it had less than 1% of the market until the launch of its “Rome” chips, which helped it grab a bigger slice as Intel ran into issues.\nLooking ahead, the analyst thinks AMD could eventually grab about 10% of the burgeoning GPU market, compared to the current 6%. He’s also raised his earnings forecast and now sees AMD earning $7.89 per share by 2027. To put that in context, the current year EPS estimates stand at $3.85 per share. Stein expects that to more than double in two years as the company is expected to grow its revenue as well as expand margins. A big part of that confidence comes from AMD’s new MI355 chip, which he expects will play a major role in the company’s growth moving forward.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Starting October 1, 2025, people who don’t live with the main account holder will no longer be able to use the Prime free shipping perk unless they buy their own membership. This was announced on September 2, signaling a move to tighten who can use Prime benefits.\nInstead of the old sharing system, Amazon will focus more on its Amazon Family plan. This plan allows one adult to share benefits with another adult, up to four children, and four teens, as long as they all live at the same address.\nThe change comes after reports showed fewer new Prime signups in the U.S. before this year’s Prime Day compared to last year. Prime Day lasted four days this summer, and although growth was slower in the U.S., Amazon said signups were record-breaking worldwide.\nBy limiting how benefits are shared, Amazon wants to push more people to sign up on their own. This could help boost revenue, especially as the number of new U.S. members starts to slow down.

On Friday, directors proposed a 10-year pay package that could deliver Musk as much as $1 trillion in stock awards if the company clears a set of extraordinary performance hurdles.\nSuggested Reading\nThe deal would grant Musk roughly 423 million Tesla shares, currently worth about $143 billion, but the full value only materializes if Tesla executes on a series of rather ambitious targets.\nRelated Content\nThe first tranche would vest when Tesla’s market capitalization hits and sustains $2 trillion, with additional tranches tied to every $500 billion increment after that, up to $6.5 trillion. The final tranches vest if Tesla reaches $8.5 trillion in market value — a target that would make it far and away the most valuable publicly traded company on earth.\nBut valuation alone won’t do it. Under the pay package, Tesla must also deliver 20 million vehicles annually, put 1 million autonomous robotaxis into commercial service, deliver 1 million Optimus humanoid robots, and sign up 10 million active subscriptions for its Full Self-Driving software. On the financial side, the bar is just as high: Adjusted EBITDA must start at $50 billion and eventually reach $400 billion over four consecutive quarters, even as Tesla continues to pour billions into AI and robotics R&D.\nIf Musk clears all those hurdles, his ownership stake could more than double — from about 12% of outstanding shares today to more than 25%. That would give him even greater control over Tesla’s direction at a time when the company is trying to reinvent itself as an AI and robotics powerhouse, not just an electric carmaker.\nFor Tesla’s board, the calculation is simple: Musk is Tesla.\n“The biggest asset for Tesla is Musk,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a Friday note, maintaining his “Outperform” rating and sky-high $500 price target. He argued the package was “critical to keep Musk at the helm” through what he described as the company’s most consequential growth cycle, with autonomy and robotics “front and center.” The proxy filing also calls for a nonbinding shareholder vote on a strategic investment in Musk’s xAI startup, designed to accelerate Tesla’s AI development and create what the company claims could be one of the most powerful AI platforms in the world.\nLately, though, Tesla’s EV engine has sputtered, and that weakness has only magnified concerns about Musk’s attention span.\nTesla’s second-quarter deliveries fell 13% year over year to 384,122 vehicles, its second consecutive quarterly drop and the sharpest mid-year slowdown since 2022. Revenues slipped 12%, and profit fell 16%, with Europe and China showing the steepest losses. The stumbles come as rivals such as BYD extend their lead in China and European incumbents eat into Tesla’s market share. The company’s energy-storage business is still growing, but it’s nowhere near large enough to offset the shortfall in cars.\nAgainst that backdrop, Musk has been increasingly preoccupied with politics and side projects. He accepted a role heading President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), said he was starting a third political party (the “America Party”), name-called the president, and pushed controversial policies on X — all while Tesla’s core business has struggled.\nShareholders have noticed. Some have openly pressed Musk to commit at least 40 hours a week to Tesla, worried that his forays into Washington and social media are draining focus at a time when execution is critical. For the board, the trillion-dollar pay package is less a bonus than a tether — an attempt to bind Musk to Tesla through 2030 and assure investors that the CEO remains fully engaged in the company’s make-or-break pivot from EVs to autonomy and AI.\nThat means that this package carries major implications for Tesla’s governance and shareholder structure. If Musk meets its ambitious targets, his stake in the company could more than double, consolidating greater control in one individual as Tesla’s oversight faces legal scrutiny. A Delaware court voided Musk’s previous $56 billion compensation deal in January 2024, ruling that the board failed to exercise sufficient independence in approving it. That decision, now under appeal, forced Tesla to assemble a $29 billion interim award last month while it worked on a long-term plan.\nThe stakes extend beyond compensation. For Tesla, the package is a statement of intent about what the company is trying to become. The company, which once lived or died by Model 3 deliveries, is pitching itself as a leader in artificial intelligence, autonomy, and robotics — a transition that apparently requires both investor patience and Musk’s sustained involvement at the center of the company’s evolution, even as he juggles SpaceX, X, and a growing portfolio of AI ventures.\nThe plan now goes to shareholders, with a vote scheduled for Nov. 6. And those shareholders face a familiar question: How much turbulence are they willing to tolerate in exchange for growth? They’ve long accepted volatility, governance drama, and Musk’s distractions so long as Tesla kept climbing. This package asks them to double down.

Musk’s previous pay package, which added significantly to his massive wealth, also laid out ambitious growth plans that once appeared to be a reach – but which Tesla proved able to reach easily.\nThe new pay package could grant Musk 423.7 million additional shares of Tesla stock. Those shares would be be worth $143.5 billion at today’s stock value.\nBut Musk would get those shares only if the value of Tesla stock increases significantly in coming years. The company stock would need to reach an overall value of $8.5 trillion for Musk to get all the shares, significantly above the current market capitalization of $1.1 trillion\nThose 423.7 million new shares that Musk would get under this package would be worth close to $1 trillion should the company hit the increased valuation targets spelled out in Friday’s proxy statement.\nIf Tesla shares are able to reach the $8.5 billion market capitalization value, it could become the most valuable company ever. It would be worth roughly double the current market value of Nvidia (NVDA), the current most-valuable company on the market. Tesla is already the most valuable automaker by a large margin, even though legacy automakers, like second-most valuable automaker Toyota, sell far more vehicles and now make more profits.\nProposal for Tesla in invest in xAI\nThe company’s proxy statement that laid out Musk’s payment plan also included a shareholder proposal that Tesla take a stake in privately-held xAI, the artificial intelligence company that Musk also owns. That could help Elon Musk further consolidate his growing business empire.\nXAI recently purchased X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, which Musk bought for $44 billion of his own money in 2022. The company did not take a position for or against that shareholder proposal, which does not give any details of how large a stake Tesla should take in xAI, and what price.\nBut any such investment could further enrich Tesla since Musk is the primary owner of xAI.\nMusk currently owns 410 million shares of Tesla shares, worth $139 billion at Thursday’s closing price. That stake, along with his stakes in xAI, rocket company SpaceX, and several other companies he has started and runs, have made him the richest person on the planet, worth $378 billion according to Bloomberg’s billionaire tracker.\nHe currently has options to buy an additional 304 million shares of Tesla, but a judge in Delaware has twice struck down that 2018 pay package that granted him those options as illegal. Those rulings came despite overwhelming approval by Tesla shareholders – twice. The company again has tried to grant those options to Musk this year, and adding in those options, he now owns 18% of the company’s shares.\nTesla shares nearly doubled in value to a record-high price for its shares between election day and mid-December 2024, as investors bet that his close ties to President Donald Trump would be a boon for Tesla. But as Tesla faced protests and dropping sales and falling profits in backlash to those ties (before he had a falling out with Trump), all those things resulted in Telsa’s stock losing those gains. The shares have recovered some of those losses, but they are still down 26% from the December peak.\nStill, Musk and his fans on Wall Street have insisted the company is well positioned to grow even larger and more successful in the future. He has continued to predict that his plans for self-driving cars – including a robotaxi service – will create massive profits and value for shareholders. The robotaxis would provide rides to passengers andalso allow Tesla owners to rent out their cars for driverless rides when not in use.\nMusk has also promised a line of humanoid robots that could bring in even more sales than Tesla’s car business.\nKeeping Musk focused on Tesla\n“It’s a big pay package but Tesla needs to keep its biggest asset in Musk as CEO,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told CNN Friday. Ives is one of the bigger Tesla bulls on Wall Street.\n“In this AI era Musk now will drive its next leg of growth,” Ives added. “The Board had a $1 trillion dollar decision and made the right one.”\nThe board’s proxy statement spoke of the importance of keeping Musk focused on Tesla going forward. In addition to his many business interests, he remains active in politics, despite his falling out with President Trump. He has announced plans to form a third political party.\nTesla, in its proxy statement, warned that it needed to incentivize Musk to focus his attention on growing the company. It said that during the negotiations on the pay package, “Musk also raised the possibility that he may pursue other interests that may afford him greater influence if he did not receive such assurances.”\nThe board said it “believes that Mr. Musk singularly possesses the leadership characteristics necessary to transform Tesla and realize its long-term mission at an unparalleled level.”\nBut the company said it is also making plans for life after Elon Musk, saying it is already working on succession plans. And it said that one of the terms of the employment package that Musk must meet to receive the final 70 million shares of stock is that he needs to have “developed a framework for Chief Executive Officer succession.”\n“The board regularly discusses management succession planning and leadership development,” said the proxy statement. It said those succession plans are “for both sudden, unanticipated events, in addition to longer-term planned succession for its executives.” It said it “believes that management has developed a robust pipeline of seasoned leadership talent within Tesla,” and that is also looking at possible external talent.\nMusk does not receive a cash salary from Tesla. All of his compensation comes from Tesla shares and options he has been granted in the past. Since there is still an ongoing court fight over the 304 million options, Musk has not received any compensation for nearly a decade, since a 2012 pay package made its last disbursement of options to him in 2017.\nBut not all tech billionaires receive additional stock options or grants as compensation, instead benefiting from the increased valuations of their existing stakes in their companies. That includes Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, who co-founded Facebook. Both took large stakes in their companies as founders, but neither has received stock grants or options since those companies had initial public offerings in 1997 and 2012, respectively.\nIf Musk and his fans are right, Musk would become far wealthier even without any additional shares of Tesla stock. His current holdings of 410 million Tesla shares, even without the disputed 304 million options, would be worth nearly $1 trillion more than today’s valuation, should Tesla’s market cap rise to $8.5 billion.\nDespite promises, Tesla faces problems\nBut to achieve that target, it would have to start doing the things Musk is promising in terms of self-driving vehicles and its robotaxi. And that would mean meeting grand claims from a man and company that have often fallen short of their promises.\nTesla critics say that the stock has become grossly overvalued because of Wall Street’s willingness to buy into Musk’s vision of the future in terms of AI, self-driving vehicles and robots, despite its failures to deliver on past promises along those lines.\n“Elon Musk has been saying since 2014 ‘we will have a fully autonomous car next year.’ It hasn’t happened, but that promise has been valued in the billions by Wall Street,” said analyst Gordon Johnson, one of the harsher critics of Tesla. “Elon Musk is a master manipulator. He’s been able to keep the stock elevated. The reason the board is paying him is he’s willing to say things that other CEOs aren’t willing to say or get away with.”\nTesla is facing growing competition from Chinese EV makers. BYD, one of those Chinese automakers, is poised to pass Tesla for the most EV sales worldwide, even though it is not available for sale in the United States.\nTesla also faces competition from other companies that are ahead of it in providing robotaxi services, including Waymo, the autonomous vehicle unit of Google parent Alphabet, which has its own service and has partnered with Uber in some cities.\nAnd a change in US law is about to remove a $7,500 tax credit for buyers of most electric vehicles, which could cause prices and sales of those vehicles to fall sharply.\nUS law also recently removed the billions of dollars in penalties that traditional automakers have had to pay if their gas-powered vehicles exceed emissions rules. The way that they avoided those payments in the past was by buying regulatory credits from an EV maker like Tesla. But the payments that brought billions in revenue to Tesla will now vanish.\nJohnson said that Tesla’s stock price is therefore unlikely to hit the ambitious targets laid out in this Musk pay package.\n“Things are going to get worse for them, not better,” said Johnson. “Is Tesla going to go to $8 trillion? Abso-f**king-lutely not.”\nShares of Tesla (TSLA) were up about 5% in early trading on the news.\nThis story has been updated with additional context and reporting.", "content_hash": "28206ee41bf2c8a5606e559144c0c464", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The Dominican Republic is the first market in the Caribbean served by Amazon Air Cargo, the wholesale business unit established in late September 2024 help fill aircraft with heavy shipments independent from Amazon’s parcel ecosystem.\nALK Global Logistics was previously listed on Amazon Air Cargo’s website as a partner, but prior to Wednesday no details were available about what their contractual arrangement involved.\nAmazon Air manages a fleet of about 100 passenger-to-cargo converted aircraft to support next-day and two-day package delivery for the Amazon marketplace. Amazon Air Cargo is the direct sales channel to logistics providers and other businesses seeking to move general cargo by air.\nALK is the fourth Amazon Air Cargo customer that has been publicly promoted, although the company’s website lists a handful of other users. The flights connect Miami and Santo Domingo with seven weekly frequencies. Amazon outsources the flying to contractor 21 Air, according to flight activity on Flightradar24.\nAerodom, the operator of Las Américas International Airport (SDQ), is collaborating with ALK to fill the flights with cargo.\n“This new route positions us at the forefront of logistics in the region, allowing exporters and importers to benefit from faster and more reliable solutions,” said ALK Chief Executive Officer Alfonso Alemán, in a news release.\nSDQ is the Dominican Republic’s primary air cargo gateway and is experiencing an influx of e-commerce traffic. A new terminal is dedicated to express parcels and e-commerce shipments, with capacity for 4 million additional packages per year.\nIn the spring, Amazon began operating daily flights between Miami and Bogota, carrying e-commerce packages to Colombia and returning with shipments tendered by the cargo division of flag-carrier Avianca. Those flights are also operated by 21 Air.\nAmazon engages all-cargo airlines to operate its fleet because it doesn’t have an air operator’s certifcate.\nIn July, Air Premia, a passenger airline based in South Korea, entered into a transportation services agreement with Amazon Air Cargo under which it transfers belly cargo to Amazon at Honolulu airport for onward carriage to the continental United States. Those Amazon flights utilize Airbus A330-330 converted freighters operated by Hawaiian Airlines, which was acquired last year by Alaska Airlines. Once at U.S. hubs, the Air Premia shipments are relayed to 45 cities, including Atlanta and Houston, through the Amazon Air network.", "content_hash": "79e5437d42449b19b4257fabeedf1cda", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

His supporting statement reads:\nTesla’s integration of Grok into its vehicles demonstrates the tangible benefits of collaboration with xAI. As Tesla pivots toward AI-driven technologies, including Full Self-Driving and robotics, a strategic investment in xAI would secure access to advanced AI capabilities, enhance product innovation, and drive shareholder value.\nThe board, which often suggests investors vote against shareholder proposals, is neutral on this one.\nIf Tesla does end up investing in xAI, it would be the second of Musk’s companies to do so. SpaceX, Musk’s aerospace company, has committed to investing $2 billion in xAI as part of a $5 billion equity raise. Analysts have speculated that SpaceX’s involvement in xAI could signal the AI firm is having trouble raising from outside investors. (Musk also merged X, the company formerly known as Twitter, with xAI earlier this year.)\nSome Tesla shareholders have argued that xAI is a rival to Tesla, since Musk has often described his EV company as an AI company. Last year, shareholders sued Musk and the company for allowing Musk to startup a rival AI firm, but the case was dismissed.\nHawk’s proposal comes as Tesla grapples with weakening EV sales and a lackluster robotaxi rollout. The company has attempted to direct investor attention away from those headwinds and towards Tesla’s AI efforts, which center on testing and deploying autonomous vehicles and Optimus, its humanoid robot.\nMusk has argued that he requires more of a controlling stake in Tesla to lead the company’s AI efforts, rather than get distracted by his other AI company. Alongside the proposal to invest in xAI, shareholders will vote on a Tesla-backed 10-year compensation plan for Musk that could give him more than 25% control.\nThe filing comes as Tesla continues to appeal a Delaware judge’s decision to strike down Musk’s earlier $56 billion pay package. The new plan would tie Musk’s compensation to ambitious benchmarks, including boosting Tesla’s market value from about $1 trillion today to more than $8 trillion.\n“Tesla’s not going to get to $8 trillion market cap based on FSD and robotaxi. To get to that $8 trillion, you kind of need xAI,” Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, told TechCrunch. “We’re talking numbers that have historically been inconceivable. To get to those, we need things to happen that are inconceivable right now.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid roughly 0.4%. The declines mark a pullback from sizable gains earlier in the session.\nThe US economy added just 22,000 jobs in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was far short of expectations for 75,000 and adds more evidence to the narrative of a dramatically slowing US labor market. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, compared with 4.2% the previous month.\nRevisions to data from July and June in Friday's report suggest that over the last three months, the US economy has created fewer than 30,000 new jobs. The revisions also showed a negative print in June, the first labor market shrinkage since 2020.\nThe jobs report, the first since President Trump fired the head of the BLS, capped a week of data showing cracks in the labor market. That has fed Wall Street's certainty that a rate cut is coming at the Federal Reserve's September meeting. Traders are now pricing in a 100% chance of a reduction, and bets are rising on a \"jumbo,\" 50-basis-point cut.\nTreasury yields sank following the report, with the 30-year yield (^TYX) falling below 4.79% after nearing 5% earlier in the week. The benchmark 10-year yield (^TNX) dropped to 4.07%, its lowest since April.\nAfter the release, Trump voiced further criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell in a social media post. \"Jerome 'Too Late' Powell should have lowered rates long ago. As usual, he’s 'Too Late!'\" he wrote. His comment comes a day after a Senate hearing to confirm Trump pick Stephen Miran as Fed governor, as the White House tries to recast the Fed in pursuit of rate cuts.\nMeanwhile, AI trade hopes got a boost after an upbeat outlook from Broadcom (AVGO) and a report that the US company has signed a deal to build OpenAI's (OPAI.PVT) first chips.

As usual, he’s 'Too Late!' Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Friday.\nTrump's continued tirade against Powell — and of late, his push to remove Fed governor Lisa Cook — have put the independence of the central bank in question. The president is seen as looking to recast the powerful institution in pursuit of interest-rate cuts.\nHis comments followed a weaker-than-expected August jobs report from the BLS — the first since Trump ousted the head of the agency in the wake of the July reading.\nAt the same time, revisions to job addition figures in previous months showed that June was the first month of shrinkage since 2020.\nThose numbers lifted investor confidence in rate cuts from the Fed to new highs, with traders now pricing in 100% odds of a reduction when policymakers meet later in September.\nBroadcom adds nearly $140 billion after quarterly results show strong AI chip demand, Nvidia sheds $160 billion\nAI chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) added $138.5 billion to its market capitalization in intraday trading Friday after its third quarter results surpassed Wall Street's expectations and the company added a new AI customer (reportedly OpenAI) set to bring in $10 billion in revenue.\nShares of the company touched an all-time intraday high of $356.24 during Friday's trading session before paring gains slightly to hover above $330.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) shed $160.6 billion from its own market cap. Bank of America (BAC) analyst Vivek Arya said in a note to clients that while Nvidia shares could experience near term pressure as Broadcom captures greater market share of the AI chip space, \"the AI pie could just be getting bigger.\"\nNvidia stock fell 3.6% Friday. It remains the most valuable company in the world, with a value over $4 trillion.\nIts AI chipmaking rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) also suffered, with shares dropping nearly 6.8% in intraday trading.\nJobs slowdown seals Fed rate cut as White House criticizes Powell for not acting sooner\nYahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports:\nRead more here.\nTesla stock rises after $1 trillion pay package for Musk is put forward\nTesla's (TSLA) stock popped as much as 4.9% on Friday after the EV maker's board put forward a plan to compensate CEO Elon Musk with a pay package worth roughly $1 trillion, if he achieves certain milestones.\nThose milestones include driving Tesla's market cap to $8.5 trillion and putting 1 million of its Robotaxis into commercial operation, according to the proposal outlined in an SEC filing.\nThis pay package would provide Musk with an additional 423 million shares of common stock, or 12% of Tesla shares. That means he would have roughly 25% voting power over the company's decisions, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients Friday.\nIves said the voting power provision was \"critical to keep Musk at the helm to lead Tesla through the most critical time in the company’s history.\"\n\"We believe this was the smart move by the Board as the biggest asset for Tesla is Musk,\" Ives said, adding: \"[T]his is a crucial time for Tesla ahead, with autonomous and robotics front and center.\"\nThe stock pared gains shortly after the market open, and was up more than 2% in mid-morning.\nTech leads stocks higher at the open\nUS stocks jumped at the open on Friday as investors digested a weak August jobs report, which pushed investor confidence in a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting even higher.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.4%, coming off a fresh all-time closing high for the index on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.6%.\nTech stocks' surge was led by gains in Tesla (TSLA) and Broadcom (AVGO) shares, which added 3.6% and 12.8% at the start of Friday's trading session.\nRate cut bets surge after jobs report\nBets on coming Fed rate cuts are surging after the jobs report.\nCME Group had the odds of a cut very high before the report — around 97% to 3%. But after it confirmed the severe summer slowdown, the odds almost immediately shifted to 100% on a 25-point cut this month.\nSubsequently, traders piled into bets on a \"jumbo\" rate cut — 50 basis points. As of around 9:10 a.m. ET, about 88% of bets are on a 25-point cut, and 12% of bets are for 50 points.\nBets are also jumping on cuts in October and December. By the end of the year, a majority of traders expect the equivalent of three rate cuts.\nThe first negative jobs print since 2020\nThe revisions to the monthly jobs report have taken high focus lately. On Friday, we learned something very noteworthy from them: June 2025 was the first month of labor market shrinkage since 2020.\nJune's number was revised to show a net loss of 13,000 jobs. That's the first negative monthly jobs print since December 2020, in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs my colleague Jake Conley notes, this report's revisions found that, over the last three months, the US economy added 8,000 fewer jobs per month than had been previously reported.\nYou can see the slight dip in the chart below:\nUS economy adds just 22,000 jobs, unemployment rate rises\nThe US labor market continues to slow.\nThe August jobs report released Friday by the the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) showed there were just 22,000 new jobs added to the economy last month, far fewer than forecast and the latest sign that the US labor market slowed down through the summer. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in August.\nEconomists had expected the report to show 75,000 jobs created last month, with the unemployment rate forecast to rise to 4.3%, according to Bloomberg data.\nIn July, the economy created 73,000 new jobs. Those figures were revised on Friday to show 79,000 jobs created during the month. Revisions to June's data, however, were more negative, with those numbers now showing 13,000 jobs lost during the month. Revisions in early August had brought June's job growth down to 14,000.\nRead more here.\nGood morning.

The results are deserved, as people I talk to in retail have been super let down in Lululemon's product assortments in recent months. It will take time to reverse the lack of must-have items, they say.\nHere is the Street vibe on Lululemon this morning:\n\"Challenges from domestic market pressures and removal of the de minimis exemption are primary drivers of a meaningful cut to FY25 guidance (implying -4.4% lower 2H revenue and -22% lower 2H EPS at the midpoint). Acknowledgment of underperformance within the casual side of the business (40% revenue mix) is a starting point, though reigniting brand momentum in the U.S. is likely to take longer than we had previously anticipated.\" — Stifel analyst Peter McGoldrick\n\"It's very simple... With sales per foot 4x mall avg and margins near peak, LULU's fundamentals will get much worse ahead. The US drives the earnings and the US is fading fast here. We believe the guide is not low enough and continue to carry estimates well below the Street/company guide. Rising competition won't stop either, which means LULU's EPS is permanently impaired.

The next step in this program will occur on Tuesday, September 9 when Porsche customers will gain soft launch access to the Tesla Supercharger network. This means Porsche owners will have access to 23,500 Tesla Superchargers in North America – helping them find even more convenient places to charge.\nAccess to the Tesla Supercharger network will be possible though Porsche-supplied NACS DC adapter being made available to Porsche customers. At this soft launch stage, Porsche customers will utilize the Tesla app to enable charging. Charging through the My Porsche app and plug-and-charge is expected to follow in the coming months.\n“We are continually working to make every aspect of Porsche ownership as convenient as possible for our customers – and this news represents a significant step for owners of our electrified cars,” said Timo Resch, President and CEO of Porsche Cars North America. “As we launch this offering, in the coming months, we will be adding more features to make the process even more seamless.”\nThe adapter\nGoing forward, all new model year 2026 Porsche Taycan and Macan Electric models will include Porsche NACS DC adapter at no additional fee. Model year 2025 Taycan owners and all existing Macan Electric owners are eligible for a complimentary adapter. This group of owners will receive notification via their My Porsche to reserve their free Porsche NACS DC adapter shortly.\nModel year 2024 and older Taycan customers can elect to purchase the Porsche NACS DC adapter from the Porsche Online Shop and at local Porsche Centers starting today. The MSRP of the adapter is $185 and enables Porsche owners to charge their CCS-equipped Taycan and Macan Electric models at DC fast charging stations equipped with NACS/J3400 compatible cables, including select Tesla Superchargers.\nHow it works\nThis soft launch will allow customer access the Tesla Supercharger network ahead of the full operational launch – with enhanced features such as access via the Porsche app and plug & charge capability – following in the coming months.\nCustomers connecting to a NACS Tesla Supercharger will need to take two simple steps – the first being to download and register on the Tesla app to activate Tesla Supercharger stations.\nOther stations, such as Ionna and Electrify America with NACS handles, can be activated via the My Porsche app. Next, they will use their new Porsche NACS DC adapter to connect to the charging station cable before it can then be plugged into the car.\nCharge planning software\nAll model year 2026 Taycan and Macan Electric variants will come with the necessary navigation features to incorporate the location of additional chargers. Model year 2024 and 2025 Macan Electric models will receive this software update before the end of the year, while model year 2025 and earlier Taycan variants will receive their upgrade thereafter. All charge-planning software updates will be complimentary.", "content_hash": "03dbae534a223b3e01fbbffe618ab2d0", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

Airfares likely increased again owing to another strong seasonal factor, and lodging away from home should also climb.”\nThese gains reflect both mean-reversion after earlier declines and higher summer travel activity.\nBased on these CPI forecasts, BofA expects core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation to rise to 3.0% year-on-year in August.\n“Our preliminary estimate for core PCE inflation in July is 0.27% month-on-month. If correct, core PCE would increase to 3.0% year-on-year in August,” the analysts said.\nRelated articles\nAugust CPI report likely to show ’sticky’ inflation: BofA\n8 Warren Buffett-Backed Stocks to Navigate September Volatility\nApollo economist warns: AI bubble now bigger than 1990s tech mania", "content_hash": "c2af861f5396470f4de60f33c99635ee", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The credit card and banking giant is benefiting from increased market optimism as the Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates.\nThe credit card for the affluent customer\nAmerican Express has carved out a niche as an elite credit card provider, servicing an upscale clientele with fee-based products that come with a coveted rewards program. Although it has only a fraction of competitor Visa's card membership, it has nearly double Visa's revenue. Its cardmembers are high spenders, and they're more resilient when there's pressure, making American Express resilient, too.\nIn the 2025 second quarter, revenue increased 9% year over year (currency neutral), and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were up 17%.\nAmerican Express stands out from other credit card networks in several ways. One is the focus on the affluent consumer, and another is its closed-loop model. Instead of working with partnering banks or financial institutions to provide the credit for its customers to make purchases on its network, it acts as its own bank. That gives it greater control over the model and expands its platform. In contrast with other networks, it has a large and varied stream of revenue.\nIt also makes money on deposits, which leads to higher net interest income and higher overall net income.\nAnother way the company differentiates itself is with its robust rewards program and accompanying annual fees. Fee revenue increased 20% year over year in the second quarter and accounted for more than 13% of revenue.\nLow interest rates should boost business\nLower interest rates generally boost economic activity, because money is cheaper and therefore easier to come by. Companies can borrow more easily, and they tend to expand their operations when money is plentiful. Individuals tend to spend more when it's cheaper to service their credit.\nThis works in American Express' favor in several ways. Higher economic activity is good for spending, and people with money are also more likely to take out new fee-based cards. It also means its default rates should go lower. They're generally best-in-class, and since interest rates have started to come down from highs, they're already improving.\nAmerican Express has been a reliable stock for decades, and it also pays a growing dividend. It's one of Warren Buffett's favorite and longest-held stocks, and it can still provide value for new and current shareholders.", "content_hash": "faf1b89afcd1027ace6cff604f6f3433", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

I’ve been writing about the uptick in CFO turnover. The latest high-profile departure is at multibillionaire Elon Musk’s xAI.\nMike Liberatore stepped down abruptly as the finance chief of Musk’s artificial intelligence startup, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal citing anonymous sources. Liberatore was hired in April and reportedly left in late July. The reasons for his departure are not known, but he followed other high-profile exits from xAI of late. The company did not immediately respond to my request for comment.\nBefore joining xAI, Liberatore worked at Airbnb for almost nine years—most recently as VP of finance and corporate development—and had previously served in several business unit CFO roles. He’s also worked at Intel, eBay, and PayPal. During his brief tenure at xAI, he reportedly helped raise $10 billion in funding and expanded data center operations.\nLaunched by Musk in July 2023, xAI is a competitor of OpenAI. Both companies develop large language models and AI assistants—OpenAI with ChatGPT, xAI with Grok—that target overlapping user bases.\nLiberatore’s departure follows a wave of exits, including cofounder Igor Babuschkin (who left to start a VC firm focused on AI safety), General Counsel Robert Keele after one year, and senior lawyer Raghu Rao. xAI’s leadership is highly centralized under Musk, with no publicly disclosed independent board.\nMichael Morris, a professor at Columbia Business School, shared his assessment with me. He noted that Keele cited differences in worldview with Musk and family priorities in his LinkedIn post about leaving. Of course, Musk also played a key role in the Trump White House earlier this year.\nMorris also observed that executive turnover among Musk’s direct reports at Tesla is 44%, compared to about 9% at Meta, Amazon, and Netflix; overall, Tesla’s executive turnover rate is 27%, nearly double the industry average.\n“Analysts point to Musk’s demanding, high-contact leadership style—managing up to 18 direct reports at once—as a key reason for the trend,” Morris said. “This pattern is visible not only at Tesla but also at X and xAI, suggesting structural factors rather than isolated events.”\nHe added that many executives leave rather than risk being blamed when new initiatives encounter regulatory hurdles: “Executives don’t want to become the ‘fall guy.’”\nWhat fuels mass exits?\nxAI isn’t alone in seeing mass executive departures. Last year, OpenAI also saw multiple senior departures—such as cofounder John Schulman and CTO Mira Murati. Also in 2024, at the DNA testing startup 23andMe, all seven independent directors resigned simultaneously, citing major disagreements with CEO Anne Wojcicki and her plans to take the company private.", "content_hash": "40f37b2e78d15b9510890ef5a1213582", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

If purchased via stablecoins, fees would be $0.50 or much lower - a huge spread.\nThat’s the opportunity that Stripe sees, and they’re clearly moving quickly.\nTheir advantage here is their purpose-built chain (along with their laundry list of launch partners and beta testers).\nMany of today’s big chains were optimized for trading, while Tempo optimizes for payments, the largest real-world use case for crypto.\nIf it works, on-chain dollars become the default rail for payouts and commerce.\nAnd that’s a boon for the broader crypto space. More stablecoins grow the overall crypto pie and bring more users on-chain.\nBut it doesn’t necessarily mean your favorite L1 blockchain’s token is going to go up in price…\n🌎 Macro Crypto and Memes\nA few Crypto and Web3 headlines that caught my eye:\n- Crypto majors are mostly even with BTC leading; BTC +1% at $112,300, ETH even at $4,420, XRP even at $2.84, SOL -1% at $207\n- M (+26%), PUMP (+10%) and XDC (+5%) led top movers\n- The Bitcoin ETFs saw $220M in net outflows on Thursday, breaking a big 2-day inflow streak; the ETH ETFs saw $167M in net outflows\n- The SEC set a pro-crypto agenda, unveiling rulemakings to define digital-asset offers/sales and ease listings on U.S. exchanges\n- Stripe + Paradigm revealed their Tempo blockchain aimed at low-cost stablecoin settlement with partners including Visa, Deutsche Bank, OpenAI\n- Kraken announced a buyout of Breakout, planning to integrate the trader-native platform into Kraken Pro\n- WLFI blacklisted Justin Sun's address from selling his 595M unlocked tokens, citing activity concerns that broke WLFI rules (WLFI +15% since the news)\n- Gary Gensler’s text messages from Oct 2022 to Sept 2023 have been “lost” according to a recent audit\nIn Corporate Treasuries\n- Crypto treasury stocks slumped after the Nasdaq announced heightened scrutiny of equity raises to fund crypto purchases\n- Public firms now hold over 1,000,000 BTC (~$110B) led by Strategy at ~636K BTC\n- American Bitcoin stock fell below its IPO price in trading Thursday\nIn Memes\n- Memecoin leaders are slightly green on the day; DOGE +1%, Shiba +1%, PEPE +1%, PENGU -1%, BONK +2%, TRUMP +1%, SPX +4%, and FARTCOIN -1%\n- NEET (+20%), BITTY (+30%), SPARK (+15%) and TOKABU (+13%) led onchain movers\n💰 Token, Airdrop & Protocol Tracker\nHere's a rundown of major token, protocol and airdrop news from the day:\n- Pump Fun did another $12M in buybacks over the past week, representing 98% of their revenue\n- Myriad announced two new UX enhancements, including direct sign-in w/ MetaMask, Rabby & Rainbow wallets and easier bridging directly within Myriad, along with confirmation that USDC predictions will \"be considered at TGE\"\n- Arbitrum launched DRIP, its $40M DeFi incentive program, targeting leveraged looping with 24M ARB in rewards\n- Fireblocks launched a stablecoin payments network, connecting 40+ participants to streamline B2B stablecoin flows\n🤖 AI x Crypto\nSection dedicated to headlines in the AI sector of crypto:\n- Overall market cap even at $12.7B, leaders were mixed\n- FARTCOIN (-1%), VIRTUAL (+1%), TIBBIR (+5%), aixbt (+3%) & ai16z (+1%)\n- VADER (+33%) and VIRGEN (+22%) led top movers\n🚚 What is happening in NFTs?\nHere is the list of other notable headlines from the day in NFTs:\n- ETH NFT leaders were mixed; Punks +2% at 48.9 ETH, Pudgy -1% at 9.8, BAYC -1% at 9.1 ETH\n- HV-MTL up 230% were a notable top mover\n- Abstract NFTs were mostly red, led by Roach Racing (+7%)\n- Pudgy Penguins announced that OpenSea will be its official home, along with the PENGU token\n- The Pudgy Party soulbound token can now be claimed inside MetaMask portfolio\n- NFL All Day revamped its collector experience, rolling out verified digital autographed rookie highlight moments and partnering with four NFL teams on in-person activations to onboard more fans", "content_hash": "b1d6045bfafe48ff5b5802522276af48", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

The company acquired stablecoin infrastructure firm Bridge for $1.1 billion and crypto wallet developer Privy, creating end-to-end payment solutions spanning wallets, stablecoins, and now blockchain processing infrastructure.\nStripe’s Crypto Stack Completion Strategy\nStripe’s blockchain development completes a comprehensive crypto infrastructure buildout that began with strategic acquisitions.\nThe Bridge acquisition provided stablecoin payment capabilities across 70 countries, while Privy added wallet infrastructure for seamless user onboarding.\nThe company initially supported Bitcoin transactions in 2014 before halting crypto services due to network inefficiencies.\nStripe rebuilt its blockchain team in 2021 and accelerated initiatives throughout 2024 following regulatory clarity brought by the Trump administration.\nStablecoin Financial Accounts launched across 101 countries, enabling companies to hold and transact digital dollars.\nThe platform currently supports Circle’s USDC and Bridge’s USDB tokens with plans for stablecoin neutrality across Tempo.\nEarlier this year, Stripe partnered with Ramp to launch stablecoin-backed corporate cards, which aim to address cross-border payment delays and currency volatility.\nThe cards were initially deployed in Latin American markets before expanding to Europe, Africa, and Asia.\nCEO Patrick Collison has previously testified to Congress that Stripe sees “meaningful business interest in stablecoins as the underlying technology has matured.”\nThe GENIUS Act’s federal regulatory framework spurred corporate adoption across the billion-dollar stablecoin sector.\nTempo enables Stripe to capture transaction processing revenue directly rather than paying fees to external networks.\nParticularly, the company’s extensive merchant network spanning millions of businesses worldwide perfectly positions Tempo for rapid adoption through existing payment flows.\nFinancial Giants Race Into the Blockchain Industry\nThe stablecoin sector experienced explosive growth following regulatory clarity, with market capitalization exceeding $288 billion.\nIn fact, among many others, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse projects the growth of the stablecoin market to around $1-2 trillion.\nAmid the corporate adoption race, MetaMask announced plans earlier last month to launch “MetaMask USD” through Stripe’s payment infrastructure.\nThe proposal builds on the M⁰ network, which has regulatory backing and fiat reserves.\nWestern Union has also announced pilot programs in South America and Africa for stablecoin-powered remittances.\nJust yesterday, Ripple announced its extension of its US dollar-backed stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD), into Africa.\nApproximately 20 million addresses now transact stablecoins on public blockchains.\nRecognizing this massive growth potential, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller noted that 99% of stablecoin market capitalization is tied to the US dollar.\nHe believes “stablecoins can keep the dollar the world’s reserve currency” by increasing global accessibility.\nLooking forward, Tempo’s validator set will begin with independent, diverse participants before transitioning toward permissionless validation.\nThe blockchain maintains neutrality regarding stablecoin issuers, allowing any compliant stablecoin to be used for payments and gas fees.\n- New ChatGPT AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Avalanche and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana and Pepe by the End of 2025\n- Perplexity AI Predicts the Price of XRP, World Liberty Financial and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Why Is Crypto Down Today? – September 4, 2025\n- XRP Price Prediction: Gaming Giant Expands to XRP Ledger – Shocking Move to $10 Starting Now\n- New ChatGPT AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Avalanche and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana and Pepe by the End of 2025\n- Perplexity AI Predicts the Price of XRP, World Liberty Financial and Dogecoin by the End of 2025\n- Why Is Crypto Down Today? – September 4, 2025\n- XRP Price Prediction: Gaming Giant Expands to XRP Ledger – Shocking Move to $10 Starting Now", "content_hash": "2348bb8a6d02d0c99aaa2ed251dc0ef8", "extract_method": "trafilatura", "language": "en"}

But the stock really got going after CEO Hock Tan talked about $10 billion in custom AI-related orders from a new customer. Revenue in the fiscal 2025 third quarter, which ended Aug. 3, increased 22% year over year to $15.95 billion, ahead of the $15.83 billion consensus forecast, according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share increased 36% from the year-ago period to $1.69, also outpacing expectations of $1.65, LSEG data showed. Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) grew 30% year over year to a record $10.7 billion in the quarter, beating the FactSet consensus of $10.46 billion. AVGO YTD mountain Broadcom YTD While the results and the outlook were great, commentary on the post-earnings conference call proved to be the most crucial. At around 5:10 p.m. ET, the Club stock soared after Tan revealed a fourth major customer. He did not name the customer. Shares then caught a second leg higher around 5:30 p.m. ET after Tan said he would remain CEO \"at least\" through 2026. The stock rose more than 4.5% to just above $320. Bottom line Broadcom's great quarter, solid guide, and the CEO remarks on the call all pointed to sustained strong demand for artificial intelligence semiconductors and networking solutions, housed in the company's AI solutions segment. VMWare, the software giant Broadcom bought for $69 billion nearly two years ago, continues to power the company's infrastructure software segment. Margin performance was also impressive with Broadcom's fiscal Q3 consolidated gross margin expanding 99 basis points, or nearly a full percentage point, year over year; adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 418 basis points, and operating income profit margin expanding a robust 474 basis points. AI-related revenue in the fiscal third quarter grew 63% year-over-year to $5.2 billion. Better yet, Tan said he expects that acceleration to continue in the company's current quarter, the company's fiscal fourth quarter, guiding for $6.22 billion in AI-related revenue. Tan also noted that demand for custom silicon from its three key customers – believed to be Alphabet , Club name Meta Platforms and TikTok parent ByteDance – continued to grow. Broadcom is also in talks with additional prospects – last quarter they quantified it as four prospects – to develop custom silicon. In fact, Tan noted on the call that during the quarter, one of the prospects did indeed release a production order for which Broadcom expects to ship product \"pretty strongly\" beginning in 2026. Tan noted that the company \"secured over $10 billion of orders.\" The Financial Times is reporting that Broadcom is working with OpenAI. Perhaps, OpenAI is the fourth customer Tan talked about. As a result, management expects AI revenue for the full year \"to improve significantly\" versus prior expectations. During the Q & A session, Tan said the addition of a fourth customer with \"immediate and fairly substantial demand really changes our thinking of what 2026 would be starting to look like.\" Tan also said, \"Looking beyond what we're just reporting this quarter with robust demand from AI, bookings were extremely strong and our current consolidated backlog for the company hit a record over $110 billion.\" Why we own it Broadcom is a high-quality semiconductor and software company run by an incredible CEO in Hock Tan. The company is a big AI beneficiary through its networking and custom chip businesses. Competitors : Marvell Technology, Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia Last buy : Nov. 21, 2024 Initiation date : Aug. 24, 2023 We're certainly pleased to hear about the new customer and Tan's plans to stay on as CEO. Given the large shoes his successor will ultimately need to fill, we're thrilled to hear that he'll be sticking around for the foreseeable future. In the end, it seems that Broadcom is taking share in custom semiconductors and winning with its networking solutions. We felt that Broadcom's release would not reflect what we saw from peer custom chip name Marvell Technology , with Jim Cramer saying ahead of the release that Tan was \"going to deliver.\" That conviction is being rewarded. With signs pointing not only to demand for AI solutions sustaining, but strengthening, as we work our way into 2026, we are raising our price target to $350 from $290. However, we are keeping our hold-equivalent 2 rating for the time being as it is not our style to chase a move like the one seen out of Broadcom in after-hours trading. As of the close of Thursday's regular session, the stock was over 30% year-over-year. Any level above $317.35 in Friday trading would be an all-time high. It's rather remarkable how Broadcom has fought back from January's DeepSeek fiasco and early April's tariff concerns that slammed the stock and the overall market. The S & P 500 finished Thursday with a record-high close. Commentary Broadcom's fiscal third-quarter Semiconductor Solutions revenue increased 26% year over year to $9.17 billion, exceeding expectations of $9.11 billion, according to FactSet. The result represents yet another sequential acceleration compared to the 17% growth in fiscal Q2 and the 11% growth in fiscal Q1. Gross margin for the segment came in at a solid 67%, though it was a 30-basis point contraction versus the year prior. AI semiconductor revenue, in particular, was $5.2 billion, representing growth of 63% versus the year-ago period, and marking a significant acceleration versus the 46% growth last quarter. Importantly, Tan said on the call, \"Demand for custom AI accelerators from our three customers continued to grow as each of them journeys at their own pace towards compute, self-sufficiency and progressively we continue to gain share with these customers.\" Broadcom's AI business has two parts: custom AI accelerators and networking chips, which are effectively part of the \"plumbing\" of a data center and help its various components communicate together as a larger computing factory. Regarding the legacy semiconductor businesses, the pace of improvement remains sluggish, with saying, \"demand continues to be slow to recover, and Q3 revenue of $4 billion was flat sequentially, while broadband showed strong sequential growth. Enterprise networking and service storage were down sequentially. Wireless and industrial were flat quarter on quarter, as we expect.\" On the brighter side, we should see some sequential growth here in the current quarter, according to Tan, who added, \"Broadband service, storage and wireless are expected to improve while enterprise networking remains down quarter on quarter.\" This is in line with Club holding Apple 's launch of a new iPhone, which is expected to be unveiled at a product event on Sept. 9. Apple is believed to be Broadcom's unnamed wireless customer, so we tend to see wireless sales pick up into the launch of a new iPhone as production ramps up. Broadcom's other operating segment, Infrastructure Software , revenue grew about 17% year over year to $6.79 billion, ahead of the $6.71 billion consensus estimate, according to FactSet. Gross margin for the segment came in at 93%, up from 90% in the year ago period. The VMWare acquisition is clearly working out for Broadcom, and with the company's investments and ability to cross-sell, it stands to keep growing in the quarters ahead as new features come to market. To this point, Tan said on the call, \"What I'm most excited about. After two years of engineering development by over 5,000 developers, we delivered on a promise when we acquired VMware, we released VMware Cloud Foundation version 9.0, a fully integrated cloud platform, which can be deployed by enterprise customers on prem or carried to the cloud. It enables enterprises to run any application workload, including AI workloads on virtual machines and on modern containers. This provides the real alternative to public cloud.\" Guidance For its fourth fiscal quarter, which will end on Nov. 2, Broadcom forecasted total revenue to be about $17.4 billion, representing growth of 21% year over year. That target is ahead of the $17.01 billion consensus, according to estimates compiled by LSEG. On the call, Tan highlighted strong demand for AI infrastructure and VMWare solutions as the main drivers of the growth. Importantly, AI revenue is expected to keep growing in the coming quarter, with Tan stating on the release that he expects \"growth in AI semiconductor revenue to accelerate to about $6.2 billion in fiscal Q4, delivering eleven consecutive quarters of growth, as our customers continue to strongly invest.\" That points to growth of 66% year-over-year, versus the 63% increase we got this time around. Add in the legacy semiconductor business forecast of approximately $4.6 billion, and a Semiconductor Solutions segment guide of about $10.7 billion ahead of the $10.17 billion consensus forecast, according to FactSet. The $6.7 billion Infrastructure Software revenue guide for fiscal Q4, however, looks a tad short versus of $6.86 billion, according to FactSet. The Street, however, clearly isn't taking issue with it given the strength of VMWare. The company expects fiscal Q4 adjusted EBITDA to be approximately 67% of projected revenue, or $11.658 billion, ahead of the $11.225 billion consensus estimate, according to FactSet.

On Tuesday, the Supreme Court will rule on the legitimacy of his prolonged hospital stay in lieu of prison, following his return to Thailand in 2023, which could potentially result in jail time.\n\"Pheu Thai is actually losing everything at the moment,\" said Titipol Phakdeewanich, a political analyst from Ubon Ratchathani University.\n\"And if next week the court rules against Thaksin, it would be a big disaster for the Shinawatras.\"\nPopulist Juggernaut\nA former policeman with roots in Thailand's north who made billions in the telecoms sector, Thaksin pivoted to politics in the mid-1990s, initially serving as foreign minister and then deputy prime minister.\nThe Thai Rak Thai party, founded by him, brought Thaksin to power in 2001, when he unleashed big spending on healthcare, rural development and farming subsidies, laying the foundations of his enduring popularity in the agrarian heartland.\nHis rise also brought him into conflict with the conservative-royalist elite, who saw him as a crony capitalist plundering the economy, creating conditions for a military coup that ousted him in 2006.\nThaksin-backed parties continue to win elections after the coup, while a segment of his supporters formed the \"Red Shirt\" populist movement that celebrated the former premier, challenging the conservative establishment for almost a decade through street protests and other activism.\nFrom self-exile, Thaksin fronted his sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, who swept the general elections in 2011 and sought to replicate his populist policies. Conservatives closed ranks again to push her out three years later.\nIt was Thaksin's daughter who took over the mantle in 2023, leading a campaign laden with nostalgia for previous Shinawatra administrations, as her father maneuvered an unexpected homecoming that analysts posited was made possible with a deal with his conservative rivals.\n\"This led to many former supporters seeing Thaksin now as a member of the elite,\" said Suranand Vejjajiva, former secretary-general to the prime minister during Yingluck's term.\n\"Therefore, his base has become smaller.\"\nOnce in power, even as Thaksin won a royal amnesty and appeared to exercise backroom influence, Pheu Thai struggled to deliver on its poll promises, including its flagship cash handout programme, which has drawn criticism from its own lawmakers.\n\"They just rely on a populist platform that is not working anymore in Thai politics,\" said Titipol.\nAt least three lawmakers who have broken rank with Pheu Thai in recent weeks underlined its handling of the economy as a key reason.\n\"The people who elected me had placed their hopes in the government I belonged to,\" Sakda wrote, listing lower rice, corn, cassava and beef prices.", "content_hash": "fa7a286b7cb06c019c7184c40908f87e", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

On Tuesday, the Supreme Court will rule on the legitimacy of his prolonged hospital stay in lieu of prison, following his return to Thailand in 2023, which could potentially result in jail time.\n\"Pheu Thai is actually losing everything at the moment,\" said Titipol Phakdeewanich, a political analyst from Ubon Ratchathani University.\n\"And if next week the court rules against Thaksin, it would be a big disaster for the Shinawatras.\"\nPopulist Juggernaut\nA former policeman with roots in Thailand's north who made billions in the telecoms sector, Thaksin pivoted to politics in the mid-1990s, initially serving as foreign minister and then deputy prime minister.\nThe Thai Rak Thai party, founded by him, brought Thaksin to power in 2001, when he unleashed big spending on healthcare, rural development and farming subsidies, laying the foundations of his enduring popularity in the agrarian heartland.\nHis rise also brought him into conflict with the conservative-royalist elite, who saw him as a crony capitalist plundering the economy, creating conditions for a military coup that ousted him in 2006.\nThaksin-backed parties continue to win elections after the coup, while a segment of his supporters formed the \"Red Shirt\" populist movement that celebrated the former premier, challenging the conservative establishment for almost a decade through street protests and other activism.\nFrom self-exile, Thaksin fronted his sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, who swept the general elections in 2011 and sought to replicate his populist policies. Conservatives closed ranks again to push her out three years later.\nIt was Thaksin's daughter who took over the mantle in 2023, leading a campaign laden with nostalgia for previous Shinawatra administrations, as her father maneuvered an unexpected homecoming that analysts posited was made possible with a deal with his conservative rivals.\n\"This led to many former supporters seeing Thaksin now as a member of the elite,\" said Suranand Vejjajiva, former secretary-general to the prime minister during Yingluck's term.\n\"Therefore, his base has become smaller.\"\nOnce in power, even as Thaksin won a royal amnesty and appeared to exercise backroom influence, Pheu Thai struggled to deliver on its poll promises, including its flagship cash handout programme, which has drawn criticism from its own lawmakers.\n\"They just rely on a populist platform that is not working anymore in Thai politics,\" said Titipol.\nAt least three lawmakers who have broken rank with Pheu Thai in recent weeks underlined its handling of the economy as a key reason.\n\"The people who elected me had placed their hopes in the government I belonged to,\" Sakda wrote, listing lower rice, corn, cassava and beef prices.", "content_hash": "fa7a286b7cb06c019c7184c40908f87e", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Microsoft is OpenAI's biggest investor, having reportedly poured $13 billion in the company.\nThe news was announced by Fidji Simo, chief executive officer of applications and the former head of Instacart, in a blog post on Thursday.\n\"Importantly, the jobs platform won't just be a way for big companies to attract more talent. It will have a track dedicated to helping local businesses compete, and local governments find the AI talent they need to better serve their constituents,\" Simo said.\nShe didn't elaborate further on details regarding the platform, but a company spokesperson told TechCrunch that it expects to launch the service by mid-2026.\nAdditionally, OpenAI will introduce a new certification program in connection with its \"OpenAI Academy,\" an online learning platform that teaches workers how to use AI on the job better. This could also put it in competition with LinkedIn's learning platform, which also offers video courses across business, technology and creative fields, with certifications.\n\"[W]e're going to expand the Academy by offering certifications for different levels of AI fluency, from the basics of using AI at work all the way up to AI-custom jobs and prompt engineering,\" Simo said, adding that the program will utilize ChatGPT's Study mode. The study feature turns the chatbot into a teacher that questions, hints and provides feedback, instead of giving direct answers.\nOrganizations will be able to make the certificate part of their own learning and development programs, with OpenAI already working with Walmart, the largest private employer in the U.S. OpenAI said it plans to certify 10 million Americans by 2030.\nThe plans come amid fears about how AI is impacting the labor market. Business leaders like Salesforce's Marc Benioff have recently announced layoffs due to AI, while new studies have linked the technology to mass job loss for certain workers.\nSimo acknowledged the \"disruptive\" force of AI in her post, saying jobs and companies will look different and need to adapt.\n\"[W]hat we can do is help more people become fluent in AI and connect them with companies that need their skills, to give people more economic opportunities.\nRecent research from labor market data company Lightcast found that roles that require AI skills pay higher salaries on average than those that don't.\nThe new initiatives were also said to come as part of OpenAI's \"commitment to the White House's efforts toward expanding AI literacy.\"\nThe company has been strengthening ties with Washington, launching a new offering called OpenAI for Government on June 16, the same day it was awarded a contract of up to $200 million by the U.S. Department of Defense. OpenAI is also part of the $500 billion Stargate project, which aims to invest in AI infrastructure in the U.S. over the next four years.\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman was part of a group of tech leaders that met with U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday to discuss topics including the development of artificial intelligence.\nBefore the dinner, first lady Melania Trump made a speech highlighting the importance of AI in education and American progress, but that \"we must manage AI's growth responsibly.\"", "content_hash": "fd8dd5e295c5c419619e67e100832049", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

So, when he discovered an investment vehicle called a search fund while studying for his MBA, he went all in.\nAs millions of baby boomers prepare to retire, a quiet crisis — and an unexpected business opportunity — is unfolding across the economy. Today, over half of all U.S. small businesses are owned by people aged 55 and over, yet most lack a succession plan, according to Gallup.\nThese businesses are often unglamorous, but essential to keep society running: plumbers, equipment rental companies and pest control.\n\"They're the types of companies that if they drop what they do, it would really hurt,\" said Jon Staenberg, founder & CEO of Agate Hound Fund.\nEnter the next generation of entrepreneurs — millennials and Gen Zers — who are seizing this moment not by launching startups, but by buying companies through search funds. In doing so, they're revitalizing Main Street businesses and solving a looming succession crisis, all while building wealth in a turbulent economy.\nWhat is a search fund?\nFirst conceived in 1984, search funds — also known as \"entrepreneurship through acquisition\" — let individuals — or \"searchers\" — raise money from a small group of investors to buy and operate a small or medium-sized private company.\nA 2024 study by the Stanford Graduate School of Business describes the process in four steps:\n- Stage one: Raise initial capital (about 2 to 6 months)\n- Stage two: Search for and acquire company (about 12 to 24 months)\n- Stage three: Operation and value creation (about 4 to 7+ years)\n- Stage four: Exit (about 6 months)\nThe goal is to grow these businesses and exit with a profit — often to a private equity firm.\nIt's a compelling model: lower risk than starting from scratch, since the business already has customers, revenue, and a product-market fit.\nAcquisition targets are typically businesses with recurring revenue, low overhead, minimal regulatory risk, and stable customer bases.\n\"These are businesses that are, frankly, hard to break,\" said Jackson, who is now a search fund investor. \"It's very forgiving for the first-time CEO.\"\nBesides \"core\" search funds, other variants include self-funded, single-investor models, while others prioritize a larger pool of capital committed at launch, or a longer holding period of between 10 and 20 years.\nIn 2023, a record 94 core search funds were launched across the U.S. and Canada, while international interest also set new milestones, with 59 new core funds outside North America, according to studies conducted by Stanford and IESE Business School.\n'Safe port in a storm'\nSearch funds have grown popular as traditional career paths feel less secure, with layoffs, automation and artificial intelligence reshaping industries.\n\"There is a big displacement of young professionals who are in the middle of their career,\" said Aik Chuan Goh, managing partner of Singapore-based search fund Garlic Equity Capital. Many of these \"ambitious young professionals no longer see corporate life as their future,\" he added.\nOn the other hand, many business owners are looking to retire. \"When you put one and one together, you have a great match,\" said Goh.\nWe live in such a tumultuous time with change happening so fast, this feels like a very safe port in a storm.Jon StaenbergFounder and CEO, Agate Hound Fund\nInvestors are taking notice too. Amid downturns in the venture capital and private equity markets, search funds have emerged as an alternative asset class.\n\"Venture [capital] is so crowded now. Search funds still remain small, while the opportunity set is so big — it's the only thing I want to do for the rest of my career. You look at the returns, they've been phenomenal. They've been outsized,\" said Staenberg.\nStanford's 2024 study of 681 search funds formed in the U.S. and Canada since 1984 found that their internal rate of return was 35.1%, with a 4.5 times return on investment.\n\"Over the last 40 years, the stock market has been somewhere [around] 8.5% annual returns ... Then you go to private equity or venture over that same 40-year period ... and the returns are somewhere around 13% to 14%. So [when] you start looking at the outsized returns of 35% for search, it's a bit of a head scratcher,\" said Staenberg.\n\"We live in such a tumultuous time with change happening so fast, this feels like a very safe port in a storm.\"\nCheckbook, phonebook, playbook\nMeanwhile, search funds have also offered a risk-adjusted way for aspiring business owners to pursue their CEO dreams, such as Jackson, who, together with his friend Olaide Lawal, started their search fund in 2015.\nAbout 18 months later, the duo raised more than $5 million and acquired three dental practices from a dentist who was in his 50s. Over the next six years, Jackson ran Unified Dental Care as CEO and grew the company to seven locations before selling the business to a strategic buyer in 2023.\nBut Jackson did not come from wealth. Growing up in Champaign, Illinois, he didn't see many business success stories around him.\n\"It was normal for me to literally see in front of my door, gang fights [break] out ... and so I did not have as much access to seeing entrepreneurs,\" said Jackson.\n\"I saw the barber shop that was down the street, or I saw the person that owned the barbecue shop ... [and] people that were making an honest living, but barely livable wages,\" said Jackson.\nSo it was a risk adjusted path for me as a minority entrepreneur that didn't come with a lot of resources to have ... a successful exit.Jason JacksonFormer CEO, Unified Dental Care\n\"For me, the idea [of a search fund] was fantastic, because ... I didn't have the startup idea, so it was an opportunity for me to buy an existing business,\" he said.\nWhat makes search funds unique, he said, is that his investors also become his mentors.\n\"What separates search fund investors is that they provide, principally, three things to the entrepreneur. The first thing that they provide is [a] checkbook... This is something that I didn't have access to,\" said Jackson.\n\"Second thing that they provide access to is a phone book, meaning call me or call my network anytime ... and the third thing that they provide [is a] playbook, meaning, here's how you execute once you buy this business,\" Jackson added.\n\"So it was a risk-adjusted path for me as a minority entrepreneur that didn't come with a lot of resources to have ... a successful exit,\" said Jackson.\nThe new American dream?\nBut running a search fund isn't all smooth sailing. In fact, Jackson uncovered fraud two weeks into running the business: the seller had inflated revenue by millions.\n\"We thought we were buying a $7 million revenue company and $1.5 million in EBITDA,\" said Jackson. \"What we discovered was that the business was really doing $5 million in revenue and losing $500,000 a year after adjusting for the fraud.\"\nDespite the rocky start, Jackson turned the business around. He exited successfully, more than doubling his investment and earning seven figures altogether from his tenure as CEO and from the deal, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.\n\"We eventually were able to sell the business at a decent multiple. It's decent for the search fund industry. It's really good compared to private equity, but it's really great compared to where my partner and I came from. He came from Lagos, Nigeria. I came from an under-resourced community,\" said Jackson.\nToday, Jackson runs the Black Search Network, which he co-founded in 2020. He spends his time investing in and passing on the knowledge he's gained through his own journey to other aspiring entrepreneurs and searchers.\nIt also allows people who are gritty, who are hungry, who are willing to be coached, to pursue what we used to call the American dream — to build a business into even more success and have an exit and then come back and help others do the same thing.Jon StaenbergFounder and CEO, Agate Hound Fund\nSearch funds are not a silver bullet. Besides dealing with rejection, searchers have to find a good business to buy, convincing the owner to entrust you with their life's work, and of course, learning how to run a business for the first time.\nBut for a generation looking for stability and purpose, they may offer something rare in today's economy: a practical, profitable, and supported route to owning a business.\n\"It truly is the life cycle of entrepreneurship,\" said Staenberg. \"It also allows people who are gritty, who are hungry, who are willing to be coached, to pursue what we used to call the American dream — to build a business into even more success and have an exit and then come back and help others do the same thing.\"\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

Sign up to receive future editions.\nOverview: Every step to take-off counts\nIf launching a rocket's a prime feast, opening the doors to the vehicle's launch pad is a healthy appetizer.\nLast week, Rocket Lab introduced Launch Complex 3 — the intended take-off pad of its Neutron rocket — located within the Virginia Spaceport Authority's Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport. Neutron itself will arrive a little later to this party, with a first flight targeted this year – but the premiere of the launch site marks a major step for Rocket Lab specifically and for a space industry that's overall hungry for further launch vehicles.\nThe company already produces the small-lift Electron launch vehicle, which was performing its first commercial flights by late 2018. The 141-foot-tall Neutron is an upgrade in scale: a medium-lift reusable rocket that burns liquid methane and oxygen designed to carry payloads up to 13,000 kilograms to low Earth orbit (LEO) and 1,500 kilograms for trips to Mars or Venus.\nThe market scale for global carrier rockets — which are designed to launch a payload on a particular route or orbit — is seen set to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9% between this year and 2034. Forgive the pun, but launch demand's only risen meteorically, with payloads ranging from space exploration and research equipment to humans and defense and telecommunication satellites for fast-evolving networks.\nFor years, the industry bemoaned the limited scale of take-off capacity, with European Space Agency's Director Josef Aschbacher last year acknowledging a \"launcher crisis\" in Europe that the agency sought to resolve with the launch of the Ariane-6.\nMuch of that world's launch capacity is in the hands of Elon Musk's SpaceX, whose take-off cadence last year exceeded that of both commercial competitors and national programs. In 2024, the company saw through more than 130 flights of its workhorse medium-lift Falcon 9, which reuses its first-stage booster and payload fairings. That's just over half of the 259 orbital launches undertaken over the period globally — and could increase to more than 180 Falcon 9 launches this year, according to Musk's estimate of December. An August launch even carried Kuiper satellites for Amazon, whose owner Jeff Bezos' rival Blue Origin unleashed the New Glenn on its maiden orbital voyage in January.\nIt's not taking away from SpaceX's success story to acknowledge the drawbacks of overreliance on a single provider. Toward the middle of the year, U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to cancel government Musk's government contracts in the midst of an explosive public row led the tech billionaire to fleetingly float the possibility of decommissioning SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft — potentially stranding U.S. crew without a ride to and from the International Space Station at the time. The waters have calmed since, and SpaceX and NASA are continuing their partnership, but the incident's driven home the critical downsides of market dominance.\nWe've been over this: getting a brand new rocket model off the ground's no feat for the feeble. Moscow's still planning to push through the all-Russian Soyuz-5 by the end of the year, and Relativity Space's reusable Terran R and Firefly Aerospace's Eclipse are both currently penciled in for liftoff in 2026. Last month, our collective breaths were held as we watched intently whether the second-iteration Starship variant would prevail in the rocket's 10th test flight, or face another fiery setback. (Elon Musk's giant won the day.)\nBut, when the global satellite market is projected to expand seven-fold by 2035, it's hard not to see why all eyes are glued when space companies reveal their latest and greatest in brand new rockets — or their launch pads.\nWhat's up\n- Canada prepares its first lunar rover — Canadensys Aerospace is developing the first Canada-built rover to investigate the Moon — a \"logical first step\" for future space exploration ambitions, according to the company's CEO. — BBC\n- Senate hears NASA doubts over return to Moon timeline — A former NASA administrator told senators it was unlikely that the space agency would be able to put men back on the Moon ahead of Beijing, which has embarked on similar efforts. — Space News\n- ESA spacecraft undertakes Venus flyby — The European Space Agency's JUICE spacecraft has completed a Venus flyby en route to explore Jupiter's icy moons and gather data about the planet's Ganymede, Callisto and Europa moons. — Space.com\nIndustry maneuvers\n- Trump says Space Command HQ to move to Alabama — U.S. President Donald Trump said the U.S. Space Command's headquarters will move to Alabama from Colorado, citing the latter state's mail-in voting system. — NBC News\n- White House axes labor unions at NASA — Washington has moved to eliminate collective bargaining rights for several government institutions, including NASA, citing national security. — White House executive order\nMarket movers\n- Rocket Lab reveals new pad ahead of first Neutron rocket launch — Rocket Lab unveiled its new Launch Complex 3 pad at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport in Wallops Island, which will be used to test and launch the reusable Neutron rocket that could debut as soon as the end of the year. — Defense News\n- Andoya Space, Rheinmetall to bolster efforts to boost satellite launch — Andoya Space and Rheinmetall have agreed to strengthen their combined efforts to bolster satellite launch and space capabilities. — Defence Industry Europe\n- NordSpace's Taiga launch delayed by tech, weather issues — Ontario-based tech startup NordSpace has postponed the launch of its Taiga rocket — intended as the first ever commercial rocket take-off from Canadian soil — after a safety system fault and weather disruptions.

The chipmaker on Thursday posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue along with robust guidance for the current quarter. The company, which develops chips for Google and other cloud customers, also said it secured $10 billion in orders from a new client for custom chips. Shares popped more than 8% in premarket trading. \"This performance puts Broadcom on track to drive ~$20B in AI revenues for FY25,\" wrote JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur. \"Overall, we are encouraged by Broadcom's strong visibility into FY26/FY27 AI revenue and a record $110B backlog, supported by robust cloud/hyperscaler capex trends, ongoing AI training and inference workloads, the ramp of Google's next-gen TPU v6/v7 3nm AI accelerator ASICs, new customer/program ramps … and strong demand for AI networking.\" Questions are now swirling among analysts and investors about Broadcom's mystery client — and what that means for the company's strength in the coming years as it tries to take market share from Nvidia . Take a look at what several analysts had to say. Bank of America: Reiterated buy rating, lifted price target by $100 to $400 \"Reiterate Buy, our top pick as AVGO's custom AI chip (XPU) continues to build with a fourth large customer (OpenAI per media reports) likely joining the current three (Google, Meta, ByteDance.) The ~$10bn addition (in 2HFY26E) to prior FY26 growth now puts AI growth closer to 110% YoY vs. 55-60% YoY prior. Further, AVGO suggested growth could accelerate further into FY27E on additional programs, new customers,\" analyst Vivek Arya said. \"While we agree AVGO is taking more share, we believe the AI pie could just be getting bigger in-line with NVDA's commentary (\"multi $trillion\" TAM.)\" Barclays: Kept overweight rating, raised price target by $135 to $400 \"Outside of the new customer, the core 3 ASIC customers are also doing better than expected and likely surpass the 60% Y/Y AI revenue target even before the new customer layers in … Outside of ASICs, the company is currently short on EMLs (explains transceiver constraints) and is doubling capacity over the next 9 months. The company is firing on all cylinders with clear line of sight for growth supported by significant backlog,\" analyst Tom O'Malley said in a note to clients. JPMorgan: Kept overweight rating, changed price target to $400 from $325 \"Broadcom reported better-than-expected results for the Jul- Qtr and provided solid revenue outlook for the Oct-Qtr, driven by accelerating AI demand, stabilizing non-AI semiconductors, and continued solid momentum from VMware … Broadcom's diversified portfolio and product cycles support a solid revenue growth profile,\" analyst Harlan Sur wrote in a note. Morgan Stanley: Reiterated overweight rating, raised price target from $357 to $382 \"Upside to overall numbers is modest, but AI stays strong. More importantly, the company is putting a 4th AI customer into backlog, with the surprising forecast of $10 bn of incremental 2h revenue,\" analyst Joseph Moore said. \"While Broadcom has said that all three of their initial customers are on track, we do believe that the third customer is in China, could be subject to export constraints, and has seen some implementation delays.\" Goldman Sachs: Reiterated buy rating, lifted price target by $20 to $360 \"We believe the most significant development was Broadcom's announcement that it has converted another new custom silicon customer focused on inference, which is expected to help drive 'material' upside to management's prior expectation of AI Semiconductor revenue growth of ~60% in 2026 ... we see the company remaining the leader in AI custom compute and merchant networking silicon (which is likely to grow in importance), and we believe the company's enterprise software portfolio is under-appreciated,\" analyst James Schneider said. Wells Fargo: Kept equal weight rating, lifted price target by $90 to $345 \"AVGO delivered another solid beat-and-raise w/ continued custom AI XPU momentum - most notably highlighting $10B+ order from new (4th) customer for inference-focused XPU; accelerating AI growth in FY26 and again in FY27 (vs. +62% y/y in FY25),\" analyst Aaron Rakers wrote in a note. \"We continue to see shares representing a balanced risk/reward at current levels with significant leverage and an expectation that future acquisitions will remain a use of capital keeping us on the sidelines.\" Deutsche Bank: Kept buy rating, raised price target by $50 to $350 \"While AVGO's report/guide were relatively in-line on the surface, the all-important AI commentary was decidedly more bullish,\" analyst Ross Seymore said. \"When combined with a slowly improving non-AI semi segment and a steady software segment, we expect AVGO to deliver ~+40% revenue growth in FY26, with opex control yielding strong EPS fall through. In total, AVGO's report/guide and long-term outlook highlight its leadership position in AI XPU compute/networking, with the steady hand of CEO Hock Tan continuing to steer this growth through the end of the decade (extended his contract through 2030). \"", "content_hash": "c88edc4caaa34368e552276a162c9188", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Trump also made the point that European leaders must subject China to economic pressure for underwriting the Russian war effort, the official added.\nBut Trump's more dour view of reaching a peace deal underscores the distance he has traveled since the 2024 campaign, when he brashly predicted he'd end the war within 24 hours of taking office. (He later said he was speaking \"figuratively.\") Trump has since acknowledged that the war has proved a more stubborn problem than he expected.\nRead more from NBC News:\nWhirlwind peacemaking efforts last month appear to have stalled. Amid expectations of an elusive breakthrough, Trump flew to Anchorage, Alaska, on Aug. 15 for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He touched down in Alaska hoping for a ceasefire and left hours later without one.\nThree days later, Trump convened a meeting at the White House with Zelenskyy and European leaders. Afterward, he announced that Putin and Zelenskyy would meet for the first time since the war began in February 2022, raising hopes that a rapprochement might be in sight.\nThat meeting still hasn't happened, and there's no sign it will. During a visit to China this week, Putin said he will end the war by force if Ukraine doesn't agree to his demands. And he said he would meet with Zelenskyy only in Moscow, the Russian capital.\nZelenskyy is willing to meet with Putin in certain Persian Gulf countries, Switzerland, Austria, Turkey and elsewhere — but not on Putin's turf, a Ukrainian adviser said.\n\"We see nonstop obstacles to peace from Russia's side and fake arguments from Russia as to why there can't be a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy in the same room,\" Sergii Leshchenko, an adviser to Zelenskyy's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said in an interview.\nAsked whether he had a message for Putin, Trump told reporters at the White House this week: \"I have no message to President Putin. He knows where I stand, and he'll make a decision one way or the other. Whatever his decision is, we'll either be happy about it or unhappy. And if we're unhappy about it, you'll see things happen.\"\nAs the peace talks bog down, the casualties continue to mount. Just last week, Russia launched a massive attack on Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, that killed at least 15 people, including four children. Since Russia sent tanks into Ukraine in February 2022, casualties on both sides have reached about 1.5 million.\nA European source, speaking on condition of anonymity, spoke Thursday about being frustrated that the Trump administration hasn't imposed meaningful new sanctions on Russia as a prod to end the war.\nLeshchenko said, \"The pressure on Putin has to be really harsh so that he will not be able to continue his war machine.\"\nA complication may be Trump's relationship with Putin; he has told his advisers that he's determined not to wreck it, two people briefed on his comments said. Dating to his first term, Trump has said it's in America's interest for him to be on civil terms with his Russian counterpart, who presides over a nuclear arsenal.\nA potential advantage in retaining a leader-to-leader rapport with Putin is that Trump can position himself as a mediator both sides can trust, a Western official said in an interview. He enjoys leverage with both Putin and Zelenskyy, whose country depends on U.S. arms and money for survival.\nIn that vein, Trump last month was heard on a hot mic telling French President Emmanuel Macron that Putin wants to make a deal \"for me … as crazy as it sounds.\"\nWhile sanctions are a tool that may wrest concessions from Putin, they carry a downside in that each escalatory twist jeopardizes Trump's role as a fair broker, the official said. The challenge, the official added, is to adeptly time the sanctions and \"dial back\" when progress is made.\nAnother consideration is that sanctions can reverberate in unexpected ways. An administration official pointed to India as a cautionary example. When the United States doubled its tariff rate on India as punishment for buying Russian oil, American relations with India soured. This week, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi turned up in China for an event hosted by Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\nThe United States has long seen India as a vital democratic partner in countering Chinese and Russian influence around the world.\nYet in China, Modi was seen holding hands with Putin and speaking warmly to Xi. Images of Modi cozying up to Russia and China, the administration official said, were \"not great.\"\nBrett Bruen, who was White House director of global engagement in the Obama administration, said in an interview: \"We spent the last decade trying to build up an Indo-Pacific partnership with a view toward limiting the spread of China's adversarial actions. Trump just took a bazooka to it.\"", "content_hash": "20b94cd00c581d1e76e309a71a47268f", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

It would also give Musk increased voting power over the EV maker and aspiring robotics titan, which he has publicly demanded since early 2024.\nTesla Chairwoman Robyn Denholm told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin the plan was designed to keep the CEO \"motivated and focused on delivering for the company.\"\n\"If he performs, if he hits the super ambitious milestones that are in the plan then he gets equity — it's 1% for each half a trillion dollars of market cap, plus operational milestones he has to hit in order to do that,\" Denholm said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\nThe full award would give Musk more than 423 million additional shares. He currently holds about a 13% stake in the company.\nDenholm confirmed that the Tesla CEO pay plan, if approved by shareholders, would not put any limit on where and how Musk spends his time or require him to spend any minimum number of hours per week on Tesla business.\nTo obtain the first award in the plan, Musk and Tesla would need to almost double their current market cap to reach $2 trillion. The final benchmark is reaching an $8.5 trillion market cap.\nThe operational milestones in the 2025 CEO Performance Award include: 20 million Tesla vehicles delivered, 10 million active FSD Subscriptions, 1 million robots delivered, 1 million Robotaxis in commercial operation and a series of adjusted EBITDA benchmarks.\nMusk said at Tesla's 2024 annual meeting that Optimus robots could make Tesla a $25 trillion company. This week, he said roughly 80% of Tesla's value could eventually come from Optimus but offered no specifics.\nThe board's pitch for a ten-year Musk pay plan comes as his attention remains divided across his other ventures, and the legal battle over his 2018 pay drags on.\nMusk's collection of companies includes aerospace and defense contractor SpaceX, drilling venture The Boring Company, health tech company Neuralink and the artificial intelligence venture xAI, which has merged with his social network, X.\nTesla is in the midst of a multi-quarter sales slump due to its aging lineup, competition from Chinese automakers, and a consumer backlash to Musk's incendiary political rhetoric and involvement with the Trump administration.\nTesla also said in the filing Friday that it will ask shareholders at the Nov. 6 meeting to vote on whether the company should invest in Musk's newest venture, xAI.\nMusk first floated the idea publicly with an informal poll on X last July, asking whether Tesla should invest $5 billion into xAI.\nFounded in early 2023 in Nevada, xAI merged with Musk's social network X earlier this year. The company now operates a massive data center in Memphis, and plans to build out another facility there to help train and run its large language models and a chatbot called Grok.\nPay plan controversy\nThe new pay proposal for Musk comes after the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled last year that his 2018 pay plan was excessive, had been improperly granted by the Tesla board and must be rescinded.\nIn that case, Tornetta v. Musk, a judge found that the Tesla CEO had controlled pay negotiations at the automaker, and his board of directors failed to give shareholders information that they were legally entitled to before telling them they should vote to approve Musk's performance-based pay plan.\nThe 2018 pay plan was worth about $56 billion when it vested, and was the largest public executive compensation plan in U.S. history.\nLike the new proposed pay plan, Tesla had to hit a series of benchmarks, both market cap related and operational, for Musk to get his options.\nThe amount of compensation that Tesla had paid its directors, including Denholm, was a point of consideration for the judge in the Tornetta matter. Denholm said in the trial that during her time on the Tesla board, she had received compensation worth $280 million, calling it \"life-changing wealth.\"\nMusk, Denholm and other allies of the Tesla CEO have criticized the Delaware court's decision, and Tesla even moved its site of incorporation from Delaware to Texas in response to the verdict.\nTesla attempted to \"ratify\" the 2018 CEO pay plan after Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick voided it, asking shareholders to vote to restore it in retrospect of her ruling. McCormick said such a vote did not remedy the earlier problems and upheld her decision in December 2024.\nThe case is now on appeal in Delaware.", "content_hash": "4e24102f245ece76bb42dcb4e9313e54", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Economists polled by Dow Jones expected an increase of 75,000. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3%, as expected.\nOn Thursday, the ADP private payrolls data came in weaker-than-expected, with private payrolls rising by just 54,000 in August — below the forecast of 75,000 from economists polled by Dow Jones and a slowdown from the 106,000 gain in July.\nThe report showed a marked slowdown from the July increase of 79,000, which was revised up by 6,000.

Futures data shows traders believe it's certain the Fed will cut rates a quarter point from their current 4.25% to 4.50% range at its next policy meeting on Sept. 17.\n\"Overall, it was a disappointing release that will start the conversation about whether the FOMC should cut 50 bp on September 17,\" Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates at BMO, said in a note. \"We're still in the 25 bp cut camp but will acknowledge that next week's benchmark revisions and CPI could shift the market's perception on the appropriateness of going a quarter-point.\"", "content_hash": "15de46458c50edb52f6ce94dac561430", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

It will sideline major store renovations and development in the meantime.\nWhile the changes will vary based on the location, expect more seating, dark wood paneling and other tweaks that make its cafes cozier. The renovations will also include changes like less harsh lighting that won't affect customers with light sensitivity.\n\"We're uplifting more than 1,000 coffeehouses over the next year, blending our global heritage with local relevance to create spaces that are immersive, inclusive, and deeply human,\" Dawn Clark, Starbucks senior vice president of coffeehouse design and concepts, said in a statement to CNBC.\n\"Whether it's the laid-back warmth of the Palisades or the urban energy of Manhattan, intentional design encourages customers to stay longer, connect more, and return often — and translates into meaningful business impact,\" Clark said.\nStarbucks is planning to spend about $150,000 on each \"uplift,\" without closing the stores down. The company started with locations in New York, followed by cafes in Southern California.\nThe makeovers are intended to make the stores more welcoming, returning Starbucks to its prior status as a \"third place\" for customers to hang out between home and work. In recent years, Starbucks had lost that reputation, fueled by decisions like removing seats as mobile ordering become popular and getting rid of outlets to discourage lingering.\nUnder CEO Brian Niccol, the chain plans to reverse many of those decisions as it tries to break a sales slump. For example, he previously told employees in June that he plans to add back the 30,000 seats that had been removed from cafes.\nBut trying to appeal to a wider swath of customers isn't new for the company. Starbucks first unveiled an accessible store design in early 2024, before Niccol's tenure. At the time, the company said that the design took about two years and included input from baristas.\nTake a look inside a recently renovated New York City cafe near Manhattan's Union Square.\nBefore the renovation, the location lacked many decorative touches, besides some large-scale photos of the chain's Hacienda Alsacia, its coffee and research farm in Costa Rica.\nWith such sparse seating, the cafe's concrete floors were more obvious. Harsh lighting didn't help the store's appearance either.\nThe location now features much more seating near the entrance. Leather accents to the wraparound booth make the seats more comfortable. The tables are easily movable and at an accessible height for wheelchair users.\nStarbucks also brought back the electrical outlets that disappeared in prior makeovers. Now customers who want to study or work from the location can charge their laptops or phones, encouraging them to stay longer.\nLarge area rugs bring a cozy touch, in addition to dampening some of the cafe's ambient noise. Live plants also add to the homey vibe of the space.\nHigh-top tables, positioned closer to the barista bar, offer a seating option for customers looking to sit down with companions. The makeover adds 16 more seats to the location.\nStarbucks also changed out its lightbulbs to soften the store's lighting and reduce glare, giving it a warmer atmosphere. The improved lighting helps highlight an existing mural, seen on the right of the photo above.\nBehind the barista bar, the company added a large shelving unit that highlights bags of its coffee, plus decorative burlap sacks that hold beans. Touches of purple are a nod to the nearby New York University.\nCustomers waiting to pick up their drinks can sit off to the side. Previously, the area was a standing bar that wasn't accessible to wheelchair users.\nIn addition to adding rugs, Starbucks also improved the location's overall insulation to cut down on the clamor of a busy coffee shop. For baristas, the change means that conversations among customers are less likely to disturb their work, whether that's hearing an order correctly or focusing on making a latte.", "content_hash": "d6decec73068e181c917c3e83fd6eca7", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

He is serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Pennsylvania.\nThe report does not say James Biden violated the law and does not mention Hunter Biden or suggest he was involved in McGonigal's misconduct.\nAttorneys who recently represented McGonigal and Hunter and James Biden did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The China Energy Fund Committee ceased operating before 2020, according to public reports.\nBiden business dealings\nPrevious reporting by NBC News and other investigations described extensive business dealings between the two Bidens and the China Energy Fund Committee, or CEFC.\nA Senate report on Hunter Biden's business dealings showed that a joint venture funded by CEFC and its chairman, Ye Jianming, called \"Hudson West III\" paid another company, Owasco P.C., $4,790,375.225. Public records in Washington, D.C., show that Owasco P.C. is controlled by Hunter Biden.\nNBC News reported in 2022 that a review of the personal and corporate emails on Hunter Biden's laptop hard drive yielded little information about any business he conducted on behalf of Hudson West III. Hunter Biden's autobiography also doesn't discuss his Chinese business dealings in any detail.\nThe inspector general's report says the FBI team that investigated McGonigal's leak to the CEFC associate also looked into whether James Biden played a role in tipping off anyone with ties to the firm.\nInquiries by James Biden\nA retired Secret Service agent told the FBI that James Biden reached out to him in November 2017 \"with a request to determine whether there was an arrest warrant\" for Patrick Ho, a CEFC employee, the report says.\nThe inspector general's report says hotel records show that James Biden was in Hong Kong on Nov. 12, 2017, and made calls to the retired Secret Service agent. The retired agent said that James Biden told him that \"we have information from China that Ho may be arrested\" and that Ho wanted to travel to the United States but was concerned about a potential warrant for his arrest there, the report says.\nUltimately, the retired Secret Service agent said, he told James Biden he couldn't find an active arrest warrant for Ho but cautioned Biden \"that because arrest warrants are 'sensitive,' negative database searches did not necessarily mean that a warrant did not exist.\"\nIn testimony to Congress in February 2024, James Biden was asked whether he planned to inform Ho whether he was under FBI investigation or whether there was an indictment against him filed under seal with the court.\n\"Absolutely not,\" Biden replied, adding that he was simply trying to determine whether it would be problematic for him and Hunter Biden to meet with Ho.\nHo arrived in the United States in December 2017, apparently believing he wasn't at risk, but the FBI arrested him upon arrival. He was convicted in 2018 and sentenced to three years in prison for bribing or attempting to bribe officials in Africa as CEFC pursued business deals there.\nPayments to Hunter Biden\nRecords provided by the Senate and emails on Hunter Biden's hard drive show that Hudson West III sent a wire to a company called Hudson West, which wired Hunter Biden's company, Owasco, $1 million in March 2019 with a memo line stating, \"Dr Patrick Ho Chi Ping Representation.\"\nNBC News has reported that Hunter Biden never appeared on the docket in Ho's case. No emails were found on his laptop that indicated he was involved in the legal strategy of Ho's case or drafted any legal documents outside his suggestion of whom Ho should hire as a defense lawyer.\nMcGonigal leaked the CEFC investigation to a person identified in an indictment as a \"former senior Albanian government official\" and an employee of a \"Chinese energy conglomerate.\" The former senior Albanian government official then informed CEFC of the probe.\nMcGonigal himself provided much of the information for the report. His proffer was in November 2023 during the Biden administration.\nThe report says McGonigal hoped to put together a business deal with the former Albanian government official after he retired from the FBI.", "content_hash": "f0063e0d81eb52acfc21ccccc4a097b4", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The change comes less than a decade after a cap was placed on this tax break for the first time in its history.\nTaxpayers who itemize tax breaks can claim the SALT deduction, which includes state and local income taxes and property taxes. Trump's 2017 legislation capped SALT at $10,000. Before 2018, the deduction was unlimited — but curbed by the alternative minimum tax for some wealthier households.\n\"This was in effect for over 100 years prior to the 2017 passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,\" said Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., who led the push on Capitol Hill for the higher cap.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nNew bill would eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits\nRecord numbers of retirement savers are now 401(k), IRA millionaires\nWhy coffee prices are so high — and where they’re headed next\nCongress introduced an unlimited state and local tax deduction in 1913. Lawmakers' goal: cut down on what some consider double taxation.\nBut when Republicans needed ways to pay for other tax breaks in the 2017 bill, they homed in on capping the state and local deductions, arguing they primarily benefited wealthier Americans in high cost-of-living areas.\nWho benefits from a higher SALT cap\nHouseholds making $1 million or more would receive half of the benefit if the SALT cap were repealed, according to a 2021 report from the Tax Policy Center.\nBut data shows less-wealthy families stand to save from the higher cap, too, especially those in high cost-of-living areas outside major cities.\nIn 2022, the average SALT deduction was close to $10,000 in states such as Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, California and Massachusetts, according to a Bipartisan Policy Center analysis with the latest IRS data. Those high averages indicate \"that a large portion of taxpayers claiming the deduction bumped up against the $10,000 cap,\" researchers wrote.\nMeanwhile, the states and district with the highest share of SALT claimants were Washington, D.C., Maryland, California, Utah and Virginia, the analysis found.\nHigher property taxes are also putting pressure on many homeowners. The national median annual property tax increased 23% between 2019 and 2023, according to the National Association of Realtors.\nState and local taxes are crucial for funding public services. In 2022, New York state and local governments spent $15,368 per person. That year, the state levied $12,751 in tax per person, according to the Citizens Budget Commission of New York.\n\"That took care of roads, bridges, school districts,\" said Westchester County Executive Ken Jenkins. Westchester County in New York has some of the highest property tax bills in the country.\nRaising the cap on deductions ultimately reduces the amount of revenue the federal government takes in.\nThis adds to the national deficit, which stands at $1.628 trillion in fiscal 2025, according to the Treasury Department.\nThe higher SALT cap is expected to increase the national debt by more than $142 billion over 10 years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. The Tax Foundation estimates that the heightened cap would cost about $320 billion compared with an extension of the existing cap.\nWatch the video above to learn more about why Congress raised the SALT cap this summer.\n— CNBC personal finance reporter Kate Dore contributed reporting to this story.\nCorrection: This article has been updated to correct the title of the Citizens Budget Commission of New York.", "content_hash": "67d19c76905e7d9ffff1216bfd900e60", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

You’re protected for a set number of years or miles, and your plan can cover nearly the entire car (bumper-to-bumper) or just named components, such as the powertrain or electrical system.\nAn extended warranty may be provided by the car manufacturer and sold by the dealership, or it may come from a third-party company like CarChex.\nHow much does a CarChex extended warranty coverage cost?\nFor a five-year Platinum plan for a 2021 Ford Escape with 50,000 miles, we were quoted a rate of $191 per month for 24 months.\nWill CarChex provide a rental car while my vehicle is being repaired?\nYes, all CarChex plans include reimbursement for a rental car if you have a covered breakdown repair. CarChex will cover a rental up to $60 a day. It also offers trip interruption reimbursement if your breakdown requires you to stay in a hotel for up to three days.\nDoes CarChex require a vehicle inspection?\nVehicle inspections are not required for coverage. However, CarChex recommends an inspection to get a clearer picture of your car’s condition. If it’s in excellent shape, your premium could be lower.\nCan I cancel my CarChex service contract?\nIf you cancel your contract within the first 30 days, you will receive a full refund. After that, you’ll get a prorated refund, minus any claims paid.\nMoney matters — so make the most of it.

Powerball ticket sales on the platform increased 130% day over day from Wednesday to Thursday this week. Sales on Wednesday alone increased 200% from the previous week.\nLotto.com and Jackpot.com also offer online lottery sales.\nAs of the most recent drawing on Sept. 3, no ticket had all five winning numbers.

This year, Texas banned Jackpocket and other couriers from operating after a scandal involving a group of lottery ticket buyers who reportedly spent $25 million on nearly every number combination possible to win a $95 million jackpot.\nDraftKings CEO Jason Robins told CNBC back in May the ban was a disappointment because the state of Texas could have contributed meaningfully to the growth of the business.\nDraftKings forecasts Jackpocket will contribute between $260 million and $340 million in incremental revenue and between $60 million and $100 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, by fiscal 2026.\nRobins has said the biggest return on the 2024 acquisition of Jackpocket is the ability to cross-sell customers to the company's sports betting and iGaming offerings on the same platform.\nAs of Thursday, the odds of winning a prize in the Powerball drawing were 1 in 24.9, according to the lottery operator.

The transition to early fall is a seasonally weak period for U.S. equities that could weigh on technology and growth names. With any swing against bellwether stocks such as Nvidia and Microsoft likely to dampen broad market gains, investors can look for clues in the strength or weakness of the AI-themed leadership of the current bull market. Jason Hunter, JPMorgan head of technical strategy, in a recent note to clients used \"a bottom-up approach\" to find evidence of exhaustion in prominent AI leaders that led the spring and summer rally. Take a look at the technical setup for a few of the stocks Hunter looked at below: Nvidia Nvidia shares lost about 3.5% on Friday after Broadcom 's strong quarterly results reflected growing competition in the chip market. The stock has been a drag on the broader market over the past month, losing more than 8%. Shares are up 23% for the year. \"Nvidia is struggling to move back above the 171.50-174.15 cluster of tactical resistance and has tentatively broken down from a short-term top pattern,\" Hunter said. \"Continued price action below that resistance would favor an extension to the first zone of medium-term support at 147-153. We suspect material buying interest upon a first test of that support zone.\" NVDA 1Y mountain Nvidia stock performance over the past year. Alphabet Shares of the Google and YouTube parent climbed about 9% this week after Alphabet won a best-case outcome in a Justice Department antitrust case , when a court ruled that Google can keep its Chrome browser. The stock is up nearly 23% this year. \"Alphabet Inc. presents the strongest bull trend dynamics of any stock in this note,\" Hunter wrote. \"The trend remains firmly intact while above the 204-212 support zone, which includes the early-2025 peak, recent gap and short-term trend line,\" Hunter said. \"The rally has already exceeded the March-June base pattern measured move objective and 2024-2025 trend line. Given the trend dynamics, we suggest managing long risk with a trailing stop, currently set below the aforementioned support levels. A downside break would turn our attention to early-summer breakout levels near 180.\" GOOGL 1Y mountain Alphabet stock performance over the past year. Meta Platforms JPMorgan's technical analysis of Instagram parent Meta suggests that the stock is headed toward a slowdown. \"Meta Platforms Inc. exhibits signs of trend deceleration as the stock repeatedly stalls near the Sep 2024 internal trend line (now 812.24) but maintains a positive trend bias while above key support at 675.37-705. A downside break would signal a bearish medium-term trend reversal and turn our attention to the 592-601 support zone. On the upside, longer-term trend line resistance sits at 909.82,\" the bank wrote. META 1Y mountain Meta stock performance over the past year. The stock is up about 28% year to date. Oracle Oracle has outperformed many of its tech peers, soaring nearly 37% this year. But the maker of database management software has retreated 10% over the past month. \"Oracle has the most short-term chart damage of the stocks in this note after its breakdown below 243 tactical support and then the 229 Jul-Aug top pattern neckline ... the setup favors a further retracement of the spring-summer rally with three support layers,\" Hunter wrote. ORCL 1Y mountain Oracle stock performance over the past year. Microsoft Microsoft has rallied more than 18% year to date. But the stock is lower by almost 7% over the past month as the broad market has churned sideways and concern has grown around the pace of Azure growth. \"Microsoft tries to rebase following the setback from the late-July exhaustion gap. Tactically, the stock needs to clear 518-520 resistance for bulls to regain traction,\" Hunter wrote. \"On a medium-term basis, the chart does not show lower-frequency trend exhaustion or a distribution pattern. We suspect the stock will find support near the 475 Apr 38.2% retrace and 468 July 2024 peak if the pullback persists. The rally has already reached longer-term trend line resistance.\" MSFT 1Y mountain Microsoft stock over the past year. Amazon It's unclear if Amazon's price action represents a consolidation or a distribution pattern and an impending longer-term double top, according to JPMorgan. \"Given Sep-Oct seasonality, we would be cautious about assuming it's the former and at least manage long risk with a trailing stop below the 213-215 key support zone. A downside break would leave the stock vulnerable to a setback toward 190-193 medium-term support. The next level of resistance overhead rests at 252-256,\" Hunter said. The owner of the dominant e-commerce platform in the U.S. is about & % this year, lagging the broad market as well as most of its \" Magnificent 7 \" tech peers.

However, that windfall could shrink significantly after taxes.\nThere are two pretax options if you win: a lump sum, or one immediate payout followed by 29 yearly payments that increase by 5% annually. The lump sum is estimated at $826.4 million, while the annuity is worth an estimated $1.80 billion.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nTrump raised the SALT deduction limit to $40,000 for 2025 — how to maximize it\nActive managers struggled 'mightily' to beat index funds amid volatility: Morningstar\nSenator introduces new bill to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits\nThe next Powerball drawing happens live on Saturday at 10:59 p.m. ET. The chances of winning the grand prize are 1 in about 292 million.\nRoughly $198.3 million goes straight to the IRS\nThe Powerball jackpot winner can expect a large upfront federal tax withholding. The IRS requires a mandatory 24% withholding for prizes that exceed $5,000.\nIf you choose the $826.4 million cash option, the 24% federal tax withholding automatically reduces your winnings by $198.3 million.\nBut the windfall pushes you into the 37% tax bracket, and your bill will likely be higher, certified financial planner John Chichester Jr., founder and CEO of Chichester Financial Group in Phoenix previously told CNBC.\nHow to calculate your federal tax brackets\nThe next Powerball jackpot winner easily lands in the 37% federal income tax bracket, regardless of whether they choose the lump sum or yearly payments.\nFor 2025, the 37% rate applies to individuals with taxable income above $626,350 and married couples filing jointly earning $751,600 or more for 2025.\nYou calculate taxable income by subtracting the greater of the standard or itemized deductions from your adjusted gross income.\nBut the 37% rate doesn't apply to all of your taxable income. For 2025, single filers pay $188,769.75 plus 37% of the amount over $626,350. Meanwhile, joint filers pay $202,154.50 plus 37% of the amount over $751,600.\nThe jackpot winner's remaining tax bill after the 24% federal withholding depends on several factors, but could easily represent millions more. President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" raised the standard deduction, among other breaks, which could reduce taxable income for many filers in 2025.\nYou may also owe state taxes, depending on where you live and where you purchased the ticket. Some states have no income tax or don't tax lottery winnings, but others have top-income state tax brackets exceeding 10%.\nPowerball isn't the only chance to win big. The jackpot for Friday night's Mega Millions drawing now stands at an estimated $336 million. The chance of hitting the jackpot in that game is roughly 1 in 290.4 million.", "content_hash": "0fffce0b5c82c125798ae2487c0f9764", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Some research has also found no association between acetaminophen use and autism.\nIn a note on Friday, BNP Paribas analyst Navann Ty said the firm believes the \"hurdle to proving causation [between the drug and autism] is high, particularly given that the litigation previously concluded in Kenvue's favor.\"\n-- CNBC's Angelica Peebles contributed to this report.", "content_hash": "4e028e984d1fd201f787f0e2c6160df1", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Kennedy Jr. will likely link autism to the use of the company's pain medication Tylenol in pregnant women.\nHHS will release the report that could draw that link this month, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.\nThat report will also suggest a medicine derived from folate – a water-soluble vitamin – can be used to treat symptoms of the developmental disorder in some people, according to the Journal.\nIn a statement, an HHS spokesperson said \"We are using gold-standard science to get to the bottom of America's unprecedented rise in autism rates.\"\n\"Until we release the final report, any claims about its contents are nothing more than speculation,\" they added.\nTylenol could be the latest widely used and accepted treatment that Kennedy has undermined at the helm of HHS, which oversees federal health agencies that regulate drugs and other therapies. Kennedy has also taken steps to change vaccine policy in the U.S., and has amplified false claims about safe and effective shots that use mRNA technology.\nKennedy has made the disorder a key focus of HHS, pledging in April that the agency will \"know what has caused the autism epidemic\" by September and eliminate exposures. He also said that month that the agency has launched a \"massive testing and research effort\" involving hundreds of scientists worldwide that will determine the cause.\nIn a statement, Kenvue said it has \"continuously evaluated the science and [continues] to believe there is no causal link\" between the use of acetaminophen, the generic name for Tylenol, during pregnancy and autism.\nThe company added that the Food and Drug Administration and leading medical organizations \"agree on the safety\" of the drug, its use during pregnancy and the information provided on the Tylenol label.\nThe FDA website says the agency has not found \"clear evidence\" that appropriate use of acetaminophen during pregnancy causes \"adverse pregnancy, birth, neurobehavioral, or developmental outcomes.\" But the FDA said it advises pregnant women to speak with their health-care providers before using over-the-counter drugs.\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists maintains that acetaminophen is safe during pregnancy when taken as directed and after consulting a health-care provider.\nSome previous studies have suggested the drug poses risks to fetal development, and some parents have brought lawsuits claiming that they gave birth to children with autism after using it.\nBut a federal judge in Manhattan ruled in 2023 that some of those lawsuits lacked scientific evidence and later ended the litigation in 2024. Some research has also found no association between acetaminophen use and autism.\nIn a note on Friday, BNP Paribas analyst Navann Ty said the firm believes the \"hurdle to proving causation [between the drug and autism] is high, particularly given that the litigation previously concluded in Kenvue's favor.\"\n-- CNBC's Angelica Peebles contributed to this report.", "content_hash": "4e028e984d1fd201f787f0e2c6160df1", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Market moves : Stocks were falling to close out the week, but the S & P 500 was still tracking for a small weekly gain. Initially, the S & P 500 climbed to a fresh record high in response to the weak August jobs report. At first, the market viewed the data as a classic \"bad news is good news\" move — the soft job gains and higher unemployment rate made traders think the Federal Reserve may have to cut rates more aggressively into year-end. Accordingly, the 10-year Treasury yield dropped below 4.1%, driving interest rate-sensitive stocks tied to real estate and housing higher. Mortgage rates plummeted, too. The average 30-year fixed rate fell 16 basis points to 6.29%, marking the steepest one-day drop since August 2024. Mortgages comfortably under 6.5% are huge for Home Depot because that's the level where housing activity tends to pick up. While the drop in bond yields stuck, the stock market's gains quickly faded, and the soft economic data caused weakness in banks, consumer travel and leisure, industrials, and high-multiple, momentum-based stocks like Palantir and portfolio name GE Vernova . Odds changes: Fed interest rate cut expectations surged in response to the weak jobs data. As of late Friday afternoon, the chances of a 25 basis point cut at the conclusion of the central bank's September 16-17 meeting were 100%, according to CME FedWatch. Within those odds was a 10% probability of a 50 basis point cut. At year-end, the odds of three rate cuts, or a total of 75 basis points of easing, increased to about 64%. For perspective, the probability of three cuts was 46% on Thursday and 40% one week ago. Next week: There are no companies in the portfolio scheduled to report earnings next week. Some of the notable reports are Oracle , Synopsys , Kroger , Adobe , and Chewy . Also, the Fed is in its external communications blackout period ahead of its September meeting, so we won't be hearing from any Fed heads on Friday's weak jobs report and next week's consumer and wholesale inflation readings. One event we will be focused on is Apple 's fall hardware event on Tuesday. The company is expected to announce its iPhone 17 lineup, which may include a slimmed-down \"Air\" version of its flagship device. Pricing will also be of importance to investors. There are also a bunch of sell-side analyst conferences where companies will provide intra-quarter updates. Perhaps the most notable one is Morgan Stanley's Laguna conference — featuring as its website says , \"Industrials, Machinery, Aerospace & Defense, Airlines, Freight Transportation, Autos & Suppliers, and Materials companies.\" (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

Broadcom shareholders cheered a new $10 billion customer. And Tesla's stock was buoyed by a freshly proposed pay package for CEO Elon Musk.\nAdd it up, and the U.S. tech industry's eight trillion-dollar companies gained a combined $420 billion in market cap this week, lifting their total value to $21 trillion, despite a slide in Nvidia shares.\nThose companies now account for roughly 36% of the S&P 500, a proportion so great by historical standards that Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, told CNBC by email, \"there are no comparisons.\"\nThere was a certain irony to this week's gains.\nAlphabet's 9% jump on Wednesday was directly tied to the U.S. government effort to diminish the search giant's market control, which was part of a years-long campaign to break up Big Tech. Since 2020, Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta have all been hit with antitrust allegations by the Department of Justice or Federal Trade Commission.\nA year ago, Google lost to the DOJ, a result viewed by many as the most-significant antitrust decision for the tech industry since the case against Microsoft more than two decades earlier. But in the remedies ruling this week, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said Google won't be forced to sell its Chrome browser despite its loss in court and instead handed down a more limited punishment, including a requirement to share search data with competitors.\nThe decision lifted Apple along with Alphabet, because the companies can stick with an arrangement that involves Google paying Apple billions of dollars per year to be the default search engine on iPhones. Alphabet rose more than 10% for the week and Apple added 3.2%, helping boost the Nasdaq 1.1%.\nAnalysts at Wedbush Securities wrote in a note after the decision that the ruling \"removed a huge overhang\" on Google's stock and a \"black cloud worry\" that hung over Apple. Further, they said it clears the path for the companies to pursue a bigger artificial intelligence deal involving Gemini, Google's AI models.\n\"This now lays the groundwork for Apple to continue its deal and ultimately likely double down on more AI related partnerships with Google Gemini down the road,\" the analysts wrote.\nMehta explained that a major factor in his decision was the emergence of generative AI, which has become a much more competitive market than traditional search and has dramatically changed the market dynamics.\nNew players like OpenAI, Anthropic and Perplexity have altered Google's dominance, Mehta said, noting that generative AI technologies \"may yet prove to be game changers.\"\nOn Friday, Alphabet investors shrugged off a separate antitrust matter out of Europe. The company was hit with a 2.95-billion-euro ($3.45 billion) fine from European Union regulators for anti-competitive practices in its advertising technology business.\nBroadcom pops\nWhile OpenAI was an indirect catalyst for Google and Apple this week, it was more directly tied to the huge rally in Broadcom's stock.\nFollowing Broadcom's better-than-expected earnings report on Thursday, CEO Hock Tan told analysts that his chipmaker had secured a $10 billion contract with a new customer, which would be the company's fourth large AI client.\nSeveral analysts said the new customer is OpenAI, and the Financial Times reported on a partnership between the two companies.\nBroadcom is the newest entrant into the trillion-dollar club, thanks to the company's custom chips for AI, already used by Google, Meta and TikTok parent ByteDance. With Its 13% jump this week, the stock is now up 120% in the past year, lifting Broadcom's market cap to around $1.6 trillion.\n\"The company is firing on all cylinders with clear line of sight for growth supported by significant backlog,\" analysts at Barclays wrote in a note, maintaining their buy recommendation and lifting their price target on the stock.\nFor the other giant AI chipmaker, the past week wasn't so good.\nNvidia shares fell more than 4% in the holiday-shortened week, the worst performance among the megacaps. There was no apparent negative news for Nvidia, but the stock has now dropped for four consecutive weeks.\nStill, Nvidia remains the largest company by market cap, valued at over $4 trillion, with its stock up 56% in the past 12 months.\nMicrosoft also fell this week and is on an extended slide, dropping for five straight weeks. Shares are still up 21% over the last 12 months.\nOn the flipside, Tesla has been the laggard in the group. Shares of the electric vehicle maker are down 13% this year due to a multi-quarter sales slump that reflects rising competition from lower-cost Chinese manufacturers and an aging lineup of EVs.\nBut Tesla shares climbed 5% this week, sparked mostly by gains on Friday after the company said it wants investors to approve a pay plan for Musk that could be worth up to almost $1 trillion.\nThe payouts, split into 12 tranches, would require Tesla to see significant value appreciation, starting with the first award that won't kick in until the company almost doubles its market cap to $2 trillion.\nTesla Chairwoman Robyn Denholm told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin the plan was designed to keep Musk, the world's richest person, \"motivated and focused on delivering for the company.\"", "content_hash": "a5c8316444bf23816c5802bd6b7716ba", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

He said he likes the company's retail concept, adding that it holds a lucrative position in smaller U.S. towns. Cramer suggested he would buy some shares before and after the report, saying the company is \"just the kind of out-of-the-way story that could work in this tape.\"\nApple is expected to release the iPhone 17 on Tuesday, and Cramer said the reveal could move the needle. Tuesday also brings earnings from Oracle, AeroVironment and GameStop. Cramer said Oracle's stock has been performing better since the company \"reinvented itself\" to focus on data centers instead of purely software. But even a solid quarter could spur profit-taking because the market has been \"fickle\" as of late, he continued. Cramer expressed confidence in drone maker AeoVironment as the U.S.'s defense budget balloons. Like Oracle, good results could also trigger profit-taking, Cramer continued, even as he thinks the company will have \"a terrific story to tell.\" But Cramer said he doesn't feel the same way about GameStop, suggesting he's not too optimistic about its results.\nThe Labor Department will release two important inflation metrics next week — the Producer Price Index on Wednesday and the Consumer Price Index on Thursday. Cramer said Wall Street is looking for data that would encourage the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates more aggressively. Tame numbers could spell good news for the market, he said, but cautioned that nothing bullish is lasting in September.\nThursday brings earnings from Kroger and Adobe. Cramer was optimistic about the grocery giant's quarterly results and a potential rally, saying the company has seen success because it's been able to keep its prices steady. But he wasn't sure about Adobe, saying the software company has fallen out of favor on Wall Street as investors worry about competition in the artificial intelligence space.\nCramer said he expects tariff news on Friday, perhaps the long-awaited duties on semiconductor imports.

The semiconductor chipmaker's stock bounced back from a 52-week low reached on April 7 after President Donald Trump's announcement of new tariffs triggered a stock market crash.\nJust because Nvidia's share price rebounded doesn't mean you missed the boat to buy. One factor suggesting Nvidia stock still has room to run is its share price valuation.\nGauging Nvidia stock's valuation\nThe price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a common method to assess the value of Nvidia stock. Comparing it to some of the company's AI semiconductor competitors, such as Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom, can offer valuable insights.\nThe chart reveals Nvidia's earnings multiple is significantly below that of AMD and Broadcom, indicating its stock is a better value. In fact, its current P/E ratio of about 50 is lower than it was last year when it was trading at all-time highs, so its valuation has improved.\nNvidia's performance explains why. For its fiscal second quarter, ended July 27, its net income soared 59% over the prior year to $26.4 billion as revenue rose 56% year over year to $46.7 billion.\nNvidia's share price dropped after Q2 results showed its data center revenue missed Wall Street's expectations, creating a buy opportunity.\nPart of the shortfall was due to the U.S. government blocking AI chip sales to China. Consequently, Nvidia excluded the region from its forecast fiscal Q3 revenue of $54 billion. Even so, that figure is a substantial increase from the previous year's $35.1 billion, demonstrating demand for Nvidia products isn't slowing down.\nThe company's management predicts AI infrastructure spending will hit at least $3 trillion by 2030. While forecasts vary widely, with some predicting global capital expenditures will exceed $7 trillion by the end of the decade, AI spending to date has shown explosive expansion, which means Nvidia could see more years of revenue growth ahead.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

It’s Satoshi’s,’ Says Bruce Liu as OPCAT_Labs Pushes to Reboot Bitcoin’s Code\nEthereum to Close Its Largest Testnet, Holesky, After Fusaka Upgrade\nUnknown block type \"divider\", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option\nNetwork News\nALPENGLOW APPROVED BY SOLANA COMMUNITY: The Solana community voted overwhelmingly in favor of the long-awaited Alpenglow upgrade, bringing the network one step closer to the most significant technical transformation in its history. According to Solana Status on X, 98.27% of SOL stakers that voted approved the proposal, with only 1.05% voting against and 0.36% abstaining. In total, 52% of the network’s stakers participated in the vote. The upgrade introduces a new consensus protocol designed to dramatically improve transaction finality and network efficiency. At the heart of Alpenglow are two new components, Votor and Rotor, which will replace Solana’s existing systems, Proof-of-History and TowerBFT. Currently, Proof-of-History timestamps transactions to preserve their order without slowing the network, while TowerBFT handles the voting process among validators. Alpenglow will overhaul both systems. Votor will slash transaction finality times from over 12 seconds to around 150 milliseconds, delivering near-instant confirmation for users. Rotor, scheduled for a later rollout, will minimize data transfers between validators, a crucial improvement for high-demand applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain-based gaming.With approval secured, Solana is now preparing to implement the upgrade, a milestone expected to unlock greater speed, resilience, and scalability across its ecosystem. — Margaux NijkerkRead more.\nEF TO SELL 10K ETH OVER NEXT FEW WEEKS: The Ethereum Foundation (EF) shared in a post on X on Tuesday that it plans to sell 10,000 ETH through centralized exchanges over the next several weeks to support work toward research & development, ecosystem grants and related donations. According to CoinMarketCap, the ETH will amount to roughly $43 million at Tuesday’s prices. “Conversions will take place over multiple smaller orders, rather than as a single large transaction,” the EF wrote in the post on X.The news follows the EF’s rollout of a new treasury policy in June that caps annual operational spending (opex) at 15%, establishes a multiyear reserve buffer and sets a gradual pace toward even leaner spending long-term. The foundation sold an additional 10,000 ETH to SharpLink Gaming in July, making the online casino marketing firm the first publicly traded company to buy ETH from a key firm in the network’s ecosystem. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more.\nA CHAT WITH BRUCE LIU ON OP_CAT: Without OP_CAT, Bruce Liu says Bitcoin is as \"useful as a jumbo jet without wings\" capable of much more than it’s allowed to do, but stuck on the ground while Ethereum and Solana soar. Liu, the founder of OPCAT_Labs, says a single opcode, OP_CAT, could transform bitcoin from static digital gold into programmable money that rivals other layer-1 chains. OP_CAT is a long-disabled opcode in Bitcoin’s code that, if re-enabled, would allow developers to concatenate data in scripts and unlock new possibilities, from vaults and covenants to decentralized exchanges and zero-knowledge proofs. The Bitcoin blockchain, if OP_CAT was re-enabled, would be as programmable as Ethereum or Solana, said Liu. \"OP_CAT is not new code. It was never deleted, just commented out and disabled. We are not adding my opcode or somebody else’s. It’s Satoshi’s,” Liu told CoinDesk during an interview on the sidelines of BTC Asia in Hong Kong. — Sam ReynoldsRead more.\nHOLESKY SUNSET IS COMING AFTER FUSAKA UPGRADE: A fresh slate of Ethereum testnets is replacing Holesky, the once-massive staging ground now set for shutdown after two years of service.The wind-down will occur two weeks after the Fusaka upgrade is finalized later this year, at which point client and infrastructure teams will cease providing support. Fusaka is set to make Ethereum rollups cheaper and faster by spreading out the “data storage work” more evenly across validators. Holesky went live in 2023 to stress-test Ethereum’s proof-of-stake machinery at scale. It quickly became the largest public testnet, providing thousands of validators with a platform to trial upgrades before they were deployed on the mainnet. Major milestones, such as the Dencun and Pectra upgrades — which lowered transaction costs and upgraded validator efficiency, among other features — were run through Holesky first. However, cracks began to appear as the network aged. Holesky encountered “inactivity leaks” after Pectra’s activation in early 2025, a term referring to validators going offline in large numbers, which created a significant backlog for those attempting to exit. The result was months-long queues that made it impractical to test the full validator lifecycle. For developers needing fast feedback loops, Holesky had become more of a roadblock than a tool. — Shaurya Malwa Read more.\nUnknown block type \"divider\", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option\nIn Other News\nDigital asset investment firm Galaxy Digital (GLXY) is bringing its stock onto blockchain rails as equity tokenization gains steam.The Nasdaq-listed company is working with blockchain firm Superstate to make its Class A common stock available as tokens on the Solana network through Superstate’s Opening Bell platform. The arrangement preserves the full rights of SEC-registered equity while allowing investors to hold and transfer shares on-chain, the firms said. Tokenization of traditional assets has gained traction across the financial sector as firms experiment with moving equities, bonds and money-market funds onto blockchain infrastructure. A slew of tokenized equity products hit the market in the past few months predominantly for EU investors, including by Robinhood, Gemini with Dinari and xStocks by Kraken and Backed Finance. However, some offerings drew concerns such as limited shareholder rights and fragmented regulations. Unlike synthetic or wrapped tokenized stocks that operate without issuer involvement, Galaxy’s shares are issued directly on-chain and tracked by Superstate as a transfer agent, recording changes to the shareholder register instantly as tokens move between verified wallets. This approach seeks to combine compliance with blockchain features such as fast settlement, transparency and around-the clock-availability, the firms said. — Kristzian SandorRead more.\nOndo Finance launched its tokenized equity platform dubbed Ondo Global Markets, offering non-U.S. investors access to more than 100 U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on-chain. The tokenized equities, first announced in February, have gone live on Ethereum and are backed by securities held by U.S.-registered broker-dealers, the firm said.The offering includes crypto token versions of Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and the QQQ ETF among others. Investors in Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa and Latin America can mint and redeem shares around the clock during trading days, with access to underlying exchange liquidity. The service is not available for U.S. users. The tokens are designed to move freely between wallets, exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The firm has also partnered with BitGo, Ledger, Chainlink and other infrastructure providers to support the rollout.— Kristzian Sandor Read more.\nUnknown block type \"divider\", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option\nRegulatory and Policy\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde urged European Union (EU) lawmakers to impose stringent requirements and safeguards on foreign stablecoins.\nLagarde argued they should comply with the bloc’s regulatory standards before operating on EU soil, she said in a speech at a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) conference in Frankfurt. The ECB president cautioned that during a stablecoin run, investors would be more likely redeem in jurisdictions with stronger protections, such as the EU, where Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation prohibits redemption fees, potentially depleting local reserves. \"The risk of liquidity mismanagement across jurisdictions is one we have seen before.

We are confident that our combined firms are strategically positioned to benefit from future growth opportunities.”\nIn April, Aspen Standard, a newly established holding company taking majority stakes in RIAs, acquired NEPWA.

If cleared for market, the oral drug would be sold as Vyglxia and used to treat patients with spinocerebellar ataxia, a type of genetic disorder where the progressive erosion of nerve cells causes problems with movement, coordination and brain function.\nPending approval, Biohaven would be “ready to ship on Day 1,” according to CEO Vlad Coric. The company already has in place a patient hub, nurse managers, specialists to negotiate coverage with insurance companies, as well as the “basic constructs” of a small sales team for Vyglxia.\n“There’s a number of patients who are waiting,” Coric said on Wednesday, during a healthcare conference hosted by the investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald. “We're ready to go. We're just waiting on the FDA.”\nBiohaven today is referred to by some as the “2.0” version of the original company, which made a name for itself developing and then securing approval for the migraine drug Nurtec ODT. Despite competition from the much larger AbbVie, which sold a similar drug, Biohaven quickly carved out a substantial portion of the migraine treatment market and was recording more than $450 million in annual sales from Nurtec by the end of 2021.\nThat success piqued the interest of Pfizer, which, in the spring of 2022, agreed to buy Biohaven for its migraine business. After that nearly $12 billion deal closed, the remaining pieces of Biohaven were spun out into a new company operating under the same name.\nCoric envisions the Vyglxia launch being “very different” than its predecessor. It will be much smaller, more streamlined, cost considerably less and likely be accomplished with a sales team that, in size, is less than 10% of what the company deployed to sell Nurtec.\nAdditionally, Biohaven won’t have to worry about any direct competitors, as there are no other drugs currently available for spinocerebellar ataxia. “Thankfully, we're not going to have the epic David versus Goliath, Biohaven versus AbbVie,” Coric said.", "content_hash": "8c5cced284367c648893ea2fedf739f6", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

LaFontaine Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram of Clinton, Inc. alleged in his 2022 lawsuit that he was fired shortly after complaining about the manager’s conduct. He claimed that the manager used a slur that disparaged another Arab American employee in conversation with the plaintiff. He alleged retaliation in violation of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act as well as Michigan state law.\n-\nJudge Linda Parker granted summary judgment to the dealership, holding that the plaintiff did not have sufficient proof to advance his claims under the cat’s paw theory of liability. He filed a motion for reconsideration of the judgment, arguing in part that the cat’s paw theory did not apply to his claims, but Parker affirmed her prior ruling and denied the motion.\nDive Insight:\nCat’s paw theory has been invoked by federal courts in numerous employment discrimination challenges. According to Parker’s first ruling in Hackney, this doctrine holds employers liable when a “biased subordinate, who lacks decisionmaking power, uses the formal decisionmaker as a dupe in a deliberate scheme to trigger a discriminatory employment action,” citing precedent of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\nThe car dealership claimed that the manager who allegedly used the ethnic slur was not the ultimate decision-maker on whether to fire the plaintiff. The plaintiff, moreover, failed to show that the manager’s allegedly retaliatory animus was the but-for cause of his firing, Parker found. The court cited evidence uncovered during discovery that showed the plaintiff’s performance was “a legitimate factor for termination” and contributed to the decision made by the dealership’s general manager to terminate.\nIn his motion for reconsideration, the plaintiff claimed that the court erred in applying the cat’s paw theory because he contended that the manager was the decision-maker who initiated his firing. Parker conceded that the court “did not give proper consideration to this point” in its initial order.\nHowever, the judge nonetheless held the plaintiff’s evidence — namely, the presence of the manager’s name on his termination letter — did not support any inference that the manager made the decision to terminate. Parker then reaffirmed her prior findings on the applicability of cat’s paw theory to the case.", "content_hash": "b45554b14213cdfc7663f65dd424a2b2", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Its shares have dropped by 21% in 2025 as of market close Sept. 2, and after a disappointing second-quarter earnings report on July 30. However, the German shoemaker could have a plan to turn things around.\nTariff impacts being felt\nIn its July 30 quarterly report, Adidas CEO Bjørn Gulden shared that the company suffered a multimillion-euro hit in the second quarter due to recent U.S. tariffs on imports implemented by President Donald Trump. The sportswear company fears it could face tariff-related costs of up to 200 million euros ($232 million) over the remainder of 2025, equivalent to 3.4% of its 5.95 billion euros ($6.9 billion) in Q2 revenue. Still, Adidas is optimistic that it will be \"a leader in all markets\" except North America.\nGulden also warned that consumer goods prices overall may increase in the U.S. because of tariffs. Even though Trump extended tariff moratoriums with China, other pauses expired after Aug. 1, including those for Vietnam and Indonesia, the two countries that supply Adidas the bulk of its goods.\nIronically, China was once the brand's leading manufacturer before it began pivoting to Vietnam within the last decade. If Trump's proposed 46% tariff on goods imported from Vietnam remains in effect, it could have a big impact on Adidas, as well as the businesses of other clothing companies that source their products from the country, which include Nike and Wayfair.\nThe company faced an 18% drop in share price in July, its worst-performing month this year. Following that, its price fell to $95.35 on Aug. 6, the lowest price of 2025. At this pace, Adidas is in danger of reaching its lowest price since October 2023 as there is uncertainty among investors and the apparel company itself due to tariff and sales concerns.\nWill running shoes save Adidas' stock?\nAdam Cochrane, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, recently described running shoes as the most \"exciting category\" of footwear for market growth. He expects Adidas and fellow German sportswear brand Puma to redirect focus toward this category due to the increasingly high demand, as they offer comfort and style. Adidas has already matched those predictions, having released two running shoes this year: the Adizero Adios Pro 4 in January and the Adidas Boston 13 in May.", "content_hash": "52e9e856959128f3222785cf29c5d04d", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Meta went on trial earlier this year in a case that could force it to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. (The judge is weighing that decision now.) The suit, which was filed in 2020, alleges Meta overpaid for the two apps to preserve its dominance in social networking.\nAmazon, meanwhile, is set to face trial in October 2026 for the FTC’s antitrust suit. And Apple isn’t in the clear either: the Justice Department and 16 state and district attorneys general sued the company last March, accusing it of monopolizing the smartphone market.\nThe Google penalty should allow all of those companies to take a collective breath, as Judge Amit Mehta accepted “in full” Google’s proposed remedies, only tacking on a few modifications, while largely ignoring the government’s suggestions. In fact, Mehta called the proposal to divest Chrome or Android an overreach on the part of the government.\nAs part of his 226-page decision, Mehta wrote the rise of generative AI has “changed the course of this case,” acknowledging that services like ChatGPT have upended the tech world.\nThat line could be key in upcoming antitrust cases. If the case seems to be leaning against Big Tech, invoking AI and changing market conditions could be the corporate equivalent of a “get out of jail free” card.\nAmazon, for example, could argue AI shopping agents drive consumers to the lowest prices, boosting competition. It also doesn’t hurt that Amazon’s competitors are showing gains: Walmart’s online sales jumped 22% last year and rose again in the second quarter, while Shein, Temu, and TikTok Shop are also chipping away at market share.\nMeta, which is in the process of increasing its emphasis on AI, could make a similar argument. The company argues that today’s social media looks very different than it did when it acquired rivals. Its recent addition of a friends-only tab on Facebook—a way to restore a clean feed from people you actually know—reflects how much the industry has changed.", "content_hash": "3f93d1a1f99e4863175e97f0283e5461", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

President Trump’s agenda of aggressive tax cuts is expected to trigger a further surge in America’s already high debt levels at a time of slowing growth.\nIn France, the interest rate on long-term borrowing spiked to its highest since 2009 before nudging down slightly on Wednesday as its government teeters on the brink of collapse.\nIt happened as the UK Treasury announced that the Autumn Budget will take place on November 26, as rising borrowing costs threaten to land Rachel Reeves further in the red.\nThe timing means it will be one of the latest autumn fiscal events in recent years, taking place nearly a month later than last year.\nMs Reeves will be forced to find between £18bn and 28bn of savings ahead of the Budget likely funded by tax rises, Capital Economics predicts.\n12:06 PM BST\nJapanese borrowing costs climb to reach new high\nYields on the longest-dated Japanese government bonds are hitting fresh records, as jittery traders fret that the country’s political leaders won’t be able to keep Japan’s public debt mountain from growing.\nAfter a poor showing in recent parliamentary elections, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is struggling to assert his authority. Senior officials from his Liberal Democratic Party have quit, and his MPs might call a vote next Monday to trigger an early leadership contest.\nJapan’s debt-to-GDP ratio is 237pc, which Ishiba earlier this year pointed out is higher than Greece’s. He was trying to stop the July election turning into an auction of tax cuts and spending promises, which would have undermined several years’ success in shrinking the budget deficit.\nThe fear is that the post-election political disarray, and the potential arrival of a new prime minister trying to buy popularity, will start to erode this fiscal discipline.\nMany traders also expect the Bank of Japan to lift its benchmark interest rate in October, because although food prices are cooling, core inflation is still high and wages growth is strong. Expected BoJ hikes will fuel higher government bond yields.\nThe central bank is also pushing up yields in another way: it is buying fewer bonds, as it ends a purchase program designed to prop up the economy. This reduces demand for the bonds, saps their prices and drives up the yields.\nOther buyers are not replacing the missing BoJ. Japan’s finance ministry has been consulting with the market on whether to cut back the amount of longer-term debt it issues, to keep prices higher and ease volatility.\n11:39 AM BST\nBudget in late November risks prolonging the ‘uncertainty’ facing businesses\nHolding the autumn Budget on November 26 is prolonging the “doom and uncertainty” facing British businesses, the shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride has warned.\nSir Mel said: “Labour are stalling, leaving the Budget until as late as possible in the vain hope things might get better. Businesses and investors need certainty now - not months of further damaging speculation about tax rises.\n“Labour don’t have a plan - and they don’t know what they’re doing. This dither and delay only prolongs the doom and uncertainty unnecessarily.”\nIt comes as pressure on Rachel Reeves grows to raise taxes in the autumn Budget in order to meet her “ironclad” fiscal rules and plug a black hole in the public purse.\nSir Mel added: “Labour promised stability but they’ve doubled inflation, delivered soaring debt and destroyed business confidence. Taxes are up, the deficit is up, and borrowing costs have hit a 27-year high.“\n11:15 AM BST\nServices sector growth climbs higher\nActivity in the UK’s services sector climbed to a 16 month high amid a revival in activity in the industry.\nThe UK services PMI for August rose to 54.2 last month, up from 51.8 in July. The strong uptick in the service industry was largely because of a rise in new orders as demand recovered.\nYet, Matt Swannell, the chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, cautioned that “poorer performances from sectors not covered by the S&P Global survey, such as retail and health, the latter due to July’s strikes by resident doctors, will likely mean GDP growth is softer in Q3 than the PMIs imply”.\n“On the inflation front, today’s services survey also reported that costs and prices growth picked up in August, as businesses continued to adjust to higher labour costs,” he added.\n10:57 AM BST\nRachel Reeves expected to try to ward off a downgrade to Britain’s growth\nRachel Reeves is hoping fifty or so civil servants located half a mile from Downing Street will save her from another round of damaging tax rises.\nThe Chancellor is hoping the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government’s tax and spending watchdog, will give her credit for a series of planning reforms and trade deals struck this year.\nInsiders suggested this would determine the size of potential tax rises she will have to impose.\nSo expect a Budget on November 26 that cuts red tape and paves the way for more planning reform.\nLabour is anticipated to revive a Northern Powerhouse railway project and is looking for other ways for the economy to get more bang for its buck in order to ward off a potential downgrade of the country’s long-term growth prospects.\nIf the watchdog even slices 0.1 percentage point off Britain’s growth potential, it would mean Ms Reeves would have to find £7bn of tax rises - equivalent to a penny on income tax.\nLabour is expected to turbocharge other parts of its planning reforms. It is currently examining how to speed up the creation of the next generation of data centres as the UK looks to be an AI hub.\nMs Reeves is also hoping to be given credit for trade deals struck with the US, India and the European Union.\nInsiders rejected the idea that the Treasury was creating policy based on what the watchdog would “score” as positive for the public finances.\nOne highlighted that Jeremy Hunt went further and faster on free childcare measures because they were positive for growth.\nThe Budget’s late date will give the OBR more time to consider these measures, though the market mayhem shows there is no resiling from the fact that more tax rises are inevitable.\n10:42 AM BST\nBorrowing costs pushed higher by ‘perfect storm’ of factors\nAllan Monks, the chief UK economist at JP Morgan, said that borrowing costs have been pushed higher “by a perfect storm of factors, including global influences and structural changes in the demand for longer-dated bonds”.\nJP Morgan has previously estimated that Rachel Reeves is facing a £20bn to 30bn black hole in the public finances but now higher borrowing costs have pushed this estimate up “by a few billion”.\nMr Monks added the Chancellor is facing a challenging trade off in the autumn budget to keep both voters and markets happy.\n“Too much tightening would adversely affect growth in the near term and could accelerate Labour’s decline in the opinion polls. Too little tightening could raise market concerns and borrowing costs.”\nHowever he warned: “Even if the government gets through the Budget this year, it may find it hard to reach a stable equilibrium within the trade-off it faces.”\n10:15 AM BST\nReeves faces ‘one of the toughest’ Budgets in memory amid borrowing pressure\nRachel Reeves faces one of the toughest fiscal events in “living memory” this autumn, as borrowing costs are rising.\nRuth Curtice, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: “The Chancellor has officially fired the starting pistol on the countdown to one of the toughest second Budgets in living memory.”\nShe warned that significant tax rises or spending cuts will be needed.\nShe added: “With higher gilt yields currently adding over £3 billion to debt interest costs, and over £6 billion of policy U-turns announced since March, the Chancellor is already on track to miss her fiscal rules. With a growth downgrade also likely, significant fiscal tightening will be needed.”\n10:10 AM BST\nRise in gilt yields risks putting pressure on mortgage rates\nThe rise in Britain’s long-term borrowing costs risks pushing up mortgage rates, just as the housing market is starting to recover.\nMatthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, said: “The 30-yield gilt yield (5.7pc), which indirectly impacts long-duration mortgage rates, has now jumped to its highest level since 1997, while the 10-year (4.8pc) is trading around its highest levels so far in 2025.\nHe added: “While this is partly a global issue, clearly there are domestic factors at play that are exacerbating the rout. All eyes will be on how Chancellor Reeves and how her team intend to proceed.“\n09:37 AM BST\n5 things to start your day\nGood morning...\nThank you for joining us today, as borrowing costs edge up and the Chancellor faces a countdown to a difficult autumn Budget.\n5 things to start your day\n-\nCity grandee sounds bond markets alarm as borrowing costs hit new high | Pound falls sharply after Prime Minister sidelines Chancellor in Downing Street reshuffle\n-\nReform backs watchdog bid to break Big Tech stranglehold | Tice’s opposition to foreign monopolies risks angering the US president\n-\nReeves faces £11bn bill over Miliband’s North Sea shutdown | Companies get tax rebates for shutting down and dismantling platforms\n-\nDealerships unable to sell Range Rovers after JLR cyber attack | Car giant says there is ‘no evidence’ that customer data has been stolen\n-\nTrump’s migration crackdown puts US on track for first-ever population decline | Sweeping measures could undermine the US economy\nWhat happened overnight\nWall Street closed down last night.

But then again, there’s also likely to be some hesitancy around leaving too much of this vetting to the robots, lest you end up with shaky candidates.\nBut there’s also likely no harm in trying it out either, and seeing what kinds of results the system produces for your open jobs.\nLinkedIn says that it’s also updated and refined its Hiring Assistant process, in order to provide “more natural, responsive, conversational” ways to engage with the tool.\n“We’ve made it easier for recruiters to describe needs in their own words and work alongside Hiring Assistant to find the right candidates. We did this by re-engineering our agent orchestration and tool-calling systems so conversations feel fast and fluid, while still allowing for deeper reasoning which leads to better outcomes.”\nIt’s also revised its matching framework to improve the quality of matches (based on initial usage insights), while it’s also built and refined its own model, built on LinkedIn’s Economic Graph, to improve performance.\nAnd early results on this front have been promising.\n“Since we announced Hiring Assistant last year, recruiters are saving over four hours per role, reviewing 62% fewer profiles before reaching a confident short list, and seeing a 69% improvement in InMail acceptance.”\nSo, again, it could be worth checking out, and seeing which people the system chooses, versus the candidates that your human HR managers select for a given role.", "content_hash": "1c8de54be43767cf836850c0d476ad38", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Now, Dollar Tree is “a fully focused business,” CEO Mike Creedon said on a call with analysts Wednesday.\n“Now that Dollar Tree is completely shot of the rotten apple that was Family Dollar, it can fully focus its capital and time on a proposition that both works and has potential,” GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said in emailed comments.\nExecutives on the call noted that the impact of tariffs and the company's mitigation tactics have played out differently than expected. Positive impacts from mitigation efforts yielded results sooner, as the more direct impact of tariffs is now expected in the second half of the year.\nCreedon and industry analysts touted the success of its expanded pricing assortment. In the quarter, Dollar Tree said it continued to see growth with middle- and high-income shoppers.\n“In our view, Dollar Tree's business remains solid and should continue to benefit from a stickier core consumer and gains from middle-to-upper income consumers trading down as macro trends remain challenging,” Telsey Advisory Group analysts said in an emailed note. “Furthermore, the company should benefit from the rollout of multi-price point products, which should provide a long runway of growth.”\nPrice increases have been taken as part of a larger set of tariff mitigation efforts, but Creedon said that about 85% of the store is $2 or less. However, further price adjustments are not out of the question for the back half of the year.", "content_hash": "6678136d56a65001e97a40eae82b486a", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Two unnamed customers made up 39% of Nvidia’s total revenue in the latest quarter, according to a recent securities filing.\n-\n“Customer A” made up 23% of total revenue, while “Customer B” comprised 16%, according to Nvidia’s Q2 fiscal year 2026 earnings report, which accounted for the three months that ended July 27.\nDive Insight:\nIn recent months, customers have been upgrading to Blackwell chips, specifically the GB200 and GB300 models sold as components on the NVL72 rack systems, to increase their artificial intelligence capabilities and computing speeds. Nvidia began production shipments of GB300 in Q2, according to the securities filing.\n“We’re ramping really hard into data centers,” CEO Jensen Huang said in an earnings call Aug. 27. “This year is obviously a record-breaking year. I expect next year to be a record-breaking year.”\nNvidia posted Q2 net income of $26.4 billion, up 59% over last year. CFO Colette Kress said on the call that Nvidia’s full stack AI solutions for cloud service providers and other customers are contributing to the company’s growth.\n“We are at the beginning of an industrial revolution that will transform every industry,” Kress said. “We see $3 trillion to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spend by the end of the decade.”\nMajor customers like Microsoft, Amazon and Google are building out their AI infrastructure with Nvidia’s chips and racks in the race for AI dominance. In June, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg pledged to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build several massive AI data centers for superintelligence, Reuters reported. Meta is a major buyer of Nvidia’s chips.\nAs cloud service providers build out their infrastructures, Nvidia’s Q2 data center revenue has surged to $41.1 billion, up 56% from a year ago. This was driven in part by two direct customers that accounted for 39% of the company’s total revenue, according to an investor filing. In the same quarter last year, Nvidia’s top two customers made up 14% and 11% of sales.\nWhile no details were provided about who the top customers could be, Nvidia reported that an “AI research and deployment company” contributed to a meaningful amount of revenue through a mix of direct and indirect customers.", "content_hash": "02df29276fd2f49b844c776fc26eff26", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Aramids are synthetic fibers used to make protective gear in high-risk situations such as firefighting, industrial settings and combat.\n-\nThe deal includes 1,900 employees and five manufacturing sites, according to the press release. The divestiture is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026.\nDive Insight:\nThe divestiture is part of DuPont’s 2025 realignment segment strategy, which it began in Q1, according to a March 31 securities filing. DuPont initially planned to break into three independent companies: materials science, water technologies and electronics.\nDuPont changed its separation plans in January and decided “New DuPont” will comprise materials science and the water business, and instead only spin off its electronics segment.\nThe revamped plans led the chemical titan to adjust its segment reporting structure due to the upcoming electronics separation, accounting as “ElectronicsCo” and “IndustrialsCo,” CFO Antonella Franzen said in a Q1 earnings call. The industrials segment comprises two lines of business: healthcare and water technologies, and diversified industrials, Franzen added.\nAfter analyzing the segments’ performance, DuPont decided that the aramid assets within its industrials segment were worth more than their current market value. The net sales for the aramids business were $675 million in the first six months of 2025.\nThe aramids divestiture will not impact the company’s separation plans as it remains on track to spin off its electronics segment Qnity Electronics by Nov. 1, according to the press release.\n“Our focus right now, obviously, as I mentioned, is getting Qnity out the door on November 1,” CEO Lori Koch said in an Aug. 5 call. “We have been pretty clear, though, that we’ll look to shift the focus of the portfolio towards the Healthcare and the Water and that we had incremental portfolio work that we would probably be doing for New DuPont.”\nWhen the deal closes next year, DuPont will generate approximately $1.2 billion in cash before taxes as well as receive $300 million.

Modera had been working with Ferrentino over the years in a referral capacity and has its own tax practice based in Asheville, N.C., with which the firm will join forces.\n“We typically gather tax documents for clients and then ship them off to the accounting firm as they come in; controlling all parts of this process is easier and can reduce mistakes, confusion, and time,” said Modera CEO Tom Orecchio.\nOrecchio listed some of the benefits of having an in-house practice as seeing the entirety of the client’s financial life, spotting tax planning opportunities, giving clients one point of contact for tax compliance and allowing the firm to work more closely with the client and their remaining outside professionals.\nModera Wealth is the latest in a trend of RIAs or RIA-investors seeking to more closely link adjacent tax services to wealth management rather than operating on an external CPA referral system.\nFerrentino & Associates, founded by CEO Gary Ferrentino in 2005 and based in Oradell, N.J., offers tax preparation, accounting and bookkeeping services.\n“Gary and I have worked together for more than 25 years,” Orecchio said. “This is a formalization of a relationship built on shared purpose.”\nFerrentino will now be the director of tax services with Modera, guiding the firm’s tax strategy and working with advisors to offer tax planning.\n“I feel strongly that a client is best served when their investment advisor and accountant are in close communication,” Ferrentino said in a statement. “By joining Modera, we are able to provide additional opportunities for our team and attract talented professionals in new markets.

It will prevent Alphabet from making some exclusive contracts with device manufacturers. The company also has to share some of its search data with competitors, which is expected to help artificial intelligence firms improve competing products.\nBut, crucially, the ruling allows Google to continue paying companies such as Apple to feature its search engine.

There’s also the matter of how quickly you’ll want to pay down your mortgage.\nOn the surface, paying off your mortgage early sounds wise. After all, it can save you thousands in interest over the life of the loan, give you peace of mind knowing your home is fully yours, and reduce the burden of one of your largest monthly expenses once it’s gone. For many, the idea of being debt-free, especially with such a big-ticket item, is reason enough to push extra cash toward the balance.\nBut before you start funneling every spare dollar into your loan balance, it’s worth listening to Richard Coffin, CFA, and host of the finance show “The Plain Bagel.” GOBankingRates caught up with Coffin as part of our Top 100 Money Experts series, and he shared some compelling reasons not to pay off your mortgage. Indeed, rushing to pay it off could wind up costing you in the long run.\nSlowing Down Payments Lets You Take Advantage of Lower Interest Rates\n“Mortgages tend to be a very cheap form of borrowing, relatively speaking,” Coffin said. He points out that this is largely because they’re secured by your home — a valuable asset that reduces risk for your lender and helps keep your interest rate low.\n“That makes them more favorable than other types of loans like credit cards or unsecured lines of credit,” he said.\nGiven that you’re already paying a relatively low interest rate, it might make more sense to focus on higher-interest debt first, like credit card balances. And once that’s under control, you could revisit the idea of tackling your mortgage — or, if your risk tolerance allows, consider another option that Coffin suggests.\n“If an individual can invest the money at a higher rate of return than their mortgage rate, they would make more money investing their excess funds rather than putting it towards their mortgage balance,” he said.\nRead Next: 6 Hidden Costs of Homeownership That Can Wreck Your Budget\nPaying Off Your Mortgage Early Reduces Liquidity and Flexibility\nCoffin acknowledges that there are certain circumstances where paying off your mortgage early may feel like the right move.", "content_hash": "469414daf0df692c19728288dd8dbfc6", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Companies tend to conduct stock splits for a specific reason and usually after the stock has made a significant move over time. These moves also tend to elicit interest from the market.\nThe conversational artificial intelligence company SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) has been one of the smaller companies piggybacking on the AI revolution. While the company has generated good returns for shareholders over the past five years, the stock has also been volatile. Is a potential stock split on the horizon?\nWhat are stock splits and reverse stock splits?\nAs mentioned above, stock splits are a way for companies to change their stock price and outstanding share count. Investors need to understand that stock splits and reverse stock splits don't change the market cap of a company, so the equity value of an investor's position doesn't change either.\nA stock split lowers the share price and increases the amount of outstanding shares. For instance, let's say an investor owns 20 shares of a stock trading at $200 per share for a total value of $4,000. If the company decided to conduct a two-for-one stock split, it would give investors two shares for each one they own. This means the investor's 20 shares would increase to 40 shares. The equity value doesn't change, so the share price decreases to $100 per share ($4,000/40).\nCompanies typically conduct stock splits if their stock has gone on a big run and now trades for hundreds or even thousands of dollars per share. The company may want the stock to feel more attainable, and stock splits can also increase liquidity. On the other hand, reverse stock splits increase the price per share and lower the share count.\nThe main reason to conduct a reverse stock split is if a stock on a major exchange like the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq is out of compliance with the exchange's rules. If stocks on the NYSE or Nasdaq trade below $1 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, it could risk eventual delisting if the issue is not corrected. If a company's stock has fallen below $1 but management thinks it can turn things around and want to remain on a major exchange, a reverse stock split can be useful.\nWill SoundHound AI soon do a stock split?\nSoundHound provides companies with conversational intelligence capabilities that companies can use to improve their customer experience. Use cases include chatbots in automobiles, ordering food or other products and services, and assisting with customer issues in a more efficient manner.\nSoundHound currently trades at a roughly $5 billion market cap and over $13 per share, so the company isn't having any compliance issues right now. However, within the last five years, the stock has actually touched close to $1 per share on several occasions. According to MarketWatch, most of the company's outstanding shares are publicly traded, so liquidity doesn't seem to be an issue. However, over 30% of the public float is being shorted by investors, meaning they think the stock will go down.\nIn its second quarter earnings report, SoundHound reported a net loss of $0.19, down from a net loss of $0.11 one year ago. The adjusted net loss, however, was only $0.03 per share, a penny better than last year. Revenue of nearly $43 million rocketed 217% year over year.\nI didn't find any evidence of SoundHound conducting any stock splits in the past. Ultimately, as things stand now, I don't see the company jumping to do any kind of stock split or reverse split. The only way a reverse split would be needed is if the company lost most of its value, driven by some kind of plunge in AI stocks or company-specific failure. But none of that strikes me as likely right now.\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

Its end goal is nothing less than the death of the billable hour that, according to CEO Omar Haroun, has gotten entirely out of hand. “Most legal departments have lost control of their budgets and their knowledge,” Haroun said in a press release announcing the launch of Eudia Counsel, which he called “the first AI-native law firm.” He said it was built to help companies regain control of their knowledge.\nThe company has fought hard behind the scenes to bring this law firm to light, Haroun said in an interview with Fortune at Eudia’s 2025 Augmented Intelligence Summit in New York. Arizona is the only state in the country where a law firm is not required to be owned by lawyers, he said. Even still, there are technicalities. Eudia is not technically set up as a law firm. Under Arizona’s Alternative Business Structure (ABS) program, it’s set up as a company that is a “provider of a law firm.”\nThe company is also expanding its access-to-justice initiative, AI for Good, with Haroun telling Fortune that the economics of AI can transform pro bono work, which he sees as “the reason people like me went to law school” in the first place. Haroun acquired a law degree at Columbia Law School before a career in consulting, tech, and AI that saw him sell another company, Text IQ, to Relativity in 2021.\nDeep bench of clients\nHaroun’s career in AI stretches back over 10 years and allowed him to acquire several Fortune 500 clients as soon as he launched Eudia as cofounder in 2023. Mark Smolik, the general counsel for Fortune Global 500 firm DHL, told Fortune at the event that he has known Haroun for many years and fell into using AI “by accident.”\nThe spark for him? “Our data was all over the place,” he said, explaining that DHL was doing business on multiple continents and there were too many different spreadsheets lying around. AI was just a tool to get organized at first, but years of work with Eudia have yielded “considerable savings,” he said, declining to discuss specific numbers.\nGary Hood, general counsel for Berkshire Hathaway–owned Duracell, said his firm has been a client of Eudia since day one, adding that using it has been a “no-brainer” for use cases such as contracts and due diligence during M&A. Similar attendees at the event included Cargill, Coherent, Graybar, and Intuit, which is piloting a relationship with Eudia.\n“We have been heads down for the last two years,” Haroun told Fortune. He said the launch of its Arizona operations and some of the showy stunts at its Augmented Intelligence summit, including hiring an actor to play a priest who’s reading last rites for the billable hour, have the Eudia crowd “bracing” for a reaction from Big Law. The truth is, he said, many of Eudia’s clients have been “frustrated” over the past several years. Haroun says he hears from Eudia’s customers that outside law firms say they’re using AI but the bills keep going up, not down.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in October 2024 that major corporate clients were growing “indignant” at the stickiness of the billable hour. Rankings site Best Law Firms surveyed thousands of firms in November 2024 and found that “alternative” billing structures were on the rise, but the billable hour was alive and well, with a significant number of firms offering it exclusively.\nHaroun declined to discuss specific cost structures, but he said some clients were spending hundreds of millions of dollars on outside counsel, and that’s where Eudia steps in. He emphasized that litigation won’t change in terms of the human lawyers reviewing the documents, but contract-review types of the kind described by Smolik and Hood are ideal for AI augmentation. And, he said, AI legal services should be seen as a force for good.\nTransforming legal labor?\nEudia and Haroun used the summit to announce a major expansion of their AI for Good initiative, investing resources to remove systemic barriers and foster economic mobility and opportunity, especially for Arizona’s underserved communities. The company said Eudia Counsel will help more people resolve legal issues affordably while supporting small businesses and new entrepreneurs. Benefits include removing practical and financial barriers to legal services, enabling economic and social mobility through accessible legal support, and empowering small-business formation and entrepreneurship.\nEudia’s Series A funding round in February 2025 raised up to $105 million with backing led by General Catalyst and joined by Sierra Ventures, Floodgate, and others. The company hopes that its Arizona-led expansion—advised by former top corporate lawyers—signals the arrival of AI-native law firms and new paradigms for budget, execution, and justice in enterprise legal.\nOn the subject of whether AI will take away jobs, Haroun said that for his part, he’s learned that Eudia won’t be successful just selling AI tools. To that end, in July Eudia acquired Johnson Hana, a European legal services firm, adding over 300 lawyers to its offering. The press release announcing the deal called it a “new category of company that fuses humans and technology to fundamentally reinvent labor.” In conversation with Fortune, Haroun reiterated that he doesn’t see AI’s main value relating to software, but rather to labor.\nEudia cofounder Ashish Agrawal told Fortune that he’s worked in AI for 20 years at firms including IBM, Apple and Google, and he hasn’t been surprised to see AI take off the way it has since 2022. “It’s been a very organic process,” said Agrawal, the company CTO. Still, he said the human inputs are essential to AI working properly to get results for clients like DHL and Duracell, likening AI tools to a brand-new employee that every company has to be patient with and incorporate “organically.”\n“It’s a problem when [an AI platform] doesn’t have citations,” he said. “You don’t know where it’s drawing from.” In other words, the human element is essential.", "content_hash": "8e8d8ae99ffa843ad11c2d5bbad51a77", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

And while much of the activity on the Ethereum blockchain can be tracked (as its blockchain is open to everyone), it's also true that estimating future growth has proven to be very difficult, particularly as sentiment shifts within this sector.\nLooking at the closest publicly traded option for Ethereum, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust Mini ETF (ETH), there are some metrics we can look at to assess whether Ethereum may be overvalued or not.\nThe chart above shows the put/call ratio for Ethereum, which estimates changes in market sentiment based on changes in open interest and volume over time. We've seen both the green and red lines on the bottom of the chart increase in conjunction with some of the big moves higher, suggesting higher volume (and higher bullish call volume) appears to be driving a significant portion of Ethereum's recent move.\nUnfortunately, using traditional financial valuation metrics such as cash flow or earnings isn't possible when looking at assets like Ethereum.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 220 points, or 0.5%, after swinging between an early gain of nearly 150 points and a loss of 400. The Nasdaq composite edged down by less than 0.1%.\nThe action was more decisive in the bond market, where Treasury yields tumbled after a report from the Labor Department said U.S. employers hired fewer workers in August than economists expected. The government also said that earlier estimates for June and July overstated hiring by 21,000 jobs.\nThe disappointing numbers follow last month’s discouraging jobs update, along with other lackluster reports in intervening weeks, and traders are now betting on a 100% probability that the Fed will cut its main interest rate at its next meeting on Sept. 17, according to data from CME Group. Investors love such cuts because they can give a kickstart to the economy, but the Fed has held off on them because they can also give inflation more fuel.\nSo far this year, the Fed has been more worried about the potential of inflation worsening because of President Donald Trump’s tariffs than about the job market. But Friday’s job numbers could push the Fed to consider cutting rates in two weeks by a steeper amount than usual, said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.\n“This week has been a story of a slowing labor market, and today’s data was the exclamation point,” according to Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.\nStrong hiring for health care jobs had been helping to support the overall market, “but with it now showing some tangible signs of decline, the foundation underneath the labor market seems to be cracking,” said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock.\nWhile the data on the job market is disappointing, it’s still not so weak that it’s screaming a recession is here, and the U.S. economy is continuing to grow. A big question for investors is whether the job market can remain in a balance where it’s not so strong that it prevents cuts to interest rates but also not so weak that the economy falls off.\nUncertainty about that helped lead to Friday’s swings in the stock market. Wall Street needs things to go as hoped because it already sent stock prices to records amid expectations for a Goldilocks scenario where interest rates ease, and the economy keeps chugging along.\nOn Wall Street, Friday’s heaviest weight was Nvidia, the chip company that’s become the face of the artificial-intelligence boom. It’s been contending with criticism that its stock price charged too high, too fast and became too expensive following Wall Street’s rush into AI, and it fell 2.7%.\nLululemon dropped 18.6% after the yoga and athletic gear maker’s revenue for the latest quarter fell short of analysts’ expectations. CEO Calvin McDonald pointed to disappointing results from its U.S. operation, while Chief Financial Officer Meghan Frank said Lululemon is facing “industrywide challenges, including higher tariff rates.”\nStill, more stocks rose on Wall Street than fell. Leading the way was Broadcom, which climbed 9.4% after reporting better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Hock Tan said customers are continuing to invest strongly in AI chips.\nTesla rose 3.6% after proposing a payout package that could reach $1 trillion for its CEO, Elon Musk, if the electric vehicle company meets a series of extremely aggressive targets over the next 10 years.\nSmith & Wesson Brands jumped 6.5% after the gun maker delivered better results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Mark Smith said it saw good demand for new products in what’s traditionally a slow season for sales of firearms.\nAll told, the S&P 500 fell 20.58 points to 6,481.50. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 220.43 to 45,400.86, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 7.31 to 21,700.39..\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes in Europe lost early gains to turn lower with Wall Street. That followed strength across much of Asia.\nThe Nikkei 225 rallied 1% in Tokyo after data showed accelerating growth in earnings for Japanese workers. Chinese markets rebounded following three days of decline, with indexes rising more than 1% in both Hong Kong and Shanghai.\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped to 4.09% from 4.17% late Thursday and from 4.28% on Tuesday. That’s a notable move for the bond market and could mean lower interest rates are coming for mortgages and other loans.\n___\nAP Writers Matt Ott and Teresa Cerojano contributed.", "content_hash": "88559acd3816e4926624f4e2aa3eeddf", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Clearly stating that the company is facing no issues with supply, it addressed the rumors in a post on X (formerly Twitter):\n\"We've seen erroneous chatter in the media claiming that NVIDIA is supply constrained and 'sold out' of H100/H200. We have more than enough H100/H200 to satisfy every order without delay. The rumor that H20 reduced our supply of either H100/H200 or Blackwell is also categorically false—selling H20 has no impact on our ability to supply other NVIDIA products.\"\nNot that it would have put a dent in the wider growth story of the most valuable company in the world in terms of market cap, Nvidia's clarification leaves its stakeholders further assured that it remains well-positioned to continue to occupy the apex position in the AI megatrend. Further, notwithstanding the recent pullback in the stock due to some perceived issues in its latest earnings, it is still up 27.2% on a YTD basis, outperforming the S&P 500's ($SPX) rise of 9.1% in the same period.\nSo, with a market cap of $4.2 trillion, can Nvidia add more value to its market cap? I believe it can add much more value. Why? Let's take a closer look.\nSuffering From Success\nThe expectations around Nvidia have skyrocketed in recent years, and remarkably, the company has exceeded them with elan. Thus, any inkling of a dark cloud is leading market participants to hit the “Sell” button on the stock, resulting in ludicrous obituaries about the company's future growth story. But first, let's address what led to the recent correction.\nThe primary causes for the recent fall in the Nvidia share price were the data center revenue miss, zero chip sales to China during Q2 2025, and the lack of any update regarding sales to China in Q3. Well, let's start with data center revenues, which came in at $41.1 billion in Q2 2025. This was just slightly lower than analysts' expectations of $41.3 billion. Overall, it was still up 5% from the previous quarter and an impressive 56% from the previous year.\nComing to the sales issue concerning China, Nvidia is already in active negotiations to develop a new chip for the Asian powerhouse called B30A while continuing sales of its older-generation H20 chips.\nMeanwhile, amid all the brouhaha, Nvidia's overall revenue and earnings again surpassed Street expectations, a record that stretches back several quarters. Revenues of $46.7 billion marked a yearly growth of 56%, while earnings of $1.05 per share denoted a growth of 54% from the previous year, exceeding the estimates of $1.01 per share.\nAlthough operating margins witnessed a slight decline from the previous year's 66.4%, they remained at a healthy 64.5%. However, net cash flow from operating activities continued to rise, coming in at $15.4 billion, up from $14.5 billion in the previous year. And with no short-term debt on its books, Nvidia ended the quarter with a cash balance of $56.8 billion, reflecting a solid liquidity position.\nNotably, Nvidia has guided for revenues to be in the range of $52.92 billion and $55.08 billion, the midpoint of which would denote a yearly growth of 53.8%. Analysts are expecting a revenue of $53.14 billion.\nThus, Nvidia continues to boast of fundamentals that are the envy of many, with no signs of slowing down. Minor skirmishes aside, Nvidia is expected to further improve its financials in the coming times.\nNvidia Is The Best AI Play (And Not Just That)\nSince my last analysis of Nvidia, the stock has remained an attractive investment proposition, with a focus not just on AI but also on frontier technologies such as robotics, which has been described as “Physical AI” by CEO Jensen Huang. In fact, the correction of about 5% has made the stock even more attractive for investors who were awaiting a pullback to get the stock at a lower price.\nMeanwhile, beyond the substantial capital investments in artificial intelligence by hyperscale data center operators and Nvidia’s entrenched dominance in the GPU arena, an additional driver of future growth is emerging in the form of the Rubin GPU and the Vera CPU. During the recent earnings call, the company’s chief financial officer confirmed that both products have completed the tape-out stage and are advancing toward mass production, a milestone expected to position them for commercial release in 2026. This development has the potential to create a fresh and significant revenue channel in the coming years.\nFurther, momentum is also building within Nvidia’s Gaming and AI PC operations. Revenue for this segment rose 49% year-over-year (YoY) to reach $4.3 billion, a surge largely attributed to the rapid uptake of the new GeForce RTX 5060, which has become one of the fastest-growing x60 series GPUs in the company’s history. Smaller divisions also recorded strong performances. Professional Visualization posted a 32% rise in sales, climbing to $601 million, while Automotive and Robotics revenue advanced 69% to $586 million.\nFinally, the company is additionally working to expand its footprint in the enterprise sector through developments in agentic AI and robotics. The progression of agentic AI is opening new commercial opportunities, with RTX PRO servers poised to become a multibillion-dollar business line. These servers are already being deployed by corporations such as Hitachi (HTHIY) and Disney (DIS) for applications including simulations and digital twin technologies. In robotics, the Jetson Thor platform is positioned to deliver dramatic improvements in AI processing at the edge, supported by a developer base exceeding two million and strategic relationships with partners such as Amazon (AMZN) Robotics.\nAnalyst Opinions on NVDA Stock\nThus, analysts remain bullish about the NVDA stock, assigning it a rating of “Strong Buy” with a mean target price of $210.49. This indicates upside potential of about 23.3% from current levels. Out of 46 analysts covering the stock, 38 have a “Strong Buy” rating, two have a “Moderate Buy” rating, five have a “Hold” rating, and one has a “Strong Sell” rating.\nOn the date of publication, Pathikrit Bose did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The home electronics and computer parts e-tailer has behaved like a meme stock in 2025. August was probably just the start of a correction of Newegg's inflated stock price. I say this as a longtime Newegg shareholder, by the way -- the stock was rising too high, too fast, and for all the wrong reasons.\nThe meme stock surge was too good to be true\nIf you bought Newegg shares on the last trading day of May and sold them at the end of July, you saw a 1,220% return on your investment. A $1,000 Newegg bet was worth $12,200 at the end of that period. Even now, after August's steep price drop and a continued downtrend in early September, Newegg's shares are up more than 500% in three months.\nThe company did have some news to share last month. Newegg reported first-half results on August 21, showing 12.6% year-over-year revenue growth and a stabilizing bottom line. Net losses decreased from $25.0 to $4.2 million. Newegg reported more repeat customers and higher average order values. New gamer-friendly products from Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia helped Newegg achieve these robust results.\nThe financial picture is clearing up after a couple of difficult years. But the half-year report didn't boost the stock at all. Newegg's stock fell 13% the next day. Generally speaking, the drawdown from earlier peaks simply continued as before.\nThe short squeeze behind Newegg's drama\nNewegg's stock has all the trappings of a classic meme stock this summer. Short-seller interest soared to 331% of the market float in early July, which is only possible with naked short-selling. Newegg traders enjoyed a strong short-squeeze effect, followed by a natural drop when the artificial price manipulation faded out. These sudden price bursts never last forever.\nThe aftermath of such extreme short squeezes typically follows a predictable pattern. Once the buying frenzy subsides and short sellers have either covered their positions or new shorts have entered at higher prices, the stock tends to find a new equilibrium -- usually far below the squeeze peak but often above the pre-squeeze levels.", "content_hash": "c7626e359e268eef5e1632d929a946fc", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Nio's recent second-quarter earnings reflected strong delivery growth, improved financial performance, and significant advances in its multi-brand and technology strategies. This robust recovery has sent its stock up 42.3% year-to-date (YTD), outpacing the overall market gain. Let’s see if NIO stock is a buy, hold, or sell now.\nAbout Nio\nNio is a Chinese EV company that creates, manufactures, and sells smart, premium EVs like SUVs and sedans. It is often referred to as the \"Tesla of China\" because it caters to the upper end of the market, emphasizing luxury design, technology, and performance. Some of Nio's most well-known EV models include the ES8, ES6, and EC6 (electric SUVs) and the ET7 and ET5 (premium electric sedans). The company has also launched the Envoy brand, which is a more affordable mainstream sub-brand.\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nSupermicro Stock Drops 29% in a Month: Is SMCI a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n-\nTesla Now Has an India Problem. What Does That Mean for Hard-Hit TSLA Stock?\nWhat distinguishes Nio is its battery-swapping technology, which allows drivers to replace a depleted battery with a fully charged one in minutes rather than having to recharge.\nDeliveries Surge as Multi-Brand Portfolio Gains Traction\nDuring the first quarter, CEO William Li had stated that 2025 would be Nio's \"hardest year for products,\" with the primary focus on achieving profitability through efficiency and scale. And this is what the second quarter revealed. In the second quarter, Nio delivered 72,056 smart EVs, up 25.6% year-on-year (YoY). The Envoy brand has continued to gain traction in the mainstream family market, while the Firefly brand is rapidly gaining share in the high-end small car segment. Firefly has sold over 10,000 units in just three months, making it the best-selling model in its category.\nTotal revenue increased 9% YoY and 57.9% sequentially to $2.6 billion, boosted by a 2.6% increase in vehicle sales. While the company remains unprofitable, the net loss decreased 1% YoY to $697.2 million.\nMulti-Brand Strategy Is Accelerating Growth\nManagement emphasized that Nio's three-brand strategy, Nio, Envoy, and Firefly, is opening up new user segments, ranging from premium executive sedans to family SUVs and small urban EVs. The launch of the Envoy L90 in late July was a resounding success, with 10,575 units sold in its first full month.

It’s been a swift reversal for what had been a bright light in the market, soaring over 150% in 2023 and 2024 combined. The plunge has been particularly dramatic in light of the strong showings by software giants like Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp., and Palantir Technologies Inc., all of whom are considered to be stronger in AI.\nWhile Salesforce, which makes customer relationship management software, has its own AI products, concerns about its long-term trajectory mean the shares may languish even if the company posts strong earnings when it reports after the bell on Wednesday. The stock rose 0.7% on Wednesday.\n“I’m not expecting a major AI contribution to Salesforce over the next several quarters, and in the meantime there are a lot of concerns that AI can disrupt and replace the legacy software names,” said Jake Seltz, who manages the Allspring LT Large Growth ETF, which owns Salesforce shares. “I’m optimistic it will eventually be a winner, but it may take a couple years, and right now there’s more interest in the companies that are already benefiting.”\nSalesforce is expected to post revenue growth of nearly 9% from a year ago in its fiscal second quarter, with a 23% increase in net earnings. While that would represent its fastest sales expansion in more than a year, it would still be the fifth straight quarter below 10%, something that hadn’t happened for almost two decades. The company’s annual revenue isn’t expected to grow at a double-digit pace until fiscal 2029.\nSalesforce’s previous earnings report showed its Agentforce AI platform gaining traction. Similarly, the company considers its $8 billion acquisition of data-management software company Informatica Inc. a key piece of its AI strategy. However, investors remain unsure whether AI will be a tailwind or a headwind for the stock.\nThe company isn’t alone in its struggles. Other long-time software leaders like Adobe Inc. have also been hobbled this year by fears that their growth could be usurped by AI-native competitors.\nThe software industry faces three threats from AI, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets, and Salesforce is exposed to two of them: AI-written coding that can generate features and applications, and AI shrinking workforces and thereby reducing demand for seat-based business models like Salesforce’s.\n“There was a lot of fanfare about Agentforce, but the revenue numbers haven’t been amazing, especially relative to a company of this size, and that’s been disappointing,” said Rishi Jaluria, managing director of software equity research at RBC Capital Markets, who downgraded the shares earlier this year after being a long-time Salesforce bull.\n“There are real questions about how mature the tech is and whether it can deliver on the promise, especially since we will only see more AI competitors going forward,” Jaluria added. “Unless Agentforce becomes a must-have, I worry growth will continue to slow.”\nPotential Bargain\nOf course, given the plunge in Salesforce’s stock price this year, low expectations heading into this earnings report make it easier for the company to surprise to the upside. The analysts covering the shares have an average price target of about $336 over the next 12 months, indicating upside of more than 30%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe company’s stock market valuation also suggests room to run. Salesforce shares trade at just 21 times blended forward earnings, not far from an all-time low and a fraction of their long-term average.\nIn a measure of confidence, the hedge fund Starboard Value raised its stake in Salesforce by more than 400,000 shares as of June 30, according to Bloomberg’s analysis of Starboard’s 13F filing.\nStill, the company’s prospects likely come down to AI, making a cheap valuation beside the point in many ways. For example, investors have largely looked past Palantir’s chart-topping valuation because of its strong position in AI. What is Salesforce worth if it isn’t a major player in this boom?\n“So long as we have limited visibility on AI growth, the multiple will continue to come down,” said RBC’s Jaluria. “Even though it isn’t expensive, if growth continues to slow, its hard to stick my neck out and say buy now.”\nTech Chart of the Day\nNvidia Corp. closed below a key technical level for the first time since May as investors continue to rotate out of the leading maker of artificial intelligence chips. The stock fell 2% to $170.74 on Tuesday, a fourth straight negative session that took it below its 50-day moving average of $171.06. Breaking under this closely watched level is seen as a negative sign of near-term momentum trends.\nTop Tech Stories\nAlphabet Inc.’s Google will be required to share online search data with rivals while avoiding harsher penalties, including the forced sale of its Chrome business, a judge ruled in the biggest US antitrust case in almost three decades.\nApple Inc. shares gained after a US judge stopped short of barring its lucrative search arrangement with Google, a deal that has generated roughly $20 billion in revenue a year for the iPhone maker.\nApple’s lead artificial intelligence researcher for robotics has departed the company to join Meta Platforms Inc.’s competing effort, part of an exodus of AI talent from the iPhone maker.\nThe US has revoked Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s authorization to freely ship essential gear to its main Chinese chipmaking base, potentially curtailing its production capabilities at that older-generation facility.\nAnthropic has closed a deal to raise $13 billion from investors in a new funding round that nearly triples its valuation to $183 billion, including dollars raised — a larger-than-expected haul that makes the artificial intelligence company one of the most valuable startups in the world.\nEarnings Due Wednesday\nEarnings Postmarket:\nHewlett Packard Enterprise Co.

Wednesday's weakness in US economic news also weighed on energy demand prospects and crude prices. Losses in crude were limited due to a weaker dollar.\nMore News from Barchart\nWednesday's US economic news was weaker-than-expected, a negative factor for energy demand and crude prices. The Jul JOLTS job openings fell -176,000 to a 10-month low of 7.181 million, showing a weaker labor market than expectations of 7.380 million. Also, Jul factory orders fell -1.3% m/m, the second straight month orders have declined.\nReduced Russian crude output is tightening global oil supplies and is supportive of prices. Ukrainian drone and missile attacks on Russian refineries have curbed Russia's crude-processing runs to 5.09 million bpd in the first 27 days of August, the lowest monthly average in over 3.25 years.\nCrude prices have support on concerns that the ongoing war in Ukraine could lead to additional sanctions on Russian energy exports, reducing global oil supplies. US Treasury Secretary Bessent said Tuesday that the US \"will be examining sanctions on Russia very closely this week\" due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. President Trump has threatened \"very big consequences\" if Russia doesn't come to the negotiating table. Last Friday, German Chancellor Merz and French President Macron called for secondary sanctions on Russia for its war in Ukraine. They said they will push for measures targeting \"companies from third countries that support Russia's war.\"\nA decrease in crude oil held worldwide on tankers is bullish for oil prices. Vortexa reported Monday that crude oil stored on tankers that have been stationary for at least seven days fell by -18% w/w to 72.67 million bbl in the week ended August 29.\nConcerns about higher OPEC production are negative for crude prices after OPEC+ on August 2 endorsed an additional 547,000 bpd increase in its crude production for September 1. OPEC+ is boosting output to reverse the 2-year-long production cut, gradually restoring a total of 2.2 million bpd of production by September 2026. OPEC+ has 1.66 million bpd of supplies that are currently due to remain offline until late 2026. OPEC+ will meet again on September 7 to discuss crude production levels.

If that's true, it may mean that the stock market reacts positively to a Fed rate cut in September, particularly if Powell signals it's not a one-and-done reduction.\nAccording to Morgan Stanley's data crunching, stock market returns are much better during rate-cutting regimes than when the Fed is neutral or increasing rates.\nHistorically, the S&P 500 has returned an average of 1.7% per month during Fed interest-rate-cutting periods, substantially better than the negative 0.5% monthly loss when rates rise.\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, when the Fed is stuck in neutral, as it is now, the S&P 500 returns 1.3% on average per month:\n\"The S&P 500 typically delivers strong performance during Fed cutting regimes. ... The index’s valuation tends to remain supported when the policy rate is being reduced and earnings growth is above the long-term median — which is what they expect to sustain over the next 12 months.\"\nWhy rate cuts support stock prices\nFed interest rate cuts don't directly control the lending rates banks set, but they do indirectly affect them.\nThe Fed sets rate policy by adjusting the Federal Funds Rate, which is the rate banks charge each other on overnight loans of bank reserves. When the Fed makes borrowing more expensive overnight, banks raise rates to maintain their net interest margins (the difference between what they earn on loans and pay out on deposits). The opposite is true when it cuts rates.\nAs a result, lower rates tend to mean lower borrowing costs. And that's good news for corporate and household spending and bullish for corporate revenue and profit growth, the lifeblood of stock market returns.\nStock market valuation is high, but earnings growth is, too\nGiven the stock market's current backdrop, the potential for lower rates to support valuations when earnings are growing faster than usual is particularly interesting.\nThe S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings multiple is higher than usual, following the benchmark index's 30% rally from its low in early April.\nAccording to FactSet, the forward one-year p/e, which is based on consensus earnings estimates, is 22.4 — above the 19.9 and 18.5 averages for five and 10 years respectively.\nIn the past p/e multiples this high haven't been a great sign for returns one year later. However, Morgan Stanley's research suggests that stocks can continue to boast high valuations during rate-cutting periods as long as their earnings grow faster than normal.\nAccording to FactSet, that appears to be the case this year.\nIn the second quarter, the S&P 500 delivered earnings growth of 11.9%. In Q3, Wall Street expects momentum to slow, but it will still clock in up 7.5% from one year ago.\nSince June 30 Wall Street's estimates for S&P 500 companies' aggregate 2025 earnings have increased by 1.6% to $268.48, with communication services, financials, and consumer discretionary sectors all seeing increases above 3%.\nOverall, S&P 500 earnings are expected to rise 10.6% and 13.4% in 2025 and 2026.\nOver the past 10 years, S&P 500 earnings growth has averaged 9.2%, and since 1990, average annual earnings growth has been 10.32%, according to Multpl based on S&P Global data.\nWhat President Trump called Liberation Day, his April 2 tariff reveal, \"marked the trough of the rolling recession,\" concludes Morgan Stanley.\nKey takeaways:\nStocks gain an average of 1.7% per month when rates are falling.\nThey lose 0.5% per month when rates rise.\nRate cuts can support stock valuations during periods of above-average earnings growth.\nS&P 500 earnings are expected to climb 10.6% in 2025, above the 10.32% average.", "content_hash": "259117f63ed37d665c9b64fb72aeb34f", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

In its latest reported quarter, the tech behemoth saw its revenue come in up 14% on a year-on-year basis.\nStill, GOOGL stock is currently going for a forward price-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 21x only, representing a significant discount to both the broader tech sector as well as its mega-cap peers.\nThis valuation discrepancy suggests potential for multiple expansion as markets reprice Alphabet in light of the improved regulatory clarity.\nGOOGL Shares Could Soon Reclaim Their Historical Premium\nBank of America analyst Justin Post reiterated his “Buy” rating on GOOGL shares following the federal court ruling on Wednesday.\nIn his research note, Post cited “evidence of Gemini progress and search usage growth” as potential catalysts for multiple expansion toward historical premiums.\nThe BofA analyst raised his price target as well to $252, indicating potential upside of another 10% in Google stock from current levels.\nAlphabet currently pays a dividend yield of 0.37% and has a rather lucrative $70 billion stock buyback program in place, which makes GOOGL stock even more exciting to own for the longer term.\nGoogle Remains a ‘Buy’-Rated Stock Among Wall Street Analysts\nGoogle’s strong positioning across search, YouTube, and cloud computing, combined with its fast emerging AI capabilities, is keeping other Wall Street analysts bullish on its stock as well.\nAccording to Barchart, the consensus rating on GOOGL stock currently sits at “Strong Buy.”", "content_hash": "e0adfc9d0f9fa3c8dbdf1cc9aec7a62d", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

With today's gains, shares of the nuclear energy company are already up 23% this month as of this writing.\nNuScale Power, which is building small modular reactors (SMRs) but has yet to commercialize its products, just signed a landmark deal that marks the largest SMR deployment ever in U.S. history.\nNuScale Power's key partner charges up\nOn Sept. 2, ENTRA1 Energy announced an agreement to deploy six plants to supply the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) with up to 6 gigawatts (GW) of new nuclear power capacity across seven states. TVA is the nation's largest public power supplier, and that 6 GW of capacity is enough to power nearly 4.5 million homes or 60 data centers and highlights the potential of public-private partnerships in the buildout of nuclear energy technologies in the U.S.\nSo what does that have to do with NuScale Power? Everything.\nYou see, ENTRA1 Energy is also NuScale Power's exclusive global commercialization partner. In other words, ENTRA1 Energy holds the exclusive rights to develop, commercialize, and sell NuScale Power's modules and SMR technology through its own energy plants, and that will include the six it will build for TVA.\nThis is a landmark moment for NuScale Power given the magnitude of the deal, and it comes as no surprise that analysts and investors alike gave the stock much love today.\nIs NuScale Power headed another 50% higher from here?\nAt least two analysts raised their price targets on NuScale Power stock after the announcement. Analysts at Canaccord Genuity, in particular, see huge potential following the TVA-ENTRA1 Energy deal and raised the nuclear energy stock's price target by $16 to $60 per share. Even after today's big move, that price objective would mean another 50% upside in NuScale Power stock.\nNuScale Power's SMR design is the only one certified by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In May, it won the nuclear regulator's approval for its second design. That, coupled with the TVA deal, should power up ENTRA1 Energy's operations and push NuScale Power closer to generating its first revenue. As NuScale Power continues to strengthen its partnership with ENTRA1 Energy and given President Donald Trump's pro-nuclear energy stand, I wouldn't be surprised to see the stock inch higher and higher.", "content_hash": "b3ee1ce536cf08e44ad115c5b0e4c959", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Safe-haven demand and an extra-nervous market is driving the precious metals higher.\nWhat’s Driving the Bull Run in Precious Metals?\nLower U.S. interest rates, likely starting with a cut at the September meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), support both metals here. A half-point rate cut in the Fed funds rate is widely expected by the marketplace. Another rate cut is also likely from the Fed before the end of this year, barring any economic surprises such as much stronger U.S. economic growth or problematic price inflation.\nMore News from Barchart\nAnother bullish fundamental for the safe-haven metals is a very jittery bond market. Global bond yields are on the rise (lower prices) mostly due to worries about inflation, government debt sales, and fiscal discipline. U.S. Treasury yields have advanced, with the 30-year bond now approaching the 5% level, while yields on U.K., Australian, and Japanese bonds are also increasing. The selloff in prices reflects traders’ concerns around too much government spending and the potential inflationary impacts. A Bloomberg gauge of global bond returns fell 0.4% on Tuesday.\nUncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve’s independence is only adding to the bond market pressures and general trader and investor anxiety. President Donald Trump has brow-beat Fed Chair Jerome Powell since he took office in January. Also, Trump’s move to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook has rattled many traders and investors. A non-independent Federal Reserve could have the negative consequences of major foreign buyers, including sovereign nations, pulling away from U.S. Treasuries due to the politicizing of the U.S. central bank. That would mean higher borrowing costs for the U.S. government, as well as likely for U.S. citizens.\nVeteran market watchers know that history shows the months of September and October can be rough for the stock, financial, and currency sectors. The U.S. stock market’s worst performing month historically is September. That’s creating a jittery equities environment and that’s positive for the safe-haven metals, from a competing asset class perspective.", "content_hash": "055e193457eeb76fa5c129fcdd625426", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

But economists see signs that market conditions are improving for house hunters.\nFor instance, pending home sales, a forward-looking metric of signed contracts, edged up by 0.7% on an annual basis in July according to the National Association of Realtors. Month-to-month pending home sales did tick 0.4% lower, NAR said, but there are other positive indicators.\nA similar report from real estate data firm Redfin showed that the number of pending home sales climbed 1.6% year-over-year in August.\n“Buyers are circling,” said Ali Mafi, a Redfin Premier agent in San Francisco. “House hunters are feeling more confident about buying a home now that mortgage rates have started to decline.”\nMortgage rates remain stubbornly high at 6.56%, but they are at their lowest levels since October 2024, according to Freddie Mac.Additionally, the growth rate of home prices is slowing after years of shooting higher, and the number of listings on the market has increased. That gives buyers a larger inventory to choose from, and could pressure sellers to price their homes more competitively.\nRecent data on mortgage applications also shows that more serious buyers are coming back onto the market. Purchase application volumes were up 2% over last week and 25% over last year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.\nAll of this may help move some potential buyers off the sidelines.\n“Prospective buyers appear to be less sensitive to rates at these levels and are more active, bolstered by more inventory and cooling home-price growth in many parts of the country,” said Joel Kan, MBA’s Vice President and Deputy Chief Economist.\nStill, real estate agents remain cautious. NAR’s confidence index survey found that only 16% of members expect buyer traffic to improve over the next three months, while 21% expect an increase in seller traffic.\n\"Even with modest improvements in mortgage rates, housing affordability, and inventory, buyers still remain hesitant,\" said National Association of Realtors chief economist Lawrence Yun. “People are taking their time to ensure the timing and home are right for them.\"\nRead the original article on Investopedia", "content_hash": "7c0aa9a0b1a71bf1abf0a32214c34874", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Wednesday's rebound in equity markets has curbed liquidity demand for the dollar. Losses in the dollar accelerated on Wednesday as the chances for a Fed rate cut later this month increased after the Jul JOLTS job openings fell more than expected to a 10-month low.\nUS Jul JOLTS job openings fell -176,000 to a 10-month low of 7.181 million, showing a weaker labor market than expectations of 7.380 million.\nUS Jul factory orders fell -1.3% m/m, right on expectations, and the second straight month orders have declined.\nThe Fed Beige Book hinted at signs of stagflation and was bearish for the dollar as it stated that \"most of the twelve Federal Reserve districts reported little or no change in economic activity since the prior Beige Book period. Also, across districts, contacts reported flat to declining consumer spending because, for many households, wages were failing to keep up with rising prices. In addition, nearly all districts noted tariff-related price increases, with contacts from many districts reporting that tariffs were especially impactful on the prices of inputs.\"\nFed Governor Christopher Waller said the fed funds rate is currently above the neutral rate, meaning monetary policy is restricting the economy, and that inflation is likely to move \"much closer\" to the Fed's goal in six or seven months. He added that the Fed should aim to get ahead of a sharp slowdown in the job market and \"we need to start cutting interest rates at the next meeting\" and make multiple cuts in the coming months.\nSt. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said, \"The current modestly restrictive setting of the policy rate is consistent with today's full employment labor market and core inflation nearly one percentage point above the Fed's 2% target,\" and it's important to take a \"balanced approach\" to policy right now and not weight too much to support the labor market or to fight inflation.\nAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic reiterated that he sees one interest rate cut this year, as price stability remains his primary concern, and it's not unambiguously clear that the labor market is weakening materially.\nConcerns over the Fed's independence and fears about capital flight are negative for the dollar, particularly following President Trump's move to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook. If Mr. Trump succeeds in firing Fed Governor Cook, foreign investors may lose faith in the Fed and the dollar and swap their dollar assets into non-dollar investments.\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 95% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and at 56% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.\nEUR/USD (^EURUSD) on Wednesday rose by +0.15%. Dollar weakness on Wednesday supported gains in the euro. The euro also garnered some support from Wednesday's stronger-than-expected Eurozone July PPI report, a hawkish factor for ECB policy. Gains in the euro were limited after the Eurozone Aug S&P composite PMI was revised lower.\nEurozone July PPI eased +0.2% y/y from +0.6% y/y in June, slightly stronger than expectations of +0.1% y/y.\nThe Eurozone Aug S&P composite PMI was revised downward by -0.1 to 51.0 from the previously reported 51.1.\nOn the geopolitical front, diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine remain elusive, which is bearish for the euro. Last Friday, German Chancellor Merz and French President Macron called for secondary sanctions on Russia for its war in Ukraine and said they will push for measures targeting \"companies from third countries that support Russia's war.\" Last Thursday, German Chancellor Merz stated that a meeting between Russian President Putin and Ukrainian President Zelensky is unlikely to take place. The outcome of the Russian-Ukrainian war could have macroeconomic implications regarding tariffs and oil prices, and could, of course, have significant consequences for European security.\nSwaps are pricing in a 1% chance of a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\nUSD/JPY (^USDJPY) on Wednesday fell by -0.19%. The yen recovered from a 1-month low against the dollar on Wednesday and moved higher after the weaker-than-expected US Jul JOLTS job openings report knocked the dollar and T-note yields lower. The yen also garnered some support after Japan's Aug S&P services PMI was revised upward.\nThe yen initially moved lower on Wednesday on negative carryover from Tuesday's news that the Secretary General of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party, Hiroshi Moriyama, a key ally of Prime Minister Ishiba and a proponent of fiscal discipline, is stepping down, which is seen as paving the way toward a more expansionary fiscal policy.\nThe Japan Aug S&P services PMI was revised upward by +0.4 to 53.1 from the previously reported 52.7.\nDecember gold (GCZ25) on Wednesday closed up +43.30 (+1.21%), and December silver (SIZ25) closed up +0.468 (+1.13%). Precious metal prices on Wednesday added to Tuesday's sharp rally, with Dec gold posting a new contract high and nearest-futures (U25) posting a record high of $3,593.70 an ounce. Also, Dec silver posted a contract high, and nearest-futures (U25) posted a 14-year high\nWednesday's weaker dollar was supportive for metals prices. Gains in precious metals accelerated on Wednesday as T-note yields dropped on the weaker-than-expected US Jul JOLTS job openings report, which boosted the odds of a Fed rate cut at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting. Demand for gold as a store of value is also boosting prices due to threats of spiraling budget deficits and sticky inflation. In addition, President Trump's move to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook has sparked concerns about the Fed's independence and increased demand for safe-haven assets, including precious metals. Finally, political uncertainty in France is driving demand for gold as a safe-haven, following French Prime Minister Bayrou's call for a confidence vote that could bring down his government as soon as next week.\nGold has continued safe-haven support related to US tariffs and geopolitical risks, including the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. The fund buying of precious metals continues to support prices, following the rise in gold holdings in ETFs to a 2-year high on Tuesday and the rise in silver holdings in ETFs to a 3-year high last Friday.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The European Union (EU), for instance, enacted the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation on Dec. 30, 2024, which unifies crypto guidelines amid all member states of the EU. The goal of MiCA is to protect crypto investors, create crypto guidelines and maintain the strength of the EU’s markets.\nFurther, according to Chatham House, MiCA “comprehensively sets rules for digital asset issuers and service providers in a way that should facilitate innovation without threatening financial stability.” And it could be a catalyst for other crypto innovations, per EY.\nOne of those is a central bank digital currency (CBDC) via an official “digital euro.” CBDCs are official digital legal tender. On the other hand, many stablecoins are privately issued and thus often have inconsistent levels of regulation and oversight by comparison.\nWhile the GENIUS Act aims to provide a regulatory framework for stablecoins, some have concerns. For example, Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, expressed worries regarding the GENIUS Act. According to the World Economic Forum, she noted that stablecoins that are backed by the U.S. dollar pose a threat to monetary policy and European autonomy. She has pushed for developing a digital euro, and in a recent speech, she explained that it is a “strategy priority” that could safeguard the monetary system in Europe.\nCheck Out: I Asked ChatGPT How To Get Rich Off of Bitcoin — Here’s What It Said\nPost-GENIUS Stablecoin Strategy for America\nMeanwhile, American crypto legislation has yet to be nearly as comprehensive as the EU’s, and America may be on a markedly different path overall by placing a premium upon the privately backed stablecoin.\nCurrently, per McKinsey & Company, stablecoin circulation accounts for less than 1% of all global money transactions (approximately $30 billion). While growing exponentially in popularity, they are still a small part of the overall crypto market. For Americans who utilize stablecoins domestically, the GENIUS Act offers far more oversight in the U.S. marketplace, with fewer possibilities for scams and a system of consumer protections now in place to guardrail your digital wallet.", "content_hash": "8eb1cc5f050567638999254479672990", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Boosting usage to “historic capacity factors” could lead to more than 250 million tons of additional annual demand in the coming years, it said.\nStill, analysts see this forecast as a mathematical maximum that’s unlikely to be achieved in the real world.\nUS coal usage has been steadily declining as utilities shift away from the dirtiest fossil fuel. But President Donald Trump’s pro-coal and anti-renewable approach has included blocking plans to shut down this from a Michigan power plant that burns fuel from Peabody. Total consumption is expected to be 439 million tons this year, according to the US Energy Information Administration. That’s up 6.7% from last year, but well down from its 2007 peak of 1.13 billion tons.\n“Peabody sees great untapped potential for existing US coal plants,” Mark Spurbeck, chief financial officer for the St. Louis-based company, said by email.\nElectricity demand in the US is set to climb 25% through 2030, driven by factories, increasingly electrified homes and especially from the booming buildout of data centers used for artificial intelligence. At the same time, supply-chain constraints have hindered utilities’ efforts to add more natural gas plants.\nThat’s spurring increased reliance on underused coal plants, which have significant potential to deliver more power.\nThe US fleet was operating at just 42% last year, according to Peabody, compared to 72% in 2008.\nStill, anticipating demand to climb by 250 million tons assumes that coal plants are all ramped up close to the historic levels that preceded the global financial crisis of 2008, which is unlikely, said Andy Blumenfeld, director of data analytics at McCloskey by Opis.\n“That’s a really big number,” he said. “It’s a theoretical maximum, if everything works perfectly.

Processing existing queues will likely take around 14 days, as no more than 1,800 validators can exit daily and only 900 can enter, Illia Otychenko, lead analyst at CEX.IO, told Decrypt.\nEverstake called the results “pretty striking,” as it hasn't seen queues of this size since September 2023 after the Shanghai upgrade earlier that year enabled ETH stakers to withdraw their capital for the first time.\nThe wait for users who want to become validators, which enables them to stake their tokens and gain rewards, has lengthened because of the network’s control mechanism after depositing ETH. Ethereum ETFs have generated more than $13 billion in inflows with most of those investments coming in the last six weeks.\nMeanwhile, treasuries have mushroomed with BitMine Immersion, which pivoted its focus from Bitcoin mining earlier this year, growing its ETH holdings to $8.1 billion.

After last week's signaling from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at Jackson Hole, that we'll likely be looking at at least one rate cut this year. It's fair to ask, what the real impact may be? We'll touch on bond proxy stocks and financials, but to start, real estate. Now, Dave, you've talked a lot in the past about how homebuilder sentiment has reached new lows, but mortgage rates are directly tied to federal reserve policies, and many argue that all it would take is a few basis points and lower rates to really quickly ignite that real estate demand. Do you think that actually will come to fruition especially given the other environmental impacts that we're seeing today?\nDavid Meier: I think it'll take more than a few basis points, but directionally I think this is correct. Lower interest rates help homebuilders in so many different ways. First, the lower rates make it easier for potential buyers, and that defects demand. With lower rates you could see demand rise. Plus the other thing is right now, homebuilders are giving lots of incentives away in order to get people to make a purchase within a higher interest rate environment. Lower rates could actually mean less builder incentives and potentially more profitability for the builder on a per build basis. Clearly buying and building houses are big decisions and they take time. But I think lower rates being a catalyst for additional building can help other macrovariables over time as well.\nJason Hall: One thing about homebuilders, this is important too is they're also big consumers of debt and usually for long periods of time because they buy land that they hold for multiple years and they finance that land because they just don't have a bunch of cash laying around. It helps them on both ends of their balance sheet and operating state.\nEmily Flippen: That a good point, Jason. But I'll play devil's advocate here too, which is to say, we still see affordability at all time lows, and I don't know if there's necessarily going to be. We presume that there's a bunch of people sitting on the sidelines waiting for interest rates to come down or homebuilders sitting on the sideline waiting for interest rates to come down to build. That prices will actually move further down, even if interest rates come down. It's possible that we still have people even with lower interest rates that are priced out of the home market entirely.\nDavid Meier: That's exactly right. I will say this as a person who has bought two new homes. Builders are always reluctant to give on price, so price is not something they typically uses in the negotiating table.\nEmily Flippen: I can understand why. Jason, you've analyzed economic measures as part of your research process for years. Housing accounts for nearly a third of all the goods and services that are part of our consumer price index, and nearly 20% of total GDP all comes down to housing. Needless to say, it's pretty important. But not all that impact is home building. Actually, a majority of it is things like housing services, which is just a fancy way to say, rent. In my opinion and I think in my experience is arguably less impacted by interest rates. How should one think about that segment of the housing market within the context of rate changes?\nJason Hall: We think about CPI and a lot of times when it comes to something like rent, we don't think about the rents that people already have a contract for. That's priced in. You're still rolling in that existing lease agreement. But we think about the people that are out looking for a new place and it's like, wow, this cost a lot more than it did a couple of years ago when I was looking for an apartment. But I think what we forget too is that interest rates actually do affect rents in a bigger way than we realize because the vast majority of commercial real estate is financed. These rates are there. Walker & Dunlop, which is a major player in multifamily residential real estate finance put some really good information in their presentations. Their Q2 earnings presentation, one of the things that they showed was that back in 2021, there was more than $250 billion in capital raised for private real estate investments. Last year, 125 billion, so we're talking half as much. What changed? Interest rates. Real estate uses a lot of debt to fund those deals. As an investor one of the trends worth following is the amount of cash sitting on the sidelines for real estate. Walker & Dunlop estimates there's about 400 billion in dry powder, so to speak, that's nearing the end of its investment period in real estate funds. It's a lot of money that could be deployed into more supply in the years ahead, that could accelerate. I think that could be good on the supply side. Maybe not bring prices down, but as people's incomes go up, maybe people's incomes go up faster than the prices will go up and that could help some with the affordability.\nDavid Meier: Fair point but I have to ask, how does this all accrue to value for investors? Are there certain stocks or industries, homebuilders, REITs? There's so many different ways to play these trends.\nI'll start. I have to wonder if Rocket Companies , ticker RKT wouldn't be a big beneficiary of lower rates. It has a mortgage origination business, and that would actually stand to benefit both on the home building side but on the resale transaction side. Speaking of transactions, it just acquired Redfin, the home selling platform. Unfortunately, the Rocket's stock price is up pretty sharply off the April lows and perhaps some of that is in anticipation of rates falling. That's been talked about for quite a while. But that's where I'd be looking for sure for opportunities.\nJason Hall: David, another part of Rocket that's set to benefit is not just the writing of the mortgages, but their servicing business, which is set to get a lot bigger with another acquisition that's in the pipe there too. I think that's an interesting one. I'll make the case for homebuilders. If you're targeted, looking at the ones that are really good originators, in other words, they're good about buying land in areas that it makes sense and they get a good price and they're really good at building and pricing their products. Green Brick Homes, I think is a good example. Ticker GRBK. They could benefit a lot. I don't think second half of this year, I think this is a multiple year trend because lower rates should prove to be a boost. I think there is pin up demand. Despite the lack of affordability for a lot of people, there's still plenty of people that make plenty of money that in the right geographies where there's economic opportunity are interested in Green Brick could benefit. I think REITs like Realty Income, ticker O, already has really good access to lower cost capital. It's an advantage against a lot of its competitors is set to get a boost in a way we don't necessarily think about as an investor. Have a lot of debt already and they're going to have to refinance that debt as it matures. Lower rates means that they're going to be able to refinance at a little more appealing rate than they would have gotten a year ago. That means less money having to go out the door to pay those finance costs and more that they get to retain to grow their dividend.\nDavid Meier: Jason, with those two ideas, are you saying quality is not a function of the rate environment? Those are good, high quality businesses.\nJason Hall: That's the key. That's exactly it. Throwing ideas at the wall and chasing return is one thing. Focusing on quality still matters maybe even more in this environment because that's where you get the sustained benefits of this and not just a little bit of bump because you're chasing what you read on WallStreetBets\nEmily Flippen: You can even make the argument that interest rates in general are always going to be some element of cyclical, which is to say they will go up and they will go down over time in a typical cycle. While it's hard to predict exactly what that looks like. The thesis for our company and an investment should be so much bigger than just what is the current interest rate regime, or where do I see the interest rate regime going? It should be doing something that's likely to provide long term value outside of the factors that they don't have control over, like interest rates.\nJason Hall: That's exactly right.\nEmily Flippen: We'll circle back potentially to REITs and some other dividend paying investments at the end of the show. But up next, we're digging into how interest rates can impact financial stocks. Stick with us.\nFinancials. That's the segment of the market. It's made up of companies like banks, insurance companies, even some fintech businesses. They're perhaps one of the most obvious industries that gets hit by interest rates. After all when rates go up, interest income for these companies tend to rise, but at the same time, consumer credit costs rise and loan growth can stall. For some of these companies, that can turn into a double edged sword. Jason, do lower interest rates really benefit banks and other financial institutions given the possibility for those lower net interest margins?\nJason Hall: There's definitely a tension between interest rates and borrower demand, but I think that's more important than anything else. Obviously in the high end and the low end, higher rates don't matter if nobody can afford them. Rates that are too close to your capital cost. For banks, what do you pay for depositors and interest bearing? Then you think about companies that borrow money and then they lend money in some way. You have to pay for it. There's a margin between it. They just don't work if the math doesn't work. But small rate cuts, they can unlock some pent up demand for large purchases like homes and cars, and that new loan activity can be worth more than the risk of lower yields cutting your margins. Think about it like this. If you can earn an extra $25 million in margin at a lower gross margin rate, you take the extra $25 million. The dollars are what pays the bills. I think that's the key. Your net interest income moving higher is what matter. The percentages matter on the margins, but if you can issue more loans at the lower rate, you take the larger amount of loans.\nEmily Flippen: That's nicely said. It's more of a volume game as opposed to a pricing game for a lot of these companies. Even if it means that you end up getting a lower margin on the sales that you're making, if you're doing a larger volume of sales on dollars basis, the bottom line still grows.\nJason Hall: Yes.\nDavid Meier: I will also say in my experience, the rates that they charge for their loans may not fall as quickly as the rates that they get for the money they borrow. Again, very short period of time, you could get a little incremental boost that way because it might take some time for that signal to flow through the market that sets the rates for the consumer, for the buyer.\nEmily Flippen: Dave, I also want to talk to you a little bit about the fintech sector. You've followed this industry, and I know that you see a lot of growth at a reasonable price opportunities with some potentially smaller cap companies in this space, but even big companies like PayPal, Block, and Affirm, they're all being impacted by higher rates. Management really likes to parrot that lower rates could reduce consumer borrowing costs. They could drive transactions higher. But again, in my experience, those lower rates tend to come at a time when the economy is showing weakening signs, which isn't typically great for consumer spending, and I think could be a headwind for some of these platforms. Where do you fall on that?\nDavid Meier: Typically you're right. When there is a slowdown in the economy, we see monetary policy move toward reducing rates and the idea there is to try to prevent demand from falling too far. Demand is what drives GDP. That's what people think about when they buy things. That's the idea at least when the environment is poor. Lower rates spur buying, let's keep the economy from shrinking too much. But there are obviously other factors at play, control spending, job security, consumer confidence, inflation, we could name a whole bunch more. What's interesting is today, I think the rate cut chatter is more about just trying to get the economy to grow faster. In the short term, that should be beneficial to much of the fintech sector via a bump in demand. What that means is more people wanting to buy stuff and having multiple options to pay for it. You named a few. I can use PayPal. If I want to do buy now pay later, I could use Affirm, things like that. It will be interesting to see how this all plays out, but I actually think in today's environment, a short term cut is positive for that entire industry.\nEmily Flippen: Beautifully said. Up next, we're moving over to bond proxy stocks and how interest rates impact high yield investments. We'll see you after the break.\nNow moving over to a segment of the market that many believe stands to benefit the most from rate cuts, bond proxy stocks. These are companies that act like a bond. Some would argue a lower risk, high yielding investment, things like utilities, telecom, and dividend players. Dave, in a high rate world, dividend stocks, they lose luster in some sense compared to treasuries. Three percent dividend yield sounds great until you're comparing it to a risk free 5% from the government and then all of a sudden, I'm not so interested in buying that company anymore. We've actually seen a pretty substantial underperformance of dividend and paying stocks in recent years. How much of that is impacted by rate cuts and do you think potential rate cuts could make these types of investments even more attractive?\nDavid Meier: I think that's right. Actually it's a little weird but I think the rate cut could make them a little bit more attractive. In a rate cutting environment, the market tends to gravitate toward smaller companies and growthier ideas. What that could mean is that there is \"less demand\" for dividend payers. People just don't want them. There's something else that's going up. Let's chase that. But dividend payers really aren't really for outperforming the market, like bonds. They're more for protecting capital and getting a little sent back to you each year. But for some, that actually might be more attractive than treasuries because those stocks could actually get a little bit of capital appreciation. You might get a little boost in all of this. You might get a little less yield, but you could get a little more capital appreciation. It's possible to outperform what they were doing before, but I think it's always difficult for dividend payers to outperform something like the S&P 500 index.\nEmily Flippen: It's a good thing that we don't have Matt and Antoine here listening because they might have a bone to pick with it. But, Jason, I know this is something that I've talked about with Matt and Antoine previously on Motley Fool Money, which is that the number of dividend paying companies in the US markets has fallen substantially. You can make the argument that this is a potential impact of rate changes and just dividends being less attractive to investors, or if there's just a broader change in appetite from investors for high yielding investments. What are your thoughts?\nJason Hall: I think it's a combination of two things that are very interrelated. If you look at what's happened really, it's really were a couple of decades in, but in terms of the investor win, really coming out of the financial crisis, this explosive growth of technology companies, software as a service, along with low interest rates. Those things fed each other because the capital flowed into VC, which was funding because there was no return to be earned in bonds. Really again, coming out of the great financial crisis. We talk about this within the context of the pandemic. We need to go back another decade to really tell the full story of this low interest rate environment. All this money flowed into VC and VC became very institutionalized. We're talking massive amounts of money that would normally have maybe been in bonds or other income investments that went to VC that stayed there for decades, that's funded so many of these software companies, that have made the corporate world more efficient and more profitable and have unlocked other growth opportunities for those businesses which have allocated their capital toward those growth opportunities instead of returning money back and dividends. Share repurchases have continued to happen at very high levels. But the dividends, like you said, have really largely gone down. Those two things created one another. We're in a weird place now though because you go back to end of 2021 and 2022 when interest rates really skyrocketed.\nWhat's happened since then? VC and private equity, they're having a lot more trouble raising capital than they did prior to that, because you can get 5% risk free again. You see how this comes full circle. I think that 2010 Cambrian explosion of software as the service, and now we have AI. Guys, that's software, it's all funding the same thing and driving this growth in extremely high levels of corporate profitability that we've never really seen before, and it's just changed the environment. The last thing I'll add to that because of this, we have an entire generation of retail investors who made their money on stocks and saw bonds as this not worth it thing to invest in. Now we have hundreds of billions of dollars of capital, even for people that are retired. That made their money in stocks that are not interested in shifting to fixed income. It's this weird dichotomy that we're dealing with. But I think we started to see a little bit of a shift, but they're so interrelated. It's hard to really say it's one thing or the other.\nEmily Flippen: Speaking anecdotally, I think I'm part of that generation of investors. I'm 30-years-old and if I have dividend paying stocks in my portfolio, it's by sheer accidents, not through any conscious capital allocation on my part. I've always looked down on companies that pay dividends in some sense, because in my mind it's effectively like saying, I can't figure out a better place to put this money to work so we're giving it back to you and you can figure it out. I want my management and my leadership teams for companies to have ideas about where great places to invest are. That's why I gave them my money in the first place. Don't send it back to me. [LAUGHTER] But clearly, maybe the interest rate regime will change my opinion on that. No longer when I'm not looking at 5% risk free.\nJason Hall: That's right.\nEmily Flippen: As we sign off here, let's do one last quick lightning round on other stocks or segments that really care about interest rates that we didn't get to today. I'll start and I'll say, companies that hold to client cash. I think this is such a big risk for investors because it's unrelated to their core business. Using Tesla just as a quick example, they have a lot of these auto regulatory credits that come and generate basically tons of net profit for the company that's unrelated to the manufacture, production, sale of electric vehicles. There are software companies that effectively do the same thing except for instead of dealing with regulatory credits, they're dealing that with client cash. Airbnb is perhaps the most salient example. Lots of people pay upfront when they get an Airbnb. Airbnb holds onto that cash and they earn returns and net interest on the cash that they're holding for clients. Over the course of 2024, the interest income from client cash generated around 30% of their total profits for the year. That's unrelated to their core platform offering. That's a risk that I think some investors don't fact ran when considering lower interest rates is that, Airbnb, Paycom, other software services that receive cash upfront. These are businesses that in part generate a fair portion of profits just off interest income.\nJason Hall: Airbnb has float. Who would have thought it?\nEmily Flippen: Who would have thought it? [LAUGHTER] Dave, what about you?\nDavid Meier: Small caps. Smaller companies face lots of challenges on their way to try to become bigger companies by growing their revenue and cash flow. Lower rates makes capital, which is just way more crucial to a smaller company than a larger company, a little less expensive. What that can mean, perhaps they can fund a project or make an improvement to a product that helps them grow that they didn't think they could fund before. All things being equal, I would definitely look within the small cap sector for opportunities when rates are falling.\nJason Hall: I'm going to invert this a little bit. I'm going to do my best Charlie Munger and say, what are industries that can be heavily affected by this in positive ways that don't necessarily become more investible. I'll go from Munger to Peter Lynch here who once wrote, \"Roughly, even a great company in a mediocre industry is still a mediocre company.\" In recent decades, besides Tesla, find me a massively market beating successful investment in the automaker space. You really can't, they are very rare. It's a brutal price taker industry, very low margins, capital intensitive, end user demand that's very cyclical. Even Tesla, the one success, hasn't really been a great investment in recent years, and what success it has had has been tied to the story things, future bets around AI, autonomy, and robotics, not the EV business. Let's be honest, it's struggling right now. I think any benefit investors see from falling rates in that industry, let me paraphrase Jerome Powell and say it's probably going to be transitory.\nEmily Flippen: I love that note to end on. I think that summarizes the takeaway from today's show, which is that, it's true, lower interest rates can lift a lot of boats, but for some certain stocks or some certain segments, that actually can make or break the investment. For other businesses, maybe automakers, in this case, where it can drive demand, it doesn't actually change a long term thesis for a lot of investments.\nJason Hall: That's right.\nEmily Flippen: Jason, Dave, thank you both so much for joining.

Families with tighter finances may have a harder time keeping up in the second half of 2025, he added.\n“If you look at the lower-income consumer, and you look at the challenges that they're facing every day, just across their entire life, in terms of what things cost, it's just... a cause for caution,” Creedon said, according to a transcript made available by AlphaSense.\nThe caution echoes some recent research findings. A survey released recently by PricewaterhouseCoopers suggested that shoppers planned to spend around $1,552 apiece this holiday season, down some 5% from a year earlier, with Generation Z shoppers slashing spending by more than 20%. Consumers planned to spend about 11% less on gifts specifically, PwC said, while keeping travel and entertainment spending steady.\n\"People are going to keep shopping, but with continuing concerns about tariffs and elevated prices (especially on electronics, apparel, toys, food, and household staples), value-conscious choices are likely to define the season,\" the report said.\nDollar Tree Raises Full-Year Same-Store Sales Forecast\nA number of other companies have recently warned that consumers are growing cautious. Dollar General (DG) said sales in its $1 sections climbed at double the rate of same-store sales across its portfolio as a whole.

The discounter raised its full-year forecast Wednesday, estimating that comparable store sales will grow 4% to 6% year-over-year, compared to a prior range of 3% to 5%.\nLow-income consumers will still shop at Dollar Tree to stretch their budget, while those with greater means will continue to come for unexpected finds, said Creedon, who suggested Dollar Tree has “the answer” for everyone.", "content_hash": "c0c38d39cee634fbc222fd61a5a571de", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

As of this writing on Sept. 3, The Trade Desk is down 55% this year and in the middle of its worst price drawdown ever.\nInvestors are concerned about slowing revenue growth for this advertising innovator, which has previously traded at a premium valuation. Here's why The Trade Desk slipped yet again in the month of August.\nSlowing growth, high expectations\nOn Aug. 7, The Trade Desk reported its second-quarter earnings. The advertising technology company that provides solutions for ad buyers outside of the large internet walled gardens had 19% year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter. Sales hit $694 million, with net income of $90 million for a margin of 13%.\nIn the same period a year ago, The Trade Desk reported revenue growth of 26%. Growth has begun to slow for this advertising disruptor, and even slower growth is expected in the third quarter, with guidance calling for 14% year-over-year gains to $717 million. In recent years, The Trade Desk has been a much faster grower. The company claims a huge addressable market for its decentralized targeted advertising across internet assets like connected TV, webpages, and even podcasts as an alternative to the likes of Google or Instagram.\nIn fact, Meta Platforms grew its advertising revenue by 21% year over year last quarter, which was actually faster than The Trade Desk at a much larger scale. Whatever gains The Trade Desk made in targeted digital advertising are now going in reverse, and investors are worried. The stock previously traded at a high valuation, with a price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 20 before this dip.\nIs The Trade Desk stock a buy?\nEven after this 37% drop in August, The Trade Desk still trades at a P/S ratio of 10, which is significantly above the S&P 500 index average of 3.2.\nThis is a company with an extremely high gross margin -- 80% or so over the last 12 months -- but one that has failed to see significant expansion of its bottom-line net income margin even though it has now reached a large scale. A P/S ratio of 10 is not cheap unless you believe that The Trade Desk will grow quickly or have sky-high bottom-line margins.\nIt has neither. For this reason, the stock is probably one you should not buy the dip on right now.", "content_hash": "dcc1ac847111b2a10b154db39797be53", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The report by economist Jiayi Xu details how these mounting climate threats are reshaping housing markets, creating major financial burdens for homeowners, and driving up the cost and complexity of insurance nationwide.\nOverall, it finds that 26% of U.S. homes are at severe or extreme risk, with flood risks particularly underestimated by the federal government. Nearly 6 million homes ($3.4 trillion in value) face severe flooding in the next 30 years, about 2 million more than FEMA estimates, due to outdated flood maps. Major metro areas like Miami, New York, Tampa, Los Angeles, and Houston collectively hold hundreds of billions of dollars in at-risk property.\nThe number actually represents a drop from 2024’s edition of the same report, which found a whopping 44% and $22 trillion worth of homes were exposed, but Realtor.com’s chief economist Danielle Hale told Fortune the reports are not directly comparable. The 2024 edition includes five climate risks—flood, wind, fire, heat and air quality—while the 2025 edition includes only three. Even isolating the wind, flood and wildfire risks from the 2024 report yields a cumulative value of $14.1 trillion, a higher mark than the 2025 edition.\nHale also said Realtor.com partners on this report with First Street, a research firm that seeks to quantify risk for “every property in the country,” and their models may vary from year to year. Hale also noted some “pretty high-profile” climate events have occurred in between the two reports, such as the devastating LA wildfires, which Fortune reported consumed an estimated $150 billion worth of property wealth.\nFlood, hurricane, and wildfire hotspots\nMiami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach leads in total property value at risk of severe flood and wind damage, with all homes in certain metros such as Miami and Houston classified as highly vulnerable. New Orleans and several Florida metros show the highest share of homes exposed to flood risk relative to overall property value. California holds nearly 40% of the nation’s total wildfire-exposed property value, some $3.4 trillion, with Los Angeles and Riverside as the hotspots of concern. Outside California, western cities such as Colorado Springs, Colo., and Tucson, Ariz., also face high wildfire-related property threats.\nInsurance premiums are surging in high-risk markets, with Miami homeowners paying an average of 3.7% of a home’s value in annual premiums—the nation’s highest rate. Flood insurance is often sold separately, hurricane deductibles can be five times higher than on standard policies, and wildfire coverage is often limited or unaffordable. Difficulty securing affordable coverage is contributing to “insurance deserts,” according to the World Economic Forum. Hale noted insurance is required with most mortgages, but for the millions of Americans who own their homes outright without a mortgage, they can go without insurance legally and are therefore vulnerable.\nThe sharp rise in insurance premiums, increased frequency of disaster events, and growing difficulty in securing coverage are reshaping not only where people live but also whether housing remains affordable in vulnerable regions. As insurance becomes harder to secure in risk-prone areas, markets in lower-risk regions are expected to see stronger home price growth due to climate-driven migration. Hale said Realtor.com has been running this report for five years and it’s “easy to forget about the sheer magnitude or the risks” from climate, “it easy to underestimate them,” and her firm hopes to equip homebuyers with enough information as possible going into a big decision.\nLost in the flood?\nThe Realtor.com study explains that First Street finds a large difference in at-risk home counts between its model and FEMA zones because the latter “do not account for heavy rainfall and future climate changes.” Realtor.com’s analysis finds that roughly 2 million homes, valued at almost $1 trillion, could be facing a flood risk that current homeowners don’t know about, and therefore they may lack flood insurance.\nIf major flood risk areas identified by the First Street are taken into account, this gap could be even larger. New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco have the biggest gaps, in dollar terms. New York has a $95.3 billion vulnerability, according to the study, LA has $65.6 billion, and San Francisco has $54.9 billion.\nThe insurance and housing sectors are scrambling to try to get ahead of this ticking time bomb. Fannie Mae CEO Priscilla Almodovar wrote in the pages of Fortune in May 2024 she appreciated Beyoncé for her song “YA YA” on the “Cowboy Carter” album, where she sounded the insurance-desert alarm: “Wildfire burnt his house down/Insurance ain’t gonna pay no Fannie Mae.” Each year since 2021, she added, the U.S. has averaged 22 natural disasters with damage exceeding $1 billion, a stark contrast from the 1980s, when the average was three per year.\nFor this story, Fortune used generative AI to help with an initial draft.

That's because Rocket Lab is seen as a serious contender that could challenge Elon Musk's SpaceX for dominance in the space exploration market. A key element in its ability to do so is the successful development of Neutron, its heavy-lift rocket that can compete with SpaceX for major payloads.\nThe company announced yesterday that the Neutron launch pad was complete, helping to give investors confidence that the company is close to a successful launch.\nRocketLab's valuation weighs on the stock\nThe company is now valued at nearly $22 billion, which is pretty hefty for a company with annual sales of about $500 million and operating in the red.\nThe company does have momentum behind it and a substantial backlog, but it still lost almost $200 million in the last 12 months before taxes, interest, or depreciation are taken into account -- and considering it builds rockets, its depreciation costs are substantial. The company will continue to have to drive development and growth through expensive debt or stock dilution.\nThe opportunity is exciting, but for my taste, paying $22 billion for a company burning cash at this rate requires more faith than fundamentals.

In response, companies are freezing hiring, and consumers are tightening their belts in many places. According to the \"Beige Book\" released by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, a compilation of anecdotal reports from business leaders gathered nationwide between July and late August.\nThe report adds color to the picture painted by hard data on inflation and hiring. It also details the growing impact of tariffs that President Donald Trump ratcheted up this year.\nThe Fed found that economic growth stagnated in most of the country while slight growth occurred in four of its twelve districts.\nMuch of the 55-page report was devoted to the impact of tariffs. Some companies are passing the cost of the new import taxes on to consumers, while others are reluctant or unable to do so. Some expect to raise costs in the future.\nFamilies in the Kansas City district were getting more frugal as tariff-related price hikes squeezed their budgets.\n\"Anecdotal reports include families opting for staycations in place of extended travel and some households returning vehicles within a year to avoid the burden of loan payments,\" the report said. \"As one pharmacy shared, shoppers are buying less retail merchandise but maintaining consumption for the more essential items. Firms anticipate this pattern to persist, with consumers prioritizing cost over quality.\"\nThe report noted that many companies had frozen or slowed down hiring, reinforcing concerns that the job market is weakening as companies tighten their belts in the face of reduced customer demand.\n\"Seven districts noted that firms were hesitant to hire workers because of weaker demand or uncertainty,\" the report said.\nReport Could Encourage Fed To Cut Interest Rates\nThe report showed growing threats to the Federal Reserve's two goals of keeping inflation low and employment high.\nSome economists said the report's detailed analysis of stagnating economic growth and a weakening job market could push Federal Reserve officials toward lowering their key interest rate when the central bank's policy committee next meets in September.\nFed officials have kept rates flat, at a higher-than-usual level, this year in hopes of pushing inflation down to the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. However, fears of a job market crash could propel them to cut interest rates to boost borrowing and spending and juice the job market. The fed funds rate affects interest rates on many business and consumer loans.\n\"The Fed's latest regional economic update depicted a softening economy and labour market, which may go some ways to coaxing a rate cut later this month,\" Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a commentary.\nThe report also highlighted another major concern of Fed officials: tariffs could worsen inflation. The Fed is trying to determine whether the tariffs will produce a one-and-done price hike or whether prices will continue to spiral upward.\n\"Most districts reported that their firms were expecting price increases to continue in the months ahead, with three of those districts noting that the pace of price increases was expected to rise further,\" the report said.\nThe job market concerns seemed more salient to financial markets than the inflation red flags. According to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, chances for a September rate cut rose to 96%, up from 93% the previous day.

Those efforts were quickly put on hold when the Securities and Exchange Commission introduced rules requiring banks offering custody to hold equivalent capital on their balance sheets.\nThe requirement proved too restrictive, pushing the bank to suspend the program. That changed this year when the SEC rescinded the rule shortly after President Donald Trump began his second term, opening the door for large banks to reenter the digital assets space.\n“We had the playbook and it’s sort of opening it up and executing it again,” said Stephen Philipson, head of wealth, corporate, commercial, and institutional banking at U.S. Bank.\nHe added that the bank expects to scale the business more broadly as demand grows, while also exploring possible applications of crypto and stablecoins across wealth management, payments, and consumer banking.\nThe relaunch places U.S. Bancorp among a growing list of major financial institutions reactivating or expanding digital custody services.\nBank of New York Mellon, the country’s oldest bank, introduced a custody platform in 2022 to safeguard Bitcoin and Ether for select institutional clients.\nFidelity Investments also offers custody services, while crypto-native firms such as Coinbase, BitGo, and Anchorage Digital remain major players. Anchorage continues to stand out as the only federally chartered digital asset bank.\nFresh regulatory guidance from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in March further encouraged banks to participate in digital asset activities, stating that banks no longer need to seek prior approval to offer custody.\nIndustry observers expect the change to accelerate adoption among mainstream banks, providing institutional investors with more familiar and regulated options for safeguarding assets.\nU.S. Bancorp said it will consider expanding custody services beyond Bitcoin, but only for assets that meet its risk and compliance standards. For now, the decision to restart operations shows a renewed willingness by traditional finance to compete with specialized crypto custodians.\nThe timing also coincides with heightened activity in spot Bitcoin ETFs. Since their approval earlier this year, the products have attracted billions of dollars in inflows, driving institutional demand for secure storage solutions.\nCustody is viewed as a key piece of infrastructure to support that growth, and U.S. Bancorp is positioning itself to capture part of the market.\nTraditional Finance Firms Globally Shift Toward Crypto Integration\nCrypto is edging further into mainstream finance as U.S. banks and regulators move toward deeper integration with digital assets.\nIn recent months, several large lenders have begun exploring crypto services, stablecoin issuance, and custody solutions once considered too risky.\nGerman institutions, including DZ Bank and Sparkassen, have indicated similar intentions, showing how traditional finance is rapidly adapting to demand.\nThe shift is partly driven by regulation. In July, the first federal stablecoin law was signed, providing a framework for banks to explore dollar-pegged tokens.\nStablecoins like USDT and USDC already support a $230 billion market, moving funds faster and cheaper than legacy rails.\nAnalysts warn that widespread adoption could reduce deposits and payment revenues for banks, but lenders see opportunity in capturing new flows before tech-native competitors dominate.\nTrump Pushes Sweeping Crypto Reforms in Second Term\nThe regulatory environment has become friendlier as well. In August, the SEC and CFTC issued a joint statement clarifying that registered exchanges may facilitate spot crypto trades, a step intended to improve investor protections and encourage development in the U.S.\nFor everyday users, this means being able to buy and sell crypto directly, similar to stocks, on licensed platforms that follow compliance rules.\nThis growing institutional interest is unfolding against a broader political backdrop shaped by Donald Trump’s second administration.\nSince returning to the office, Trump has positioned himself as a champion of digital assets, in contrast to what he calls the “hostile” stance of his predecessor.\nThe White House has already pushed through the GENIUS Act, the country’s first stablecoin law, and is lobbying Congress to pass the CLARITY Act, a comprehensive framework for digital assets.\nThe administration has also introduced a strategic Bitcoin reserve and published a 160-page report outlining plans to support open-source infrastructure and safeguard user privacy.\nSEC Chairman Paul Atkins, a Trump appointee, announced “Project Crypto” in July, a sweeping effort to modernize securities rules and bring crypto asset distributions back onshore.\nThe project includes clearer categories for tokens, new disclosure standards, and safe harbors for coin offerings and airdrops, steps intended to make it easier for companies to include U.S. investors.\nAt the same time, tensions with banks remain. In August, a coalition of crypto firms, including Gemini and Robinhood, urged Trump to block new “account access” fees proposed by lenders, arguing such charges would cripple innovation.\nBanks countered that the industry is asking for free services while profiting from user data.", "content_hash": "07e7b9940f033200d5df927279a65e99", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

That broadly lifted stocks over the span of four decades, although investors experienced a few bumps along the way.\nA wave of supply-side economic reforms, including the tax cuts and deregulation that arrived during the 1980s under President Ronald Reagan, also helped to boost corporate profits and stock-market returns.\nBut President Trump’s tariff plans and the supply-chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have changed all of that, according to Oppenheimer. Now, the globalization that had unfurled slowly over decades is slamming into reverse.\nIn the years ahead, heavy government debt burdens will likely keep bond yields elevated relative to where they stood during the years that followed the 2008 financial crisis. Prices of consumer goods and services should continue to climb more quickly than they did in the past. And aging populations could also complicate the relationship between corporate profits and economic growth.\nIn the past, the strongest returns for stocks typically followed periods where valuations were relatively low.\nBut these days, valuations based on most popular metrics are looking stretched. European and Asian markets might look cheap relative to the U.S., but that is a harder case to make when comparing them to where things stood in the past.\nWhen measured as a percentage of total GDP, corporate profit margins are also looking stretched.\nFor these reasons, Oppenheimer and his team believe returns for broad market indexes like the S&P 500 SPX might prove disappointing going forward.\n“On balance, while we see high valuations as justifiable, there is less scope for multiple expansion to contribute much to returns. We expect less meaningful annualized returns at broad index levels than we have seen in the 1945-1968, 1982-2000 and 2009-2022 supercycles,” Oppenheimer wrote in a report shared with MarketWatch.\nThat could create problems for investors who have favored broadly diversified portfolios that track indexes like the S&P 500. At the same time, skilled stock pickers could benefit from a wealth of opportunities to outperform.\nOver the past few decades, returns in the global equities market have largely been dominated by U.S. information-technology stocks, as well as companies such as Amazon.com Inc. AMZN and Meta Platforms Inc. META that are often lumped in with Big Tech.\nBut as the AI revolution begins to bear fruit, this could change, Oppenheimer said. Companies are starting to leverage this new technology to boost productivity. Soon, the gap between stock-market winners and losers could become more obvious across sectors, styles and geographies.\nOver the past few years, the success of the latest crop of U.S. stock-market leaders like Nvidia Corp. NVDA and Microsoft Corp. MSFT has caused global equities markets to become increasingly concentrated.\nWhile Oppenheimer believes plenty of opportunity remains within the technology space, he cautioned that investors should consider diversifying away from some of the recent stock-market leaders.\nInvestors should also think about expanding their security-selection search beyond the U.S., he noted. Europe could hold some particularly enticing opportunities as companies spend more money on long-lived assets to boost productivity and innovation.\nU.S. stocks have held up so far in 2025, as markets quickly bounced back from the turbulence unleashed in early April by President Trump’s initial “liberation day” tariff onslaught. But many international markets have bested the U.S. this year to date, especially when their returns are translated into U.S. dollar terms.\nAs of Wednesday late afternoon, the S&P 500 was clinging to a 0.2% gain, while the Nasdaq Composite COMP was up by 0.7%. Both indexes received a boost after a major antitrust ruling helped bolster shares of Alphabet Inc. GOOGL GOOG and Apple Inc. AAPL Meanwhile, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA remained stuck in the red, off by nearly 200 points, or 0.4%, in recent trade.", "content_hash": "dc63d4004820940a8fc70f548cd0be50", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

In most cases, you’ll just need to hold a specific minimum balance in the account to avoid paying the fee. If your account has a minimum balance requirement, you’ll need to make sure your average daily balance stays above the minimum to avoid the fee.\n2. Set Up Direct Deposit\nSome checking accounts will waive your monthly account fee if you set up direct deposit into the account. This means you’ll need your paychecks to automatically deposit into the account on a regular basis. Some accounts require a minimum direct deposit amount into the account each month to waive account fees.\n3. Open Another Account\nSome banks will waive your checking account fees if you open another account at the same bank.

Waller framed the conference as a continuation of the central bank’s push to balance innovation with stability.\n“Innovation has been a constant in payments to meet the changing needs of consumers and businesses,” Waller said.\nHe added that the Fed seeks to explore both the opportunities and challenges of new technologies, with the goal of improving the safety and efficiency of payments.\nThe Payments Innovation Conference will feature panel discussions on the convergence of traditional and decentralized finance, the business models emerging around stablecoins, and the role of AI in payments.\nThe agenda also includes sessions on tokenization, which is increasingly seen as a tool for transforming how financial assets are issued and transferred.\nThe entire event will be livestreamed to the public on the Fed’s website, with more details to be released in the weeks ahead.\nThe October summit comes as stablecoins expand rapidly into the digital asset economy. With more than $230 billion in circulation globally, tokens like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC are now central to crypto markets and increasingly seen as a bridge to traditional finance.\nPolicymakers have been weighing their potential to improve payment efficiency against risks of instability, particularly if stablecoins replace bank deposits or disrupt existing systems.\nThe Federal Reserve has held prior events on digital payments, but the October conference shows a growing urgency to address stablecoins’ role in the financial system directly. The discussions arrive just months after Congress passed the first federal stablecoin legislation in July, giving banks a clearer regulatory path to issuing dollar-backed tokens.\nSpeaking in Wyoming on August 20, she suggested allowing Fed staff to hold small amounts of crypto to better understand how the technology works. Bowman argued that direct exposure would provide valuable insight and help the central bank attract talent in a competitive field.\nShe further warned that an “overly cautious mindset” could make the banking system less relevant to consumers and businesses, urging regulators to work with the industry to understand blockchain’s potential benefits, including tokenized assets that streamline ownership transfers.\nThe upcoming payments conference is expected to continue this dialogue, as policymakers balance innovation with oversight.\nBy placing stablecoins at the center of the agenda, the Fed appears intent on tackling the business models of one of crypto’s fastest-growing sectors head-on.\nU.S. Federal Reserve Pulls Back Crypto Oversight, Ends Specialized Supervision Program\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve has scaled back its oversight of banks’ crypto activities, dismantling measures introduced in 2022 and 2023 that required pre-approvals and heightened scrutiny of digital asset ventures.\nThe program, created under Supervisory Letter SR 23-7, had imposed stricter reviews of digital-asset services and required proof of robust risk controls.\nIn its statement, the Fed said the program had already met its goal of deepening regulators’ understanding of digital-asset risks, making continued specialized supervision unnecessary. Crypto-friendly lawmakers, however, viewed the reversal as a political victory.\nSenator Cynthia Lummis called it a “big win” against what she and others labeled “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” an alleged effort to cut off banking access for crypto firms. President Donald Trump has also condemned such oversight, describing it as part of a broader “debanking” agenda.\nThe rollback means banks will now have their digital-asset services reviewed under the same risk-based framework as traditional activities. While the Fed stressed that safety, soundness, and compliance standards remain, banks will no longer face a separate supervisory layer for crypto operations.\nRegulators have still emphasized risk-management obligations. In July, the Fed, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued a joint reminder to banks providing crypto custody.\nThe agencies outlined fiduciary and non-fiduciary models of custody, stressing the need for strict controls over cryptographic keys, cyber protections, and compliance with existing laws.\nMeanwhile, lawmakers are pushing for broader regulatory clarity. In mid-July, House Republicans declared “Crypto Week,” advancing bills including the CLARITY Act to distinguish between securities and commodities and the GENIUS Act on stablecoin oversight, which President Trump had already signed.\nAnother proposal, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, would prohibit the creation of a U.S. central bank digital currency.\nTogether, the regulatory retreat and legislative push mark a shift toward a lighter, pro-crypto stance in Washington.", "content_hash": "61f5cc034109ee62ddb625268e481b0b", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Here’s a few ways to avoid checking account fees:\n1. Meet the Minimum Balance\nMany checking accounts that charge a monthly fee offer a way to waive the fee. In most cases, you’ll just need to hold a specific minimum balance in the account to avoid paying the fee. If your account has a minimum balance requirement, you’ll need to make sure your average daily balance stays above the minimum to avoid the fee.\n2. Set Up Direct Deposit\nSome checking accounts will waive your monthly account fee if you set up direct deposit into the account. This means you’ll need your paychecks to automatically deposit into the account on a regular basis. Some accounts require a minimum direct deposit amount into the account each month to waive account fees.\n3. Open Another Account\nSome banks will waive your checking account fees if you open another account at the same bank. This might just mean opening a linked checking account, or potentially opening another checking account, a certificate of deposit (CD), or even an individual retirement account (IRA).", "content_hash": "a28339661b85a60ee5f31525a584fa57", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Waller framed the conference as a continuation of the central bank’s push to balance innovation with stability.\n“Innovation has been a constant in payments to meet the changing needs of consumers and businesses,” Waller said.\nHe added that the Fed seeks to explore both the opportunities and challenges of new technologies, with the goal of improving the safety and efficiency of payments.\nThe Payments Innovation Conference will feature panel discussions on the convergence of traditional and decentralized finance, the business models emerging around stablecoins, and the role of AI in payments.\nThe agenda also includes sessions on tokenization, which is increasingly seen as a tool for transforming how financial assets are issued and transferred.\nThe entire event will be livestreamed to the public on the Fed’s website, with more details to be released in the weeks ahead.\nThe October summit comes as stablecoins expand rapidly into the digital asset economy. With more than $230 billion in circulation globally, tokens like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC are now central to crypto markets and increasingly seen as a bridge to traditional finance.\nPolicymakers have been weighing their potential to improve payment efficiency against risks of instability, particularly if stablecoins replace bank deposits or disrupt existing systems.\nThe Federal Reserve has held prior events on digital payments, but the October conference shows a growing urgency to address stablecoins’ role in the financial system directly. The discussions arrive just months after Congress passed the first federal stablecoin legislation in July, giving banks a clearer regulatory path to issuing dollar-backed tokens.\nSpeaking in Wyoming on August 20, she suggested allowing Fed staff to hold small amounts of crypto to better understand how the technology works. Bowman argued that direct exposure would provide valuable insight and help the central bank attract talent in a competitive field.\nShe further warned that an “overly cautious mindset” could make the banking system less relevant to consumers and businesses, urging regulators to work with the industry to understand blockchain’s potential benefits, including tokenized assets that streamline ownership transfers.\nThe upcoming payments conference is expected to continue this dialogue, as policymakers balance innovation with oversight.\nBy placing stablecoins at the center of the agenda, the Fed appears intent on tackling the business models of one of crypto’s fastest-growing sectors head-on.\nU.S. Federal Reserve Pulls Back Crypto Oversight, Ends Specialized Supervision Program\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve has scaled back its oversight of banks’ crypto activities, dismantling measures introduced in 2022 and 2023 that required pre-approvals and heightened scrutiny of digital asset ventures.\nThe program, created under Supervisory Letter SR 23-7, had imposed stricter reviews of digital-asset services and required proof of robust risk controls.\nIn its statement, the Fed said the program had already met its goal of deepening regulators’ understanding of digital-asset risks, making continued specialized supervision unnecessary. Crypto-friendly lawmakers, however, viewed the reversal as a political victory.\nSenator Cynthia Lummis called it a “big win” against what she and others labeled “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” an alleged effort to cut off banking access for crypto firms. President Donald Trump has also condemned such oversight, describing it as part of a broader “debanking” agenda.\nThe rollback means banks will now have their digital-asset services reviewed under the same risk-based framework as traditional activities. While the Fed stressed that safety, soundness, and compliance standards remain, banks will no longer face a separate supervisory layer for crypto operations.\nRegulators have still emphasized risk-management obligations. In July, the Fed, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued a joint reminder to banks providing crypto custody.\nThe agencies outlined fiduciary and non-fiduciary models of custody, stressing the need for strict controls over cryptographic keys, cyber protections, and compliance with existing laws.\nMeanwhile, lawmakers are pushing for broader regulatory clarity. In mid-July, House Republicans declared “Crypto Week,” advancing bills including the CLARITY Act to distinguish between securities and commodities and the GENIUS Act on stablecoin oversight, which President Trump had already signed.\nAnother proposal, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, would prohibit the creation of a U.S. central bank digital currency.\nTogether, the regulatory retreat and legislative push mark a shift toward a lighter, pro-crypto stance in Washington.", "content_hash": "61f5cc034109ee62ddb625268e481b0b", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

We will absolutely not allow new green taxes for households and transport,\" Babis said.\nTo gain greater control over electricity price-setting, the party reiterated that it would raise the state's stake in the country's top energy provider CEZ to 100% from the current 70%.\nANO said it would cap the retirement age at 65, reversing a pension reform gradually raising the age to 67 to limit sharp increases in pension costs as part of the budget.\nThe party also plans to cut corporate tax to 19% from 21%, increase tax write-offs for individuals and lower value-added tax for restaurants.\nBabis said the funding for these measures would come through improved tax collection and higher economic growth. The party's fiscal expert Alena Schilerova said that ANO was not pledging balanced budgets now but that they would be the result of a successful economic policy.", "content_hash": "53886c8891bf1636c3640ee3018d9645", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

In late-session trading it was up by more than 3% in price, well ahead of the S&P 500 index's 0.2% gain at that point in the day.\nA recent acquisition could be a game changer\nWell before market open, BNP Paribas Exane's Jakob Bluestone changed said recommendation, pushing it up a notch to outperform (buy, in other words) from his previous neutral. His price target on Nokia's Europe-listed stock is 4.30 euros ($5.01) per share.\nAccording to reports, Bluestone's new outlook on Nokia derives largely from its latest big-ticket acquisition. Last June it acquired U.S. tech and telecom equipment supplier Infinera in a $2.3 billion deal; this closed in February.\nThe analyst believes that absorbing Infinera positions Nokia to benefit from investments into artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, which go hand in hand with the current wave of data center build-outs (as those facilities are modified and expanded to handle the increased resource requirements of AI).\nBluestone pointed out that at the moment, Nokia's revenue from hyperscaler projects comprises only 5% of its overall top line. Given the high demand from such clients, that percentage could go well higher.\nBusiness metamorphosis\nAt the dawn of the cellphone era, Nokia reigned supreme, particularly as a producer of handsets. It did not adjust well in the subsequent Age of the Smartphone, and since then has refashioned itself into a provider of the networking technology and associated offerings that underpin the telecom industry.\nWith Infinera it certainly has a chance of capturing lightning in a bottle; given that, Bluestone's new, bullish take feels realistic.\nShould you buy stock in Nokia Oyj right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nokia Oyj, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nokia Oyj wasn’t one of them.

You're listening to the Saturday Personal Finance Edition of Motley Fool Money. I'm Robert Brokamp. This week, I speak with Fool contributor Matt Frankel about the whys and hows of turning your home into cash.\nBut first, let's talk about last week and money. We start with a post on X from Liz Ann Sonders, Chief Investment Strategist at Schwab. Since President Trump announced a pause on tariffs on April 8th, the S&P 500 has returned 29% as of August 18th, according to Sonders post. But she highlighted which indexes have done the best and worst since then. The winners aren't necessarily the types of stocks that would give you much faith in the rally. The top three performers have been the Goldman Sachs Non-Profitable Tech Index, the Goldman Sachs Most Shorted Index, and the UBS Mime Basket Index, all of which have returned more than 60% since April 8th.\nAt the bottom of the list, are indexes of Blue-chip dividend paying stocks, such as consumer staples, whichever turns in the low to bid single digits. Clearly, over the last four or so months, investors have been piling back into speculative growth stocks. But not exclusively. The current earnings season has actually been really solid and many stocks have risen for good reason. Of the 11 major sectors as determined by S&P, the best performers since April 8th have been Communication Services and Tech, which are dominated by the biggest companies in the US. In fact, for the first time ever, the 10 largest companies now make up 40% of the S&P 500. For our next item, let's switch gears, which is a pun, because we're going to talk about car insurance. We've seen a lot of inflation over the past few years, but some of the biggest increases have been in vehicles and what it costs to insure them. According to bank rate, the average annual cost of car insurance is almost $2,700, which is up 60% over the past five years. The reason starts with the fact that cars have become more expensive, partially due to inflation, but also because cars have much more technology built into them than they did even just a few years ago. The average price of a new car in July was almost $49,000, according to Kelly Blue Book. But it's not just car prices that are driving up the cost of insurance.\nThere's actually a shortage of mechanics in this country. That's something to consider if you're looking for a job that's safe from AI, at least from now. There are also many more weather related events than in the past. The cost of insurance also incorporates expenses related to healthcare and lawyers, and those have risen. Unfortunately, this may not get any better since tariffs may increase the cost of vehicles and their parts. What should you do? Well, it might pay to do some comparison shopping if you haven't done so in a while and look for insurers that offer discounts you may be eligible for based on your age, driving history, the features of your car, maybe even your profession.\nYou might consider raising your deductible, but it also may be time to reduce the amount of insurance you have, according to a recent article by Rachel Green of Kiplinger's. Once your vehicle reaches certain milestones, such as it being several years old or exceeding 100,000 miles, you might consider reducing the amount of your comprehensive and collision coverage. It'll depend on your state's minimum insurance requirements and the value of your car, which you can look up online at such sites as kbb.com. But Green estimates that you could save up to $1,800 a year by reducing your coverage, which you should then put in a high yield savings account so that the money is available if you have to pay for repairs yourself or when you're ready to buy a new car. Now we come to the number of the week, which is 44. That's the percentage of adults who order kids' meals at restaurants for themselves, according to a survey by Lightspeed Commerce and highlighted in a recent article from Market Watch by Charles Passy. The main reason smaller portions. With many Americans on appetite suppressing GLP1 medications, many Janar is hungry, but higher prices are also a factor which brings us to a recent Wall Street Journal article about McDonald's, which by the way, sells 3.2 million happy meals each and every day. The average cost of a Big Mac value meal now is more than $10, but exceeds $18 in some locations, and customers aren't happy. The company plans to work with its franchisees to lower the costs of some of its value meals later this year. As far as I'm concerned, when anything gets cheaper, that's good news. Next up, what should homeowners do with their equity, if anything, when Motley Fool Money continues?\nYour home plays a unique and multifaceted role in your personal finances. It's an ongoing and variable expense, including such items as utilities, taxes, and maintenance, the latter of which can result in unexpected bills in the thousands of dollars. If your home has a mortgage, then it's also a liability. And if you don't pay the bill, you could lose your home. But it's also a resource. In fact, for many Americans, their home is their biggest asset. Here to discuss how to factor your home into your financial plan is full contributor and certified financial planner Matt Frankel. Matt, welcome to the show.\nMatt Frankel: Thanks, Bro. I'm always happy to talk real estate in any form.\nRobert Brokamp: Well, then let's kick this off with some stats. According to Redfin, the median home sales price in July was $443,462, near an all time high, though actually slightly down from June. Now, if you own the home outright, that's how much equity you have, but almost two-thirds of homeowners still have a mortgage. According to totality, the average home equity is a bit more than $330,000 for those with a mortgage. According to the Case Shiller Nashville Home Price Index, prices have increased 52% over the past five years. Anyone who's owned a home for at least the last few to several years has likely done very well. On the other hand, what good is an asset? Even if it's increased in value, if it's illiquid and if you sell it, you still have to live somewhere. Matt, how do you think people should factor their home equity into their financial plans?\nMatt Frankel: Well, there's a lot of home equity out there right now. You mentioned the median home sales prices up 52% in five years. It's up 16% since 2022 when pretty much everyone stopped refinancing when interest rates started to rise. This isn't just the early pandemic zero interest rate bubble. Now, homeowners in the United States are sitting on $35 trillion of equity altogether. That's an all time high, and very few people are tapping into it right now. But your home equity is a nice asset to have. It is an illiquid asset somewhat, like you mentioned. Although technology is making it a little bit more liquid than it used to be. I don't know if you've refinanced in the past five years. It's a lot easier than it was, say, 25 years ago. It's more of a liquid asset, I would argue. But right now the time isn't great to really tap into it, but it definitely can have a lot to do with your long term financial plan.\nRobert Brokamp: Let's talk a little bit about what someone might do. They decide, I do want to access some of that home equity. You talked about refinancing. Tell us a little bit about some of the options people have if they want to convert their house into cash.\nMatt Frankel: If you want to convert your house into cash without selling it, there are three basic options, really. There are home equity loans, which are also generally known as a second mortgage, where you are getting another term loan. It has a fixed interest rate, usually. It is monthly payments. A term, say, 15 years is a very common term for a home equity loan. It works just like a mortgage, but it is second in priority to your main mortgage if you have one. Then there are home equity lines of credit or HELOC. You often see that abbreviated. These were like a credit card, but when you swipe it, instead of you owing your bank money, you owe money against the value of your home. You can open a HELOC it'll have a set limit, say, $100,000. You only borrow when you need it. You only pay interest on the money you borrow. They can't have variable rates, which is a drawback of those. But it's a more flexible way to, if you want to have the option to pay for renovations as you go along or have the option to if you have a child in college, you can only draw on it as tuitions do, things like that. It's more flexible. Then, third, there's the reverse mortgage, which is, it's what it sounds like. It's the opposite of a regular mortgage, but instead of you making payments to the bank in exchange for building your equity overtime, the bank makes payments to you. You're essentially selling them your equity overtime. That could be payments. It could be a lump sum. That's generally you have to be over 62 to use one of those. It's a common tool among retirees to produce extra cash flow in retirement.\nRobert Brokamp: Let's talk about the pros and cons of some of those options. You the home equity loan. That's great. If you need a lump sum. Maybe you're doing a home renovation or something like that, and you could afford the payments. The HELOC used to be marketed as an emergency fund. Maybe it's something to use. If your portfolio is down, let's say, and you're retired, you don't want to sell your stocks while you're down, you rely on the HELOC. But that changed somewhat. Especially during the Great Recession or the GFC, depending on what you want to call it, because a lot of banks called in those loans. Right when people were relying on their HELOC as emergency funds, the bank said, sorry, you have to pay that back. You have to be open to that possibility. Then the third thing is the reverse mortgage. To me, in theory, the reverse mortgage seems so attractive, and then you dig into the details about the upfront costs at the higher interest rates, definitely something to be fully aware of before you do it. On the pro side, if the loan grows to the point where it's actually bigger than the value of the house, you don't have to make up the difference. It's one of those things that almost like also a bigger emergency fund. Most people, I think, who take advantage of it, they had to. But I totally understand it because for some people, that's the only way they can retire.\nMatt Frankel: If you live until you're 100-years-old, a reverse mortgage could definitely work out in your favor in that sense, that you're going to keep getting your monthly payments, no matter how big your balance gets. First of all, you mentioned the fees with reverse mortgages, and that's generally the most expensive option of the three. The other two aren't free. They have closing costs just like a regular mortgage does. There are costs associated. I refinanced in 2020. I don't know of any homeowners who didn't refinance when mortgage rates were about 3% who owned a home around that time. But we did what's called a rate and term refinance. We didn't take any cash out. There are good and bad reasons to tap into your home equity. It's really important to point out. Home equity is not your piggy bank. It shouldn't be used for things like an elaborate vacation. It shouldn't be used for everyday expenses unless you're a retiree. It really shouldn't be used to speculate on investments. If you're thinking of pulling out all of your home equity and investing in cryptocurrencies, probably not the best idea. But there are some really good reasons. Bro mentioned doing a big project. That's one of the most common uses, and you can even deduct the interest if you do that because it counts as qualified personal residence debt if you use the home equity proceeds on your home. If you have high interest credit card debt, it could be a much better idea to if you have $30,000 of credit card debt at 25% interest, borrow against the value or your house and really knock that interest rate down. That could be one really good reasons. There are some investment opportunities where it can make sense to tap into your home equity. A lot of real estate investors, for example, that's where they get their first down payment from for an investment property. Very few people have 20% who already own a home have 20% for another home sitting in the bank. That's a very popular way to come up with a down payment for your first investment property. If you have major expenses that you need to pay your medical costs, if you have a child in college, some of the parent loans have higher interest rates than you'll get with a home equity loan. It can actually be an attractive way to borrow money for college. There are some really good reasons to do it.\nRobert Brokamp: Let's talk about a couple other ways to turn your home into cash. One, of course, is just moving and downsizing. Maybe you have a big house because you raise your family and you don't need the big house anymore, or you just want to move to a lower cost area of the country. I live in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington DC, but I grew up outside of Tampa using cost of living calculators that you can find out on the Internet. I calculated my cost of living could go down 30% if I were to sell my home here in the DC area, move to Tampa because your home determines all kinds of aspects of your bill. Taxes, your utilities. It's not just realizing the cash from selling your home and buying another one. It could lower your monthly expenses. Then the other thing is something both of us have. We have a few things in common, Matt. We're both certified financial planners. We both began our careers as teachers. But we also, as teachers, rented rooms in other people's houses. According to an article from apartmentlt.com, Americans now have more spare rooms than ever. According to their analysis, in 1970, only about 30 something, maybe 35% of homes had a spare room. Now it's over 60%. Those are a couple other ways. What was your experience renting the, was it a basement or an attic in someone's house?\nMatt Frankel: It was like a lockout unit. They called it a pool house, but it was really just like a room with a separate entrance on the back of somebody's house. That was in Key West Florida, so it was really nice place to have a pool house.\nRobert Brokamp: Would you ever rent out a room in your house?\nMatt Frankel: Maybe when the kids are out of the house, but you mentioned downsizing, and that's our general plan. Let's just say you have a house that's comfortable for your entire family. It's worth $700,000, and you owe $300,000 on it at the time you retire. Sell your house, you have $400,000 cash to buy a smaller place, and then you live mortgage free, and that's what we're leaning toward. We're a little ways away. But that's our plan with home equity.\nRobert Brokamp: We love our house. We plan to live here for as long as we can. We love our area, we love our neighborhood. The way we factor it into our plan is it's a big fat emergency fund. It is our backup for if, hopefully, our portfolio will last as long as we do, but if not, we have our home equity. Plus, if we need extraordinary long term care, we can use our home equity. You have to be careful with that, because if, for example, you're using a reverse mortgage, you have to be in the house, so if both spouses are gone, then the mortgage has to be paid off. But for me, that's how we're factoring it into our plan.\nMatt Frankel: We live in you mentioned low cost of living areas like Tampa. We're in Columbia, South Carolina, where it's even lower cost of living. We have a lot of square footage and the upkeep. I have three flights of stairs in my house or two flights of stairs. I'm on the third floor right now. I don't want to be dealing with that when I'm in my '60s. We wanted to downsize even now when we have kids, sometimes we want to downsize. But definitely over the long term.\nRobert Brokamp: That switch gears ever so slightly from home equity and financial planning to what's actually going on in the housing market right now. What's your take?\nMatt Frankel: Well, my general take is it's slowly but surely becoming more of a buyer's market. It has been really hard to find a home for sale because everyone has these 3 or 4% mortgage rates and no one wants to sell. Of course, some people have to sell. You get transferred from work or something like that. But people are holding out, and we're seeing that starting to fade. Over the past year, existing home inventories are up 12%, but sales are flat, so there's a lot more inventory on the market versus how many homes are turning. In your inventories building, you mentioned earlier that home prices have actually declined over the past few months. They're still slightly up over the past year, but over the past three or four months, we've actually seen them pull back a little bit. One of the reasons is mortgage rates, I wouldn't call them low, but they're definitely the lowest point so far this year. Mortgage rates have a lot more to do with home affordability than even prices themselves. Do you know that a roughly two percentage point reduction in a mortgage rate is equal to a 20% price reduction in your home in terms of your mortgage payment each month? It's a big and even the most bearish people think we're not going to get a 20% home price drop. Really, mortgage rates are the key to home affordability. If rates come down even more, which I think they will, you're going to see a lot more buyers and sellers both rushed to the market. Not necessarily going to be a buyers market, but definitely an active market compared to what we've seen.\nRobert Brokamp: Well, Matt, this has been great. Thank you for sharing your insight and wisdom.\nMatt Frankel: Any time.\nRobert Brokamp: Time to get it done, Fools, and we kick it off with a bank rate article from my former Fool colleague Dr. James Royal, who wrote, \"The biggest wave of wealth in history is set to pass from baby boomers over the next 20 years, and it's going to have a huge impact on those who stand to inherit it. It's called the great wealth transfer when an estimated $84 trillion is poised to move from older Americans to Gen X's and millennials.\" Of course, not everyone will inherit it equally. According to the article, the top 1% own as much as the bottom 90%, but everyone owns something, and it'll have to go to someone when we each join that great tax shelter in the sky. The key to making the most of this wealth transfer is having an updated estate plan and making sure your relatives have one, too. Unfortunately, most people haven't done this. According to the recent version of the annual Wills and Estate Planning Survey from caring.com, only 24% of Americans have a will, which is just one part of an estate plan. It should also include updated beneficiary designations on your retirement accounts and insurance policies, durable powers of attorney, healthcare directives, directions about who you'd want to raise your kids if something happens to you and perhaps a trust. Without these documents, your assets may not go to the people you'd like to inherit them, and it will cost much more in time and money for your estate to get settled. Here's what to do. See an experienced attorney who specializes in estate planning and get your documents in order.\nThen say to your parents, siblings, any other relevant people, Hey, I just updated my estate plan, and here's where to find it if anything happens to me. What should we do if anything happens to you? Hopefully, this will start a productive conversation about their estate planning and allow you to nudge them to get their documents in order. Because if they don't, you may be the person who pays the price. That's the show.

NYDIG, the bitcoin firm with which U.S. Bancorp originally partnered, will act as the bitcoin sub-custodian, while the bank will be the client intermediary.\nIn the service's latest iteration, U.S. Bancorp has expanded its offering to include bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Doing so means the company will now be able to \"provide full-service solutions for managers seeking custody and administration services,\" Stephen Philipson, vice chair and the head of wealth, corporate, commercial and institutional banking, said in a press release.\nU.S. Bancorp's decision to resume bitcoin custody services comes as the Trump administration continues to embrace the U.S. crypto industry.\nIn July, Congress passed the GENIUS Act, which establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins. President Donald Trump quickly signed the bill into law, marking a win for crypto enthusiasts and eliciting interest from banks such as Bank of America and Citigroup in offering their own stablecoins to facilitate digital payments.\nThe current environment in Washington, D.C., is a big change from the Biden administration, when regulators openly discouraged investing in digital assets and rejected many applications for new crypto products.\nU.S. Bancorp, the parent of U.S. Bank, launched its bitcoin custody services in 2021 in response to clients' growing demand for cryptocurrency-related offerings. Less than a year later, it stopped offering those services following the release of guidance by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which suggested banks and other entities needed to include cryptocurrencies held in custody as on-balance sheet liabilities.\nDoing so would have increased capital-related changes at U.S. Bancorp, which would have reduced the \"profit viability\" of the offerings, a U.S. Bancorp spokesperson said Wednesday in an email.\nThe SEC guidance was repealed earlier this year, shortly after Trump took office.\nU.S. Bancorp has been ahead of many other banks in exploring digital assets, but it is still evaluating the range of possible crypto-related services it could offer.", "content_hash": "f2b1cfddd9049101bc331c3d643fd7bd", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

But that assumption doesn’t always hold up.\nOne-third of Americans earning over $200,000 a year say they’re still living paycheck-to-paycheck, according to a 2024 report by PYMNTS Intelligence [1]. Some members of this group are sometimes referred to as a HENRY, or “high earner, not rich yet.”\nTurns out wealth isn’t just about how much you earn, it’s also about how you think, what you do with it and how effectively you avoid lifestyle creep.\nHere are the top five ways wealthy people approach life, career and finances differently from the rest of us.\nSubtle about their wealth\nContrary to popular belief, most multimillionaires are not cruising around in neon orange Lamborghinis or reaching for cigars stashed away in Gucci bags. Instead, many wealthy Americans try to hide their wealth rather than flaunt it.\nThis “stealth wealth” or “quiet luxury” trend was highlighted in the 2024 National Millionaires Survey by Ramsey Solutions, which found that the top three car brands preferred by the wealthy were Toyota, Honda and Ford [2].\nSimply put: Wealthy Americans stay wealthy by resisting the urge to flaunt it or spend it unnecessarily. For instance, they make sure they’re getting the best value for their money with monthly expenses, like car insurance.\nShopping around for different rates used to take hours of research, but now free services like OfficialCarInsurance.com can help find the lowest rates on your behalf.\nOfficialCarInsurance.com lets you instantly sort through policies from car insurance providers in your area, including trusted names like Progressive, GEICO and Allstate. With rates as low as $29 per month, you can find coverage that suits your needs and potentially save you hundreds of dollars per year.\nTo get started, fill in some basic information and OfficialCarInsurance.com will provide a list of the top insurers in your area within minutes. Keep in mind that you can usually switch your insurance policy at almost any time, not just at the end of the policy period. Just watch out for any early cancellation fees.\nAnother major psychological difference between the rich and the poor is their ability to delay gratification.\nIn 2016, the National Bureau of Economic Research [3] surveyed Americans over the age of 70 to see what bonus they would need to delay getting $100 by one year instead of right now. Would they need $10 or $30 to hold on until the cash came in? Those requiring less compensation were said to be better at delaying gratification, which turned out to match their actual wealth levels and financial well-being.\nIn short, the ability to resist instant gratification is a key sign of future financial success.\nIt can also be a valuable skill when it comes to investing in assets with long-term wealth potential. For example, gold is known for being a safe-haven asset as it tends to be less volatile than stocks in the long term. The yellow precious metal has also been on a bull run for much of 2025, striking highs of $3,500 per ounce in late August, according to GoldPrice [4].\nWith Priority Gold, you can invest in gold for your retirement with a gold IRA, combining the tax benefits of an IRA with the inflation-hedging benefits of investing in gold.\nWhen you make a qualifying purchase with Priority Gold, you can also receive up to $10,000 in silver for free. Silver has also been on an impressive year-to-date surge, climbing from about $30 per ounce in January to just over $40 an ounce by the end of summer, according to KITCO [5].\nAside from gold, there are plenty of other ways to invest your money to make more money. A 2024 Gallup poll [6] found that 31% of upper-income Americans believe stocks are the best investment. Only 7% said a savings account was a good investment.\nIn contrast, 20% of lower-income Americans chose savings accounts as the best investment, while just 14% preferred stocks.\nTo put this in perspective, the average APY on a standard savings account was just 0.39% in August, according to the FDIC [7].\nThis difference in strategy highlights a key mindset shift. Many lower-income households avoid risk and prefer safety, while wealthier households are more familiar with the potential rewards of riskier assets.\nAlternative assets like art can be riskier than stocks, but they can also come with greater returns.\nOver the last 10 years, art prices rose by 91%, according to the Knight Frank Wealth Report [8]. In comparison, the S&P 500 delivered 9.8% annualized returns, over the same period. This can make investing in fine art ideal, depending on how long you’re willing to hold the asset.\nUnfortunately, for many investors, there was no way to invest in art unless you wanted to spend millions buying an entire painting — not to mention sourcing it, negotiating and managing storage. Or at least, that was the case until Masterworks launched.\nMasterworks gives you the ability to invest in shares of contemporary art, including paintings by well-known artists like Banksy, Picasso and Basquiat.\nAs an investor using Masterworks, you can select the fine art you want to invest in — with every piece of artwork thoroughly vetted by their team of industry experts. Less than 3% of all artwork passes the vetting process — making each investable asset a potentially prime candidate for future appreciation.\nDebt isn’t inherently good or bad — it’s all about how it’s used.\nLower-income households are more likely to rely on expensive forms of debt to cover daily spending. About 18% of households earning between $25,000 and $49,999 used buy-now-pay-later programs in 2023, compared to just 10% for those earning more than $100,000, according to the Federal Reserve [8].\nWealthier Americans tend to use debt for productive investments, such as real estate. These assets have the potential to grow in value, while consumer goods like cars or electronics lose value over time.\nRethinking how you use debt could be a game-changer on your path to building wealth. But you don’t necessarily need to take on a mortgage to tap into the real estate market.\nFNRP has relationships with the nation’s largest essential-needs brands, such as Kroger, Walmart and Whole Foods. And since these retailers provide necessities, they tend to still perform well during times of economic volatility and can act as a hedge against inflation. This could make FNRP a good option for those looking to get into real estate for wealth generation, but who aren’t sure about committing to a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.\nYou can engage with experts, explore available deals and easily make an allocation, all in FNRP’s personalized portal.\nAnother way to take advantage of the real estate market is through Homeshares, which provides accredited investors access to the $34.9 trillion U.S. home equity market.\nHistorically, this has been the exclusive playground of institutional investors. But now, with a minimum investment of $25,000, investors can gain direct exposure to hundreds of owner-occupied homes in top U.S. cities through Homeshares’ U.S. Home Equity Fund — without the headaches of buying, owning or managing property.\nInvesting wisely in real estate and other assets is important, but it’s only part of the equation for securing your future — especially if, like HENRYs, you’re putting your all into long-term growth.\nTo truly accelerate your net worth, you need expert guidance across all areas of your wealth — and that’s where the trusted team of financial planners at Range can come in.\nFor individuals earning at least $250,000, or households making over $200,000, Range offers a smart, streamlined way to manage your full financial life — especially your real estate investments.\nOne powerful tool they offer is cost segregation analysis — a strategy that reclassifies components of your property to accelerate depreciation and boost early tax deductions. This shortens depreciation timelines — from the standard 27.5–39 years down to just 5–15 years — allowing you to claim significantly larger tax deductions sooner and keep more money in your pocket.\nBut Range delivers proactive advice across your entire financial life — not just real estate or taxes\nFrom stock options and tax strategies to real estate and big-picture planning, Range integrates it all under one roof. With a transparent, flat annual fee — no hidden costs or percentage-of-assets surprises — you get AI-powered insights and comprehensive guidance designed to scale with your wealth.\nStay in the know.

European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel told Reuters there's no need to cut rates.\nSchnabel is at the hawkish end of the spectrum, but markets don't disagree - the ECB is expected to stand pat next week and all of next year. Further rate cut hopes are fading. Could the next move, whenever it comes, actually be a rate hike?\n* China flexes muscles\nChina held its largest-ever military parade on Wednesday to mark 80 years since Japan's defeat in World War Two, with President Xi Jinping telling the world it must choose between \"peace or war, dialogue or confrontation, win-win or zero-sum.\" U.S. President Donald Trump called it a \"beautiful ceremony\".\nThe event was designed to flex China's diplomatic, economic and tech muscle too, not just its military might. As many countries agree to lopsided trade deals with the U.S., the leaders of China, Russia and India are forging closer ties between their nations.\nChina uses yuan as olive branch in U.S. trade talks\nA notable trend this year has been the often-counterintuitive market reactions to U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to upend many long-held economic norms. One of the biggest surprises has been the appreciation of China's yuan.\nThe consensus opinion at the start of the year was that Beijing would counter Washington's punitive tariffs on Chinese imports by depreciating the yuan against the dollar. This would keep Chinese goods competitive, enabling the country's exporters to compensate for any loss of U.S. business.\nOn top of that, a weaker exchange rate would, in theory, help to reflate China's economy, pulling it out of the deflationary funk it has been in since its property bubble began to burst in 2021.\nAnd, finally, a weaker yuan would be a poke in the eye to Washington. A key pillar of the Trump administration's economic agenda, articulated most artfully by adviser Stephen Miran and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, is a weaker dollar.\nBut Beijing surprised everyone.\nThe yuan did slide to an 18-year low around 7.350 per dollar during the chaos of Trump's April 2 'Liberation Day' tariffs. And combined with low domestic inflation and even deflation in recent years, the yuan's broad 'real' effective exchange rate (REER) is the weakest in over a decade.\nBut since April, it has reversed course rapidly against the dollar, trading last week at a 2025 high of 7.1260 per dollar.\nIndeed, measured by the People's Bank of China's official daily fixings or offshore market trading, the yuan just posted its biggest monthly gain against the greenback in almost a year.\nThese big moves can partly be explained by strong capital inflows. The Shanghai Composite equity index is at a 10-year high, boosted by record net inflows from hedge funds in August. And even though China's trade surplus with the U.S. may be shrinking, its global surplus in the first seven months of the year hit a new record.\nThat's a recipe for a stronger exchange rate.\nGOOD FAITH\nBut with a currency as tightly controlled as the yuan, market dynamics are not the whole story.\nThe appreciation appears to be a deliberate policy choice by Beijing, potentially hinting at its broader strategy in combating Trump's tariffs.\nOn a basic level, this doesn't make sense. Given the deflationary pressures still weighing on the Chinese economy, why do authorities appear to be actively pursuing a stronger exchange rate?\nBut when viewed as a negotiating tactic, the logic starts to become clear. The Trump administration has explicitly stated that it wants a weaker dollar – not a 'weak dollar', mind you – but a currency level that would make U.S. exports more attractive. And Beijing can help deliver this, especially given that China's currency acts as an anchor for other regional exchange rates.\nThus, the yuan's appreciation against the dollar indicates that – despite China's show of force this week – Beijing is still willing to negotiate with Washington.\n'ANTI-INVOLUTION'\nChina may also want a firmer exchange rate to help ease some domestic concerns, namely sluggish consumption.\nThe economic data coming out of China will do little to support consumer sentiment or domestic demand: the latest headline manufacturing PMI data was soft, new orders are declining, and construction has contracted at its fastest rate since the pandemic.\nPresident Xi Jinping is clearly taking this seriously. He has pledged to take steps to boost domestic consumption and technological innovation, while supporting small firms. And he has also spoken about breaking the cycle of \"involution\", a term now widely used for excess competition and overcapacity.\nAn appreciating yuan should help these efforts because, as all else being equal, a stronger currency should boost domestic demand.\nThe yuan's recent rise against the dollar is thus \"a policy push, not a market pull,\" as Goldman Sachs analysts neatly put it.\nAnd given the foreign and domestic concerns China currently faces, investors should not be surprised if Beijing keeps pushing the currency higher, at least until the latest U.S.-Sino tariff truce expires in November. A stronger yuan may be one olive branch Beijing is still willing to offer.\nWhat could move markets tomorrow?\n* Australia trade (July) * Malaysia interest rate decision * Euro zone retail sales (July) * Canada trade (July) * U.S. trade (July) * U.S. services ISM (August) * U.S. ADP private sector employment (August) * U.S. weekly jobless claims * U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing on Stephen Mirannomination to Fed Board of Governors * Federal Reserve officials scheduled to speak include NewYork Fed President John Williams, Chicago Fed President AustanGoolsbee\nWant to receive Trading Day in your inbox every weekday morning?

From the same section, shortly after the conclusion of the call, you will also be able to find a recording of this call for the next thirty days. Certain forward-looking statements will be made during this call that reflect Tilly's, Inc.'s judgment and analysis only as of today, September 3, 2025, and actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on various factors affecting Tilly's, Inc.'s business.\nAccordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. For a more thorough discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with any forward-looking statements, please see the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements that is included in our fiscal 2025 second quarter earnings release, which is furnished to the SEC today on Form 8-K, as well as our other filings with the SEC referenced in that disclaimer. Today's call will be limited to one hour and will include a Q&A session after our prepared remarks. I now turn the call over to Hezy.\nHezy Shaked: Thanks, Gar, and to all who are joining us today. First, I'd like to start by thanking the entire team for all their hard work since I reassumed the CEO position in 2024. We believe we are just beginning to see the impact of those effective efforts, and it is encouraging to see. Next, I'm excited to welcome Nate Smith as our new President and CEO. He brings extensive apparel and consumer product industry experience to Tilly's, and I'm excited for this next chapter of the Tilly's, Inc. story under his leadership. I remain highly engaged with the company, assisting Nate as he transitions into our company and thereafter.\nWould you like to say a few words to introduce yourself?\nNate Smith: Thanks, Hezy. Yes, I'm excited to be here at Tilly's, Inc., and I'm excited about the prospects I believe this business has. I just arrived two weeks ago, and I'm getting settled in, getting to know the team and our operations here. I look forward to leveraging my industry experience to continue to improve and build upon the progress being made. I'll have more to say during our next earnings call once I've had a chance to get more familiar with things, but I'm excited to be here and work with the team as we aim to drive further improvements over time.\nI'll now turn the call over to Mike to share the details about our second quarter results and third quarter outlook.\nMichael Henry: Thanks, Nate. We're excited that you're here with us, and we look forward to working with you. Now on to the details of our call today. We believe our second quarter results and start to the third quarter demonstrate that we are continuing to build incremental forward momentum as stabilization of our business continues. Our second quarter comparable net sales decrease of 4.5% was within our outlook range and represented a second consecutive quarter of sequential trend improvement from 2024. We had some significant achievements during the quarter, including meaningfully improved product margins, significantly reduced inventory levels, improved inventory aging, and reduced SG&A expenses compared to last year's second quarter.\nOur earnings per share of $0.10 beat our earnings outlook range for the quarter and represented our first profitable quarter since 2022, nearly three years ago. We believe these facts indicate that we are making progress toward improving our business, but there remains much more to do to return to profitability consistently over longer periods of time. On the marketing front, we continue to seek fun ways to build customer awareness and consideration for Tilly's, Inc., something that we were doing pretty well prior to COVID. We mentioned Travis Barker's in-store appearance at Irvine Spectrum in late May, in partnership with Hurley during our last earnings call.\nIn late July, we collaborated with the Mike Tyson Foundation, the Passion Project, and Tilly's Life Center to provide underprivileged kids with some life skill education and an opportunity to meet Mike in our Cerritos store along with some of our loyalty members and other customers. We've quadrupled our TikTok following to 169,000 followers since the start of the second quarter last year. Our content creation efforts have evolved and improved, aided by the launch of our TikTok shop just a few months ago. As we improve our product assortment, our social, digital, and in-store marketing and engagement efforts are just as important to drive interest and consideration among our customer demographic, and we continue to prioritize resources here.\nMoving on to the impact of tariffs, which remain volatile, we continue to expect a relatively modest impact on our product costs for the remainder of fiscal 2025 at this time. Our merchandising team has worked closely with all of our proprietary and branded partners to attempt to mitigate as much tariff impact on us as is reasonably possible. Currently, net impacts on our product margins for 2025 are limited to just $500,000. The impact on fiscal 2026 is likely to be larger but is not clearly determinable due to the frequent change in tariff declarations and both our and our partners' continuous mitigation efforts.\nThe impact of tariffs remains a fluid situation that can change at any moment, but this is what we know as of today. Turning to our operating results for 2025 compared to last year's second quarter, total net sales were $151.3 million, a decrease of 7.1%. We ended the second quarter with 232 total stores, a net decrease of 15 stores or 6.1% compared to a year ago. Total comparable net sales, including both physical stores and e-commerce, decreased by 4.5%. Net sales from physical stores decreased by 7.3% and represented 81.1% of total net sales compared to 81.3% last year, while e-commerce net sales decreased by 6.6% and represented 18.9% of total net sales compared to 18.7% last year.\nGross margin, including buying, distribution, and occupancy expenses, improved by 180 basis points to 32.5% of net sales compared to 30.7% last year. Product margins improved by 210 basis points compared to last year, primarily due to the combination of higher initial markups and lower markdowns as a result of operating with reduced, more current inventory. Buying, distribution, and occupancy costs deleveraged by 30 basis points despite being $2.4 million below last year in the aggregate, due to carrying these costs against lower total net sales. With 15 fewer stores than a year ago, occupancy costs decreased by $1.7 million. Distribution costs decreased by $600,000, primarily due to reduced temporary labor expenses.\nTotal SG&A expenses were $46.4 million, a decrease of $4.4 million and 50 basis points as a percentage of net sales compared to last year's second quarter. Primary expense reductions were attributable to reduced store payroll and related of $1.9 million, lower non-cash asset write-off charges of $700,000, reduced e-commerce fulfillment labor of $500,000, and lower corporate payroll and related benefits of $400,000, among other smaller items. Pretax income was $3.1 million or 2.1% of net sales compared to a pre-tax loss of $73,000 or breakeven as a percentage of net sales last year. Income tax benefit was $41,000 or 1.3% of pretax income compared to $4,000 or 6.2% of pretax loss last year.\nBoth year's income tax results include the continuing impact of a full non-cash deferred tax asset valuation allowance. This year's income tax benefit includes the refund of certain income tax credit carryforwards and state income tax carryback claims. Net income was $3.2 million or $0.10 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $69,000 or breakeven on a per-share basis last year. On our debt-free balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with total liquidity of $114 million and no borrowings at any time, comprised of cash of $51 million and undrawn borrowing capacity of $63 million under our asset-backed credit facility. Total balance sheet inventory was 14.5% lower than at the end of last year's second quarter.\nAdditionally, our unit inventory aging was more current than at the end of last year's second quarter. Looking at our start to 2025, total comparable net sales for fiscal August ended August 30, 2025, increased by 0.9% compared to last year, continuing our sequential improvement in sales trend from quarter to quarter that we have seen in fiscal 2025 so far. Comparable net sales from stores increased by 4.5%, while e-commerce net sales decreased by 12.1%. The decrease in e-commerce net sales during fiscal August was primarily attributable to a distribution decision by one of our third-party brands that removed what was $1.8 million in net sales for us during August.\nAbsent this issue, our e-commerce net sales were otherwise just shy of flat for fiscal August. Based on current and historical trends, we estimate the following ranges for 2025: net sales of approximately $134 million to $140 million, translating to a comparable net sales range of a decrease of 2% to an increase of 2%, respectively.\nSG&A of approximately $47 million, excluding any potential non-cash asset impairment charges, a near-zero effective income tax rate due to the continuing impact of a full non-cash valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, net loss of approximately $10.5 million to $6.9 million, respectively, and per-share results of a net loss of $0.35 to $0.23, respectively, an improvement compared to last year's loss per share of $0.43. We expect to end the third quarter with 230 total stores after closing four stores and opening two new stores during the quarter. This compares to 246 total stores at the end of last year's third quarter. At this time, we expect to close two additional stores in the fourth quarter.\nWe have 45 lease decisions remaining to be made by the end of the fiscal year, which may result in a few additional store closures, which are not yet confirmed. We expect to end the third quarter with a debt-free balance sheet and total liquidity of approximately $83 million to $86 million, comprised of cash and investments of approximately $20 million to $25 million and available undrawn borrowing capacity of approximately $61 million to $63 million under our credit facility, reflecting the natural ebb and flow of our liquidity following the back-to-school season and the buildup of inventory in advance of the holiday season, which is consistent with historical patterns. We expect to remain a debt-free company throughout fiscal 2025.\nIn closing, we believe our product assortment remains on trend, and we're building forward momentum toward improved business performance. We believe we are stabilizing our business, and with Nate's leadership just beginning, we're cautiously optimistic that a continuation of improved performance remains ahead. Operator, we'll now go to our Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you. If you wish to ask a question, please press star and then one on your touch-tone phone. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed, and you would like to withdraw your question, please press star then 2. And at this time, we'll pause momentarily to assemble our roster. And the first question will come from Matt Koranda with Roth Capital. Please go ahead.\nMatt Koranda: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just to start with Nate. Congrats and wanted to see if maybe you'd be willing to discuss sort of the broader opportunity that you see at Tilly's, Inc., you know, sort of primary early priorities after joining?\nNate Smith: Yeah. Thanks, Matt. So I just started really, week two here and had a great first week and dove in quickly as Hezy mentioned and met the team, spent a lot of time with the executive team. I think my initial impressions are, you know, the team has made great strides. When Hezy came back, and with Michael Henry and the executive team, they've made great strides. And so initially, you know, the emphasis should be on doubling down on those things that are working well. And then, of course, find those areas that we think we can make some course corrections. But, you know, again, it's pretty early.\nBut, I look forward to working with the team and over the course of the next few months, setting a path.\nMatt Koranda: Okay. Great. Maybe just turning to the results and the outlook questions that I had. Maybe just, first of all, really encouraging to see the sequential improvement in comp and the positive comp in August. Just wanted to see, Mike, if you could talk about the progression during the second quarter of the comps that you saw and into August? Did things improve each month? And then just anything to call out in terms of the drivers of the August positive comp between traffic and ticket? I know you already mentioned a little bit of a dynamic going on in the e-commerce channel. Any more clarity you can provide also on that in terms of product category that was in?\nMichael Henry: Alright. Pardon me. I'm writing notes as you're asking all those various questions, so I hopefully remember to address all of them. Let me know if I miss anything in particular. The Q2 cadence, you know, we did our last earnings call. We mentioned that fiscal May was a minus two. June actually slowed down to a minus 7.6, and then July bounced back to about a minus three to finish off the quarter. And then as we transitioned into August, we were just below flat in the first week, flat in the second week, and then we've been positive for each of the last two weeks to finish off the month at slightly positive overall.\nAll of our apparel departments moved positively in August. That's what's really leading our business, the apparel side of things, and all elements of apparel being positive.\nMatt Koranda: Got it. And then, just on the callout, you've mentioned in terms of the e-commerce vendor, category that was in as well.\nMichael Henry: Yeah. So not gonna name names there, given the relationships that are involved. But it was something that was peculiar to the e-commerce business and the distribution decision made by a vendor of ours that essentially took a little bit of business away from us. And gave the metrics there of the impact of that.\nMatt Koranda: Okay. Let me answer the second. That it's not only us. It's everybody else too. Only our business is very, very large.\nMichael Henry: Got it. Okay. So this is a broader system-wide sort of change made by the vendor, not necessarily something individual for Tilly's, Inc. Okay. Alright. Understood. Very good point, and it was not just Tilly's, Inc.\nMatt Koranda: Alright. Alright. Great. The outlook, I guess, for the third quarter, it looks like it's factoring in kind of a flattish comp despite the growth you saw in August. Maybe can we talk a little bit about sort of why we're embedding the assumption of a little bit of sequential erosion? Is it just some conservatism given the consumer, or, you know, what are we seeing in guess? Or how do we expect the rest of the quarter to play out? And maybe it's just a consolidation kind of back-to-school shopping that we've seen. But, just wanted to see if you could unpack the dynamic there.\nMichael Henry: Sure, Matt. So for each of the last three years, August fiscal August has been our best performance of each of those years. And then we have seen a significant slowdown once you get past what I'll refer to as the need-based period of back-to-school, we've seen a slowdown in our business during September and October relative to August, in each of the last three years. So the bottom end of our range is really contemplating if a similar sort of pattern occurs again for a fourth year in a row and is more aligned with what our year-to-date comp of about minus five, that's how you'd get to the bottom end of minus two.\nWe do believe our product assortment is definitely better and more current than it was at this time a year ago. We're operating with a lower level of inventory overall and a more current inventory than we were at this time last year. So we're cautiously optimistic that maybe we wouldn't see quite the size of fall off in September and October as we have seen in prior years, but want to be conscious that behavior has definitely been there. And we better contemplate that in terms of how we look at things going forward.\nMatt Koranda: Yeah. Okay. Makes sense. Wanted to see if you guys could talk a little bit about the gross margin and the product margin improvement that you saw in the quarter, it sounds like a fair bit of that is just being cleaner on inventory. We got higher IMU. Lower markdowns. But maybe if you could just talk about the health of the current inventory and assortment, where it stands now, it looks like efficiency is looking better down, inventories down on a per store as well as being down on a gross dollar basis. But wanted to see if you could talk about the health of inventory there.\nMichael Henry: Right. So the inventory definitely is healthier, and you just noted all the headlines about it. We purposely planned this year. As I said, I might have said two quarters ago that we were gonna run through this year with significantly reduced inventories, year-long. That was a purposeful plan. We all put our minds together and believe that we had just been buying too much to say it as plainly as I can across all product areas. And took a really hard look at our past behaviors and tried to be a lot sharper in terms of our commitments for this year.\nAnd try to push ourselves more into a chase mode on things that are working really well and not to be so overbought in things that are turning very slowly. So we think we're seeing the benefits of that. When you see inventory down 14.5%, that's with a store count that's down 6%. So as you noted, it is lower on an overall store-by-store basis, and yet we're still able to produce a positive comp in August. Meaningfully improved product margins in the second quarter. We'd expect a similar type of behavior in terms of basis point movement in product margins in the third quarter.\nSo pleased to see the fruits of that labor to try to be more efficient in our inventory management this year.\nMatt Koranda: Okay. Maybe just one other one on gross margins, if I could. With respect to tariffs and any vendor pricing or pressure that we've seen, maybe could you guys talk about, are you seeing any sort of pricing changes from vendors in response to tariffs? If so, kind of what is that looking like, and what is that sort of start to filter through the P&L?\nMichael Henry: Well, everything is filtered into the Outlook that we gave based on what we currently know. And, you know, all we can really tell you is what we're seeing in our go-forward purchase orders and the net differences in costs as well as retail prices. There are some instances where third-party brands are moving price to consumer as well as cost to us. Then the net difference doesn't end up being much at all. That's why you might be surprised at how low we're seeing that net impact of half a million dollars that I mentioned and it not being something higher, it's because there's a whole bunch of things going on. Certain brands adjust price while they adjust cost.\nWe've changed sources for certain programs with sharper costs than what we might have had a year ago. So there's a lot of different moving pieces to this. It's not a simple answer.\nMatt Koranda: Yeah. Okay. Alright. Fair enough. And then just last one, I guess, on SG&A. Good cost containment there. And it looks like, I guess, the bulk of the savings on a year-over-year basis were from store labor. Is there more to come there? I guess I've always gotten the sense that's a hard line item to move, but you guys moved it successfully. Maybe just talk a little bit about where you see opportunity for further cost containment there.\nMichael Henry: Sure. We'll continue to see some store labor savings, we believe, in both Q3 and Q4. We should see a similar dollar movement in SG&A below LY in the third quarter. Again, you've been around us for a number of years. You've heard us talk about this over the years. With all the constant increases in minimum wage, particularly here in California, where almost half of our stores reside and all our distribution operations reside. Those minimum wage impacts have an outsized impact on us relative to others that maybe aren't so heavily penetrated in California. So it has forced us to take a really hard look at our payroll matrix each and every year.\nI'll never claim that we're perfect at it or can't continue to refine it, and believe me, there's a lot of scrutiny on this. And we believe there still will be opportunity for us to improve upon that. And you'll continue to see lower store payroll dollars and some other expense savings in each quarter as we go forward for the rest of the year.\nMatt Koranda: Okay. Great. I'll leave it there, guys. I appreciate all the answers.\nOperator: This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Michael Henry for any closing remarks.

The country’s production rose by 14% in 2024 to around 820,000 tonnes.\nIn July, Mining Technology visited FQM’s Zambian operations, Kansanshi and Trident, to see first-hand the scale, challenges and potential of this cornerstone investment.\nLocated in Zambia’s North-Western Province, at the heart of the country’s copper belt, those are the country’s biggest copper producers. The Trident operation, near the city of Kalumbila, includes the Sentinel copper mine and the Enterprise nickel operation. Around 160km east, near Solwezi, the Canadian mining company also runs the Kansanshi copper mine, one of the largest in Africa.\nS3 expansion, a strategic investment\nIn 2023, FQM launched the Kansanshi S3 expansion, the third major development phase at the mine and a $2bn project to adapt operations to deeper, lower-grade sulphide ore.\nAs Mining Technology could see on the ground, the centrepiece is a new 25 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) processing plant, due to come online in the second half of 2025 and ramping up to full capacity by 2029.\nThe expansion, which also extends the South East Dome pit, will lift Kansanshi’s output to around 280,000 tonnes per annum (tpa), supporting a combined 480,000tpa of copper from Kansanshi and Sentinel by 2027, a 93,000-tonne (t) increase from 2023.\nS3 extends Kansanshi’s mine life to at least 2044, with operations continuing to 2049. So far, 1.5 billion tonnes (bt) of ore has been mined, with 3.6bt remaining.\nInvestment in the Kansanshi S3 expansion accelerated in 2024 with more than $800m spent, bringing total expenditure to $1.1bn. The remaining $900m investment is expected to follow by 2029.\nThe S3 project will also add around 900 permanent jobs across engineering, maintenance, mining, processing, smelting and support services, reinforcing its broad economic impact in Zambia.\nFQM celebrates almost 30 years in Zambia\n“The journey at S3 is only the latest chapter. Indeed, this project is part of a 30-year journey that First Quantum has shared with the people of Zambia,” said FQM CEO Tristan Pascall in a speech at the opening ceremony.\n“Over three decades, we have invested not only in world-class mining assets but also in the careers, local companies, institutions and communities that surround them,” he added.\nFQM’s presence in Zambia goes back to 1996, beginning with the acquisition of the Bwana Mkubwa copper mine in Ndola, in the Copperbelt Province, later closed in 2011 because copper reserves had been exhausted.\nIn 2001, the copper miner acquired an 80% stake in the Kansanshi project, around 400km north-west of Ndola, bringing the copper mine into commercial production by 2005. A major milestone followed in 2014 with the start of construction on the Kansanshi smelter, which reached full commercial operations the following year.\nFQM expanded its Zambian footprint in 2010 with the acquisition of Kiwara Plc, gaining control of the Trident project and its flagship asset, the Sentinel copper mine.\nConstruction of Sentinel and its processing plant began in 2012, with first concentrate produced in 2014 and commercial production achieved in November 2016. The mine has since grown steadily. Sentinel delivered 231,000t of copper in 2024 following the installation of a fourth crusher and a new conveyor system in 2022. Sentinel’s production guidance for 2025 is 200,000–230,000t.\nMeanwhile, the Enterprise nickel mine, located 12km from Sentinel, began commercial production on 1 June 2024. It represents Zambia’s largest nickel development and strengthens FQM’s diversification, adding a new strategic metal alongside its copper operations.\nKansanshi: a flagship operation\nKansanshi has been a flagship operation for FQM since 2004. The mine is owned and operated by Kansanshi Mining, a joint venture between FQM (80%) and Zambian state-owned investment company ZCCM Investments Holdings (20%).\nKansanshi’s processing circuits comprise its main pits, crushers, the existing and S3 process plants, the smelter and tailings storage facilities.\nThe plant processes 13mtpa of sulphide ore, 8mtpa of mixed ore and 7mtpa of oxide ore through dedicated milling and flotation circuits. Sulphide ore undergoes conventional flotation, while mixed and oxide ores are treated with sulphidisation and leaching. Copper is recovered as cathode via solvent extraction and electrowinning, and as anode through smelting.\nThe Kansanshi smelter, which was closed for maintenance at the time of the visit, is designed to treat concentrates from Kanshansi, Sentinel and third parties. The smelter processes copper concentrate from the mine’s flotation circuits to produce high-purity copper anodes.\nThe Kansanshi smelter has a nameplate capacity of 1.2mtpa of concentrate, producing approximately 300,000tpa of copper anode. It also generates more than 1mtpa of sulphuric acid as a by-product, which is reused in leaching operations. This integration enhances efficiency, reduces reliance on external acid supply and supports cost-effective copper recovery across the operation.\nThe Kansanshi site also produced 105,113oz of gold in 2024.\nFocus on the environment\nKansanshi is driving fleet electrification with a pilot Hitachi 220t battery-electric dump truck, the world’s largest fully electric dump truck, as seen by Mining Technology during the visit.\nThe mine is supported by a 19-unit digger fleet where electric machines now deliver 59% of productivity versus 41% from diesel. The mine operates ten trolley lines spanning 8km to cut emissions and improve efficiency, with further extensions planned.\nMining in Zambia faces risks from land, water and power competition. This is intensified by climate change, as 85% of electricity comes from hydropower.\nIn 2025, FQM is sourcing 193MW of emergency generating capacity to cover 60% of its demand, adding $80m of expenditure and raising copper costs by $0.07 per pound. To address this, the company works with state-owned power utility Zambia Electricity Supply on grid projects and renewables expansion.\nFQM has also implemented advanced environmental measures in water and waste management, including a 2021 on-site bottling plant at Sentinel and rehabilitation efforts at Trident.\nThe company also supports biodiversity conservation programmes and farming projects, helping local growers earn income from crops like chiles and beans.\nKansanshi’s tailings storage facilities are managed under the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM). The site also uses advanced monitoring systems including 140-plus piezometers, tiltmeters and fibre-optics that detect vibrations, acoustic signals and temperature shifts to flag seepage or internal erosion.\nSafety is the company’s top priority, supported by technologies such as AI fatigue monitoring and wrist-worn ReadiWatches to detect micro-sleeps, and monitor vital sign tracking in addition to road monitoring, fleet management and lightning detection systems. Despite these measures, mining remains high-risk; in June, a dump truck operator died at Sentinel, with investigations ongoing, although operations have since resumed.\nAttracting foreign investment into Zambia\nZambia, Africa’s second-largest copper producer after the Democratic Republic of Congo, accounts for around 3% of global output and ranked tenth worldwide in 2023, with FQM’s Sentinel and Kansanshi mines leading production.\nSince taking office in 2021, President Hakainde Hichilema has worked to rebuild investor confidence, which was strained under his predecessor Edgar Lungu’s mining tax regime. The president set an ambitious goal to nearly quadruple copper output from 800,000t to 3mt by 2030, backed by new strategies and the 2024 Minerals Regulation Commission Act.\nSpeaking at the launch of Kansanshi’s S3 expansion, Hichilema hailed it as “a development that reflects not only the scale of private sector confidence in Zambia but also the direction of our country under the New Dawn Government. A Zambia that is open, ready and rising.”\n“This launch is not just about the mining sector – it is about Zambia’s future. It is a signal to the world that Zambia is charting a new path, one anchored in partnerships that empower, investments that uplift and leadership that listens.”\nBeyond Zambia, FQM operates mines in Mauritania, Australia, Turkey, Finland and Panama, and is advancing projects in Argentina, Peru and Spain. With Cobre Panamá idle since November 2023, costing $15m per month, Zambia has become its core revenue driver.\n\"Kansanshi S3: Zambia’s biggest copper investment in a decade\" was originally created and published by Mining Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Furthermore, the ADP National Employment Report showed U.S. private payrolls increased less than expected in August.\nThe dollar edged higher in relatively steady trade, reflecting investor wariness of making any big moves ahead of Friday's more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report.\nThe dollar strengthened 0.33% to 148.585 against the Japanese yen.

An extra $30 per net ton will be added each year through 2028.\nFor Chinese-built vessels, which are staple at companies like Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), fees will amount to $18 per net ton, or roughly equivalent to $120 per container. That will increase in $5-per-ton annual increments over the next three years.\nThese fees were revised downward from proposed levies that were initially harsher for all carriers with Chinese-built ships.\nOOCL and Cosco Shipping, which is a Chinese state-owned enterprise, were always anticipated to be the ocean carriers most impacted by the fees. After the USTR dialed back the fees in April due to concerns from U.S. businesses, Cosco called them “discriminatory” measures that distorted fair competition among container shipping companies.\nAnalysts have expected Cosco and OOCL to minimize the fees in some way via the Ocean Alliance vessel-sharing agreement, in which the firms are likely to adjust their network by assigning CMA CGM and Evergreen to more trans-Pacific, U.S.-bound sailings.\nBut Ocean Alliance ties aside, Cosco’s fleet is likely to see some impact.\nIn the first half of 2025, 18 percent of Cosco Shipping’s total cargo volume (including OOCL) sailed on the trans-Pacific trade lane, well below the volume moved between Asian countries (34 percent). Another 21 percent of cargo volume was shipped between separate ports on Mainland China, the liner said in its interim report.\nHowever, the trans-Pacific route brings in a much higher share of revenue to Cosco. The trade lane generated 29 percent of container shipping revenue, just beating out the intra-Asia lane (28 percent) for the top spot.", "content_hash": "067078012a9b8cba3959385a79be93ec", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

A few technology companies are well-positioned to benefit from these massive investments, making them compelling long-term picks for retail investors.\nHere are two such high-quality growth stocks that can generate exceptional long-term returns for shareholders and are worth considering now.\n1. Nvidia\nOnce known primarily for its gaming GPUs, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is now increasingly seen as a key driver of the modern artificial intelligence (AI) economy. The company's full-stack platform, which includes GPUs, CPUs, networking hardware, and proprietary Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) software stack, powers cloud data centers, sovereign AI projects, and enterprise AI projects worldwide.\nNvidia expects global AI infrastructure spending to reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. This includes the AI infrastructure required to support massive training and inference compute for reasoning agentic AI, sovereign AI projects, enterprise AI, physical AI, and robotics. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity, especially after the launch of the Blackwell architecture systems (GB300 NVL72), which are 10x more power efficient compared to previous Hopper architecture systems. Since power limitation and excessive costs are major challenges for data centers worldwide, the power-efficient Blackwell systems are being increasingly adopted by cloud service providers and enterprises to train and run next-generation AI models.\nNvidia's software ecosystem has also played a critical role in building a sticky customer base. Used by almost 5 million developers and 40,000 companies, CUDA helps improve the efficiency and performance of AI workloads -- thereby locking clients in Nvidia's ecosystem. Nvidia's networking solutions, such as Spectrum-X Ethernet and InfiniBand, are also becoming essential for building massive AI clusters.\nNvidia also differentiates itself from its peers with its rapid pace of innovation, releasing new architecture while strengthening its customer relationships. The company is already working on Rubin architecture to follow the successful rollout of Blackwell systems.\nNvidia's recent financial performance underlines its dominant position. The company delivered $46.7 billion in revenue, representing a 56% year-over-year increase, in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended July 27, 2025). Data center revenues increased 56% year over year to $41.1 billion, driven by the robust adoption of Blackwell systems and growth in networking. Gross margin was 72.4%, while operating income surged 53% year over year to $28.4 billion. The company also returned $10 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, and expanded its authorization by an additional $60 billion, signaling confidence in long-term growth.\nWhile Nvidia's stock is valued richly at 39.5 times forward earnings, the premium seems justified for a company with unmatched scale and technological edge in the booming AI market. Hence, the stock appears to be a brilliant buy-and-hold option for long-term investors.\n2. Palantir\nEnterprise software giant Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR) is at the forefront in helping organizations make faster and more accurate data-driven decisions. Once known primarily as a contractor for the defense sector, Palantir's AI-powered solutions are now used extensively by both government and commercial clients. This has positioned it effectively as a long-term beneficiary of the ongoing AI revolution.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended June 30, 2025), Palantir's quarterly revenues surpassed $1 billion for the first time in history, a 48% year-over-year increase. The company has also increased its profitability, with adjusted operating margin rising to 46%, nearly 300 basis points higher than the upper end of its guidance. The company's free cash flow also reached $569 million, implying a 57% margin.\nThe U.S. commercial segment has become a key growth driver, driven by the strong adoption of the company's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). U.S. commercial revenues were up 93% year-over-year to $306 million in the second quarter. The U.S. Army also awarded Palantir a 10-year enterprise contract worth up to $10 billion. This multi-year contract has dramatically improved the company's revenue visibility.\nPalantir's AIP differentiates itself from other enterprise AI solutions with its ontology-based architecture (mapping digital assets to physical assets). AIP integrates large language model capabilities with Palantir's ontology framework, making it more accurate, cost-effective, and reliable in resolving client challenges. Customers are seeing measurable impact -- from cutting onboarding times at banks from days to seconds to reducing fraud detection cycles from months to moments. This approach has created a sticky customer base, as evidenced by its 128% net dollar retention rate in the second quarter.\nPalantir, however, is trading at costly levels. At more than 277 times forward earnings, Palantir trades at one of the highest multiples in the enterprise software sector. However, the stock can continue to grow even higher as the company delivers explosive top-line growth, achieves rising profitability, and secures long-term revenue contracts.\nWith $6 billion in cash on hand, ongoing buybacks, and a growing moat in AI infrastructure, Palantir may be a good pick for long-term investors. Investors can also opt for a dollar-cost averaging strategy and gradually build a position in this expensive but high-quality stock over a longer period of time.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

This led to speculation that the dominance held by a few leading tech companies could be ending, as a forced Google breakup could lead to similar action against its peers such as Apple.\nSince Google appears to have avoided severe regulatory action, though, investors have less cause for concern.\nWhat it means: Considered the most significant antitrust case in decades, the landmark ruling carries major implications for both Google and the broader tech sector.\nLike Google, Apple has faced accusations of engaging in monopolistic practices, such as having an illegal hold over the smartphone market. The fact Google has avoided a forced breakup suggests that other companies are likely to do the same.\nThis may be seen as a bullish indicator for tech stocks beyond just Alphabet and Apple, as many of the sector's other big names have faced similar antitrust accusations.\n\"In our view, the benign remedy ruling is a significant positive for GOOGL shares and should alleviate the overarching regulatory overhang,\" Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Deepak Mathivanan said in a recent report.\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "content_hash": "954760a8e940bf67e5551828b3f4afb8", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Email pr@fool.com\nFull Conference Call Transcript\nAmit Berry: Good afternoon. And welcome to C3.ai, Inc.'s earnings call for the 2026Q1, which ended on July 31, 2025. My name is Amit Berry, and I lead investor relations at C3.ai, Inc. With me on the call today are Tom Siebel, Executive Chairman, Stephen Ehigian, Chief Executive Officer, and Hitesh Lath, Chief Financial Officer. After the market closed today, we issued a press release with details regarding our first quarter results, as well as a supplemental to our results. Both of which can be accessed through the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.c3.ai. This call is being webcast and a replay will be available on our IR website following the conclusion of the call.\nDuring today's call, we will make statements related to our business that may be considered forward-looking under federal securities laws. These statements reflect our views only as of today, and should not be considered representative of our views as of any subsequent date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements or outlook. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.\nFor a further discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, as it may be supplemented by other filings and reports we make with the SEC from time to time, including our quarterly report on Form 10-Q that will be filed for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2025. All financial results will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures to the extent reasonably available is included in our press release.\nFinally, at times in our prepared remarks, in response to your questions, we may discuss metrics that are incremental to our usual presentation to give greater insight into the dynamics of our business and our quarterly results. Please be advised that we may or may not continue to provide this additional detail in the future. And with that, let me turn the call over to Hitesh.\nHitesh Lath: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I will share our financial results and provide additional color on our business. All figures are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. Total revenue for the quarter was $70.3 million, a decrease of 19% year-over-year. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $60.3 million, representing 86% of total revenue. Revenue from the sale of software licenses that are demonstration versions of C3.ai, Inc. applications was $17.9 million during the quarter, which was sequentially lower by $15.9 million.\nWe sell these licenses at the request of our distribution partners to enable them to demonstrate our software effectively to their customers and at the request of our large strategic customers to enable them to accelerate C3.ai, Inc. application adoption across their companies. Professional services revenue was $10 million, of which $8.7 million was revenue from engineering services, or PES. Professional services represent 14% of total revenue during the quarter. Our subscription and PES revenue combined was $69 million and accounted for 98% of total revenue. I'll now walk you through some of our strategic customer wins this quarter. Nucor has expanded its commitment with C3.ai, Inc. in a multiyear partnership to build an enterprise-wide AI program across their facilities.\nWe are supporting and optimizing day-to-day planning, inventory, and scheduling decisions, and now expanding to additional plants and use cases. Comerica, a global leader in chemicals, launched its first enterprise-scale AI program with C3.ai, Inc. After initial success improving yield in its salt business, Comerica is now scaling to 100 assets and multiple use cases, the start of a company-wide AI transformation. HII, America's largest military shipbuilder, is expanding its partnership with C3.ai, Inc. to accelerate throughput at Ingalls and Newport News. Initial deployments cut complex shipbuilding timelines, and we are now scaling these AI capabilities across HII shipyards to strengthen US Navy fleet readiness.\nThe US Army Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office is deploying a contested logistics application built on the C3 Agentic AI platform to support frontline vehicles in high-risk environments. This system applies agentic and generative AI to enhance sustainment, readiness, and decision speed in contested environments. I'll now move on to the rest of the financial results. Non-GAAP gross profit for the quarter was $36.3 million, and non-GAAP gross margin was 52%. Non-GAAP gross margin for professional services remained high at over 80%. Non-GAAP operating loss for the quarter was $57.8 million. Non-GAAP net loss for the quarter was $49.8 million, and non-GAAP net loss per share was $0.37. Our net cash used in operating activities was $33.5 million.\nFree cash flow for the quarter was negative $34.3 million. We continue to be well-capitalized and closed the quarter with $711.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. During the first quarter, we signed 28 initial production deployments or IPDs. At the end of the quarter, we had cumulatively signed 374 IPDs, of which 266 are still active. This means they are either in their original three to six-month term, extended for some duration, converted to ongoing subscription or consumption contract, or are currently being negotiated for conversion to ongoing subscription or consumption contract.\nNon-GAAP gross margin declined this quarter to 52% primarily due to a higher mix of IPD-related costs, a lower mix of demonstration license revenue, and PES revenue, and lower economies of scale. As compared to fiscal 2025, we expect to continue to see moderated gross margins in the near term due to a higher mix of IPDs, which carry a greater cost of revenue during the initial production phase of the customer life cycle due to our investments in expanding our support capacity and lower economies of scale. Now I'll move on to our guidance for the next quarter. Our revenue guidance for 2026Q2 is $72 million to $80 million.\nOur guidance for non-GAAP loss from operations for 2026Q2 is $49.5 million to $57.5 million. Given the appointment of our new Chief Executive Officer and the recent restructuring of the sales and services organizations, we are withdrawing our previous guidance. We plan on providing guidance for the 2026Q3 and full year fiscal 2026 when we announce our financial results for the 2026Q2. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Siebel: Thank you, Hitesh. And good afternoon, everyone. As Hitesh reported, the financial results of the first quarter were completely unacceptable. And completely unacceptable in virtually every respect. I've given this a lot of thought as to, you know, what the root cause of this is. Okay? Is there a market? The market is huge. Is there some new competitor that changed the competitive dynamics of the space? There is not. Is there some secular change in the market that we haven't seen before? There is not. The fact of the matter is that it boiled down to poor sales execution and poor resource coordination.\nIt's clear that the new leadership that we brought into the organization in the guy globally in sales and service in the service organization, in EMEA, in federal, in North America, kind of mid-quarter, and it caused confusion in the sales process. As I have previously announced, I ran into some unanticipated health issues, and as a result of these health issues, I was unable to participate as actively as I used to in the sales processes and the coordination of resources necessary to make these sales processes successful and come to closure. In hindsight, it's clear that my active involvement in that sales process had a greater impact than any of us knew.\nThe good news is that we have completely restructured our sales and service organizations globally. We have brought in new, highly experienced leadership across the board, okay, to drive growth, to drive customer satisfaction. Even better, consistent with our announcement last July, we have completed the search, and we have appointed a new Chief Executive Officer in the person of Stephen Ehigian, who is highly experienced and well-equipped to drive the details of this business, to coordinate resources, and to accelerate growth.\nIn the sales and service organizations, we have combined these organizations under a new leader in the person of a Chief Commercial Officer to bring a more seamless experience focused on delivering value for each and every one of our customers. In addition to the Chief Commercial Officer, we've brought in a new General Manager of EMEA, we brought in a new Group Vice President for North American operations, and we brought significant leadership into the federal business operations. By combining the sales and service organizations into a cohesive whole, we are assuring a focus on delivering rapid economic benefits to each and every one of our customer engagements to ensure their continued success.\nAs we entered Q2, we have installed new leadership across the board. We have reorganized our sales and service organizations with a tightly integrated detailed execution plan going forward where everybody knows where they sit, what their job responsibilities are, and we've assured that everybody has the resources to do their job. We have a product that is unmatched in technical sophistication and functionality. We have over 131 enterprise AI applications in the market. I believe we have the highest levels of customer satisfaction as measured by net promoter scores in the application software industry. We have a huge and rapidly growing addressable market opportunity. We have the leadership in place, and we are positioned to grow.\nWe are in position to gain market share, and we are in a position to assure the success of each and every one of our customer engagements. An important development in Q1 was the introduction of our strategic integrator program. This is a software OEM program whereby we are licensing the C3 Agentic AI platform to others, enabling them to design, develop, provision, and operate the industry and domain-specific applications for their markets. We're finding that the strategic integrator program is being well received by OEMs, systems integrators, into the defense, intelligence, and civilian government communities. And we expect this to be a large and rapidly growing line of business for C3.ai, Inc. going forward.\nThe use of the Agentic AI platform enables them to use all of the assets that they've developed in the last couple of decades. Be these machine learning models. And so it's an entirely open that allows them to use any of the capabilities they have, any new capabilities that the market may bring going forward since an entirely open model-driven architecture enabling complete flexibility going forward and avoiding vendor lock-in. It's difficult to overestimate the scale of the generative AI, agentic AI opportunity that is before us.\nAs of the end of the first quarter, we're involved in approximately 60 large-scale customer engagements in state and local government, in manufacturing, in federal government, in defense, intelligence, manufacturing, what have you. Many of you are familiar with the MIT report that shows that order of 95% of these LLM projects run into a dead end and are unsuccessful. Our experience is that the majority of our LLM deployments are successful across industries and across use cases. The reason for the success is the combination of these generative free chain transformers with the C3 Agentic AI platform solves all the hobgoblins with the voter as with generative AI.\nThese hobgoblins include data exfiltration, cybersecurity risk, hallucination, inability to enforce data access controls, the inability to take advantage of omni-modal integration, all of these problems are solved by C3 generative AI, resulting in a very, very high success rate associated with our projects. Q1 2025 was our nineteenth quarter operating as a public company. This is the first quarter into which we have missed our revenue guidance. Know that we take that very seriously. And we will take that seriously going forward. Candidly, there is no excuse for the economic results that we delivered in the first quarter. Okay? That being said, going forward, our objective remains the same.\nWe're here to establish and maintain a market leadership position globally in enterprise AI applications. Not in infrastructure, not in semiconductors, not in machine learning models, not in professional services implementations. Okay? We're here to establish a market leadership position in enterprise AI software, both with the C3 Agentic AI platform and with the enterprise AI application footprint we have in place and will be expanding. We have tried, tested, and proven products. We have incredibly sophisticated architecture in the Agentic AI platform. We're establishing clear leadership in Agentic AI, a concept for which you know that we hold the patents. We have tried, tested, and proven executive leadership in place. We have highly satisfied customers.\nWe have a large and expansive addressable market opportunity before us that some estimate approaches $2 trillion a year. Okay? And we are geared up to grow our product footprint, grow our market share, increase our market penetration, and operate a rapidly growing cash-positive profitable business. Going forward, I will continue to remain deeply engaged in the business now in the role as Executive Chairman. In that role, I will particularly focus on strategic partner relationships, strategic customer relationships, and keep an eye on direction and product strategy going forward. I'm most enthusiastic to announce the appointment of Stephen Ehigian as the new Chief Executive Officer of C3.ai, Inc.\nStephen brings a superlative educational background, a wealth of industry experience, having started and built and grown two successful AI companies that he sold to Salesforce. Stephen is also an experienced and accomplished public sector leader, having served as President Trump's appointee as the Acting Administrator of the General Services Administration, where Stephen was responsible for performing the General Services Administration's performing the acquisition activities of all the divisions of the federal government, and driving President Trump's AI strategy across the federal government.\nOn behalf of the board of directors of C3.ai, Inc., the executive leadership of C3.ai, Inc., and the, I know, 11 or 1,200 employees of C3.ai, Inc., whatever that number may be, I can tell you we're all enthusiastic about working closely with Stephen in his new leadership role. To ensure that he is successful in bringing more creativity to the process, more energy to the process, more drive to the process, as we accelerate growth, accelerate market penetration, and accelerate market leadership in enterprise AI. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for your time. And now I'll turn this back to Hitesh to field your questions.\nHitesh Lath: Thank you, Tom. Operator, could you please open the line for questions?\nOperator: Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Roddy Sultan with UBS. Your line is open.\nRoddy Sultan: Awesome. Thank you. First for Tom, you know, your involvement in the sales process has obviously been very critical here. I mean, is there any way to more concretely understand how involved you're planning on being in the sales process going forward? And what you're doing to ensure a smooth handoff to Stephen and the new sales leadership?\nTom Siebel: I am here to do everything I can to ensure that Stephen is successful. Okay? And so now do we have a new, you know, an entire new layer of senior leadership in the company who are tried, tested, and proven at selling enterprise AI globally. And I suspect with Stephen's leadership, they're gonna be enormously successful. That being said, okay, I will continue to be involved as necessary, okay, in monitoring that process and assisting that process to ensure that this transition goes very smoothly. And we dramatically ramp up the sales and service capacity globally.\nRoddy Sultan: Awesome. And then second for Hitesh. Obviously, a lot of moving parts in the quarter. What are you seeing that's giving you confidence in the Q2 guide? And then as about Q3 and Q4, like what is the right starting point to think about that sort of back half outlook? Any sort of building blocks would be helpful as we calibrate numbers.\nHitesh Lath: Yeah. Sure, Roddy. Q2 guidance is based on the sales activity we've seen in the month of August, as well as our review of sales pipeline for the rest of the quarter with the new sales leadership. As it relates to periods beyond Q2, while we're not providing any guidance at this point, we note that most analysts who have updated their revenue forecast for the year are forecasting fiscal 2026 revenue ranging from $290 million to $300 million. And at this point, I would not argue against any number within that range. As it relates to profitability, we acknowledge our performance in Q1 has put us behind. But we remain committed to achieving non-GAAP profitability and free cash flow.\nWe are still bullish about the business, as Tom said, and we will get to profitability and free cash flow, with the right scale, and that is a matter of time.\nRoddy Sultan: Awesome. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Patrick Walravens with Citizens. Your line is open.\nPatrick Walravens: Hey, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. This is Nick on for Pat. Tom, one quick one for you. You guys closed 40 partner-led deals this quarter. How do you see the mix of partner-led versus direct sales evolving?\nTom Siebel: That's a great question. I think something like Amit, correct me. Is it 80% or 90%? 90 this quarter. The 90% of the business that we closed this quarter was with partners. Particularly Azure and AWS and GCP. And McKinsey Quantum Black, and you can expect that our investment in those partnerships going forward is gonna be big time.\nI think there are, you know, what certainly, without quoting a number, there are certainly tens of thousands of salespeople at Azure alone, and we are amping up our go-to-market activities with Microsoft, with AWS, GCP in a big way globally, and so we would hope we're going from, say, hundreds of that we're involved in today where we're joint selling and we hope that will go to soon to thousands. So that is a major, major advantage that we have, this partner ecosystem. And we fully intend to exploit that advantage.\nPatrick Walravens: Great. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, I heard Stephen was in the room. If I could ask him a quick one, that would be fantastic. You know, how did Stephen, great to meet you. Looking forward to working with you. How did you choose C3.ai, Inc., and why was it a compelling opportunity?\nStephen Ehigian: Yeah. Well, first, the market opportunity here for enterprise AI is enormous. Every company, every government is exploring how to transition away from testing and experimenting with AI to actually rolling out across their core operations and workflows. Exciting for me is C3.ai, Inc. has the technology platform and applications that customers need today. Their technology is being deployed across some of the most valuable customers in the world into the most challenging environments. So for me, on top of all that, the ability to learn from Tom Siebel, who invented this entire enterprise AI market, as well as with the extraordinary team here, was, honestly, an easy decision to say yes to.\nPatrick Walravens: Awesome. Thank you very much. Looking forward to working with you.\nStephen Ehigian: Likewise. Thank you.\nOperator: And one moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Matthew Calitri with Needham and Co. Your line is open.\nMatt Calitri: Hi, guys. This is Matt Calitri on for Mike Cikos over at Needham. Thanks for taking our questions. Tom, how would you weight the underperformance this quarter between sales disruption and your impact on the sales process?\nTom Siebel: I think it was a combination of both, but I would put it, you know, probably 70% sales disruption and 30% my not being as involved in the details as I have previously been. And, you know, I think that, you know? So those are the facts. And, you know, the quarter is the quarter was dreadful. Okay? And now we need to pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and get on business, which is exactly what we're gonna do.\nMatt Calitri: Understood. And then looking at the execution steps, how would you categorize them as far as assigning pilots or converting them in contracts? What exactly were you seeing there?\nTom Siebel: It's all of the above, Matt. I mean, there are a lot of new people involved. There is new leadership involved. I think, you know, when you do that, you know, sometimes channels could cross a little bit and these things get confused. And, you know, we were, you know, we were, you know, driving the car down the road and replacing the engine, the transmission, and the wheels at the same time. And, you know, the guy who used to drive the car wasn't there. So it was a bad quarter. It happens. I mean, come on. I was at Oracle in 1989 when Oracle had its first miss.\nI think that the stock went from 27 to 3 as I recall. And it was the end of the world. Well, since then, as you know, Oracle has missed 34 quarters since, still not the end of the world. And, NVIDIA has missed 10. Amazon has missed 23. Salesforce has missed a few, certainly six months ago and twelve months ago. And today, nobody remembers any of that. Six months from now, nobody will remember this because we're gonna be rocking.\nMatt Calitri: Understood. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. That is all the time we have for Q&A today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Siebel for any closing remarks.\nTom Siebel: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your time this afternoon. We really appreciate your attention. You know, keep your eye on the screen. There's gonna be a lot of things happening at C3.ai, Inc., and it's exciting. We're encouraged, and we are going for it, people. So stay tuned. And thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's program. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.\nTrump’s Tariffs Could Create $1.5 Trillion AI Gold Rush\nThe Motley Fool’s analysts are tracking a massive shift in U.S. tech.

Email pr@fool.com\nFull Conference Call Transcript\nAJ Gosselin: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss ChargePoint Holdings, Inc.'s Second Quarter Fiscal 2026 Earnings Results. This call is being webcast and can be accessed on the Investors section of our website at investors.chargepoint.com. With me on today's call are Rick Wilmer, our Chief Executive Officer, and Manzi Katani, Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, we issued our press release announcing results for the quarter ended July 31, 2025, which can be found on our website. We would like to remind you that during the conference call, management will be making forward-looking statements, including our outlook for 2026.\nThese forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements after the call. For a more detailed description of certain factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on June 6, 2025, and our earnings release posted today on our website and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K.\nAlso, please note that we use certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which we reconcile to GAAP in our earnings release and for certain historical periods in the investor presentation posted on the Investors section of our website. And finally, we will be posting a transcript of this call to our investor relations website under the Quarterly Results section. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wilmer.\nRick Wilmer: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining the ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. second-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings call. We are pleased to report solid results for the quarter. Second quarter revenue was $99 million, landing at the top of our guidance range. Non-GAAP gross margin improved sequentially, with Q2 results coming in at 33%. This figure is notable as the highest gross margin we have reported since becoming a public company, and we successfully mitigated tariffs to achieve it. Cash management was exceptional, with our ending balance at $195 million, only $2 million below Q1's close, largely driven by structural OpEx changes we have been making over the last year.\nOur collaboration with GM is also progressing, with nearly a dozen sites and more than 50 new fast charging ports and many more scheduled to launch this year. Overall, ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. now manages over 363,000 ports, including more than 37,000 DC fast chargers and 123,000 located in Europe. Globally, ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. drivers can access nearly 1,300,000 charging ports. We achieved this performance despite the uncertainty, particularly in North America. Within the US, passenger EV sales growth slowed to a 3% year-over-year increase. The forthcoming expiration of the Consumer 30D EV tax and 30C alternative fuel vehicle refueling credit are also sources of concern for future EV adoption.\nAlong with the evolving tariff landscape, this has translated into delays for major projects we have won extended expansion build-outs, but no project cancellations. So we are making solid progress on our path, as we saw over the past year, to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA breakeven. Considering these delays and their impact on revenue, we have determined we will be best positioned if we push out our EBITDA breakeven beyond this year. This is to ensure we can fund product innovation and commercialization efforts, which we expect to drive durable revenue growth. Uncertainty aside, we believe our go-to-market strategy and innovation put us on a firm footing to drive growth, win market share, and hit EBITDA positive in the coming quarters.\nRegarding our go-to-market strategy, we are rapidly operationalizing our partnership with Eaton, and that work will be largely completed this quarter. Since this partnership was announced in May, we continue to build confidence that together we will accelerate the deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure across North America and Europe. We have already introduced our co-branded product, expanded our channel reach, accessed new strategic accounts, and started generating new streams of revenue together. We are delivering innovation, which has been accelerated and expanded because of our partnership with Eaton.\nThe express line of DC charging solutions powered by Eaton and announced last week combines the strength of both companies to deliver more power in less space with massive scalability along with the easiest and fastest installation. It features Eaton hardware for grid connectivity plus B2G capabilities. The net result will be substantially lower CapEx and operating costs and faster deployment timelines. It will change the game in terms of the economics of DC fast charging for our customers. We are also co-developing a bidirectional home charging solution with advanced energy management.\nThe integration of ChargePoint Holdings, Inc.'s Flex Plus chargers with Eaton's Able Edge smart panels and breakers enables vehicles to supply backup power to homes and also automatically adjust EV charging based on the home energy usage. To allow homeowners to install EV charging, the behind-the-meter insights will help utilities manage grid stress and transformer loads. We expect this synergistic type of innovation will deliver real value to homeowners, utilities, and auto OEMs while at the same time driving market share gains. Both the new express line of DC solutions and flex product line are designed to not only deliver market differentiation but also cost-effectiveness. We expect both product lines to have a positive impact on our hardware gross margins.\nMoving to markets, Europe seems promising going forward. Roadmotion reports a 26% year-over-year increase in European EV sales during the first half of the year, which is a strong indicator of future charging demand in Europe. We believe the current infrastructure cannot support such growth. With the innovation and new products we are delivering, we will be well situated to capture much of this demand. In summary, despite an uncertain environment causing delays, we delivered strong results. We are operationalizing our strategic Eaton partnership, which accelerates innovation and expands our reach. We are delivering game-changing products poised to strengthen our market share and profitability. Internally, the team continues to execute with excellence.\nOur long-term thesis remains intact, validated by the strength of our pipeline, the positive reaction to our new products, and the new partners and customers we are actively signing. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Manzi Katani.\nManzi Katani: Thanks, Rick. As a reminder, please see our earnings press release where we reconcile our non-GAAP results to GAAP. Our principal exclusions are stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, and certain costs related to restructuring settlements, and nonrecurring legal expenses. Revenue for the second quarter was $99 million at the high end of our guidance range, sequentially higher than the prior quarter and down 9% year-on-year. Network charging systems at $50 million accounted for 51% of second quarter revenue. Subscription revenue at $40 million was 40% of total revenue, 5% higher sequentially and up 10% year-on-year as our total installed base continued to increase. Other revenue at $8 million was 8% of total revenue.\nTurning to verticals, which we report from a billings perspective, second quarter billings percentages were commercial 75%, fleet 11%, residential 10%, and other 4%. From a geographic perspective, North America made up 84% of revenue, and Europe was 16%. This was relatively consistent with the first quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 33%, growing by three percentage points sequentially and eight percentage points year-on-year. This is attributable to higher hardware margins, higher subscription margins, as well as subscription revenue growing as a percentage of total revenue. I would like to point out that this was our seventh straight quarter of sequential non-GAAP gross margin improvement. Hardware gross margin increased 1% sequentially despite the impact of higher tariffs.\nSubscription margin continued to grow, reaching another record high of 61% on a GAAP basis and was even higher on a non-GAAP basis, reflecting economies of scale and continued optimization of support costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $59 million, up 3% sequentially and down 12% year-on-year. The small sequential increase this quarter was mainly due to a temporary increase in R&D spend as a result of higher NRE and contractor spend related to the development of our recently announced new AC and DC charging product architecture. This increase will persist in the third quarter, but we should see the spend gradually coming down in Q4 and then further reducing next year.\nWe are continuing to closely manage operating expenses, balancing investments that we believe will lead to significant future growth and margin expansion while also being mindful of current constraints. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss was $22 million. This compares with a loss of $23 million in the prior quarter and a loss of $34 million in the second quarter of last year. Stock-based compensation was $18 million, flat to last quarter and down from $19 million in the second quarter of last year. Our inventory balance remained virtually flat to the prior quarter at $212 million.\nWhile this balance did not decrease due to existing commitments with contract manufacturers, we continue to drive towards a gradual reduction in inventory over the next few quarters, which will free up cash. Speaking of cash, we ended the quarter with $195 million of cash on hand versus $196 million in the prior quarter, resulting in cash usage of less than $2 million. This compares with $49 million of cash usage in Q2 of last year and $29 million in Q1 this year. We have been able to significantly reduce cash burn over the past few quarters mainly due to spend reductions and working capital management.\nOur $150 million revolving credit facility remains undrawn, and we have no debt maturities until 2028. Turning to guidance, for 2026, we expect revenue to be between $90 million to $100 million. While we continue to guide cautiously given the challenging and constantly changing macro backdrop, delivering revenue growth, and ultimately reaching non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA breakeven and generating positive cash flow remain our primary focus areas.\nAs Rick mentioned, given the macroeconomic headwinds, the trajectory of revenue growth required to get to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA breakeven in a quarter will take longer to materialize than this year, but we expect to continue to make progress towards profitability and reducing cash burn, which we have managed to do well over the past year. We will now open the call for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: We will now begin the question and answer session. We also ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Your first question comes from the line of Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nColin Rusch: Thanks so much, guys. Now, can you just talk a little bit about what the trajectory is on OpEx? Obviously, R&D is remaining at some elevated levels along with G&A. Just want to get a sense of how that should trend over the balance of this fiscal year.\nManzi Katani: Yeah. Hi, Colin. I will take that one. Yes. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, OpEx is slightly higher than Q1 because of some investment we did on the R&D front. We have spent on prototyping as we are releasing these new products and releasing the new AC and DC architecture. Those are temporary one-time, if you will, NRE costs. And then we also had elevated expenses on the contractor side this quarter. Now we expect this to persist in the next quarter because we are really in the middle of releasing all of these products. There is a lot of activity going on around that. But I think it should come down gradually in Q4.\nAnd then we will manage it better next year.\nColin Rusch: Great. And then just from a sales perspective, you know, we all know what is going on in North America and then, you know, kind of a digestion of the new policy. But I am curious, you know, in Europe, other geographies where you are seeing any potential higher growth opportunities, you know, particularly with this Eaton relationship and global footprint there? Are there other areas that you see, you know, the products ending up that could surprise us in some way around the growth trajectory?\nRick Wilmer: Yeah. I think hey, Colin. I think the overall macro conditions in Europe are looking better right now than they are in North America. Hopefully, things will start to clarify in North America once we get through the tax credit expiration in September. But in Europe, a lot of the products that are driving some of the incremental OpEx spend that Manzi alluded to are targeted at Europe, where we did not have solutions to serve those use cases in the past. So the flex product line that we have announced a month or so ago will launch in Europe. Here soon. In fact, we have now got inventory position in Europe to begin fulfilling early sales.\nAnd then the new DC Express architecture that we also announced will be targeted at Europe, where in the past we have not had a DC product that was developed by us available in Europe. So we are as we move forward into the new year. It is a combination of a more positive macro environment and new products to serve that market that we believe are quite differentiated.\nColin Rusch: Great. Thanks so much, guys. I will hop back in queue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Dendrinos with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nChris Dendrinos: Hi. Good evening, and thank you. I guess maybe to start here, just wanted to follow-up on that question in regards to the AC architecture or the new AC launch in Europe. Can you maybe speak to the initial kind of interest levels there? And mentioned inventory? I guess, maybe what is the channel like, and what has been the response from the dealerships? Dealer channel there? Thanks.\nRick Wilmer: Yeah. So it is very early, Chris. We have just moved the first bit of inventory into Europe. We have had successful early access customers. And we are beginning to build up our channel interest and target our end customer base in three major geographies in Europe. The UK, France, and Germany. We have got all the approvals to serve all the markets, all those different product configurations based on the requirements in each of those major European geos. So we will be really getting clarity on the overall demand that we expect early on with this new product as we move through this quarter, but early indications have been positive.\nChris Dendrinos: Got it. Okay. And then, you know, maybe as a follow-up here, you know, we are only, I guess, a month or two removed from the passage of the OB3, but just kind of thinking about the demand outlook in sort of, call it, lower for longer outlook in the US. I guess, how are you thinking about, you know, the company's positioning here just given the changes in that dynamic? Are you financially in the right place? Do you need to change personnel or strategy at all or slow down maybe some of the development going forward? Thanks.\nRick Wilmer: No. I think just the opposite. I mean, within the constraints of our OpEx envelope, I really believe the path to success is to deliver innovation to the market, which we have clearly been doing as we have moved through the year with some of the more significant innovations just announced recently that we mentioned a minute ago. You know, the market, this whole industry went through a hype cycle. It collapsed in 2023. I think there is going to be ongoing demand for EVs. There are indications of that happening.\nI think I have seen data from Cox that July will be a record sales for EVs in North America, largely as a result of the tax credit expiration coming up this month. But what that tells us is that there is interest in EVs and demand for EVs if the price point is right. And I think we are seeing a lot of good innovation on the vehicle side. You can look at Ford's new platform announcement. Slate Auto, they announced their new vehicle.\nThere is just a bunch of things happening out there that are going to bring the selection up and the price down on EVs, which we believe will drive overall demand for EVs and thus charging going forward into the future. This down cycle is obviously putting pressure on everybody. And I think the industry is going to ultimately consolidate as a result of that. And I believe we are in the best position to capitalize on that. We are the biggest company with the biggest balance sheet. We serve both North America and Europe.\nWe have got a strong product portfolio spanning from home all the way up to DC fast charge, along with all the software to manage it for every use case. So I think we are in a great position going forward.\nChris Dendrinos: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Was hoping first you could elaborate more on what you are hearing from customers with respect to their project plans, in particular for North America. Rick, you mentioned some projects are being delayed but not canceled. Can you share more on what you think it would take for customers to move forward with those delayed projects? Then any context they are sharing about how they are thinking about project timing, especially with the 30C tax credits for charging stations set to go away.\nRick Wilmer: Yeah. Good question. And I think there is, you know, like, we have got, you know, some being cautious about our look forward. I think our customers are as well. They all again, remain committed to their projects. We have literally not heard of one project cancellation, but I think once the tax credits go away and we see what that means to EV sales, you will see some more decisive in the market regarding moving forward and hopefully not, you know, canceling or pausing, but we are waiting for that to happen, you know, to provide some clarity. Beyond that, it is the typical stuff that causes project delays. It is getting grid upgrades. It is construction timelines.\nIt is all the things that we have historically seen in the past where customers that are doing big projects, particularly often have kind of best-case timelines as if everything goes well, and then a permit gets delayed, the weather disrupts a construction project, and all of a sudden things are moving out. So that factor continues to persist, but it has not changed much.\nMark Delaney: Okay. Thank you for that detail, Rick. My other question was for you, Manzi, on the gross margin. Nice to see the improvement you reported this quarter. You have spoken in the past about the potential for the hardware gross margins to continue to improve as you work off inventory of older products and shift your mix toward the lower-cost product that you are building with contract manufacturers. Maybe you can share more where you are in that process and as you fully make the transition, how much do you think it could help the hardware gross margins? Thank you.\nManzi Katani: Yeah. Hi, Mark. So what we saw this quarter was, you know, hardware margins improved sequentially by a percentage point. By a percentage point, and this was because we actually did see some products coming from Asia, lower cost, but we also saw improvement in warranty cost. And we saw efficiencies in non-bomb related cost, which drove the margins up. Going forward, I think those factors will continue to benefit us. And then depending on inventory and sell-through, we should start seeing the benefit of the Asia manufacturing as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mickey Legg with The Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.\nMickey Legg: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Wanna dig in on the competitive landscape and how that is evolving a little bit. Could you talk about how you view your software and the moat you built around that, now that peers to be moving a bit harder into operation and software platforms?\nRick Wilmer: Thanks. Yeah. Hi, Nikki. Good question. I think we have got a state-of-the-art software platform that continues to evolve and modernize. We have now got a hybrid cloud solution. The amount of AI that we are integrating into the product is very interesting and exciting. I think it is going to unleash some real value for our customers. I also believe and know, quite frankly, that we can unlock all kinds of value by having our software work with our hardware. While we are happy to have our software manage third-party hardware, which we do all the time, which is oftentimes a requirement for customers, we will continue to do that.\nBut we remain committed to developing hardware as well because we know that our hardware plus software can create more value and do things that cannot be done with just stand-alone software.\nMickey Legg: Okay. Great. That is all for me. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Pearce with Needham and Company. Please go ahead.\nChris Pearce: Hey. Good afternoon, Rick and Manzi. I was just curious. At least out in California, we are seeing a lot of increased DC charging setups, money going into DC charging. Yeah. I was curious, do you think that is taking share from level two where people thought level two might have higher share in, you know, if we look back a couple of years to what people might see now or what are you guys doing around that, or do you think the idea behind the question is wrong? I just kind of like a sense of level two demand, DC charging demand, how you are kind of fitting both those buckets and what you are seeing.\nRick Wilmer: We do not see, you know, DC cannibalizing AC demand. I mean, there are different use cases and as we have talked about more than once, the vast majority of charging is done at home and at work, which is typically level two charging. On the financial side, though, we are seeing a lot of interest or a reasonable amount of interest, I would say increased interest, from financing partners behind, you know, DC fast charging for general public charging. We have had some good success with partners that we have found that want to work with us to deploy DC fast charging for the general public.\nChris Pearce: And then if we go back to the inventory, Manzi, this one is sort of be for you. Is that something you have in the inventory now? And I guess with the inventory dollars staying where they are, but things are changing under the surface, I just wanted to kind of check-in on any outsourcing risk or DCAC, new product versus old product, you kind of frame all that?\nManzi Katani: Yeah. No. I mean, you know, our inventory balance has, you know, a variety of different products and different volumes of all the different products. And we are managing that, you know, based on the arrival of the new products. We are watching that closely. Again, the release date of the new product and the, you know, the general availability and, you know, increased volume is going to take some time, and we are kind of watching each product level with their release dates and inventory balance. And managing that.\nBut in terms of if your question is about, you know, shortage or, you know, any kind of movement needed from one product to the other or the need to kind of source more. We do not see any of that.\nChris Pearce: Okay. Thank you for your time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Irwin with Roth Capital. Please go ahead.\nCraig Irwin: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. So cash use this quarter was really tight, right? You guys have been squeezing a lot of cash out of, you know, receivables, inventories, prepaid, I mean, payables, everything was a contribution this quarter. Can you talk about the ability to continue squeezing the balance sheet for cash and, you know, the new products that are launching for the end of the year, did they need a cash contribution for inventory for us to see the revenue start to ramp? Or, you know, can that be offset by continued progress bringing down balances from other products?\nManzi Katani: Yeah. Hi, Craig. And so I think, you know, there may be quarterly fluctuations in cash usage. Obviously, Q2 was fantastic in terms of cash usage, use less than $2 million, but there may be slight quarterly fluctuations depending on the timing of receivables, pay of sale of inventory, etcetera. But we do anticipate that the overall trend of declining annual cash usage will continue and it is entirely possible that because of our capitalized business model, we might get to the point where we generate cash in a quarter before we achieve EBITDA profitability. And we anticipate that we will particularly benefit from this when we start to bring inventory balance down.\nIn terms of the new products, I do not think it will impact inventory because, I mean, I think the overall inventory reduction trajectory should still happen, and it should release cash because obviously, the inventory number as it stands now is pretty high.\nRick Wilmer: The other comment I will make, Craig, is that the supply chain timeline or lead time is pretty balanced with the sales cycles now in many cases. So you would be, unlike the COVID days, for example, we do not need to build far in advance of demand such that we can adhere to customer lead time requirements. We can balance that pretty effectively now.\nCraig Irwin: Understood. And if I could squeeze another one in on the gross margin side. Can you maybe talk about the commonality of parts in the new products that you are launching? You know, I know a lot of your products introduced to date have had substantial commonality in the architecture and components to drive purchasing leverage. You know, is there maybe a change in architecture or an evolution here? How much do the new products benefit from the pre-existing buy? And, you know, would you expect these products to potentially be margin accretive heading into the end of the year?\nRick Wilmer: Yes. So at a part level, there is probably not that much commonality between the old products and the new. There are some exceptions. For example, charging cables or charging cables. They do not change very much from product to product depending on level two, level three, for example. What is common is the vendor base. And the leverage we have with the supply base is really driven by the amount of business we concentrated in certain suppliers as opposed to specific individual parts that we buy from them. That may change as we move on from product generation to product generation.\nCraig Irwin: Thank you for that. Congratulations again on the progress this quarter.\nRick Wilmer: Thanks, Craig.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Sings with B. Riley. Please go ahead.\nRyan Sings: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I will just ask a couple of follow-ups on Europe. Looks like it is almost 20% of revenue right now. I am curious where you think Europe could go in terms of ChargePoint Holdings, Inc.'s overall revenue mix over the next few years? And could you remind us if there are any material differences in terms of your economics in Europe compared to in North America?\nRick Wilmer: The economics are a lot different. The different European countries have different regulations and requirements, which makes it a bit more complex from an standpoint to make sure you have the right product for the right country, for example. But that is fairly minor relative to the overall dynamics of the business comparing North America to Europe. We are not guiding, you know, revenue beyond this quarter. But the fact that we have got hardware products going into Europe that are our products that we have not been able to offer previously implies that, you know, Europe will definitely be growing for us.\nRyan Sings: Got it. Appreciate that color, Rick.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nBill Peterson: Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. I would like to follow-up on gross margins. Been asked a few different ways. But just looking ahead, how should we think about steady-state margins for hardware when you are really past any sort of existing inventory and you are on, I guess, an optimized platform, what should that look like over the long term or, I guess, on a go-forward basis? As well as subscriptions? Could you been doing some work there to optimize that part of the business as well. I am just trying to get a sense for how we should think about steady-state margins.\nAnd I guess, you mentioned you are navigating tariffs, but could you quantify the impact so we can at least understand what level of impact there is? Should we get any relief? Or conversely, if tariffs become more, I guess, impactful?\nManzi Katani: Yeah. Hi, Bill. I will take that one. So I started this margins. I think subscription margins should continue to improve with economies of scale and ongoing efficiency in our support organization. Our, you know, revenue keeps growing, but we do not have to scale costs up. So that the improvement should continue. As you said, it is, you know, more than 61% on a non-GAAP basis this quarter. I think that trend continues. On the hardware side, again, as we see products coming in from Asia, it, you know, margins should get better. We saw improvement in warranty cost. Other efficiencies, and non-bomb cost, all of that could help.\nHowever, on the hardware side, the overall margin really depends on the mix of products sold, which is difficult to predict. So it is hard to call out an ideal state. There are a lot of moving parts there. And also overall, for margins, there is a factor of subscription revenue as a percentage of overall revenue. If that improves, obviously, go up. But as we start selling more hardware, that could impact overall margins.\nRick Wilmer: The other comment I will make, Bill, is that the new products we expect to have higher baseline margin profiles than any of our existing products. We have been very focused on not only designing for features, functionality, broad applicability, but also for cost profile.\nManzi Katani: Yep. And then on the tariffs, so we have a lot of tariff mitigation already in place. We have, you know, a spread-out manufacturing base across the globe, which we are kind of leveraging to manage tariffs. It was not really meaningful within this quarter, and like I said, we were able to mitigate the tariffs that we had and whatever we did incur, we actually, you know, we had improvements that kind of overcame that. So I do not think there is that much of an impact on what we know today. Of course, if that tariff environment changes, then things could change.\nBill Peterson: Okay. Thanks for that. One of the\nOperator: My apologies. Please repress star one. Your next question comes from John Winham with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Winham: Hi. This is John. Hopefully, you can hear me okay?\nRick Wilmer: Yep.\nJohn Winham: Yeah. Perfect. You have mentioned a potential for consolidation in the industry. I was wondering if you could talk through if there have been any early signs of that in Europe or the US or anywhere you can sort of point to. Appreciate it. Thanks.\nRick Wilmer: Yeah, John. I cannot talk to anything specifically, but it seems like it is quite active. There are a lot of interesting conversations going on.\nJohn Winham: Maybe just ask the question sort of a little bit differently. And without asking anything specific, in terms of where it would be, what would you see the advantages as an analyst, when we are looking at this, it is taking out OpEx as a percentage of revenue, greater network scale. If you could just talk to what you think the advantage of consolidation would be, I would really appreciate it. Thank you so much.\nRick Wilmer: Yeah. I think it is pretty typical after you go through a hype cycle and you end up with, you know, a lot of companies getting started during that hype cycle with what looks like a, you know, an exciting fast-growing market, then you get overcrowding in terms of the competitive landscape. And you have got people that are trying to survive and they tend to try and fight on price. And they race each other to the bottom. And they end up in a situation where they just do not have an economic model that no longer makes sense.\nJohn Winham: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Pfingst with B. Riley. Please go ahead. And we have no further questions in our queue at this time. And that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

XRP has Elliott Wave theory bullish setups, he said.\nIf XRP can break the \"final boss\" resistance at $4–$4.50, it could reach $7–$10 in the next stage. If Wave 3 is strong, XRP could reach $20 or higher in a longer rally.\nBut as of September 3, XRP is now trading at $2.84, up 1.7% on the day, and nowhere near that ambitious target.\nThe question is now not just whether XRP will get to $20 — but when it will.\nXRP's bullish action\nThere are many things going for XRP right now. The legal clarity might offer pending ETF filings in 2025, which should grow to a wave of institutional capital. Data shows there has already been momentum in futures-based ETFs.\nTeucrium's 2X Long Daily ETF (XXRP) saw inflows for its 22nd consecutive week, adding $18.2 million last week to bring total assets to $355 million. XXRP is a leveraged ETF that aims to double XRP's daily price performance.\nMore news:\nMoreover, ProShares' Ultra XRP ETF (UXRP) has recently grown to $100 million since its launch.\nBetting markets on Polymarket now show nearly 88% odds of a Ripple ETF approval by year-end.\nXRP whales are back\nOn-chain signals are also supporting the bullish thesis.

And, upgrades to the XRP Ledger (XRPL), including EVM sidechains and AMM fixes, are improving XRPL's role in DeFi and cross-border payments.\nCan XRP hit $20?\nTechnical signals favor the bullish outlook. The MACD crossed bullish, and the histogram went green, reflecting buyers' momentum.\nVolume data also presents more green spikes. Whales are returning, and bear pressure is decreasing.\nWith the price of XRP currently at $2.71, the digital asset has built a double bottom and broken out from bullish patterns such as a falling wedge and cup-and-handle.\nThe next major test is $3.20–$3.50, and exceeding it could either stall the move or clear the way for a move to $4–$5. While $20 is hard to hit in September, as the analyst pointed out, if the momentum holds, $20 could be the bull case.\nRelated: What is Bitcoin mining?

Email pr@fool.com\nFull Conference Call Transcript\nAmit Berry: Good afternoon. And welcome to C3.ai, Inc.'s earnings call for the 2026Q1, which ended on July 31, 2025. My name is Amit Berry, and I lead investor relations at C3.ai, Inc. With me on the call today are Tom Siebel, Executive Chairman, Stephen Ehigian, Chief Executive Officer, and Hitesh Lath, Chief Financial Officer. After the market closed today, we issued a press release with details regarding our first quarter results, as well as a supplemental to our results. Both of which can be accessed through the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.c3.ai. This call is being webcast and a replay will be available on our IR website following the conclusion of the call.\nDuring today's call, we will make statements related to our business that may be considered forward-looking under federal securities laws. These statements reflect our views only as of today, and should not be considered representative of our views as of any subsequent date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements or outlook. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.\nFor a further discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, as it may be supplemented by other filings and reports we make with the SEC from time to time, including our quarterly report on Form 10-Q that will be filed for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2025. All financial results will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures to the extent reasonably available is included in our press release.\nFinally, at times in our prepared remarks, in response to your questions, we may discuss metrics that are incremental to our usual presentation to give greater insight into the dynamics of our business and our quarterly results. Please be advised that we may or may not continue to provide this additional detail in the future. And with that, let me turn the call over to Hitesh.\nHitesh Lath: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I will share our financial results and provide additional color on our business. All figures are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. Total revenue for the quarter was $70.3 million, a decrease of 19% year-over-year. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $60.3 million, representing 86% of total revenue. Revenue from the sale of software licenses that are demonstration versions of C3.ai, Inc. applications was $17.9 million during the quarter, which was sequentially lower by $15.9 million.\nWe sell these licenses at the request of our distribution partners to enable them to demonstrate our software effectively to their customers and at the request of our large strategic customers to enable them to accelerate C3.ai, Inc. application adoption across their companies. Professional services revenue was $10 million, of which $8.7 million was revenue from engineering services, or PES. Professional services represent 14% of total revenue during the quarter. Our subscription and PES revenue combined was $69 million and accounted for 98% of total revenue. I'll now walk you through some of our strategic customer wins this quarter. Nucor has expanded its commitment with C3.ai, Inc. in a multiyear partnership to build an enterprise-wide AI program across their facilities.\nWe are supporting and optimizing day-to-day planning, inventory, and scheduling decisions, and now expanding to additional plants and use cases. Comerica, a global leader in chemicals, launched its first enterprise-scale AI program with C3.ai, Inc. After initial success improving yield in its salt business, Comerica is now scaling to 100 assets and multiple use cases, the start of a company-wide AI transformation. HII, America's largest military shipbuilder, is expanding its partnership with C3.ai, Inc. to accelerate throughput at Ingalls and Newport News. Initial deployments cut complex shipbuilding timelines, and we are now scaling these AI capabilities across HII shipyards to strengthen US Navy fleet readiness.\nThe US Army Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office is deploying a contested logistics application built on the C3 Agentic AI platform to support frontline vehicles in high-risk environments. This system applies agentic and generative AI to enhance sustainment, readiness, and decision speed in contested environments. I'll now move on to the rest of the financial results. Non-GAAP gross profit for the quarter was $36.3 million, and non-GAAP gross margin was 52%. Non-GAAP gross margin for professional services remained high at over 80%. Non-GAAP operating loss for the quarter was $57.8 million. Non-GAAP net loss for the quarter was $49.8 million, and non-GAAP net loss per share was $0.37. Our net cash used in operating activities was $33.5 million.\nFree cash flow for the quarter was negative $34.3 million. We continue to be well-capitalized and closed the quarter with $711.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. During the first quarter, we signed 28 initial production deployments or IPDs. At the end of the quarter, we had cumulatively signed 374 IPDs, of which 266 are still active. This means they are either in their original three to six-month term, extended for some duration, converted to ongoing subscription or consumption contract, or are currently being negotiated for conversion to ongoing subscription or consumption contract.\nNon-GAAP gross margin declined this quarter to 52% primarily due to a higher mix of IPD-related costs, a lower mix of demonstration license revenue, and PES revenue, and lower economies of scale. As compared to fiscal 2025, we expect to continue to see moderated gross margins in the near term due to a higher mix of IPDs, which carry a greater cost of revenue during the initial production phase of the customer life cycle due to our investments in expanding our support capacity and lower economies of scale. Now I'll move on to our guidance for the next quarter. Our revenue guidance for 2026Q2 is $72 million to $80 million.\nOur guidance for non-GAAP loss from operations for 2026Q2 is $49.5 million to $57.5 million. Given the appointment of our new Chief Executive Officer and the recent restructuring of the sales and services organizations, we are withdrawing our previous guidance. We plan on providing guidance for the 2026Q3 and full year fiscal 2026 when we announce our financial results for the 2026Q2. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Siebel: Thank you, Hitesh. And good afternoon, everyone. As Hitesh reported, the financial results of the first quarter were completely unacceptable. And completely unacceptable in virtually every respect. I've given this a lot of thought as to, you know, what the root cause of this is. Okay? Is there a market? The market is huge. Is there some new competitor that changed the competitive dynamics of the space? There is not. Is there some secular change in the market that we haven't seen before? There is not. The fact of the matter is that it boiled down to poor sales execution and poor resource coordination.\nIt's clear that the new leadership that we brought into the organization in the guy globally in sales and service in the service organization, in EMEA, in federal, in North America, kind of mid-quarter, and it caused confusion in the sales process. As I have previously announced, I ran into some unanticipated health issues, and as a result of these health issues, I was unable to participate as actively as I used to in the sales processes and the coordination of resources necessary to make these sales processes successful and come to closure. In hindsight, it's clear that my active involvement in that sales process had a greater impact than any of us knew.\nThe good news is that we have completely restructured our sales and service organizations globally. We have brought in new, highly experienced leadership across the board, okay, to drive growth, to drive customer satisfaction. Even better, consistent with our announcement last July, we have completed the search, and we have appointed a new Chief Executive Officer in the person of Stephen Ehigian, who is highly experienced and well-equipped to drive the details of this business, to coordinate resources, and to accelerate growth.\nIn the sales and service organizations, we have combined these organizations under a new leader in the person of a Chief Commercial Officer to bring a more seamless experience focused on delivering value for each and every one of our customers. In addition to the Chief Commercial Officer, we've brought in a new General Manager of EMEA, we brought in a new Group Vice President for North American operations, and we brought significant leadership into the federal business operations. By combining the sales and service organizations into a cohesive whole, we are assuring a focus on delivering rapid economic benefits to each and every one of our customer engagements to ensure their continued success.\nAs we entered Q2, we have installed new leadership across the board. We have reorganized our sales and service organizations with a tightly integrated detailed execution plan going forward where everybody knows where they sit, what their job responsibilities are, and we've assured that everybody has the resources to do their job. We have a product that is unmatched in technical sophistication and functionality. We have over 131 enterprise AI applications in the market. I believe we have the highest levels of customer satisfaction as measured by net promoter scores in the application software industry. We have a huge and rapidly growing addressable market opportunity. We have the leadership in place, and we are positioned to grow.\nWe are in position to gain market share, and we are in a position to assure the success of each and every one of our customer engagements. An important development in Q1 was the introduction of our strategic integrator program. This is a software OEM program whereby we are licensing the C3 Agentic AI platform to others, enabling them to design, develop, provision, and operate the industry and domain-specific applications for their markets. We're finding that the strategic integrator program is being well received by OEMs, systems integrators, into the defense, intelligence, and civilian government communities. And we expect this to be a large and rapidly growing line of business for C3.ai, Inc. going forward.\nThe use of the Agentic AI platform enables them to use all of the assets that they've developed in the last couple of decades. Be these machine learning models. And so it's an entirely open that allows them to use any of the capabilities they have, any new capabilities that the market may bring going forward since an entirely open model-driven architecture enabling complete flexibility going forward and avoiding vendor lock-in. It's difficult to overestimate the scale of the generative AI, agentic AI opportunity that is before us.\nAs of the end of the first quarter, we're involved in approximately 60 large-scale customer engagements in state and local government, in manufacturing, in federal government, in defense, intelligence, manufacturing, what have you. Many of you are familiar with the MIT report that shows that order of 95% of these LLM projects run into a dead end and are unsuccessful. Our experience is that the majority of our LLM deployments are successful across industries and across use cases. The reason for the success is the combination of these generative free chain transformers with the C3 Agentic AI platform solves all the hobgoblins with the voter as with generative AI.\nThese hobgoblins include data exfiltration, cybersecurity risk, hallucination, inability to enforce data access controls, the inability to take advantage of omni-modal integration, all of these problems are solved by C3 generative AI, resulting in a very, very high success rate associated with our projects. Q1 2025 was our nineteenth quarter operating as a public company. This is the first quarter into which we have missed our revenue guidance. Know that we take that very seriously. And we will take that seriously going forward. Candidly, there is no excuse for the economic results that we delivered in the first quarter. Okay? That being said, going forward, our objective remains the same.\nWe're here to establish and maintain a market leadership position globally in enterprise AI applications. Not in infrastructure, not in semiconductors, not in machine learning models, not in professional services implementations. Okay? We're here to establish a market leadership position in enterprise AI software, both with the C3 Agentic AI platform and with the enterprise AI application footprint we have in place and will be expanding. We have tried, tested, and proven products. We have incredibly sophisticated architecture in the Agentic AI platform. We're establishing clear leadership in Agentic AI, a concept for which you know that we hold the patents. We have tried, tested, and proven executive leadership in place. We have highly satisfied customers.\nWe have a large and expansive addressable market opportunity before us that some estimate approaches $2 trillion a year. Okay? And we are geared up to grow our product footprint, grow our market share, increase our market penetration, and operate a rapidly growing cash-positive profitable business. Going forward, I will continue to remain deeply engaged in the business now in the role as Executive Chairman. In that role, I will particularly focus on strategic partner relationships, strategic customer relationships, and keep an eye on direction and product strategy going forward. I'm most enthusiastic to announce the appointment of Stephen Ehigian as the new Chief Executive Officer of C3.ai, Inc.\nStephen brings a superlative educational background, a wealth of industry experience, having started and built and grown two successful AI companies that he sold to Salesforce. Stephen is also an experienced and accomplished public sector leader, having served as President Trump's appointee as the Acting Administrator of the General Services Administration, where Stephen was responsible for performing the General Services Administration's performing the acquisition activities of all the divisions of the federal government, and driving President Trump's AI strategy across the federal government.\nOn behalf of the board of directors of C3.ai, Inc., the executive leadership of C3.ai, Inc., and the, I know, 11 or 1,200 employees of C3.ai, Inc., whatever that number may be, I can tell you we're all enthusiastic about working closely with Stephen in his new leadership role. To ensure that he is successful in bringing more creativity to the process, more energy to the process, more drive to the process, as we accelerate growth, accelerate market penetration, and accelerate market leadership in enterprise AI. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for your time. And now I'll turn this back to Hitesh to field your questions.\nHitesh Lath: Thank you, Tom. Operator, could you please open the line for questions?\nOperator: Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Roddy Sultan with UBS. Your line is open.\nRoddy Sultan: Awesome. Thank you. First for Tom, you know, your involvement in the sales process has obviously been very critical here. I mean, is there any way to more concretely understand how involved you're planning on being in the sales process going forward? And what you're doing to ensure a smooth handoff to Stephen and the new sales leadership?\nTom Siebel: I am here to do everything I can to ensure that Stephen is successful. Okay? And so now do we have a new, you know, an entire new layer of senior leadership in the company who are tried, tested, and proven at selling enterprise AI globally. And I suspect with Stephen's leadership, they're gonna be enormously successful. That being said, okay, I will continue to be involved as necessary, okay, in monitoring that process and assisting that process to ensure that this transition goes very smoothly. And we dramatically ramp up the sales and service capacity globally.\nRoddy Sultan: Awesome. And then second for Hitesh. Obviously, a lot of moving parts in the quarter. What are you seeing that's giving you confidence in the Q2 guide? And then as about Q3 and Q4, like what is the right starting point to think about that sort of back half outlook? Any sort of building blocks would be helpful as we calibrate numbers.\nHitesh Lath: Yeah. Sure, Roddy. Q2 guidance is based on the sales activity we've seen in the month of August, as well as our review of sales pipeline for the rest of the quarter with the new sales leadership. As it relates to periods beyond Q2, while we're not providing any guidance at this point, we note that most analysts who have updated their revenue forecast for the year are forecasting fiscal 2026 revenue ranging from $290 million to $300 million. And at this point, I would not argue against any number within that range. As it relates to profitability, we acknowledge our performance in Q1 has put us behind. But we remain committed to achieving non-GAAP profitability and free cash flow.\nWe are still bullish about the business, as Tom said, and we will get to profitability and free cash flow, with the right scale, and that is a matter of time.\nRoddy Sultan: Awesome. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Patrick Walravens with Citizens. Your line is open.\nPatrick Walravens: Hey, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. This is Nick on for Pat. Tom, one quick one for you. You guys closed 40 partner-led deals this quarter. How do you see the mix of partner-led versus direct sales evolving?\nTom Siebel: That's a great question. I think something like Amit, correct me. Is it 80% or 90%? 90 this quarter. The 90% of the business that we closed this quarter was with partners. Particularly Azure and AWS and GCP. And McKinsey Quantum Black, and you can expect that our investment in those partnerships going forward is gonna be big time.\nI think there are, you know, what certainly, without quoting a number, there are certainly tens of thousands of salespeople at Azure alone, and we are amping up our go-to-market activities with Microsoft, with AWS, GCP in a big way globally, and so we would hope we're going from, say, hundreds of that we're involved in today where we're joint selling and we hope that will go to soon to thousands. So that is a major, major advantage that we have, this partner ecosystem. And we fully intend to exploit that advantage.\nPatrick Walravens: Great. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, I heard Stephen was in the room. If I could ask him a quick one, that would be fantastic. You know, how did Stephen, great to meet you. Looking forward to working with you. How did you choose C3.ai, Inc., and why was it a compelling opportunity?\nStephen Ehigian: Yeah. Well, first, the market opportunity here for enterprise AI is enormous. Every company, every government is exploring how to transition away from testing and experimenting with AI to actually rolling out across their core operations and workflows. Exciting for me is C3.ai, Inc. has the technology platform and applications that customers need today. Their technology is being deployed across some of the most valuable customers in the world into the most challenging environments. So for me, on top of all that, the ability to learn from Tom Siebel, who invented this entire enterprise AI market, as well as with the extraordinary team here, was, honestly, an easy decision to say yes to.\nPatrick Walravens: Awesome. Thank you very much. Looking forward to working with you.\nStephen Ehigian: Likewise. Thank you.\nOperator: And one moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Matthew Calitri with Needham and Co. Your line is open.\nMatt Calitri: Hi, guys. This is Matt Calitri on for Mike Cikos over at Needham. Thanks for taking our questions. Tom, how would you weight the underperformance this quarter between sales disruption and your impact on the sales process?\nTom Siebel: I think it was a combination of both, but I would put it, you know, probably 70% sales disruption and 30% my not being as involved in the details as I have previously been. And, you know, I think that, you know? So those are the facts. And, you know, the quarter is the quarter was dreadful. Okay? And now we need to pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and get on business, which is exactly what we're gonna do.\nMatt Calitri: Understood. And then looking at the execution steps, how would you categorize them as far as assigning pilots or converting them in contracts? What exactly were you seeing there?\nTom Siebel: It's all of the above, Matt. I mean, there are a lot of new people involved. There is new leadership involved. I think, you know, when you do that, you know, sometimes channels could cross a little bit and these things get confused. And, you know, we were, you know, we were, you know, driving the car down the road and replacing the engine, the transmission, and the wheels at the same time. And, you know, the guy who used to drive the car wasn't there. So it was a bad quarter. It happens. I mean, come on. I was at Oracle in 1989 when Oracle had its first miss.\nI think that the stock went from 27 to 3 as I recall. And it was the end of the world. Well, since then, as you know, Oracle has missed 34 quarters since, still not the end of the world. And, NVIDIA has missed 10. Amazon has missed 23. Salesforce has missed a few, certainly six months ago and twelve months ago. And today, nobody remembers any of that. Six months from now, nobody will remember this because we're gonna be rocking.\nMatt Calitri: Understood. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. That is all the time we have for Q&A today.

This call is being webcast and can be accessed on the Investors section of our website at investors.chargepoint.com. With me on today's call are Rick Wilmer, our Chief Executive Officer, and Manzi Katani, Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, we issued our press release announcing results for the quarter ended July 31, 2025, which can be found on our website. We would like to remind you that during the conference call, management will be making forward-looking statements, including our outlook for 2026.\nThese forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements after the call. For a more detailed description of certain factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on June 6, 2025, and our earnings release posted today on our website and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K.\nAlso, please note that we use certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which we reconcile to GAAP in our earnings release and for certain historical periods in the investor presentation posted on the Investors section of our website. And finally, we will be posting a transcript of this call to our investor relations website under the Quarterly Results section. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wilmer.\nRick Wilmer: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining the ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. second-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings call. We are pleased to report solid results for the quarter. Second quarter revenue was $99 million, landing at the top of our guidance range. Non-GAAP gross margin improved sequentially, with Q2 results coming in at 33%. This figure is notable as the highest gross margin we have reported since becoming a public company, and we successfully mitigated tariffs to achieve it. Cash management was exceptional, with our ending balance at $195 million, only $2 million below Q1's close, largely driven by structural OpEx changes we have been making over the last year.\nOur collaboration with GM is also progressing, with nearly a dozen sites and more than 50 new fast charging ports and many more scheduled to launch this year. Overall, ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. now manages over 363,000 ports, including more than 37,000 DC fast chargers and 123,000 located in Europe. Globally, ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. drivers can access nearly 1,300,000 charging ports. We achieved this performance despite the uncertainty, particularly in North America. Within the US, passenger EV sales growth slowed to a 3% year-over-year increase. The forthcoming expiration of the Consumer 30D EV tax and 30C alternative fuel vehicle refueling credit are also sources of concern for future EV adoption.\nAlong with the evolving tariff landscape, this has translated into delays for major projects we have won extended expansion build-outs, but no project cancellations. So we are making solid progress on our path, as we saw over the past year, to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA breakeven. Considering these delays and their impact on revenue, we have determined we will be best positioned if we push out our EBITDA breakeven beyond this year. This is to ensure we can fund product innovation and commercialization efforts, which we expect to drive durable revenue growth. Uncertainty aside, we believe our go-to-market strategy and innovation put us on a firm footing to drive growth, win market share, and hit EBITDA positive in the coming quarters.\nRegarding our go-to-market strategy, we are rapidly operationalizing our partnership with Eaton, and that work will be largely completed this quarter. Since this partnership was announced in May, we continue to build confidence that together we will accelerate the deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure across North America and Europe. We have already introduced our co-branded product, expanded our channel reach, accessed new strategic accounts, and started generating new streams of revenue together. We are delivering innovation, which has been accelerated and expanded because of our partnership with Eaton.\nThe express line of DC charging solutions powered by Eaton and announced last week combines the strength of both companies to deliver more power in less space with massive scalability along with the easiest and fastest installation. It features Eaton hardware for grid connectivity plus B2G capabilities. The net result will be substantially lower CapEx and operating costs and faster deployment timelines. It will change the game in terms of the economics of DC fast charging for our customers. We are also co-developing a bidirectional home charging solution with advanced energy management.\nThe integration of ChargePoint Holdings, Inc.'s Flex Plus chargers with Eaton's Able Edge smart panels and breakers enables vehicles to supply backup power to homes and also automatically adjust EV charging based on the home energy usage. To allow homeowners to install EV charging, the behind-the-meter insights will help utilities manage grid stress and transformer loads. We expect this synergistic type of innovation will deliver real value to homeowners, utilities, and auto OEMs while at the same time driving market share gains. Both the new express line of DC solutions and flex product line are designed to not only deliver market differentiation but also cost-effectiveness. We expect both product lines to have a positive impact on our hardware gross margins.\nMoving to markets, Europe seems promising going forward. Roadmotion reports a 26% year-over-year increase in European EV sales during the first half of the year, which is a strong indicator of future charging demand in Europe. We believe the current infrastructure cannot support such growth. With the innovation and new products we are delivering, we will be well situated to capture much of this demand. In summary, despite an uncertain environment causing delays, we delivered strong results. We are operationalizing our strategic Eaton partnership, which accelerates innovation and expands our reach. We are delivering game-changing products poised to strengthen our market share and profitability. Internally, the team continues to execute with excellence.\nOur long-term thesis remains intact, validated by the strength of our pipeline, the positive reaction to our new products, and the new partners and customers we are actively signing. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Manzi Katani.\nManzi Katani: Thanks, Rick. As a reminder, please see our earnings press release where we reconcile our non-GAAP results to GAAP. Our principal exclusions are stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, and certain costs related to restructuring settlements, and nonrecurring legal expenses. Revenue for the second quarter was $99 million at the high end of our guidance range, sequentially higher than the prior quarter and down 9% year-on-year. Network charging systems at $50 million accounted for 51% of second quarter revenue. Subscription revenue at $40 million was 40% of total revenue, 5% higher sequentially and up 10% year-on-year as our total installed base continued to increase. Other revenue at $8 million was 8% of total revenue.\nTurning to verticals, which we report from a billings perspective, second quarter billings percentages were commercial 75%, fleet 11%, residential 10%, and other 4%. From a geographic perspective, North America made up 84% of revenue, and Europe was 16%. This was relatively consistent with the first quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 33%, growing by three percentage points sequentially and eight percentage points year-on-year. This is attributable to higher hardware margins, higher subscription margins, as well as subscription revenue growing as a percentage of total revenue. I would like to point out that this was our seventh straight quarter of sequential non-GAAP gross margin improvement. Hardware gross margin increased 1% sequentially despite the impact of higher tariffs.\nSubscription margin continued to grow, reaching another record high of 61% on a GAAP basis and was even higher on a non-GAAP basis, reflecting economies of scale and continued optimization of support costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $59 million, up 3% sequentially and down 12% year-on-year. The small sequential increase this quarter was mainly due to a temporary increase in R&D spend as a result of higher NRE and contractor spend related to the development of our recently announced new AC and DC charging product architecture. This increase will persist in the third quarter, but we should see the spend gradually coming down in Q4 and then further reducing next year.\nWe are continuing to closely manage operating expenses, balancing investments that we believe will lead to significant future growth and margin expansion while also being mindful of current constraints. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss was $22 million. This compares with a loss of $23 million in the prior quarter and a loss of $34 million in the second quarter of last year. Stock-based compensation was $18 million, flat to last quarter and down from $19 million in the second quarter of last year. Our inventory balance remained virtually flat to the prior quarter at $212 million.\nWhile this balance did not decrease due to existing commitments with contract manufacturers, we continue to drive towards a gradual reduction in inventory over the next few quarters, which will free up cash. Speaking of cash, we ended the quarter with $195 million of cash on hand versus $196 million in the prior quarter, resulting in cash usage of less than $2 million. This compares with $49 million of cash usage in Q2 of last year and $29 million in Q1 this year. We have been able to significantly reduce cash burn over the past few quarters mainly due to spend reductions and working capital management.\nOur $150 million revolving credit facility remains undrawn, and we have no debt maturities until 2028. Turning to guidance, for 2026, we expect revenue to be between $90 million to $100 million. While we continue to guide cautiously given the challenging and constantly changing macro backdrop, delivering revenue growth, and ultimately reaching non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA breakeven and generating positive cash flow remain our primary focus areas.\nAs Rick mentioned, given the macroeconomic headwinds, the trajectory of revenue growth required to get to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA breakeven in a quarter will take longer to materialize than this year, but we expect to continue to make progress towards profitability and reducing cash burn, which we have managed to do well over the past year. We will now open the call for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: We will now begin the question and answer session. We also ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Your first question comes from the line of Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nColin Rusch: Thanks so much, guys. Now, can you just talk a little bit about what the trajectory is on OpEx? Obviously, R&D is remaining at some elevated levels along with G&A. Just want to get a sense of how that should trend over the balance of this fiscal year.\nManzi Katani: Yeah. Hi, Colin. I will take that one. Yes. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, OpEx is slightly higher than Q1 because of some investment we did on the R&D front. We have spent on prototyping as we are releasing these new products and releasing the new AC and DC architecture. Those are temporary one-time, if you will, NRE costs. And then we also had elevated expenses on the contractor side this quarter. Now we expect this to persist in the next quarter because we are really in the middle of releasing all of these products. There is a lot of activity going on around that. But I think it should come down gradually in Q4.\nAnd then we will manage it better next year.\nColin Rusch: Great. And then just from a sales perspective, you know, we all know what is going on in North America and then, you know, kind of a digestion of the new policy. But I am curious, you know, in Europe, other geographies where you are seeing any potential higher growth opportunities, you know, particularly with this Eaton relationship and global footprint there? Are there other areas that you see, you know, the products ending up that could surprise us in some way around the growth trajectory?\nRick Wilmer: Yeah. I think hey, Colin. I think the overall macro conditions in Europe are looking better right now than they are in North America. Hopefully, things will start to clarify in North America once we get through the tax credit expiration in September. But in Europe, a lot of the products that are driving some of the incremental OpEx spend that Manzi alluded to are targeted at Europe, where we did not have solutions to serve those use cases in the past. So the flex product line that we have announced a month or so ago will launch in Europe. Here soon. In fact, we have now got inventory position in Europe to begin fulfilling early sales.\nAnd then the new DC Express architecture that we also announced will be targeted at Europe, where in the past we have not had a DC product that was developed by us available in Europe. So we are as we move forward into the new year. It is a combination of a more positive macro environment and new products to serve that market that we believe are quite differentiated.\nColin Rusch: Great. Thanks so much, guys. I will hop back in queue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Dendrinos with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nChris Dendrinos: Hi. Good evening, and thank you. I guess maybe to start here, just wanted to follow-up on that question in regards to the AC architecture or the new AC launch in Europe. Can you maybe speak to the initial kind of interest levels there? And mentioned inventory? I guess, maybe what is the channel like, and what has been the response from the dealerships? Dealer channel there? Thanks.\nRick Wilmer: Yeah. So it is very early, Chris. We have just moved the first bit of inventory into Europe. We have had successful early access customers. And we are beginning to build up our channel interest and target our end customer base in three major geographies in Europe. The UK, France, and Germany. We have got all the approvals to serve all the markets, all those different product configurations based on the requirements in each of those major European geos. So we will be really getting clarity on the overall demand that we expect early on with this new product as we move through this quarter, but early indications have been positive.\nChris Dendrinos: Got it. Okay. And then, you know, maybe as a follow-up here, you know, we are only, I guess, a month or two removed from the passage of the OB3, but just kind of thinking about the demand outlook in sort of, call it, lower for longer outlook in the US. I guess, how are you thinking about, you know, the company's positioning here just given the changes in that dynamic? Are you financially in the right place? Do you need to change personnel or strategy at all or slow down maybe some of the development going forward? Thanks.\nRick Wilmer: No. I think just the opposite. I mean, within the constraints of our OpEx envelope, I really believe the path to success is to deliver innovation to the market, which we have clearly been doing as we have moved through the year with some of the more significant innovations just announced recently that we mentioned a minute ago. You know, the market, this whole industry went through a hype cycle. It collapsed in 2023. I think there is going to be ongoing demand for EVs. There are indications of that happening.\nI think I have seen data from Cox that July will be a record sales for EVs in North America, largely as a result of the tax credit expiration coming up this month. But what that tells us is that there is interest in EVs and demand for EVs if the price point is right. And I think we are seeing a lot of good innovation on the vehicle side. You can look at Ford's new platform announcement. Slate Auto, they announced their new vehicle.\nThere is just a bunch of things happening out there that are going to bring the selection up and the price down on EVs, which we believe will drive overall demand for EVs and thus charging going forward into the future. This down cycle is obviously putting pressure on everybody. And I think the industry is going to ultimately consolidate as a result of that. And I believe we are in the best position to capitalize on that. We are the biggest company with the biggest balance sheet. We serve both North America and Europe.\nWe have got a strong product portfolio spanning from home all the way up to DC fast charge, along with all the software to manage it for every use case. So I think we are in a great position going forward.\nChris Dendrinos: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Was hoping first you could elaborate more on what you are hearing from customers with respect to their project plans, in particular for North America. Rick, you mentioned some projects are being delayed but not canceled. Can you share more on what you think it would take for customers to move forward with those delayed projects? Then any context they are sharing about how they are thinking about project timing, especially with the 30C tax credits for charging stations set to go away.\nRick Wilmer: Yeah. Good question. And I think there is, you know, like, we have got, you know, some being cautious about our look forward. I think our customers are as well. They all again, remain committed to their projects. We have literally not heard of one project cancellation, but I think once the tax credits go away and we see what that means to EV sales, you will see some more decisive in the market regarding moving forward and hopefully not, you know, canceling or pausing, but we are waiting for that to happen, you know, to provide some clarity. Beyond that, it is the typical stuff that causes project delays. It is getting grid upgrades. It is construction timelines.\nIt is all the things that we have historically seen in the past where customers that are doing big projects, particularly often have kind of best-case timelines as if everything goes well, and then a permit gets delayed, the weather disrupts a construction project, and all of a sudden things are moving out. So that factor continues to persist, but it has not changed much.\nMark Delaney: Okay. Thank you for that detail, Rick. My other question was for you, Manzi, on the gross margin. Nice to see the improvement you reported this quarter. You have spoken in the past about the potential for the hardware gross margins to continue to improve as you work off inventory of older products and shift your mix toward the lower-cost product that you are building with contract manufacturers. Maybe you can share more where you are in that process and as you fully make the transition, how much do you think it could help the hardware gross margins? Thank you.\nManzi Katani: Yeah. Hi, Mark. So what we saw this quarter was, you know, hardware margins improved sequentially by a percentage point. By a percentage point, and this was because we actually did see some products coming from Asia, lower cost, but we also saw improvement in warranty cost. And we saw efficiencies in non-bomb related cost, which drove the margins up. Going forward, I think those factors will continue to benefit us. And then depending on inventory and sell-through, we should start seeing the benefit of the Asia manufacturing as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mickey Legg with The Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.\nMickey Legg: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Wanna dig in on the competitive landscape and how that is evolving a little bit. Could you talk about how you view your software and the moat you built around that, now that peers to be moving a bit harder into operation and software platforms?\nRick Wilmer: Thanks. Yeah. Hi, Nikki. Good question. I think we have got a state-of-the-art software platform that continues to evolve and modernize. We have now got a hybrid cloud solution. The amount of AI that we are integrating into the product is very interesting and exciting. I think it is going to unleash some real value for our customers. I also believe and know, quite frankly, that we can unlock all kinds of value by having our software work with our hardware. While we are happy to have our software manage third-party hardware, which we do all the time, which is oftentimes a requirement for customers, we will continue to do that.\nBut we remain committed to developing hardware as well because we know that our hardware plus software can create more value and do things that cannot be done with just stand-alone software.\nMickey Legg: Okay. Great. That is all for me. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Pearce with Needham and Company. Please go ahead.\nChris Pearce: Hey. Good afternoon, Rick and Manzi. I was just curious. At least out in California, we are seeing a lot of increased DC charging setups, money going into DC charging. Yeah. I was curious, do you think that is taking share from level two where people thought level two might have higher share in, you know, if we look back a couple of years to what people might see now or what are you guys doing around that, or do you think the idea behind the question is wrong? I just kind of like a sense of level two demand, DC charging demand, how you are kind of fitting both those buckets and what you are seeing.\nRick Wilmer: We do not see, you know, DC cannibalizing AC demand. I mean, there are different use cases and as we have talked about more than once, the vast majority of charging is done at home and at work, which is typically level two charging. On the financial side, though, we are seeing a lot of interest or a reasonable amount of interest, I would say increased interest, from financing partners behind, you know, DC fast charging for general public charging. We have had some good success with partners that we have found that want to work with us to deploy DC fast charging for the general public.\nChris Pearce: And then if we go back to the inventory, Manzi, this one is sort of be for you. Is that something you have in the inventory now? And I guess with the inventory dollars staying where they are, but things are changing under the surface, I just wanted to kind of check-in on any outsourcing risk or DCAC, new product versus old product, you kind of frame all that?\nManzi Katani: Yeah. No. I mean, you know, our inventory balance has, you know, a variety of different products and different volumes of all the different products. And we are managing that, you know, based on the arrival of the new products. We are watching that closely. Again, the release date of the new product and the, you know, the general availability and, you know, increased volume is going to take some time, and we are kind of watching each product level with their release dates and inventory balance. And managing that.\nBut in terms of if your question is about, you know, shortage or, you know, any kind of movement needed from one product to the other or the need to kind of source more. We do not see any of that.\nChris Pearce: Okay. Thank you for your time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Irwin with Roth Capital. Please go ahead.\nCraig Irwin: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. So cash use this quarter was really tight, right? You guys have been squeezing a lot of cash out of, you know, receivables, inventories, prepaid, I mean, payables, everything was a contribution this quarter. Can you talk about the ability to continue squeezing the balance sheet for cash and, you know, the new products that are launching for the end of the year, did they need a cash contribution for inventory for us to see the revenue start to ramp? Or, you know, can that be offset by continued progress bringing down balances from other products?\nManzi Katani: Yeah. Hi, Craig. And so I think, you know, there may be quarterly fluctuations in cash usage. Obviously, Q2 was fantastic in terms of cash usage, use less than $2 million, but there may be slight quarterly fluctuations depending on the timing of receivables, pay of sale of inventory, etcetera. But we do anticipate that the overall trend of declining annual cash usage will continue and it is entirely possible that because of our capitalized business model, we might get to the point where we generate cash in a quarter before we achieve EBITDA profitability. And we anticipate that we will particularly benefit from this when we start to bring inventory balance down.\nIn terms of the new products, I do not think it will impact inventory because, I mean, I think the overall inventory reduction trajectory should still happen, and it should release cash because obviously, the inventory number as it stands now is pretty high.\nRick Wilmer: The other comment I will make, Craig, is that the supply chain timeline or lead time is pretty balanced with the sales cycles now in many cases. So you would be, unlike the COVID days, for example, we do not need to build far in advance of demand such that we can adhere to customer lead time requirements. We can balance that pretty effectively now.\nCraig Irwin: Understood. And if I could squeeze another one in on the gross margin side. Can you maybe talk about the commonality of parts in the new products that you are launching? You know, I know a lot of your products introduced to date have had substantial commonality in the architecture and components to drive purchasing leverage. You know, is there maybe a change in architecture or an evolution here? How much do the new products benefit from the pre-existing buy? And, you know, would you expect these products to potentially be margin accretive heading into the end of the year?\nRick Wilmer: Yes. So at a part level, there is probably not that much commonality between the old products and the new. There are some exceptions. For example, charging cables or charging cables. They do not change very much from product to product depending on level two, level three, for example. What is common is the vendor base. And the leverage we have with the supply base is really driven by the amount of business we concentrated in certain suppliers as opposed to specific individual parts that we buy from them. That may change as we move on from product generation to product generation.\nCraig Irwin: Thank you for that. Congratulations again on the progress this quarter.\nRick Wilmer: Thanks, Craig.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Sings with B. Riley. Please go ahead.\nRyan Sings: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I will just ask a couple of follow-ups on Europe. Looks like it is almost 20% of revenue right now. I am curious where you think Europe could go in terms of ChargePoint Holdings, Inc.'s overall revenue mix over the next few years? And could you remind us if there are any material differences in terms of your economics in Europe compared to in North America?\nRick Wilmer: The economics are a lot different. The different European countries have different regulations and requirements, which makes it a bit more complex from an standpoint to make sure you have the right product for the right country, for example. But that is fairly minor relative to the overall dynamics of the business comparing North America to Europe. We are not guiding, you know, revenue beyond this quarter. But the fact that we have got hardware products going into Europe that are our products that we have not been able to offer previously implies that, you know, Europe will definitely be growing for us.\nRyan Sings: Got it. Appreciate that color, Rick.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nBill Peterson: Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. I would like to follow-up on gross margins. Been asked a few different ways. But just looking ahead, how should we think about steady-state margins for hardware when you are really past any sort of existing inventory and you are on, I guess, an optimized platform, what should that look like over the long term or, I guess, on a go-forward basis? As well as subscriptions? Could you been doing some work there to optimize that part of the business as well. I am just trying to get a sense for how we should think about steady-state margins.\nAnd I guess, you mentioned you are navigating tariffs, but could you quantify the impact so we can at least understand what level of impact there is? Should we get any relief? Or conversely, if tariffs become more, I guess, impactful?\nManzi Katani: Yeah. Hi, Bill. I will take that one. So I started this margins. I think subscription margins should continue to improve with economies of scale and ongoing efficiency in our support organization. Our, you know, revenue keeps growing, but we do not have to scale costs up. So that the improvement should continue. As you said, it is, you know, more than 61% on a non-GAAP basis this quarter. I think that trend continues. On the hardware side, again, as we see products coming in from Asia, it, you know, margins should get better. We saw improvement in warranty cost. Other efficiencies, and non-bomb cost, all of that could help.\nHowever, on the hardware side, the overall margin really depends on the mix of products sold, which is difficult to predict. So it is hard to call out an ideal state. There are a lot of moving parts there. And also overall, for margins, there is a factor of subscription revenue as a percentage of overall revenue. If that improves, obviously, go up. But as we start selling more hardware, that could impact overall margins.\nRick Wilmer: The other comment I will make, Bill, is that the new products we expect to have higher baseline margin profiles than any of our existing products. We have been very focused on not only designing for features, functionality, broad applicability, but also for cost profile.\nManzi Katani: Yep. And then on the tariffs, so we have a lot of tariff mitigation already in place. We have, you know, a spread-out manufacturing base across the globe, which we are kind of leveraging to manage tariffs. It was not really meaningful within this quarter, and like I said, we were able to mitigate the tariffs that we had and whatever we did incur, we actually, you know, we had improvements that kind of overcame that. So I do not think there is that much of an impact on what we know today. Of course, if that tariff environment changes, then things could change.\nBill Peterson: Okay. Thanks for that. One of the\nOperator: My apologies. Please repress star one. Your next question comes from John Winham with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Winham: Hi. This is John. Hopefully, you can hear me okay?\nRick Wilmer: Yep.\nJohn Winham: Yeah. Perfect. You have mentioned a potential for consolidation in the industry. I was wondering if you could talk through if there have been any early signs of that in Europe or the US or anywhere you can sort of point to. Appreciate it. Thanks.\nRick Wilmer: Yeah, John. I cannot talk to anything specifically, but it seems like it is quite active. There are a lot of interesting conversations going on.\nJohn Winham: Maybe just ask the question sort of a little bit differently. And without asking anything specific, in terms of where it would be, what would you see the advantages as an analyst, when we are looking at this, it is taking out OpEx as a percentage of revenue, greater network scale. If you could just talk to what you think the advantage of consolidation would be, I would really appreciate it. Thank you so much.\nRick Wilmer: Yeah. I think it is pretty typical after you go through a hype cycle and you end up with, you know, a lot of companies getting started during that hype cycle with what looks like a, you know, an exciting fast-growing market, then you get overcrowding in terms of the competitive landscape. And you have got people that are trying to survive and they tend to try and fight on price. And they race each other to the bottom. And they end up in a situation where they just do not have an economic model that no longer makes sense.\nJohn Winham: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Pfingst with B. Riley. Please go ahead. And we have no further questions in our queue at this time. And that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.\nTrump’s Tariffs Could Create $1.5 Trillion AI Gold Rush\nThe Motley Fool’s analysts are tracking a massive shift in U.S. tech. Over $1.5 trillion is already flowing into infrastructure, AI, and advanced manufacturing… and the number keeps climbing.\nFollowing a major tariff policy shift, a new AI Gold Rush is taking shape, and we think the real winner is a company 1/100th the size of NVIDIA.\nIt builds the tech infrastructure that Apple, OpenAI, and others suddenly can’t live without. We just released a full write-up on this under-the-radar stock — and why now might be the exact moment to move.\n*Stock Advisor returns as of August 25, 2025\nThis article is a transcript of this conference call produced for The Motley Fool.

XRP has Elliott Wave theory bullish setups, he said.\nIf XRP can break the \"final boss\" resistance at $4–$4.50, it could reach $7–$10 in the next stage. If Wave 3 is strong, XRP could reach $20 or higher in a longer rally.\nBut as of September 3, XRP is now trading at $2.84, up 1.7% on the day, and nowhere near that ambitious target.\nThe question is now not just whether XRP will get to $20 — but when it will.\nXRP's bullish action\nThere are many things going for XRP right now. The legal clarity might offer pending ETF filings in 2025, which should grow to a wave of institutional capital. Data shows there has already been momentum in futures-based ETFs.\nTeucrium's 2X Long Daily ETF (XXRP) saw inflows for its 22nd consecutive week, adding $18.2 million last week to bring total assets to $355 million. XXRP is a leveraged ETF that aims to double XRP's daily price performance.\nMore news:\nMoreover, ProShares' Ultra XRP ETF (UXRP) has recently grown to $100 million since its launch.\nBetting markets on Polymarket now show nearly 88% odds of a Ripple ETF approval by year-end.\nXRP whales are back\nOn-chain signals are also supporting the bullish thesis. Whale wallets holding XRP have reached a record 2,850, indicating that large holders are accumulating. And, upgrades to the XRP Ledger (XRPL), including EVM sidechains and AMM fixes, are improving XRPL's role in DeFi and cross-border payments.\nCan XRP hit $20?\nTechnical signals favor the bullish outlook. The MACD crossed bullish, and the histogram went green, reflecting buyers' momentum.\nVolume data also presents more green spikes. Whales are returning, and bear pressure is decreasing.\nWith the price of XRP currently at $2.71, the digital asset has built a double bottom and broken out from bullish patterns such as a falling wedge and cup-and-handle.\nThe next major test is $3.20–$3.50, and exceeding it could either stall the move or clear the way for a move to $4–$5. While $20 is hard to hit in September, as the analyst pointed out, if the momentum holds, $20 could be the bull case.\nRelated: What is Bitcoin mining?

He has led the rally on X and generated plenty of fanfare along the way\nFrom June to August, Opendoor shares surged from $0.50 per share to more than $5 per share. However, the stock dropped close to $4 per share near the end of August. Jackson has been tweeting about the stock each day and recently cited seller manipulation as the reason for the stock's current decline.\n\"Let the shorts and sellers play their games,\" Jackson said in an X post at the end of August. \"The world will wake up to $82, $200, $500 – and this board will be long gone by then.\"\nDon't Miss:\n-\nWould You Have Invested in eBay or Uber Early?

Rabois believes the stock should be worth at least as much as Carvana (NASDAQ:CVNA), which would propel the stock past $82 per share. He wrote another X post that offered detailed solutions on fixing Opendoor, such as making every mortgage assumable, killing the agent partnership segment, and offering an innovative value proposition he teased that still remains under wraps.\nOpendoor stock has lost close to 90% of its value since its all-time high in 2021. Jackson and Rabois also believe the company's bad management has prevented it from capitalizing on promising opportunities that could have rewarded shareholders. Jackson believes that getting rid of the bad leadership and putting the right people in charge will unlock shareholder value.\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nNot Everyone Is Convinced\nAlthough Opendoor stock has enjoyed a substantial rally, some people believe it's a meme rally that is due for a crash.\n\"This guy just keeps sounding dumber and dumber.

If approved by shareholders, the new pay package could make Musk the world’s first trillion dollar executive, and would mark a new level of outsized pay in a country already known for extreme compensation. But the payoff is in shares, not cash, and the goals are extreme as well.\nMusk overcame doubters to turn Tesla into the world's most valuable car company, but he could face even steeper odds in hitting the targets set by the company's compensation committee — not least because of Tesla’s main business of making electric vehicles is currently in a slump, in part because of Musk's foray into right-wing politics.\n“It doesn’t matter how much money he gets. He can’t help himself,” said Telemetry analyst Sam Abuelsamid who follows Tesla stock, which has plummeted 27% from its December high. “And the more he talks, the more he turns off potential customers.”\nTo get his first package of shares equivalent to 1% of the company, Musk would have to convince investors in the stock market that Tesla is worth $2 trillion in total, double what they value it today, and also hit several other milestones. To receive all the shares offered and make him the world’s first trillion-dollar man would require that market value to then rise to $8.5 trillion, double that of the world’s most valuable company now, chipmaker Nvidia.\nAmong other goals, sales of all Tesla vehicles would eventually also have to reach 20 million, nearly triple its entire sales since it was founded more than two decades ago. Musk would also have to vastly expand Tesla's robot and robotaxi businesses by selling a million of the bots and a million of the driverless cabs, the latter a business that has only begun to roll out its taxi service and is behind rivals, such as Waymo.\nMusk would also need to remain with Tesla for at least seven and a half years to cash out on any stock, and 10 years to earn the full amount.\nMusk has been one of the richest people in the world for several years. He is currently estimated to be worth more than $400 billion by Forbes magazine.\nA condition of the 11th and 12th tranches of the plan includes Musk coming up with a framework for someone to succeed him as CEO.\nThe plunge in Tesla sales this year was largely due to blowback over Musk’s affiliation with President Donald Trump. Tesla also faces intensifying competition from the big Detroit automakers and particularly from China.\nTesla sales have fallen precipitously in Europe after Musk aligned with a far-right political party in German. Sales plunged 40% in July in the 27 European Union countries compared with the year earlier even as sales overall of electric vehicle soared, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. Meanwhile sales of Chinese rival BYD continued to climb fast, grabbing 1.1% market share of all car sales in the month versus Tesla’s 0.7%.\nWithout a reversal of those trends, meeting the financial goals could prove especially difficult. In its most recent quarter, Tesla reported that quarterly profits plunged from $1.39 billion to $409 million. Revenue also fell and the company came up short of even the lowered expectations on Wall Street.\nInvestors have grown increasingly worried about the trajectory of the company after Musk had spent so much time in Washington this year, becoming one of the most prominent officials in the Trump administration in its bid to slash the size of the U.S. government.\nEven bulls on the stock are not convinced the new pay incentive will keep Musk, who frequently posts on his X social media platform, from saying things that alienate potential buyers.\nSaid Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, “Fixing the Musk brand damage remains a work in progress.\" Even so, Ives told clients, “We believe this was the smart move by the Board as the biggest asset for Tesla is Musk.”\nIn January 2024, a Delaware judge threw out Musk’s previous pay package, worth $44.9 billion at the time. Investors voted to restore that compensation package at Tesla’s last shareholders meeting on June 13 of last year. But late last year the package was revoked for a second time. Tesla has appealed the ruling. Last month, Tesla said that it gave Musk a stock grant of $29 billion as a reward for years of “transformative and unprecedented” growth — despite the drop in sales and profits — and noting that the CEO hadn’t been paid in years.\nThe EV company is set to hold its annual shareholders meeting on Nov. 6, where investors will vote on the new pay package.

Here's what's making news in the markets:\nWelcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.\nBitcoin is stuck in a holding pattern near $112,000, according to CoinDesk market data, but the bigger story onchain might be the divide emerging between how investors treat BTC and ETH heading into September. BTC is acting more like a macro hedge, while ETH is being positioned as the real vehicle for upside.\nThat split reflects a mix of policy uncertainty and shifting trader flows. In a recent note, QCP Capital wrote that doubts about the Fed’s independence are keeping term premiums elevated, a setup that weakens the dollar and supports hedges like BTC and gold.\nBut options desks and prediction markets show momentum gathering in ETH instead, where traders see the most potential for a breakout.\nFlowdesk reported muted implied volatility in BTC despite pullbacks, suggesting positioning rather than speculative bets. Skew remains negative, meaning puts are expensive, but that creates relative value in call structures. ETH risk reversals, meanwhile, have recovered from their recent selloff, indicating renewed demand for upside exposure.\nSOL options also saw increased activity, with flows skewed to the upside on growing sentiment around its ecosystem and corporate Digital Asset Treasury initiatives. Spot activity rotated into ETH beta names like AAVE and AERO, as well as SOL betas like RAY and DRIFT, showing breadth widening beyond majors.\nPrediction markets back this rotation theme. Polymarket sentiment reinforces the rotation. Traders expect BTC to stay capped near $120k, while ETH is given a strong chance of breaking $5,000 — a view consistent with its 20% monthly rally and recovering risk reversals.\nTraders are increasingly treating BTC as a steady macro hedge, while ETH is emerging as the market’s high-conviction upside play into September.\nEurope-based market maker Flowdesk wrote in a recent Telegram update that activity on the desk remains high, with clients broadly positioned for upside even as macro risks linger and seasonal volatility tends to pick up.\nThe macro backdrop sets the hedge case, trading flows show how positioning is shifting, and prediction markets validate it with real-money bets. Together, they sketch a market where BTC anchors as a governance and inflation hedge, ETH leads on performance, and SOL builds momentum as breadth improves.", "content_hash": "81efba4854bf9b4df0eb3069dadb1e7c", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Here's What Worked For People Who Used To Be In Debt.\nPaying off credit card debt can help you establish a good financial foundation, make investments, and build your nest egg so you can retire early. Most people know this, but it's not a common practice.\nAccording to Bankrate, 46% of credit cardholders report having a credit card balance. Furthermore, 23% of people do not think they will ever pay off their credit card debt.\nHowever, some people end up paying off their credit card debt, even if it previously looked insurmountable. Several credit cardholders who paid off their debt recently shared what inspired them to get out of debt in a lengthy Reddit post.\nDon't Miss:\n-\nThe same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.\n-\nKevin O'Leary Loves ‘Wonderful Recurring Cash Flows' — These Small Industrial Assets Deliver Just That\nCalculate Interest Payments\nMultiple Redditors said that their inspiration for paying off credit card debt was seeing how much they were paying in interest. Those small interest payments can add up, especially since credit cards are notorious for having high APRs.\n\"For me, it was realizing the interest alone was eating up more than my rent every year. Basically paying thousands for nothing,\" one commenter said. \"[That] made me get aggressive about debt payoff.\"\nGetting aggressive about debt payoff may require tough sacrifices and pursuing more ambitious goals. Some commenters suggested getting a higher-paying job, cutting down on travel and dining, and learning about personal finance.\nTrending: Dump Your Financial Advisors. One AI Platform Manages Everything — With Zero AUM Fees. Book Your Demo Today.\nAre You Prepared For An Emergency?\nOne Redditor is on the path to becoming debt-free and saving more money. This individual said that their inspiration came from asking uncomfortable questions about what they would do if an emergency came up.\n\"It's hard to prepare for things when you don't have the means. It's gonna be a while until I'm in a good spot, but it's getting better over time, so that helps my mental [health] immensely,\" the commenter said.\nIf you do not have an emergency fund, you may have to take out a loan for a surprise expense that must be addressed right away. A loan results in more interest and puts you deeper into debt. Each time you address an emergency with this approach, it puts you deeper into debt and limits your options in retirement.\nSee Also: From Chipotle to Red Bull, Top Brands Are Already Building With Modern Mill's Tree-Free Wood Alternative — Here's How You Can Invest Too\nRealizing That You're On Your Own\nOne Redditor's big moment that caused them to pay off credit card debt was realizing that they were on their own. Many children are used to having their parents cover basic expenses and bail them out in certain scenarios. However, that doesn't happen as much as you get older, and some parents expect their children to be completely independent once they are in their 20s.", "content_hash": "af0227798d8cc13dbdcd612585151855", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

(WM) operates as a leading provider of comprehensive waste management services in North America. Its offerings include collection, transfer, recycling, and resource recovery, as well as disposal services to residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal customers.\nCompanies worth $10 billion or more are generally described as “large-cap stocks.” WM fits this bill perfectly. Given the company’s extensive operations and dominance in the waste management industry, its valuation above this mark is unsurprising.\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nTesla Now Has an India Problem. What Does That Mean for Hard-Hit TSLA Stock?\n-\nCoreWeave Just Gave This Data Center Stock a Big Boost.

Meanwhile, the stock has declined 6.6% over the past three months, notably underperforming the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLI) 4.2% uptick during the same time frame.\nOver the longer term, WM stock prices have surged 11.2% on a YTD basis and gained 7.2% over the past 52 weeks, lagging behind XLI’s 13.7% gains in 2025 and 16.5% returns over the past year.\nTo confirm the overall uptrend and recent downturn, WM stock has traded mostly above its 200-day moving average over the past year with some fluctuations. Meanwhile, the stock has dropped below its 50-day moving average in recent weeks.\nWaste Management’s stock prices rose 3.4% in the trading session following the release of its impressive Q2 results on Jul. 28. The quarter was marked with robust organic revenue growth in its collection and disposal business, along with margin expansion. The company achieved its best-ever operating expense margin during the quarter.\nOverall, WM’s operating revenues surged 19% year-over-year to $6.4 billion, exceeding the Street expectations by 1.4%. Meanwhile, its adjusted EBITDA increased 18.9% year-over-year to $1.9 billion. Further, its adjusted EPS of $1.92 surpassed the consensus estimates by 1.6%.\nHowever, Waste Management has underperformed its peer, Republic Services, Inc.’s (RSG) 15.6% gains on a YTD basis and 13% surge over the past 52 weeks.\nAmong the 23 analysts covering the WM stock, the overall consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” As of writing, its mean price target of $260.71 suggests a 16.2% upside potential from current price levels.\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Sarawgi did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

(WM) operates as a leading provider of comprehensive waste management services in North America. Its offerings include collection, transfer, recycling, and resource recovery, as well as disposal services to residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal customers.\nCompanies worth $10 billion or more are generally described as “large-cap stocks.” WM fits this bill perfectly. Given the company’s extensive operations and dominance in the waste management industry, its valuation above this mark is unsurprising.\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nTesla Now Has an India Problem. What Does That Mean for Hard-Hit TSLA Stock?\n-\nCoreWeave Just Gave This Data Center Stock a Big Boost. Should You Buy Shares Now?\nWM stock touched its all-time high of $242.58 on Jun. 3 and is currently trading 7.5% below that peak. Meanwhile, the stock has declined 6.6% over the past three months, notably underperforming the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLI) 4.2% uptick during the same time frame.\nOver the longer term, WM stock prices have surged 11.2% on a YTD basis and gained 7.2% over the past 52 weeks, lagging behind XLI’s 13.7% gains in 2025 and 16.5% returns over the past year.\nTo confirm the overall uptrend and recent downturn, WM stock has traded mostly above its 200-day moving average over the past year with some fluctuations. Meanwhile, the stock has dropped below its 50-day moving average in recent weeks.\nWaste Management’s stock prices rose 3.4% in the trading session following the release of its impressive Q2 results on Jul. 28. The quarter was marked with robust organic revenue growth in its collection and disposal business, along with margin expansion. The company achieved its best-ever operating expense margin during the quarter.\nOverall, WM’s operating revenues surged 19% year-over-year to $6.4 billion, exceeding the Street expectations by 1.4%. Meanwhile, its adjusted EBITDA increased 18.9% year-over-year to $1.9 billion. Further, its adjusted EPS of $1.92 surpassed the consensus estimates by 1.6%.\nHowever, Waste Management has underperformed its peer, Republic Services, Inc.’s (RSG) 15.6% gains on a YTD basis and 13% surge over the past 52 weeks.\nAmong the 23 analysts covering the WM stock, the overall consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” As of writing, its mean price target of $260.71 suggests a 16.2% upside potential from current price levels.\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Sarawgi did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

In a statement that investors everywhere celebrated, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta - the same judge who ruled Google was illegally operating a monopoly last year - decided yesterday that the Department of Justice’s proposed penalties for the company were too harsh.\nThe result? Google is no longer under threat of being broken up and forced to sell Chrome, which represents a significant part of what makes Google’s search and advertising businesses so successful.\nTo be clear, the other penalties are still on the table, though. Google’s been ordered to share indexing and data with competitors to “level the playing field,” and the company’s now barred from exclusive contracts.\nBut how should you play this? Obviously, the markets made their sentiment known - as you can see from the 5-day chart.\nWith that out of the way, I see two strategies that you can use to capitalize on this potential bull run, each banking on upside price movement but offering different ways to earn money.\nSo, let’s take a look at long calls and bull puts.\nLong Call\nLong calls are single-leg option strategies that function as a directional bet on an underlying asset. In this case, you want the stock price to increase.\nBuying a long call option gives you control of 100 shares of the stock, at a fraction of the price. Of course, the level of exposure isn’t the same as owning 100 shares of the stock, but if you’re willing to pay top dollar and firmly believe that Google isn’t done climbing yet, then you can get option contracts that reflect 80% or more of the underlying’s price movement. That’s called delta, the options Greek that indicates the relationship between the premium and the stock price movement.\nA delta of 80 means that the premiums are expected to increase 80 cents for every $1 increase in the underlying asset. The thing is, high-delta long calls are always in the money, which means their premiums will be higher. Let’s take a look at just how high, with GOOGL as the underlying asset.\nFinding An 80 Delta Long Call Trade\nThe first thing you need to do is go to Barchart.com and search for Alphabet. Once on the stock’s profile page, go to the left-hand navigation panel and click Long Call/Put.\nYou’ll be brought straight to the results page, where you’ll see suggested trades for the nearest expiration date.\nNow, when buying in-the-money or deep ITM call options, it's usually best to select a contract that expires further into the future. This trade has less exposure to time decay and allows for more time for the trade to work out in your favor. Let’s look for trades that will expire in three months by adjusting the expiration to December 19, 2025.\nAnd there we have it, a 79-delta ITM trade. According to the screener, you can buy a 205-strike call on GOOGL for $33.45 per share or $3,345 total. The breakeven price is $238.45, just roughly $8 away from Google’s current trading price. The relatively close breakeven price is another advantage of ITM calls.\nBy the way, delta also works as a shorthand indicator of the probability of profit. For long calls, this particular trade has a 79.3% chance of profiting.\nBest-case scenario, GOOGL trades above $238.45 with still ample time left in your contract. That way, you can sell the option for a tidy profit. Worst-case, Google falls below your $205 strike price, and you lose the premium paid.\nBull Put\nNow, if you still want to participate in GOOGL’s potential upward momentum but don’t have $3,000 to fork out on an ITM long call, I recommend having a look at the bull put options strategy.\nA bull put is an intermediate-level options trading strategy that involves buying a put and selling another at a higher strike price on the same underlying asset with the same expiration date.\nThe strategy aims to profit from the asset's anticipated moderately bullish price movement - emphasis on moderately, because there’s a point where you would have gotten a lot more money if you’d just bought an OTM long call instead.\nSetting up a bull put spread results in a net credit. Essentially, you’re getting paid upfront, and if Google goes up beyond your short strike, you get to keep the premium.\nFinding High-Potential Bull Put Trades\nBull put trade suggestions can be found in the Verital Spreads page.\nFor credit spreads, I like to give my trades time, but not too much. So, I’ll switch the expiration to October 3, 30 days from now.\nAnd here, we can find the suggested trades. Another trading preference of mine is limiting my loss probabilities to 30% or less when selling credit spreads, while still earning enough premium to make the trade worthwhile. So, I’ll pick the second one on the list here:\nAccording to this trade, you can sell a 225-strike short put on GOOGL and get $4.60 per share. At the same time, you can buy a 205-strike long put and pay $1.07, bringing your effective net credit to $3.53 or $353 total per contract (that’s just credit less debit for calculation, times 100 for the total amount). The trade has a 30.6% chance of ending at a loss.\nThe great thing about bull put spreads is that they have defined risks. With this setup, as long as Google trades above $225 at expiration, your trade is profitable. However, if the stock falls below your $205 long strike, your losses are also limited to the difference between the strikes ($225 - $205 = $20), less your net credit ($20 - $3.53 = $16.47).\nFinal Thoughts\nLong calls and a bull put spreads are both bullish strategies, but the difference lies in the execution and the results. For long calls, you’re anticipating that call options will be more expensive before your contract’s expiration, so you can sell them at a profit. For bull puts, the goal is for the stock to trade above your short strike.\nAt the end of the day, your trading preference will help you decide which one fits better. Just be aware that, like with everything else in the market, there are risks involved. So, monitor your positions and always be ready to cut your losses, if required.\nOn the date of publication, Rick Orford did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

On September 1, Citi reiterated its Buy rating on Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd (NYSE:BABA), while increasing its price target from $148 to $187. The huge increase in the price target comes after the company reported stellar Q1 Fiscal Year 2026 results on August 29. The renewed price target implies an upside of 37.19% from the current price of $136.3 on September 3.\nCiti was impressed by the company’s solid cloud growth and noted that the management sees growth sustaining going forward. The company’s Cloud Intelligence Group generated revenue of $4.66 billion in Q1, a solid 26% growth year-over-year. The stock has surged by over 13% since reporting earnings.\nAlibaba’s domestic e-commerce platforms Taobao and Tmall reported a 10% year-over-year growth in Q1, which was driven by a 10% increase in customer management fees. The company’s push towards faster local delivery has yielded returns, with its quick commerce revenue rising 12% year-over-year.\nAlibaba reported an EPS of $2.058 per share, beating Wall Street estimates of $1.977 per share. The company’s net margin expanded to 17.41%, compared to 5.24% in the previous quarter and 12.99% in the previous fiscal year. The stock is currently trading at a more than reasonable forward P/E of 15.83x, which is well below many global tech peers.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of BABA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

As of September 3, the stock was trading at $161.52, which means the new price target implies an upside of 31.87%.\nAccording to the analyst, customers are finally starting to take AMD seriously. Instead of just being a backup option or a bargaining chip against Nvidia, AMD is now being considered for some pretty large AI projects.\nStein argued that AMD’s situation today is a lot like when it first started gaining traction in the server chip space. Back then, it had less than 1% of the market until the launch of its “Rome” chips, which helped it grab a bigger slice as Intel ran into issues.\nLooking ahead, the analyst thinks AMD could eventually grab about 10% of the burgeoning GPU market, compared to the current 6%. He’s also raised his earnings forecast and now sees AMD earning $7.89 per share by 2027. To put that in context, the current year EPS estimates stand at $3.85 per share. Stein expects that to more than double in two years as the company is expected to grow its revenue as well as expand margins. A big part of that confidence comes from AMD’s new MI355 chip, which he expects will play a major role in the company’s growth moving forward.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

As of September 3, the stock was trading at $98.79, giving the stock a 12-month upside potential of 26.5%, based on Tigress’ new price target.\nTigress cited that the company demonstrated “robust” sales growth along with significant advancements in the digital and omnichannel segments and increased operating efficiency. The firm pointed out that its new price target represents a total return, which includes dividends, of close to 30%.\nWalmart’s revenue in Q2 grew by a steady 4.76% to $177.4 billion. The growth was driven by the company’s U.S. comparable sales, which rose 4.6% year-over-year, which, in turn, was fueled by growth in the grocery and health & wellness segments.\nTo Tigress’s point of increased operating efficiency, the company’s net margin in Q2 expanded to a solid 3.96%, which is much higher than the average discount retailer in the US, which is typically slightly below 3%.\nThe management increased its full-year outlook for net sales to 3.75%-4.75% and adjusted EPS to $2.52-$2.62 per share, compared to $2.51 it reported for Fiscal Year 2025.

See our Advertiser Disclosure.\nHow long will mortgage rates remain in the mid- to upper-6% range? Mortgage interest rates are determined by many factors, a major one being the 10-year Treasury yield. At Yahoo Finance, we’ve designed a five-year mortgage rate forecast, built on a 10-year yield correlation, that provides some insight.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nRead more: The best mortgage lenders right now\nMortgage rates are tuned to the government bond market\nMortgage rate forecasts might best be derived from 10-year Treasury note trends. While the two rates often track in the same direction, there is a spread between them that we will account for below.\nFirst, let's understand where Treasury yields are headed in the next five years. We'll combine human analysis with data pulled from artificial intelligence to put together a prediction.\nEconomists' 5-year forecast for Treasury rates\nMichael Wolf is a global economist at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd. In June, the Deloitte Global Economics Research Center issued an updated U.S. economic forecast in which Wolf laid out the firm's Treasury yield expectations over the next five years.\n\"We expect the 10-year Treasury yield to hover near 4.5% for the remainder of this year, despite a softening in economic data and a 50-basis-point cut from the Fed in the fourth quarter of 2025,\" he wrote. \"The 10-year Treasury yield begins to decline slowly in 2026, falling to 4.1% by 2027 and remaining there through the end of 2029.\"\nLet's chart that forecast.\nThat's not much movement. Goldman Sachs analysts agree, saying the 10-year Treasury will remain near 4.1% through 2027.\nMeanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasts the Treasury yield to be 4.1% by the end of 2025, down to 4% in 2026 and remaining near 3.9% through 2029.\nDig deeper: When will mortgage rates go down?\nEstimating a 5-year spread\nAs we mentioned up top, the 10-year Treasury and 30-year fixed mortgage rates are separated by a spread. That difference between the two has been on either side of 2.5 percentage points in recent years. That's a significant change when compared to the spread from 2010 to 2020 when it was under two percentage points — and often near 1.5.\nUsing a 2.5 percentage point spread, here's an example of how Treasurys and mortgage rates compare:\n10-year Treasury rate = 4%\nSpread = 2.5 percentage points\nMortgage rates = 6.5%\nHere's a recent example: As of the last week of August, the 10-year Treasury yield was 4.24%, and the 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.56%. The spread was 6.56 - 4.23 = 2.23 percentage points.\nThe latest version of artificial intelligence, GPT-5, suggested using a spread of 2.1 to 2.3 percentage points. Here is its rationale:\n-\nHistorical standard (2010s): ~1.7 pp\n-\nRecent years (2022 to 2025): ~2.6 pp\n-\nEstimated 5-year average spread: ~2.1 to 2.3 percentage points\nUsing these spread estimates, we can now complete our five-year mortgage rate forecast.\nRead more: How to get the lowest mortgage rate possible\nThe 5-year mortgage rate forecast\nUsing the Treasury forecast from above, we add the spread between the bond market and 30-year fixed mortgage rates to compile a five-year forecast:\nLearn more: When will mortgage rates go back down to 6%?\nThe margin of error\nOf course, these are long-range estimates based on historical norms and broad expectations. All of these numbers could be thrown out the window if any of the following happens:\n-\n10-year Treasurys outperform or underperform the forecast. For example, yields could crash in a severe economic setback, such as a recession.\n-\nThe spread between Treasurys and mortgage rates narrows — or dramatically expands.\n-\nMonetary policy, as driven by the Federal Reserve, substantially changes.\nMortgage rate predictions for the next 5 years FAQs\nWill we ever see a 3% mortgage rate again?\nThere is no forecast that predicts a 3% mortgage rate in the next five years. However, who saw such low home loan rates on the horizon in 2007 when rates were about where they are now? Things like the Great Recession and a global pandemic are rarely on the radar, and such black swan events are what it takes to move mortgage rates into the cellar.\nWhat will mortgage rates be in 2027?\nThe analysis above predicts 2027 mortgage rates to be around 6.2% to 6.4%.\nWill mortgage rates drop in the next 5 years?\nBased on the estimates above, rates are not expected to drastically drop in the next five years. However, a recession or other unknown disruption to the economy (such as a financial collapse or pandemic) could change the outlook.\nIs it better to fix a rate for 2 or 5 years?\nIf you are considering an adjustable-rate mortgage with an initial fixed-rate period, you'll first want to consider how long you'll actually remain in the house you are financing. Then the long-term mortgage rate forecasting begins. The best idea is probably to choose the initial term that best fits your current budget.\nLaura Grace Tarpley edited this article.", "content_hash": "41267ec1d52cd0bc9a05b7d5322a31c8", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on CNI. Canadian National Railway Company's share was trading at $97.25 as of August 27th. CNI’s trailing and forward P/E were 18.43 and 17.48 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nCanadian National Railway (CNI) stands as a leading North American rail operator with a deeply entrenched competitive moat. The company’s 20,000-mile rail network is irreplaceable, handling a wide range of goods from grain to consumer products, ensuring stable demand across economic cycles. The structural barriers to entry in the railroad industry are immense, requiring billions in capital investment and extensive regulatory approvals, which effectively eliminate the risk of new competitors. This entrenched position makes CNI a critical backbone of North American supply chains and the transport safety network.\nFrom a financial perspective, the company is conservative yet shareholder-friendly, offering a dividend yield of roughly 2.1% backed by a 28-year track record of consecutive dividend increases and a payout ratio of only 48%, underscoring sustainability. CNI also maintains a prudent balance sheet with a low debt-to-equity ratio of 0.7, affording it resilience and flexibility even in periods of market stress. These characteristics make CNI not just a stable income generator but also a defensive asset in downturns, appealing to long-term investors seeking capital preservation.\nLooking forward, CNI’s strategic importance to trade flows, combined with its ability to generate reliable free cash flow, positions it well to remain a dependable income source with room for gradual capital appreciation during economic recoveries. While growth prospects are modest compared to high-growth industries, the combination of a durable moat, disciplined financials, and consistent dividend growth makes Canadian National Railway a compelling investment for those prioritizing stability and dependable returns.\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Canadian National Railway Company (CNI) by Max Dividends in May 2025, which highlighted its wide-moat network, dividend strength, and resilience against tariff disputes. The company’s stock price has been flat, appreciated by 0.4% since our coverage. This is because the earlier concerns proved temporary. The thesis still stands as fundamentals remain intact.

The net margin in Q2 stood at 56.53%, beating Q4’s 56.17%. The company’s net margin for Q1 was affected by inventory write-offs in China, but was still at a healthy 42.61%. The fact that the company can charge such a high premium shows the clout it has among big tech hyperscalers.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

The company primarily serves the U.S., though it operates in 32 countries, focusing on high-skilled, high-impact roles that are less economically sensitive and command premium fees. Contract talent solutions drive 56% of revenue, permanent placement 8%, and Protiviti consulting 35%. Its decades of placement data provide a natural edge for AI-driven matching tools, supporting faster, more precise placements and higher margins.\nThe company has experienced a sharp decline of over 70% from 2022 highs, presenting a potential investment opportunity. Robert Half has historically delivered exceptional returns on capital, with ROIC and ROCE averaging around 39–40% since 2000, alongside a rock-solid balance sheet featuring zero debt and $380 million in cash. Shareholders benefit from a 6.4% dividend and 2.5% annual buybacks, yielding roughly 9% while the business rebounds. Revenues tend to lag temporary help trends by 2–3 quarters, highlighting strong data correlation and predictable recovery patterns.\nKey risks include a potential recession, competitive pressure in a fragmented staffing market, management alignment, and execution of AI initiatives. However, the company appears well-positioned to navigate these challenges due to its reputation, client relationships, and operational efficiency. A conservative valuation based on 2028 projected revenue of $6.43 billion, FCF of $514 million, and a 17x multiple suggests a potential share price of $94.70, representing a 163% upside from the current $36 stock price, or a 33% CAGR over 3.4 years.

PSTG’s trailing and forward P/E were 190.20 and 41.15 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nPure Storage (PSTG) has rewarded investors with strong returns, up 112% over the past two years, though its trajectory has been volatile. The company delivered robust Q2 2025 results, with revenue climbing 13% year-over-year to $861 million, surpassing expectations and prompting an upward revision to full-year guidance. PSTG’s value proposition lies in its advanced flash memory technology, which not only delivers faster and more reliable data access but also reduces energy consumption by 80% compared to legacy hard disk systems. This sustainability advantage has fueled customer adoption, exemplified by a $390 million contract with Meta, underscoring the company’s ability to win large-scale deals and maintain a competitive edge.\nDespite these operational tailwinds and a long runway for growth, the stock is not trading at a discount, and current levels may not represent the most attractive entry point. While PSTG continues to execute effectively, prospective investors may benefit from waiting for consolidation, with the $72 range—where the stock traded prior to April’s Liberation Day rally—emerging as a potential buying zone.

Initially passed over due to its limited track record as a young public company, deeper analysis and rapid business progress led to a portfolio allocation of 8.7%. The near-term risk appears low, supported by a valuation that already prices in conservative growth assumptions, while the upside could be substantial if management’s projections hold. Even achieving 80% of guided growth over the next 12 months would leave the stock attractively valued, with potential for a multibagger outcome should Nebius sustain momentum.\nNebius’s business model is built on a cycle where superior infrastructure performance drives revenue growth, which in turn supports margin expansion and reinvestment into R&D and verticalization. Early data points show improving gross margins versus rival Coreweave, though it is too early to declare a durable edge. Operating profit and free cash flow remain pressured by heavy GPU-related capex and depreciation, with $510 million spent in Q2 alone, underscoring the capital intensity of scaling AI infrastructure.

(QLYS) represents a rare technology company that aligns closely with Berkshire Hathaway’s disciplined investment methodology, combining understandable operations, proven earnings, a durable economic moat, financial prudence, and attractive valuation. As a cybersecurity and compliance software provider, Qualys delivers cloud-based solutions that help enterprises manage IT risk, monitor vulnerabilities, and ensure regulatory compliance.\nIts subscription-driven model generates sticky, recurring revenue, creating high switching costs and long-term customer relationships. The company has consistently expanded revenue and earnings, with five-year EPS growth of 21.5% and revenue per share rising 10.7% annually, supported by robust profitability metrics, including 31% operating margins, 29% net margins, and a return on equity of 39%.\nQualys’s economic moat is reinforced by integration complexity, trust, and reputation, creating high barriers to entry for competitors. Its balance sheet is exceptionally strong, with over $381 million in cash against minimal debt, a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.11, and a low weighted average cost of capital, reflecting prudent financial management consistent with Buffett’s emphasis on low leverage. Valuation analysis suggests a fair value of $179–$202 per share, implying a 25–34% margin of safety relative to the current trading price of $134.54.\nThe company’s simple, subscription-based model, consistent earnings growth, durable competitive advantages, and conservative financial profile make it a compelling Buffett-style investment in the technology sector. While many tech firms fail to meet Berkshire’s criteria due to complexity or fragile moats, Qualys’s business resembles a utility in the digital economy, delivering predictable cash flows, high returns on capital, and a margin of safety that supports long-term investment.

Non-GAAP margins rose to 53.2%, reflecting operational efficiency, while GAAP results were impacted by a $42 million goodwill impairment, resulting in a $16.2 million operating loss. Adjusted operating margins remained healthy at 18.8%, and EPS losses of -$0.31 beat projections, marking a sharp improvement from last year. Management expects continued momentum in Q3, with revenue around $266 million, operating margins near 19.6%, and EPS projected at $0.44, signaling confidence in growth and efficiency.\nSemtech’s data center segment emerged as a key growth driver, posting a 92% year-over-year increase and accounting for 36% of the signal integrity division’s revenue. Unlike cyclical IoT products, this business benefits from hyperscaler capital spending, driven by AI infrastructure investments from AWS, Microsoft, Google, and Alibaba. Central to this growth is Semtech’s Linear Pluggable Optics (LPO), which reduces latency, power consumption, and deployment costs while enabling 800G and 1.6T interconnect speeds for AI workloads.

With roughly 20 active hyperscaler engagements and 100G–200G launches expected in 2026, Semtech is positioned to capture a meaningful share of hyperscaler spending across optical and copper solutions. Analysts remain bullish, citing strong data center growth, improving margins, and innovative products, while management continues to focus on growth, debt reduction, and acquisition integration, setting the stage for sustained momentum into 2026.\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd (CRDO) by Nikhs in March 2025, highlighting its rise as an AI infrastructure leader through Active Electrical Cables, strong Q3 revenue growth, and a system-level competitive moat. The stock has appreciated approximately 164% since coverage. The thesis still stands as growth continues. TechIt_alt shares a similar perspective but emphasizes Semtech’s data center expansion via Linear Pluggable Optics and CopperEdge solutions.", "content_hash": "7b13a3df5ea2b73841430d4eae00c88c", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Email pr@fool.com\nOn slide three, we're summarizing our key operational and financial highlights for Q2 2025. What governed Q2 2025 was our impressive fleet expansion, as within a single quarter, we took delivery of seven dry bulk ships, expanding our fleet by about 56% and reaching 19 non-Chinese-built vessels. Imperial Petroleum Inc. is now a company of a material size that operates a combined fleet of tanker and dry bulk ships. The majority of these dry bulk ship deliveries took place towards the end of the second quarter of 2025. Hence, these dry bulk ships did not have sufficient operating time to fully contribute to a bottom line. Nevertheless, our company continued the multi-year momentum of recurring profitable quarters.\nIn Q2 2025, we generated a profit of $12.8 million, corresponding to an earnings per share of $0.36. In spite of the second quarter being a weak seasonal period, especially for tankers, we managed to improve our profitability against the first quarter of 2025, mainly at the back of increased tanker time charter coverage that led to improved performance of our product tankers. During the second quarter of 2025, we did witness a turbulent market in terms of geopolitical events, mainly in June, with the brief Israel-Iran War. This conflict caused a spike in tanker rates and affected market sentiment due to the high risk of trade over moors closing.\nOur noticeable fleet expansion increased the fleet book value by about 55% against the previous quarter, and we now enjoy a fleet of about $350 million of book value. Imperial Petroleum Inc. continues to enjoy high liquidity as we entered the first half of 2025 with $212.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. We maintain a positive working capital and have sufficient quarterly cash flow generation, so we are able to preserve adequate liquidity throughout the periods. In spite of our expansion and our solid performance across the quarters, our company remains heavily undervalued.\nBased on June 30 financials and fleet market values, as per our management estimates, our net asset value per share is about $13.5, which is almost four times higher than our current market price. It's evident that our company's strong financial and operating performance, along with the positive prospects set forth through our fleet expansion, are not yet embedded in our share price. On slide four, we provide a summary of our current fleet deployment. About 80% of the fleet is currently under time charter, as customarily all our dry bulk ships are under short-term charter contracts.\nThe commercial strategy we currently follow for our dry bulk ship allows us to secure cash flow while minimizing commercial idle days and voyage costs. For the tankers, we currently have four vessels, two product tankers, and two Supramax in the spot market. The remaining five product tankers are under time charter employment, ranging from short-term to medium-term contracts. The increase in time charter coverage, which compared to the first quarter of 2025 was in the range of 10%, improved our net revenue margin and assisted our bottom line. On slide five, we're discussing the evolution of market rates for both tankers and bulk carriers.\nWhat is positive is that compared to the first half of 2025, daily rates have continued to strengthen for both tankers and bulk carriers. Looking at tanker rates, these are lower than the peak levels reached in the period 2022 to 2024, but still earnings remain robust compared to the ten-year average. Indicatively, it's reported that earnings for Supramax vessels are about 30% higher than the ten-year average. Rates for product tankers are almost 15% higher than the ten-year average. Within the second quarter of 2025, we witnessed a spike in rates around the Middle East region due to the brief Israel-Iran conflict.\nSince then, the rates have further strengthened, mainly as a result of OPEC unwinding production cuts and the newly imposed sanctions by both the U.S. and EU UK. The following June 25, rates for dry bulk vessels strengthened at the back of trade fundamentals such as improved steel margin in China and a boost of grain trade in Brazil. Currently, rates for Supramax have risen to harsh levels since May 24, ahead of U.S. grain season kickoff, and we currently enjoy solid rates in both segments we operate, which fills us with a cautious optimism as to what we anticipate for Q3 in 2025. On slide six, we're reviewing the tanker market.\nThe global oil tanker market has entered the second half of 2025 with a positive stance, but the market is still dominated by geopolitical and trade policy risks. The recent Israel-Iran tensions had a direct impact on energy infrastructure, leading to a sharp drop in Iranian exports. Ongoing negotiations on trade tariffs, such as the recent China-U.S. discussions, cause trade frictions that have a material impact on market sentiment. Moreover, the expanded sanctions on Russia and Iran could alter trade partners, further creating trade disruptions and rate volatility. Setting aside the market uncertainty, both oil demand and supply are set to rise in the remainder of 2025 and 2026, with supply expected to outpace demand.\nIn terms of supply, OPEC Plus has begun unwinding voluntary production cuts, adding 1.8 million barrels per day in 2025, an action that would positively affect the tanker rates. Looking at the tanker supply, this market is governed by restrained fleet growth, an aging fleet, and moderate demolition activity. The order book for the product tankers, MR2s, stands at 3.2% for the remainder of 2025 and 5.1% for 2026, and Supramax fleet growth is 3.5% up to 5.1% for 2026 and 9% for 2026. We also anticipate regulatory and environmental pressures to intensify demolition activity for older tonnage, a fact which will shrink vessel supply. On slide seven, we are discussing the dry bulk market.\nFollowing a softer first half, dry bulk trade has recently shown signs of rebounding. Since July 2025, dry bulk trade volumes have increased by 2% year on year. Ton mile growth for bulk carriers is expected to be moderate as Red Sea transits remain low, and any vessel rerouting back from the Red Sea in the near term looks unlikely. Any additional ton mile growth would be supported by the increase in local exports to China for Guinea bauxite and Brazil iron ore and grains. Indeed, Guinea-China box trade remains a key driver of dry bulk trade, particularly for large vessels, as departures were up 41% in the first half compared to the same period last year.\nMid-sized bulk carriers were supported by Brazil-China grain trade, U.S. corn trade, and Chinese steel exports. Overall, dry bulk trade is expected to remain relatively stable in the years ahead. In terms of fleet growth, we show 302 bulk carriers being delivered since the start of 2025. Current order book is 9% for Panamax-Capesize vessels, quite low for handy sizes at 6%, and reasonably big for Supramax-Ultramax at 11%. I'll now pass you the floor to Ms. Fenia Sakellari for the financial performance.\nFenia Sakellari: Thank you, Harry, and good morning to all. The second quarter of 2025 was a turning point for Imperial Petroleum Inc. Our fleet increased materially. Our recent acquisitions in Q2 2025 did not contribute significantly to our operations and profitability, as most of the vessels were delivered towards the end of the quarter. Nevertheless, within the second quarter of 2025, we managed to increase our profitability by 13% against the first quarter of 2025, generating a net income of $12.8 million. Focusing on the second quarter of 2024, though, this was exceptional as market rates were at their peak, much higher than in Q2 2025.\nIndicatively, it's mentioned that in Q2 2024, our daily fleet time charter equivalent was in the order of $35,200, while for Q2 2025, daily fleet time charter equivalent was about $20,700. Looking at our income statement for Q2 2025 on slide eight, revenues came in at $36.3 million, marking a $22.8 million decline compared to revenues generated in the same period of 2024. This decline stems from lower market rates. During Q2 2025, average daily spot rates for product tankers were $9,500 lower when compared to the same period of last year. In addition, average daily one-year time charter rates for product tankers were about $12,000 lower compared to prevailing rates in Q2 2024.\nVoyage costs amounted to $10.7 million, $6.4 million lower than when compared to Q2 2024. This decrease in voyage expenses is attributed to increased time charter activity by about 36%, leading to a decline in voyage costs, particularly bunker costs. In Q2 2025, embarkation costs were $5.2 million lower compared to the same period of last year. Running costs amounted to $8.4 million, increased by $1.9 million due to the increase of our fleet by an average of 3.8 vessels between the two periods. Overall, during the past year, we have witnessed a stabilization of daily operating costs across the quarters.\nOur average fleet operating costs oscillate between $6,400 to $6,700 per day, depending on maintenance and supply needs within each quarter. Dry docking costs amounted to $1.7 million, as this quarter one of our Suezmax tankers and one of our Supramax dry bulk carriers underwent dry docking. EBITDA for the second quarter of 2025 came in at $17.1 million, while net income at $12.8 million corresponded to a basic earnings per share of $0.36. For six months, EBITDA 2025, our EBITDA came in at $31.8 million. Our operating cash flow was $42 million, while our net income was $24.1 million, corresponding to an EPS of $0.67.\nOur current share price is about three times higher than our earnings per share for the last trailing 12 months, a sign that our profitability capacity is not adequately reflected in our company's valuation. Moving on to slide nine, let us take a look at our balance sheet for the six months of 2025. We enjoy a hefty cash base of close to $212 million. Within April 2025, we repaid about $40 million for the vessels CleanEpir and Neptulus. Nevertheless, we faced a marginal decline in our end-of-period cash balance, as robust cash flow generation allows preserved liquidity at high levels.\nOur fleet book values are shaded above $350 million, about 68% higher than end-of-year 2024 due to our vessel additions. Payable to related party balance mainly reflects the amount owed for recent vessel delivery, which was paid within July and August 2025. Proceeding to slide ten, we provide a summary of our liquidity, profitability, and market considerations going forward. We continue to enjoy a debt-free balance sheet and a solid cash flow generation. Within the first half of 2025, our operating cash flow was $42 million. Our profitability margin remains wide as market rates are favorable and significantly higher than our break-even levels.\nIn Q2 2025, our time charter equivalent per fleet voyage day was close to $21,000, while our daily average cash flow break-even is currently about $8,700 for tankers and close to $6,500 for our dry bulk carriers. In terms of market consideration, a focal point is the duration and next steps pertaining to the trade war, as well as OPEC further output increases, if any. For the dry carriers, it is important to see how demand will play out and whether the current level of rates can be sustained.\nConcluding our presentation with slide 11, we summarize yet once more our company's strong points, placing emphasis that we operate a quality-built fleet of tankers and dry bulk vessels that we strive to grow even further and have managed to demonstrate recurring profitability since the fourth quarter of 2021. At this stage, our CEO, Mr. Harry Vafias, will summarize our concluding remarks for the period examined.\nHarry Vafias: We are proud of completing our recent fleet expansion. This is an important milestone for us. Imperial Petroleum Inc. now operates a combined diversified fleet of nine tankers and ten bulk carriers, all non-Chinese-built vessels. In terms of our financials, we remain profitable, debt-free, and as of the end of Q2 2025, we held about $212 million in cash. In the first half of 2025, we generated $24.1 million of net profit and $42 million of operating cash flow. Market rates for both tankers and bulkers are currently favorable. Therefore, we hope that we will be able to take advantage of the second half of 2025, utilize our fleet at full speed, and produce even better results.\nWe'd like to thank you all for joining us at our conference call and for your interest and trust in our company, and we look forward to having you again with us at our next call for our Q3 results.

Most of the disparity in growth emerged after 2017.\nFigure 1: U.S. real GDP expanded 71% since 2000 while Mexico is up 49%\nComparing the performance of their equity markets is tricky. What makes the comparison challenging is that one can view the relative performance of U.S. and Mexican equities from different perspectives:\nLocal currency returns\nReturns in the same currency (USD for example)\nFrom a local currency return perspective, Mexico’s S&P BMV IPC Index has outperformed by a wide margin (Figure 2), but this ignores the fact that the Mexican peso (MXN) has declined by roughly 50% since 2000 (Figure 3).\nFigure 2: In local currency terms Mexican equities have outperformed U.S. stocks\nFigure 3: The peso has lost half its value against USD since the turn of the century\nWhen converted into the same currency, the overall returns since the year 2000 have been very similar, but the timing of the returns has been very different, with Mexico’s S&P BMV IPC Index outperforming from 2000 to 2012 while U.S. equity indices outperformed from 2012 onwards (Figure 4). This hints at the diversification potential of investing in Mexican equities alongside a portfolio of U.S. stocks.\nFigure 4: In USD, Mexican and US stocks have delivered similar performance since 2000\nIndeed, the correlation between Mexican and U.S. equities, while occasionally as high as +0.8 from 2007 to 2012, has been ranging from +0.2 to +0.6 on a one-year rolling basis for the past dozen years (Figure 6). Part of this may be a reflection of the fact that Mexico’s underlying sector composition is very different from U.S. indices (Table 1).\nTable 1: Mexico’s S&P BMV IPC has vastly different sector weighting than the S&P 500\nSource: Bloomerg Professional IMAP\nMexico has a much higher weighting to consumer staples and materials stocks, a much lower weighting to consumer discretionary and no weighting at all to information technology stocks – the S&P 500’s biggest sector – or to energy or utility stocks. Despite the S&P BMV IPC Index’s high weighting to consumer staples and materials stocks, its correlation with the S&P 500 sectors has not been particularly high during the past year either (Figure 6), suggesting strong diversification potential from S&P 500 E-Mini Select Sector Futures as well.\nFigure 5: Mexico’s S&P BMV IPC’s correlation with U.S. equities has weakened since 2016\nFigure 6: S&P BMV IPC has not displayed strong correlations with U.S. sectors\nInvestors tend to see MXN itself as a risk asset. When equities are going higher, MXN often rises versus USD. However, MXN tends to be somewhat more highly correlated to the S&P 500 than to Mexico’s S&P BMV IPC Index. This suggests that a stronger peso tends to weigh somewhat on Mexico’s stocks as a stronger currency will make it more expensive for Americans to buy Mexico’s products (Figure 7). Indeed 72% of Mexico’s exports head to the U.S. (Figure 8).\nFigure 7: Both Mexican and U.S. equities have a positive correlation to the peso\nFigure 8: 72% of Mexico’s exports head to the U.S.\nMexico’s economy may be on a rather different trajectory than the U.S. in the years ahead. Faced with higher tariffs, Mexico’s central bank has been actively cutting rates while the Fed has been on hold, narrowing the gap between the two countries’ central bank policy rates (Figure 9).\nFigure 9: Mexico’s central bank has been steadily cutting rates this year\nAs is the case in the U.S. and many other countries, Mexico’s core inflation rate has begun to creep higher. That said, Mexico’s central bank appears to believe that U.S. tariffs will push Mexico’s inflation lower as Mexico potentially finds itself flooded with Chinese, European Korean, Japanese and even non-U.S.M.C.A. compliant Mexican goods once destined for the U.S. (Figure 10).\nFigure 10: Mexico’s core inflation rate has picked up slightly\nFor the moment, Mexico’s unemployment rate remains at historically low levels at just above 2.5% (Figure 11). This is a contrast to the U.S. where unemployment rates hit bottom in 2023 and have begun to rise slightly (Figure 12).\nFigure 11: Mexico’s unemployment rate is near record lows\nFigure 12: U.S. unemployment has been moving slightly higher\nPerhaps the most striking differences between the U.S. and Mexican economies are in the realm of debt. U.S. debt to GDP ratios across the public and private sectors add up to 250% of GDP, including a public debt of over 100% of GDP (Figure 13). This contrasts very sharply with Mexico, whose total debt comes to just 81% of GDP, of which public debt is 43.6% of annual national output (Figure 14).\nFigure 13: The U.S. has rather high levels of public and private sector debt\nFigure 14: Mexico’s debt levels are relatively low\nFinally, there is the issue of valuations. Mexico’s S&P/BMV IPC Index trades at 13.96x trailing earnings compared to 24.66x for the S&P 500 and 33.32x for the Nasdaq 100. This reflects in part the different sector makeup of the indices, with the U.S. averages more heavily weighted towards tech stocks, which typically command higher earnings multiples. It also reflects differing levels of interest rates, with Mexican 10Y swaps at 7.9% while their U.S. equivalents are trading at half that level around 3.69%.\nAll these factors suggest that Mexican and U.S. equities could remain on different trajectories in the years ahead and that Mexican stocks could offer an interesting diversification opportunity to capital allocated to the U.S. market.\nAll examples in this report are hypothetical interpretations of situations and are used for explanation purposes only.

Subscribe to our free daily Wealthmanagement newsletter.\n(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s top market regulators are looking to better align US rules across agencies after years of industry complaints about how their rules and requirements sometimes conflict and can be repetitive.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said Friday that they’ll hold a Sept. 29 event to discuss “regulatory harmonization.” Those efforts might include streamlining margin and capital frameworks, reporting standards, and harmonizing product and venue definitions, the agencies said in a press statement.\nThe agencies will also discuss regulation of new product categories and market developments, from prediction markets and perpetual futures to 24/7 trading in both their markets, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins told reporters.\nUnlike many countries that have one primary regulator for financial markets, in the US, the SEC keeps tabs on stock and bond activities while the CFTC regulates derivatives trading. The split means that both agencies oversee units of Wall Street banks, hedge funds and other major financial firms.\n“By working in lockstep, our two agencies can harness our nation’s unique regulatory structure into a source of strength for market participants, investors and Americans,” Atkins and acting CFTC Chairman Caroline Pham said in the joint statement.\nThe announcement follows on the agencies’ shared announcement earlier this week that staff at both agencies want to engage with industry on the trading of some spot-crypto products on both SEC and CFTC-regulated exchanges. Meanwhile, US senators are still weighing setting up a new regulatory framework for digital assets. The CFTC is expected to receive significant more authority over the burgeoning market under the legislation.\nThe SEC and CFTC have previously tried to better coordinate regulations, including in 2018 when the agencies issued a memorandum of understanding intended to make the agencies’ regulation of swaps and security-based swaps more consistent.", "content_hash": "dd2939a951c24ec2b9242cc237ded84e", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Overall, employers added a disappointing 22,000 jobs in August, signaling a slowdown in U.S. hiring.\nIt will take time to see how tariffs’ impact on the manufacturing labor force plays out. So far this year, the uncertainty around the new trade policies and consumer spending has prompted some businesses to slow hirings.\n“There's no good reason for manufacturing to be hiring right now, and there are a lot of good reasons for it to be taking it easy,” said Ron Hetrick, a senior economist at labor market analytics company Lightcast.\nWhy is the manufacturing sector losing workers?\nManufacturing job loss isn’t exclusive to the Trump administration. Jobs in the industry – which slid to 12.7 million in August, or about 8% of total nonfarm employment – have dipped dramatically since their peak in 1979 when they accounted for roughly 22% of total employment. While there were gains made after the Great Recession, jobs began trending down again in early 2023.\nThat downward trend has continued into 2025, with the sector losing roughly 78,000 jobs over the year through August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nEconomists point to a continuation of long-term trends driven by increased production among manufacturing facilities.\n\"As you get better at making manufactured product – that is productivity growth – you don't need as many people to make the same things you did before,\" said Chad Syverson, an economics professor at the University of Chicago.\nHigher interest rates, meant to ease inflation by cooling economic activity, also play a role, said Hetrick.\nMore recently, changes under the Trump administration seem to be adding fuel to the fire. A crackdown on immigration means fewer workers on factory payrolls. A decline in consumer confidence has manufacturers questioning production plans. And uncertainty around Trump’s new trade policy has some companies pausing hiring until they have a better picture of how tariffs will impact pricing.\n“We know nothing reduces investment quite like a bunch of uncertainty, especially in regard to policy,” Syverson said. “And to say that we’ve had uncertainty in policy for the past several months is a massive understatement.”\nA recent report from the Institute for Supply Management, a trade group, found economic activity in the manufacturing sector contracted for the sixth consecutive month in August.\nOne survey respondent quoted in the report, who works in the electrical equipment, appliances and components space, said their company has had to increase prices 24% to offset tariffs and let go about 15% of its U.S. workforce – including engineering and IT roles.\n“‘Made in the USA’ has become even more difficult due to tariffs on many components,” the respondent said. “The administration wants manufacturing jobs in the U.S., but we are losing higher-skilled and higher-paying roles. With no stability in trade and economics, capital expenditures spending and hiring are frozen. It’s survival.”\nManufacturing job growth will hinge on just how many companies decide to shift production to the United States.\nThe White House website claims more than $8 trillion in new investments from companies like Apple and Nvidia are “creating hundreds of thousands of new, good-paying jobs for Americans,” although some of those investments were in the works before Trump took office, as previously reported by USA TODAY.\nBut even with the average effective tariff rate at 17.4% – its highest since 1935, according to the Yale Budget Lab – some experts say it may not be enough to bring manufacturers back to the United States in a meaningful way.\nIt would take at least $2.9 trillion in net new capital investment to add 6.7 million manufacturing jobs and return the sector to its historic peak, according to a report led by Wells Fargo senior economist Sarah House. That’s nearly double the $1.6 trillion secured by the Trump administration as of late May when the report was published.\n“Even if current tariff policy sticks, a full rebound in manufacturing employment looks hard-pressed,” the report reads.\nOne issue is that tariffs drive up production costs for U.S. manufacturers, which import nearly one-third of intermediate inputs, according to a 2022 report from the Commerce Department. This squeezes firms’ budgets, making hiring more difficult.\n\"If you make the inputs more expensive for a firm, their prices are going to have to go up. And if their prices go up, people will buy less. And if people are buying less, you’re going to use less workers,” said Teresa Fort, an associate professor of business administration at Dartmouth who researches international trade.\nOne respondent to the ISM survey, who works with computer and electronic product manufacturing, said higher material costs have made it “more difficult” to justify plans to bring production back to the United States.\n“Tariffs continue to wreak havoc on planning/scheduling activities,” the respondent said in the report. “New product development costs continue to increase as unexpected tariff increases are announced.”\nBut there were also positive signals for the sector in the ISM report. Raw materials price growth slowed in August compared to July, and the New Orders Index expanded for the first time after six months of contraction ‒ although ISM Chair Susan Spence noted in the report that \"for every positive comment about new orders, there were 2.5 comments expressing concern about near-term demand.\"\nScott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a trade group representing manufacturers and the United Steelworkers, emphasized that the sector is not a monolith – some manufacturers could take a hit from higher input costs, while others stand to benefit from tariffs.\nOnce the uncertainty around trade settles, he has hopes tariffs and other changes – including new tax policies, lower interest rates and workforce training incentives – will be enough to spark a manufacturing jobs revival.\n“Tariffs alone aren’t likely to move the needle for every sector the way we want it to. But tariffs combined with additional industrial policies can be highly impactful for manufacturing,\" Paul said.", "content_hash": "3133e70bbfbd231a0a281bdb83ea326a", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

U.S. oil company ConocoPhillips this week announced it would cut up to 25% of its staff to reduce costs.\nThe scope of Halliburton's layoffs was not immediately clear.\nHalliburton has rolled out the cuts over several weeks, according to the sources, who were directly involved in layoffs but not authorized to speak publicly. At least three business divisions had lost between 20% and 40% of employees, the sources said.\nHalliburton, the third-largest global oilfield services company by revenue, did not respond to a request for comment.\nOilfield services companies provide technical expertise, equipment, and labor, including drilling, to support oil and gas exploration and production.\nHouston, Texas-based Halliburton had 48,395 employees at the end of 2024, according to its latest annual report.\nThe company in June said it expected a sharp decline in full-year revenue, as it warned of lower activity in the oil and gas sector. It posted a 33% fall in second-quarter profit this year amid weaker demand.\nOn a conference call with analysts after reporting second-quarter earnings, CEO Jeff Miller noted the oilfield services market appeared very different than it did 90 days ago, citing a slowdown in North America and among large national oil companies elsewhere.\n\"To put it plainly, what I see tells me the oilfield services market will be softer than I previously expected over the short to medium term,\" he said.\nBrent crude was trading below $66 on Friday, down nearly 20% from this year's peak north of $82 a barrel in mid-January, as investors braced for the OPEC+ group's meeting on Sunday.

Throughout the past four months, 107,000 net new jobs have been added, versus the first four months of 2025, in which 491,000 jobs were added.\nThe unemployment rate rose to 4.3% last month, marking a 13-month high.\nAccording to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the leisure and hospitality sector gained 28,000 roles in August, with eating and drinking establishments specifically adding 11,000 jobs. Hospitality was the second strongest sector in August, behind private education and health services, helping to offset big losses in professional and business services, federal government, state government, and manufacturing.\nOverall, the private sector added 38,000 jobs, while government employment declined by 16,000.\nNotably, Friday’s report comes on the heels of another BLS report earlier this week showing that U.S. job openings fell to a 10-month low in July, and that there are now more unemployed people than job openings for the first time since 2021.\nThe sharp slowdown in hiring could have major implications for discretionary spending, impacting the restaurant industry directly. The industry has been contending with negative traffic for nearly two years because of increasingly frugal consumers reining in their dining-out occasions as menu prices remain elevated. Lingering inflation and a slowing job market have also impacted consumer sentiment, which is down more than 14% compared to last year, according to research from the University of Michigan.\nSeveral restaurant companies, including McDonald’s, have recently flashed warning signals about consumer behavior.\n“Re-engaging the low-income consumer is critical as they typically visit our restaurants more frequently than middle- and high-income consumers,” McDonald’s chief executive officer Chris Kempczinski said during the company’s earnings call last month. “This bifurcated consumer base is why we remain cautious about the overall near-term health of the U.S. consumer.”\nLower-income consumers, he added, have pulled back their restaurant visits by double digits in recent months and he expects this trend to continue throughout the rest of the year. New Bank of America data supports his forecast, noting that a widening gap has opened between spending and wage growth of lower-income households and other cohorts.\nEarlier this week, Kempczinski said on CNBC’s Squawk Box that we are in “kind of a two-tiered economy. If you’re upper income, earning over $100,000, things are good. What we see with middle and lower-income consumers is actually a different story.

This accolade acknowledges their transformative approach in redefining the financial dimensions of the supply chain through advanced artificial intelligence. In an industry notoriously riddled with manual processes and inefficiencies, OTR Solutions has emerged as a beacon of progression, tackling some of the most endemic challenges in freight finance with their trailblazing AI platform, OTRintelligence.\nAt the core of OTR Solutions’ achievement lies their ability to streamline the traditionally cumbersome financial transactions within the logistics sector. The primary issue they address is the slow and often error-prone process of invoice handling and payment. Before the advent of their technology, invoice approval, fraud detection, and transaction verification were manual and fraught with delays and errors. These challenges often resulted in bottlenecks, negatively impacting cash flow for carriers and brokers. By integrating a sophisticated AI-driven system, OTR Solutions has managed to accelerate these processes, transforming financial interactions into real-time engagements.\nThe crux of OTR Solutions’ innovation is their AI audit engine, a part of their proprietary platform OTRintelligence. This system is adept at automatically cross-referencing invoices against historical data to detect fraudulent activities and inaccuracies with an accuracy unmatched in the industry. Built on millions of real freight invoices and several billion dollars in freight spend, OTRintelligence is continually learning and evolving. Unlike many solutions that rely on synthetic datasets, their engine draws insights from authentic and extensive data, significantly enhancing its efficacy in real-world applications.\nFor carriers, this means invoices can be validated and funded in mere minutes, even without human oversight. The AI system identifies any potential fraud, cross-verifying document details to ensure compliance and accuracy. This capability allows for round-the-clock funding, including nights and weekends, providing a consistent flow of working capital crucial for small fleets and individual operators. By enabling such flexibility, OTRintelligence sets a new benchmark for efficiency and reliability in the carrier payment market.\nOn the broker side, OTR Solutions integrates its technology through the Epay Manager platform. This integration employs natural language processing capabilities to go beyond mere document indexing. The system mimics human judgment, highlighting critical issues like missing signatures and incorrect load documentation, thereby preventing future disputes. As a result, back-office operations experience a dramatic increase in efficiency, purportedly as high as tenfold, freeing up resources and allowing staff to concentrate on higher-value tasks.", "content_hash": "1543af29824361c05f47945d18a9356c", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

However, as the company matures, it will look to diversify the staking vehicles it utilizes as it seeks out higher-yield opportunities.\n“When you hold billions of dollars of ETH and you're looking at a portfolio of staking, there is going to be an ability to deploy that through staking opportunities on Linea,” Chalom told Decrypt. “And that is really, really important, not only to Consensys, but to the Linea Consortium.

He explained that by driving high-quality activity towards these kinds of projects, it should, in turn, also drive up the price of Ethereum—which is ultimately in the interest of SharpLink as one of the largest holders of ETH.\n“When I say we're here to support Ethereum, we're here to support Ethereum and the L2s that derive from it,” he added. “So not only allocating tokens for Linea bootstrapping [as part of the Linea Consortium], but also [exploring] potential opportunities in staking and liquidity provision, given how much ETH we as a treasury want.”\nBack in July, SharpLink joined the Linea Consortium—a group of companies that will steward 75% of the LINEA token distribution.

Most of the disparity in growth emerged after 2017.\nFigure 1: U.S. real GDP expanded 71% since 2000 while Mexico is up 49%\nComparing the performance of their equity markets is tricky. What makes the comparison challenging is that one can view the relative performance of U.S. and Mexican equities from different perspectives:\nLocal currency returns\nReturns in the same currency (USD for example)\nFrom a local currency return perspective, Mexico’s S&P BMV IPC Index has outperformed by a wide margin (Figure 2), but this ignores the fact that the Mexican peso (MXN) has declined by roughly 50% since 2000 (Figure 3).\nFigure 2: In local currency terms Mexican equities have outperformed U.S. stocks\nFigure 3: The peso has lost half its value against USD since the turn of the century\nWhen converted into the same currency, the overall returns since the year 2000 have been very similar, but the timing of the returns has been very different, with Mexico’s S&P BMV IPC Index outperforming from 2000 to 2012 while U.S. equity indices outperformed from 2012 onwards (Figure 4). This hints at the diversification potential of investing in Mexican equities alongside a portfolio of U.S. stocks.\nFigure 4: In USD, Mexican and US stocks have delivered similar performance since 2000\nIndeed, the correlation between Mexican and U.S. equities, while occasionally as high as +0.8 from 2007 to 2012, has been ranging from +0.2 to +0.6 on a one-year rolling basis for the past dozen years (Figure 6). Part of this may be a reflection of the fact that Mexico’s underlying sector composition is very different from U.S. indices (Table 1).\nTable 1: Mexico’s S&P BMV IPC has vastly different sector weighting than the S&P 500\nSource: Bloomerg Professional IMAP\nMexico has a much higher weighting to consumer staples and materials stocks, a much lower weighting to consumer discretionary and no weighting at all to information technology stocks – the S&P 500’s biggest sector – or to energy or utility stocks. Despite the S&P BMV IPC Index’s high weighting to consumer staples and materials stocks, its correlation with the S&P 500 sectors has not been particularly high during the past year either (Figure 6), suggesting strong diversification potential from S&P 500 E-Mini Select Sector Futures as well.\nFigure 5: Mexico’s S&P BMV IPC’s correlation with U.S. equities has weakened since 2016\nFigure 6: S&P BMV IPC has not displayed strong correlations with U.S. sectors\nInvestors tend to see MXN itself as a risk asset. When equities are going higher, MXN often rises versus USD. However, MXN tends to be somewhat more highly correlated to the S&P 500 than to Mexico’s S&P BMV IPC Index. This suggests that a stronger peso tends to weigh somewhat on Mexico’s stocks as a stronger currency will make it more expensive for Americans to buy Mexico’s products (Figure 7). Indeed 72% of Mexico’s exports head to the U.S. (Figure 8).\nFigure 7: Both Mexican and U.S. equities have a positive correlation to the peso\nFigure 8: 72% of Mexico’s exports head to the U.S.\nMexico’s economy may be on a rather different trajectory than the U.S. in the years ahead. Faced with higher tariffs, Mexico’s central bank has been actively cutting rates while the Fed has been on hold, narrowing the gap between the two countries’ central bank policy rates (Figure 9).\nFigure 9: Mexico’s central bank has been steadily cutting rates this year\nAs is the case in the U.S. and many other countries, Mexico’s core inflation rate has begun to creep higher. That said, Mexico’s central bank appears to believe that U.S. tariffs will push Mexico’s inflation lower as Mexico potentially finds itself flooded with Chinese, European Korean, Japanese and even non-U.S.M.C.A. compliant Mexican goods once destined for the U.S. (Figure 10).\nFigure 10: Mexico’s core inflation rate has picked up slightly\nFor the moment, Mexico’s unemployment rate remains at historically low levels at just above 2.5% (Figure 11). This is a contrast to the U.S. where unemployment rates hit bottom in 2023 and have begun to rise slightly (Figure 12).\nFigure 11: Mexico’s unemployment rate is near record lows\nFigure 12: U.S. unemployment has been moving slightly higher\nPerhaps the most striking differences between the U.S. and Mexican economies are in the realm of debt. U.S. debt to GDP ratios across the public and private sectors add up to 250% of GDP, including a public debt of over 100% of GDP (Figure 13). This contrasts very sharply with Mexico, whose total debt comes to just 81% of GDP, of which public debt is 43.6% of annual national output (Figure 14).\nFigure 13: The U.S. has rather high levels of public and private sector debt\nFigure 14: Mexico’s debt levels are relatively low\nFinally, there is the issue of valuations. Mexico’s S&P/BMV IPC Index trades at 13.96x trailing earnings compared to 24.66x for the S&P 500 and 33.32x for the Nasdaq 100. This reflects in part the different sector makeup of the indices, with the U.S. averages more heavily weighted towards tech stocks, which typically command higher earnings multiples. It also reflects differing levels of interest rates, with Mexican 10Y swaps at 7.9% while their U.S. equivalents are trading at half that level around 3.69%.\nAll these factors suggest that Mexican and U.S. equities could remain on different trajectories in the years ahead and that Mexican stocks could offer an interesting diversification opportunity to capital allocated to the U.S. market.\nAll examples in this report are hypothetical interpretations of situations and are used for explanation purposes only.

The split means that both agencies oversee units of Wall Street banks, hedge funds and other major financial firms.\n“By working in lockstep, our two agencies can harness our nation’s unique regulatory structure into a source of strength for market participants, investors and Americans,” Atkins and acting CFTC Chairman Caroline Pham said in the joint statement.\nThe announcement follows on the agencies’ shared announcement earlier this week that staff at both agencies want to engage with industry on the trading of some spot-crypto products on both SEC and CFTC-regulated exchanges. Meanwhile, US senators are still weighing setting up a new regulatory framework for digital assets. The CFTC is expected to receive significant more authority over the burgeoning market under the legislation.\nThe SEC and CFTC have previously tried to better coordinate regulations, including in 2018 when the agencies issued a memorandum of understanding intended to make the agencies’ regulation of swaps and security-based swaps more consistent.", "content_hash": "dd2939a951c24ec2b9242cc237ded84e", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Overall, employers added a disappointing 22,000 jobs in August, signaling a slowdown in U.S. hiring.\nIt will take time to see how tariffs’ impact on the manufacturing labor force plays out. So far this year, the uncertainty around the new trade policies and consumer spending has prompted some businesses to slow hirings.\n“There's no good reason for manufacturing to be hiring right now, and there are a lot of good reasons for it to be taking it easy,” said Ron Hetrick, a senior economist at labor market analytics company Lightcast.\nWhy is the manufacturing sector losing workers?\nManufacturing job loss isn’t exclusive to the Trump administration. Jobs in the industry – which slid to 12.7 million in August, or about 8% of total nonfarm employment – have dipped dramatically since their peak in 1979 when they accounted for roughly 22% of total employment. While there were gains made after the Great Recession, jobs began trending down again in early 2023.\nThat downward trend has continued into 2025, with the sector losing roughly 78,000 jobs over the year through August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nEconomists point to a continuation of long-term trends driven by increased production among manufacturing facilities.\n\"As you get better at making manufactured product – that is productivity growth – you don't need as many people to make the same things you did before,\" said Chad Syverson, an economics professor at the University of Chicago.\nHigher interest rates, meant to ease inflation by cooling economic activity, also play a role, said Hetrick.\nMore recently, changes under the Trump administration seem to be adding fuel to the fire. A crackdown on immigration means fewer workers on factory payrolls. A decline in consumer confidence has manufacturers questioning production plans. And uncertainty around Trump’s new trade policy has some companies pausing hiring until they have a better picture of how tariffs will impact pricing.\n“We know nothing reduces investment quite like a bunch of uncertainty, especially in regard to policy,” Syverson said. “And to say that we’ve had uncertainty in policy for the past several months is a massive understatement.”\nA recent report from the Institute for Supply Management, a trade group, found economic activity in the manufacturing sector contracted for the sixth consecutive month in August.\nOne survey respondent quoted in the report, who works in the electrical equipment, appliances and components space, said their company has had to increase prices 24% to offset tariffs and let go about 15% of its U.S. workforce – including engineering and IT roles.\n“‘Made in the USA’ has become even more difficult due to tariffs on many components,” the respondent said. “The administration wants manufacturing jobs in the U.S., but we are losing higher-skilled and higher-paying roles. With no stability in trade and economics, capital expenditures spending and hiring are frozen. It’s survival.”\nManufacturing job growth will hinge on just how many companies decide to shift production to the United States.\nThe White House website claims more than $8 trillion in new investments from companies like Apple and Nvidia are “creating hundreds of thousands of new, good-paying jobs for Americans,” although some of those investments were in the works before Trump took office, as previously reported by USA TODAY.\nBut even with the average effective tariff rate at 17.4% – its highest since 1935, according to the Yale Budget Lab – some experts say it may not be enough to bring manufacturers back to the United States in a meaningful way.\nIt would take at least $2.9 trillion in net new capital investment to add 6.7 million manufacturing jobs and return the sector to its historic peak, according to a report led by Wells Fargo senior economist Sarah House. That’s nearly double the $1.6 trillion secured by the Trump administration as of late May when the report was published.\n“Even if current tariff policy sticks, a full rebound in manufacturing employment looks hard-pressed,” the report reads.\nOne issue is that tariffs drive up production costs for U.S. manufacturers, which import nearly one-third of intermediate inputs, according to a 2022 report from the Commerce Department. This squeezes firms’ budgets, making hiring more difficult.\n\"If you make the inputs more expensive for a firm, their prices are going to have to go up. And if their prices go up, people will buy less. And if people are buying less, you’re going to use less workers,” said Teresa Fort, an associate professor of business administration at Dartmouth who researches international trade.\nOne respondent to the ISM survey, who works with computer and electronic product manufacturing, said higher material costs have made it “more difficult” to justify plans to bring production back to the United States.\n“Tariffs continue to wreak havoc on planning/scheduling activities,” the respondent said in the report. “New product development costs continue to increase as unexpected tariff increases are announced.”\nBut there were also positive signals for the sector in the ISM report. Raw materials price growth slowed in August compared to July, and the New Orders Index expanded for the first time after six months of contraction ‒ although ISM Chair Susan Spence noted in the report that \"for every positive comment about new orders, there were 2.5 comments expressing concern about near-term demand.\"\nScott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a trade group representing manufacturers and the United Steelworkers, emphasized that the sector is not a monolith – some manufacturers could take a hit from higher input costs, while others stand to benefit from tariffs.\nOnce the uncertainty around trade settles, he has hopes tariffs and other changes – including new tax policies, lower interest rates and workforce training incentives – will be enough to spark a manufacturing jobs revival.\n“Tariffs alone aren’t likely to move the needle for every sector the way we want it to. But tariffs combined with additional industrial policies can be highly impactful for manufacturing,\" Paul said.", "content_hash": "3133e70bbfbd231a0a281bdb83ea326a", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

U.S. oil company ConocoPhillips this week announced it would cut up to 25% of its staff to reduce costs.\nThe scope of Halliburton's layoffs was not immediately clear.\nHalliburton has rolled out the cuts over several weeks, according to the sources, who were directly involved in layoffs but not authorized to speak publicly. At least three business divisions had lost between 20% and 40% of employees, the sources said.\nHalliburton, the third-largest global oilfield services company by revenue, did not respond to a request for comment.\nOilfield services companies provide technical expertise, equipment, and labor, including drilling, to support oil and gas exploration and production.\nHouston, Texas-based Halliburton had 48,395 employees at the end of 2024, according to its latest annual report.\nThe company in June said it expected a sharp decline in full-year revenue, as it warned of lower activity in the oil and gas sector. It posted a 33% fall in second-quarter profit this year amid weaker demand.\nOn a conference call with analysts after reporting second-quarter earnings, CEO Jeff Miller noted the oilfield services market appeared very different than it did 90 days ago, citing a slowdown in North America and among large national oil companies elsewhere.\n\"To put it plainly, what I see tells me the oilfield services market will be softer than I previously expected over the short to medium term,\" he said.\nBrent crude was trading below $66 on Friday, down nearly 20% from this year's peak north of $82 a barrel in mid-January, as investors braced for the OPEC+ group's meeting on Sunday.

Throughout the past four months, 107,000 net new jobs have been added, versus the first four months of 2025, in which 491,000 jobs were added.\nThe unemployment rate rose to 4.3% last month, marking a 13-month high.\nAccording to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the leisure and hospitality sector gained 28,000 roles in August, with eating and drinking establishments specifically adding 11,000 jobs. Hospitality was the second strongest sector in August, behind private education and health services, helping to offset big losses in professional and business services, federal government, state government, and manufacturing.\nOverall, the private sector added 38,000 jobs, while government employment declined by 16,000.\nNotably, Friday’s report comes on the heels of another BLS report earlier this week showing that U.S. job openings fell to a 10-month low in July, and that there are now more unemployed people than job openings for the first time since 2021.\nThe sharp slowdown in hiring could have major implications for discretionary spending, impacting the restaurant industry directly. The industry has been contending with negative traffic for nearly two years because of increasingly frugal consumers reining in their dining-out occasions as menu prices remain elevated. Lingering inflation and a slowing job market have also impacted consumer sentiment, which is down more than 14% compared to last year, according to research from the University of Michigan.\nSeveral restaurant companies, including McDonald’s, have recently flashed warning signals about consumer behavior.\n“Re-engaging the low-income consumer is critical as they typically visit our restaurants more frequently than middle- and high-income consumers,” McDonald’s chief executive officer Chris Kempczinski said during the company’s earnings call last month. “This bifurcated consumer base is why we remain cautious about the overall near-term health of the U.S. consumer.”\nLower-income consumers, he added, have pulled back their restaurant visits by double digits in recent months and he expects this trend to continue throughout the rest of the year. New Bank of America data supports his forecast, noting that a widening gap has opened between spending and wage growth of lower-income households and other cohorts.\nEarlier this week, Kempczinski said on CNBC’s Squawk Box that we are in “kind of a two-tiered economy. If you’re upper income, earning over $100,000, things are good. What we see with middle and lower-income consumers is actually a different story. They’re under pressure.”", "content_hash": "59959cd41d2ff546fd498399fdbd0edb", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

However, as the company matures, it will look to diversify the staking vehicles it utilizes as it seeks out higher-yield opportunities.\n“When you hold billions of dollars of ETH and you're looking at a portfolio of staking, there is going to be an ability to deploy that through staking opportunities on Linea,” Chalom told Decrypt. “And that is really, really important, not only to Consensys, but to the Linea Consortium.

SNOW’s forward P/E was 208.33 according to Yahoo Finance.\none photo/Shutterstock.com\nSnowflake (SNOW) delivered another solid quarter, reinforcing its turnaround that began in Q1. Product revenue rose 32% YoY in Q2, while its net revenue retention rate remained strong at 125%, reflecting continued customer loyalty and expansion. The company added 533 new customers, bringing its total base to over 12,000, including 654 customers generating more than $1 million in annual revenue, up 28% from last year. Profitability also improved, with non-GAAP operating margin reaching 11.1%, a 6.1% increase over the prior year.\nAs a leading data lake storage provider, SNOW’s architecture eliminates data silos, allowing organizations to securely share data internally and externally, accelerating collaboration and analytics. This makes SNOW a natural choice for enterprises pursuing AI-driven insights and data-driven strategies, a positioning that underpins its growth momentum. While a discounted cash flow model does not suggest the stock is undervalued, comparisons to Databricks, which holds an even higher private market valuation, indicate further upside potential for SNOW. However, the company must sustain its current pace of execution to justify its premium positioning.\nThe stock has already risen over 50% this year, highlighting both investor confidence and the risk of volatility should growth or margins falter. For long-term investors, SNOW’s market leadership, robust expansion among large accounts, and alignment with enterprise AI adoption trends provide a compelling case. Yet the path forward is dependent on maintaining operational discipline and scaling profitability. With high expectations already priced in, the investment carries both meaningful upside and significant execution risk.\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) by Oliver | MMMT Wealth in April 2025, which highlighted strong net revenue retention, margin improvements, and robust financial health. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately by 70% since our coverage as the thesis played out with solid execution. Magnus Ofstad shares a similar view but emphasizes quarterly performance, Databricks’ valuation, and volatility risks.\nSnowflake Inc. is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 94 hedge fund portfolios held SNOW at the end of the first quarter which was 85 in the previous quarter.

Investors are waiting and anticipating news from the company surrounding robotaxis or even progress with its humanoid robots.\nNews about CEO Elon Musk has the stock jumping today, though. Shares popped more than 5% early this morning, and remained higher by 2.8% as of 11:46 a.m. ET.\nElon Musk could earn $1 trillion -- or nothing\nToday's move came after Tesla filed a new pay plan proposal for its CEO. The company wants Elon Musk to focus on Tesla and remain with the company for years to come. It included many incentives to accomplish that goal.\nThe proposed plan includes 12 tranches for various milestones. Targets include a cumulative 20 million electric vehicles delivered, 1 million robotaxis, and 1 million robots. Tesla has delivered about 7.5 million EVs to date, but no robotaxis or humanoid robots yet.\nMusk would be awarded 35 million shares, or about 1% of total shares outstanding, by achieving each milestone. The first reward would take effect when Tesla's valuation hits $2 trillion. That would give investors about a double from recent levels. The next nine would each require an additional $500 billion in market capitalization. The last two tranches each require an additional $1 trillion in market cap.\nInvestors are buying shares today, recognizing that owning Tesla stock is a way to gain from Musk achieving the goals in his proposed pay package. From an investor perspective, the important point is that earning full compensation from the plan would require Musk to drive $7.5 trillion of value to shareholders. That would imply a stock price of about $2,675 per share.\nThere are operational requirements as well. Those include earnings per share goals, 10 million active full self-driving (FSD) subscriptions, as well as the previously mentioned EV and robot goals.\nImportantly, the operational and market cap milestones must both be achieved for each tranche to pay out. While the goals are quite aspirational, that potential payback has investors buying Tesla today.\nShould you buy stock in Tesla right now?\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now.

DG’s trailing and forward P/E were 20.14 and 19.68 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nfikri-rasyid-ezeC8-clZSs-unsplash\nDollar General (DG) exemplifies the power of a simple, resilient model: small stores located close to home, offering essential consumables at consistently low prices. With over 20,500 stores across 48 states, DG is often the only general merchandise option in rural America, where 75% of households live within five miles of a location. Its business is built around quick, $10 fill-in trips, with 80% of revenue driven by staples like snacks, groceries, cleaning supplies, and health & beauty.\nWhile margins on consumables are thin, non-consumables and private brands provide profit leverage, and initiatives like DG Fresh have lowered costs while expanding fresh and frozen offerings. Competitors like Walmart, Amazon, and Temu cannot replicate DG’s niche: immediate-need, small-basket, paycheck-to-paycheck households seeking convenience and affordability. Walmart may win on unit price, but DG’s proximity and speed keep it competitive, while Amazon and Temu are disadvantaged by order minimums and product mix.\nInflation and tariffs pose challenges, yet they also reinforce DG’s value, drawing households down from higher-cost channels. Its moat rests on capital-efficient small-box economics, deep alignment with low-income shoppers, and a consumables-led merchandise mix that drives recurring trips. Management, led by returning CEO Todd Vasos, is stabilizing operations after execution missteps, focusing on shrink reduction, remodels, and higher-margin growth levers like pOpshelf and digital media. At a $24B market cap and ~12× FCF, DG trades at a discount that underestimates its earnings power. Margin recovery and buybacks could drive double-digit compounding, making DG a durable compounder with substantial long-term upside.\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Dollar General Corporation (DG) by Tyler Moody in October 2023, which highlighted margin compression but argued stabilization would restore profitability. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately 35% since our coverage. This is because execution and resilience improved. The thesis still stands as structural economics remain intact.

AMR’s trailing P/E was 6.24 according to Yahoo Finance.\nCopyright: vyacheslavsvetlichnyy / 123RF Stock Photo\nAlpha Metallurgical Resources (AMR) represents a classic deep-value opportunity where the market has mispriced the company due to short-term pessimism. While analysts expected a catastrophic Q2 loss of $2.76 per share, AMR reported a loss of just $0.38, highlighting exceptional operational execution in a challenging metallurgical coal market. This outperformance was driven by the company achieving its best quarterly cost of coal sales since 2021, reducing costs to $100.06 per ton through a 10% increase in productivity and disciplined cuts in maintenance and supply expenses.\nDespite weak coal prices, the market is overlooking two critical aspects that underpin AMR’s investment case. First, the company has a fortress balance sheet, with $556.9 million in liquidity and minimal long-term debt of $5.8 million as of June 30, 2025, providing significant resilience and a margin of safety that positions AMR to outperform less financially stable peers. Second, the company has a coiled spring of capital returns, with approximately $400 million remaining on its $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization.\nWhile buybacks were paused amid market softness, management indicated plans to restart opportunistically, creating an imminent catalyst that could meaningfully reduce the public float at depressed valuations. Overall, AMR offers investors access to a best-in-class, operationally superior metallurgical coal producer at trough-cycle valuations. The combination of strong operational leverage to potential coal price recovery and the near-term share repurchase catalyst creates a highly asymmetric risk-reward profile, making AMR a compelling investment for those recognizing the disconnect between market perception and underlying fundamentals.\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc.

METC’s trailing and forward P/E were 9.47 and 5.49 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nnikolay-kovalenko-66r7PAK1Qy0-unsplash\nRamaco Resources Inc. (METC) stands out as a unique investment that cannot be analyzed like a typical coal company. The firm is executing a strategic pivot to become a “dual platform” company, combining low-cost metallurgical coal operations with the mining and processing of rare earth elements (REEs) at its Brook Mine in Wyoming. This mine represents the first new REE project in the U.S. in over 70 years, positioning Ramaco to challenge China’s dominance in minerals critical for defense, electric vehicles, and high-tech manufacturing.\nBrook Mine’s geology offers a rare advantage: the REEs are commingled with soft coal and clay, making extraction easier, cheaper, and free from the radioactivity issues common to conventional hard-rock REE deposits. Market valuation, however, fails to reflect this transformative potential. A preliminary economic assessment by Fluor Corporation assigns the project a pre-tax NPV of $1.2 billion—nearly equal to Ramaco’s total enterprise value of $1.7 billion—implying that investors are attributing little to no value to the REE asset.\nThe recent $200 million upsized public offering further de-risks the thesis, funding the REE project’s acceleration toward commercialization and signaling management’s confidence. The investment case is thus a sum-of-the-parts arbitrage: investors gain a stable, cash-generating metallurgical coal business while effectively receiving a call option on a fully-funded, strategically vital rare earths operation. Ramaco illustrates that true alpha emerges not from deep specialization but from connecting seemingly unrelated opportunities—linking regulatory developments, technology trends, and cyclical industry dynamics to identify undervalued, multi-dimensional growth prospects.\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Ramaco Resources, Inc.

Cumulative trading volume has now exceeded $2.57 trillion.\nSource: DefiLlama\nDespite its scale, Hyperliquid operates with just 11 employees, relying on automation and smart contracts to handle functions such as settlement, reconciliation, compliance, and customer operations.\nThe lean model has produced efficiency ratios far ahead of traditional payment firms.

In a statement, the exchange said the disruption stemmed from a sharp traffic spike rather than a hack or exploit.\nThe halt created brief price divergences as traders were unable to close positions. Hyperliquid has since pledged to add monitoring tools and safeguards to prevent a repeat.\nLater in August, the exchange reimbursed nearly $2 million to users affected by the brief outage.\nThe token powers Hyperliquid’s on-chain perpetuals DEX, which operates a Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) and supports smart contracts via HyperEVM. It is used for gas, staking, and governance.\nThe project’s tokenomics tie protocol fees to both an Assistance Fund and the HLP pool, which buy back $HYPE. Current revenue distribution stands at 54% and 46%, respectively.\nSpeculation around HYPE intensified after former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes predicted the token could deliver 126x returns by 2028. Hayes’ thesis assumes Treasury-backed stablecoins will reshape global banking, driving trillions in deposits into compliant DeFi venues like Hyperliquid.\nInstitutional interest is growing. Hayes himself acquired 58,631 HYPE tokens worth $2.6 million, while 21Shares listed exchange-traded products on Switzerland’s SIX Exchange.\nAnalysts say expansion into tokenized assets and fintech integrations could further strengthen Hyperliquid’s position in the coming years.", "content_hash": "a3edc11d3c146284c26d26a58e79bfa1", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

America’s unemployment rate also rose from 4.2pc to 4.3pc.\nAfter the figures were published, US government borrowing costs dipped as investors bet the weak jobs data will increase the likelihood of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.\nYields on 10-year Treasuries – which move inversely to prices – fell to 4.095pc from 4.16pc, the lowest since Mr Trump’s liberation day tariffs in April while 30-year yields fell from 4.853pc to 4.824pc.\nIn Britain, yields on gilts, which are closely tied to US government borrowing costs also dipped. The rates on 30-year bonds fell from 5.574pc to 5.531pc.\nThe gloomy jobs figures may further provoke the ire of the President, who has previously criticised US jobs data as “rigged”. Last month he sacked Erika McEntarfer, the head of the BLS, after figures showed downwards revisions in the May and June jobs figures.\nOn Thursday, Mr Trump appeared to shrug off the figures ahead of their publication. “The real numbers that I’m talking about are going to be whatever it is, but will be in a year from now,” he said.\nStatistics for June were also revised down again on Friday. Instead of growth of 14,000 in June, the US saw non-farm payrolls shrink by 13,000. However there was a small upwards revision for the July numbers.\nThe non-farm payrolls data are the latest numbers in a slew of data that points to a slowdown in the US jobs market as Mr Trump’s sweeping trade tariffs and rapid policy changes push businesses to put hiring decisions on hold.\nSeparate figures from ADP on Thursday showed private sector hiring halved in August, totalling just 54,000. This was down from 106,000 in July and was well below the 75,000 economists had expected.\nBLS figures show the number of long-term unemployed has increased by 385,000 over this year and now stands at 1.9m.\nMr Trump has nominated EJ Antoni, chief economist at the Right-wing Heritage Foundation, to take over Ms McEntarfer’s role.\n05:34 PM BST\nSigning off...\nThanks for joining us today.\nThat’s all for this live blog, but you can read all the latest news and comment on the economy here.\n05:15 PM BST\nFTSE 100 closes down as US jobs market stalls\nThe FTSE 100 gave back early gains to close lower today as a weak US jobs report raised fears the world’s biggest economy was slowing.\n“The [US] labour market is in a precarious position,” said analysts at Wells Fargo, putting the Federal Reserve in a position “where it will imminently start cutting the federal funds rate”.\nThe FTSE 100 index closed down 0.1pc, at 9,208.21. It had earlier traded as high as 9,253.53.\nThe FTSE 250 ended 0.5pc higher, at 21,575.54, and the AIM All-Share finished up 0.5pc, at 765.63.\nFor the week, the FTSE 100 rose 0.2pc, the FTSE 250 fell 0.1pc and the AIM All-Share firmed 0.2pc.\nIn New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.5pc, the S&P 500 is 0.4pc lower, while the Nasdaq dropped 0.1pc.\nThomas Feltmate, senior economist at TD Economics, said: “There’s no escaping that the [US] labour market is softening, and quickly.\n“Fed officials have become increasingly concerned about the downside risks to the labour market, and [today’s] report will not assuage those fears.”\nWells Fargo said the jobs engine, that has been integral to US economic growth defying expectations for the past four years, is “stalling”.\n“With elevated risk of further downward revisions, the recent pace of hiring is dangerously close to crossing into negative territory, where job market weakness quickly becomes self-reinforcing,” the broker warned.\n04:46 PM BST\nCost of UK government debt slides after US jobs figures\nThe yield on gilts – the effective interest rate on UK government debt – slid this afternoon, after spiking earlier in the week.\nThe fall came after weak US jobs numbers raised hopes of American interest rate cuts.\nUS rates act as a drumbeat through Western economies.\nThe yield on 30-year gilts dropped 1.3pc to 5.505pc, while the 10-year gilt yields fell 1.6pc to 4.647pc.\n04:16 PM BST\nWall Street falls back from record highs on slowdown fears\nWall Street’s main indexes eased from record highs this afternoon after concerns about a US slowdown outweighed optimism about interest-rate cuts.\nData showed the US economy created only 22,000 jobs last month compared to an estimate of 75,000 additions, confirming that labour market conditions were softening and making a stronger case for an interest-rate cut later this month.\n“This is more of a recessionary jobs report than not. It doesn’t indicate that we’re necessarily in a recession now, but it definitely is more in the negative column than it is in the positive column,” said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab.\n“If they’re (the Fed) is cutting in response to a weakening labour market because it’s getting away from them, that is initially not a bullish setup for the stock market.”\nThe three major US stock indexes had scaled fresh peaks early in the afternoon, but the gains petered out.\nThe S&P 500 and the Dow Jones are down 0.6pc, while the Nasdaq has lost 0.4pc.\n04:09 PM BST\nJP Morgan says UK’s black hole heading towards £30bn\nJP Morgan has warned that rising UK bond yields could push the black hole in Britain’s public finances up towards £30bn.\nIt comes after yields on Britain’s 30-year gilts rose to as much as 5.748pc earlier this week.\nThe investment bank said: “There are several factors behind the rise in yields seen over the course of this year, of which fiscal concerns are only are one. But with a a Budget date now having been set for Nov 26, attention is turning to the size of the likely tightening that will bring and the precise choice of measures the Chancellor will opt for.\n“Higher yields tilt the risks around our £20-30bn estimate of the size of the fiscal deterioration to the upside.\n“The Chancellor has again reiterated that the rules are ‘non-negotiable’, highlighting the likelihood of a tightening of comparable magnitude. But the form that will take remains unclear.\n“While higher taxes appear set to account for the lion’s share, some of these may be deferred to future years while upfront measures focus on savings with modest immediate growth impact. There is still some scope to announce deferred spending cuts in order to meet the medium term rules (e.g. in 2029/30) and calls for spending reductions to fill more of the gap increased this week.”\n03:38 PM BST\nDollar dives after US jobs numbers\nThe dollar fell sharply against major peers this afternoon after monthly jobs data showed that American employers hired fewer workers than expected. This likely guarantees a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.\nThe US currency fell 0.8pc against a basket of six other global currencies, including the pound.\n“The data is giving evidence of what was feared, which is that what companies have experienced throughout the year because of changes in trading policy has added costs when it comes to tariffs,” said Juan Perez, director of trading at Monex USA in Washington.\n“These costs can only be absorbed for so long and what is being manifested is that companies are struggling with hiring.”\nUS government bond yields also fell. The yield on benchmark US 10-year notes fell to 4.081pc from 4.160pc yesterday.\n“It’s definitely not a good story for the US dollar and it’s not a good story for the United States because what today truly establishes is that we are experiencing very serious stagflation,” Mr Perez added.\nStagflation refers to high inflation accompanied with unemployment and stagnant demand.\n03:29 PM BST\nTrump hits out at Federal Reserve\nDonald Trump has lashed out at Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell for not cutting interest rates after surprisingly bad US jobs numbers.\nMr Trump said on Truth Social: “Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell should have lowered rates long ago. As usual, he’s ‘Too Late!’.”\nMr Trump has been making aggressive demands for interest rate cuts for months, calling Mr Powell a “numbskull” and trying to sack Fed Governor Lisa Cook.\nThe Fed has kept rates on hold all year as it waits to see the impact of Mr Trump’s tariffs, which are expected to drive up inflation.\n02:57 PM BST\nWall Street climbs to more records\nUS stocks are rising further into record heights this afternoon after the latest disappointing signal on the job market bolstered expectations of interest rate cuts.\nThe S&P 500 climbed as much as 0.5pc and added to its all-time high set the day before. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is 0.3pc and the Nasdaq is 0.6pc higher.\nThe action was much stronger in the bond market, where Treasury yields tumbled after a report from the US Labor Department said employers across the country hired far fewer workers in August than economists expected.\nThe disappointing numbers followed last month’s weaker-than-expected update, along with other lacklustre reports in the intervening weeks. Traders now are betting on a 100pc probability that the Fed will cut its main interest rate at its next meeting on Sept 17, according to data from CME Group.\nSuch cuts can give a kickstart to the economy and job market, but the Fed has held off on them so far this year because they can also give inflation more fuel.\n“This week has been a story of a slowing labour market, and today’s data was the exclamation point,” according to Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.\n02:42 PM BST\nGold hits fresh record after dismal US jobs numbers\nThe price of gold jumped to a fresh record after poor US jobs numbers increased bets that the Fed will cut interest rates.\nGold, which does not generate interest, is more attractive when the American central bank lowers rates.\nThe metal rose 0.8pc to as much as $3,586.82 an ounce.\n02:31 PM BST\n‘Trigger’ could set of UK fiscal crisis, warns economist\nThe conditions are in place for a crisis in the Government’s finances, a top economist has warned.\nAll that is needed now is a trigger, according to Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics.\nGlobal investors could be shocked by anything from the Government breaking the borrowing rules, to a bump in interest rates which makes Britain’s near-£3tn debt look unsustainable.\n“Many of the conditions which have led to fiscal crises in the past are now in place. This does not mean a fiscal crisis in the UK is imminent or inevitable. The missing ingredient is a trigger,” said Ms Gregory.\n“If a UK fiscal crisis does erupt, it’s as likely to come from a change in perceptions or personnel as economic data or policy. This underlines the need for the government to continue to commit to fiscal discipline to keep the bond market onside.”\nShe listed seven potential such triggers.\nAny attempt to break or change the fiscal rules – set just last year by Rachel Reeves – “could be perceived as a waning commitment to fiscal discipline, adding to the sense of nervousness about the UK’s perilous fiscal position and leading to sharp increases in borrowing costs.”\nSimilarly a long-term failure to get borrowing under control risks undermining credibility, causing more wobbles in debt markets.\nIf the Chancellor is sidelined or ditched, that could be taken as a sign the Government is abandoning any semblance of fiscal responsibility.\nRunaway inflation and stagnant growth are another danger, as is “a vicious cycle” of rising debt costs which force the Government to borrow more just to pay the interest bill.\nA Reform UK victory might also scare investors, if the opposition party does not explain how it will fund its plans, while contagion from a crisis abroad - perhaps in France, where the Government is likely to fall next week - could also worsen Britain’s predicament.\n02:19 PM BST\nTrump’s trade war ‘failing to reshore production’\nAmerica’s manufacturing sector has shed 78,000 jobs so far this year in a clear sign that Donald Trump’s trade war is failing to “bring jobs back” to the US.\nThe US lost 12,000 manufacturing jobs in August, contributing to a 25,000 decline in overall goods producing roles. Jobs in wholesale trade also fell by 11,700.\nBradley Saunders, of Capital Economics, said: “This confounds hopes of a tariff-led reshoring renaissance.”\n02:16 PM BST\nDoge helps cut 100,000 US government jobs\nNearly 100,000 government jobs have been lost since the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) started making huge cuts at the start of the year.\nFederal government employment fell by 15,000 in August and was down by 97,000 since January, BLS figures showed.\nThe impact of the Doge cuts has been delayed because employees who are on paid leave or are receiving ongoing severance pay are counted as employed in the BLS survey.\n02:09 PM BST\nJobs market ‘has headed off a cliff-edge’\nThe US labour market “has headed off a cliff-edge”, Capital Economics has warned.\nBradley Saunders, of the research consultancy, said: “August’s Employment Report confirmed that the labour market has headed off a cliff-edge.”\nAmerica’s three-month average jobs growth is now just 29,000, just a fraction of the average monthly jobs growth of 184,000 seen across 2024.\n02:01 PM BST\nTesla board recommends record $1tn package for Musk\nTesla is promising to award Elon Musk a $1tn (£740bn) payday if he makes the electric car maker the most valuable company of all time.\nThe company unveiled a new pay award scheme on Friday that will hand him hundreds of millions of shares if he can hit a string of ambitious milestones, including making Tesla worth $8.5tn over the next decade.\nBy 2035, Mr Musk would also have to have sold 1m AI robots and have 1m self-driving robotaxis on the road.\nThe deal would multiply Mr Musk’s existing $378bn (£280bn) net worth, which already makes him the world’s richest person by a wide margin, and make him the world’s first trillionaire.\n01:51 PM BST\nTrump says India and Russia appear ‘lost’ to ‘deepest, darkest China’\nDonald Trump has said India and Russia seem to have been “lost” to China after their leaders met with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week, expressing annoyance at New Delhi and Moscow as Beijing pushes a new world order.\n“Looks like we’ve lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest, China. May they have a long and prosperous future together!” Mr Trump wrote in a social media post accompanying a photo of the three leaders together at Xi’s summit in China.\nXi hosted more than 20 leaders of non-Western countries for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in the Chinese port city of Tianjin, including Russian president Vladimir Putin and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi.\nAsked about Mr Trump’s post, India’s foreign ministry told reporters in New Delhi that it had no comment.\n01:46 PM BST\nWall Street raises bets on US interest rate cuts\nS&P 500 and Nasdaq futures have risen before the New York Stock Exchange opens properly this afternoon,\nMarkets are reacting to a weaker-than-expected non-farm payrolls reading which has raised investor bets on interest-rate cuts.\nTraders increased bets that there could be as many as three quarter of a percentage point rate cuts by the end of the year.\nA US Labor Department report showed non-farm payrolls increased 22,000 in August, compared with an estimate of a 75,000 rise, according to economists polled by Reuters.\n01:36 PM BST\nTrump shrugged off jobs numbers in advance\nUS employers added just 22,000 jobs last month as the labour market continued to cool under uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s economic policies.\nThe Labor Department said this afternoon that hiring decelerated from 79,000 in July. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3pc, the Labor Department reported Friday.\nWhen the department put out a disappointing jobs report a month ago, an enraged President Donald Trump responded by firing the economist in charge of compiling the numbers and nominating a loyalist to replace her.\nTalking to reporters Thursday night at a dinner with wealthy tech executives, Trump had seemed to shrug off whatever hiring numbers would come out Friday. “The real numbers that I’m talking about are going to be whatever it is, but will be in a year from now,’’ the president said.\n01:24 PM BST\nInvestment bank warns over UK politicians\nAn American investment bank has warned over the willingness of British politicians to stomach tax and spending reforms.\nMohit Kumar, chief economist and strategist for Europe at Jefferies, said: “Our worry for the long end in the UK and France is not just about the current deficit picture, but about the willingness of politicians to deliver unpopular fiscal reforms,” said Mohit Kumar, chief economist and strategist for Europe at Jefferies.\nIt comes in a week when the cost of long-term debt spiked.\nThe yield (effectively the interest rate) on 30-year gilts hit 5.748pc on Wednesday. Germany, the benchmark for the eurozone, is currently paying 3.329pc on its 30-year bunds.\n12:56 PM BST\nGlobal stocks surge ahead of US jobs data\nUS markets are expected to open up later today ahead of crucial jobs data that could pave the way for further interest rate cuts.\nFutures on the S&P 500 were up 0.3pc while Nasdaq futures were up 0.5pc ahead of markets opening later this afternoon after hitting record levels at the close on Thursday.\nInvestors are looking ahead to US payroll data later this afternoon, which is expected to show a cooling jobs market in America.\nA weaker jobs market should be good news for investors, as it provides ammunition for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.\nThe FTSE 100 was up around 0.3pc at lunchtime while the European Stoxx 600 was also up 0.3pc.\n12:07 PM BST\nHousing Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner to resign\nAngela Rayner, the Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Housing, is to resign from the government, according to multiple reports, amid a row over whether she paid enough stamp duty on a house purchase in Hove.\nMs Rayner, who was in charge of Labour’s planning reforms and its house-building blitz, will leave after disclosures in The Telegraph she had not paid enough tax when buying a new flat.\nThe Labour deputy leader had been responsible for waving through a series of infrastructure, housing and data centre projects for the government. But the government faced major hurdles to reaching its target for building one million new homes.\nSeparately, Sky News reported on Friday that Baroness Poppy Gustafsson, the Investment Minister, was planning to leave the government. The former Darktrace boss had been tasked with helping to attract businesses to Britain.\nYou can see all the updates on our politics live blog today.\n11:54 AM BST\nONS apologises over botched data releases\nThe head of the Office of National Statistics (ONS) has apologised for its delayed and incorrect retail sales update in July amid growing doubts over the reliability of UK’s official economic data.\nJames Benford, a former Bank of England director who joined as head of the ONS in June, this morning acknowledged a major error in how it was seasonally adjusting retail figures.\nIn a blog post, he said: “I apologise both for the delay to this release and the error in how we have been seasonally adjusting these data.”\nThe failure to properly account for seasonal changes in how retailers report their figures, which can be tied to major holidays such as Easter and Black Friday that boost sales, meant the ONS was forced to revise down its quarterly growth data from the start of the year.\nIt revised down the growth rate in retail sales in the first quarter of 2025 from 1.3pc to 0.7pc and up in the second quarter from 0.2pc to 0.3pc.\nMr Benford said: “We will be conducting a full lessons-learned exercise and will improve our processes and procedures to make sure the error will not be repeated.”\nThe ONS said it planned to “put more resources behind work to improve economic statistics and to bring more transparency on how these plans are progressing” after a series of errors and revisions in its data releases.\n10:52 AM BST\nShoppers at risk of higher prices as Budget looms, retail bosses warn\nShoppers have been warned they face higher prices amid fears Rachel Reeves could hammer retailers with further tax rises at her Budget in November.\nThe British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents the UK’s biggest retailers, said any further tax rises on the industry also risked store closures and job losses.\nIt came as official data showed a 0.6pc rise in retail sales in July, compared with a month earlier, but fell 0.6pc during three months to July on the previous quarter.\nHowever, the BRC said the increase made “little dent” at a time when retailers were burdened with higher taxes and labour costs.\nDr Kris Hamer, from the BRC, said: “Unfortunately, this level of sales growth makes little dent on the £7bn of new costs that retailers are having to shoulder following last year’s Budget.\n“With a date now sent for the next Budget, government must ensure that no additional tax is levied onto retailers, or else many will be forced to make difficult decisions around raising prices, store closures, and jobs.”\nRetailers raised fears that with an autumn Budget scheduled for November 26, they could face a sharp fall in spending just as they get ready for the crucial Christmas trading period.\nNicholas Found from Retail Economics said despite an increase in retail sales in July, spending on homeware and fashion had become heavily reliant on promotions rather than a boost in consumer demand.\nHe said: “Sales momentum across categories is patchy beneath the surface, including food facing renewed pressure from price rises.”\nThe figures were published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Friday after they delayed releasing the data by two weeks “to allow for further quality assurance”.\nThe statistics body apologised for errors in its data and made corrections to retail sales figures from earlier in the year.\nThe ONS revised down its figures for the volume of retail sales in the six months to June from 1.7pc to 1.1pc.\nThe change came after the statistics body uncovered an error in how it seasonally adjusts the data.\n10:30 AM BST\nReeves accused of wasting billions in taxpayer cash with costly debt binge\nRachel Reeves has been accused of wasting taxpayers’ money through an “arrogant” approach to borrowing from international debt markets.\nEconomists believe the Chancellor could save billions of pounds by the end of the decade if she copied the US treasury and opted to borrow more money via cheaper, short-term debt.\nInstead, the Government continues to raise billions by borrowing over 10, 20 and 30-year terms that lock in high borrowing costs for decades.\n09:54 AM BST\nONS grapples with reliability concerns\nExperts have raised concerns about the reliability of data from the ONS after the statistics body made revisions to retail sales figures released earlier this year.\nErrors in the way the ONS produces seasonally adjusted retail sales figures had caused it to delay the release of the figures by two weeks.\nMatt Swannell, the chief economic advisor to EY ITEM Club, said: “It’s hard to have much confidence in the data when such fundamental errors have been made, and the revisions are so significant.”\nThe ONS then made significant revisions to retail sales figures from the first six months of the year after it uncovered an error with how it calculated seasonally adjusted sales.\nRob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “Errors are unwelcome and likely reflect ONS resources being stretched too far.\n“Getting the data right in the first place is crucial for building confidence in official statistics, but almost as important is admitting an error and correcting the problem as soon as possible.”\nThe ONS has also experienced issues with its labour market data as responses to its key survey have declined.\n09:33 AM BST\nLondon markets update\nThe FTSE 100 has risen 0.3pc this morning as defence and aerospace companies provide a boost to the blue-chip index.\nHousebuilders Barratt Redrow and Berkeley Group helped to push the FTSE 100 higher after Berkeley Group maintained guidance for the current financial year.\nThe FTSE 250 also made gains in early morning trading, climbing 0.4pc. However, it came under pressure from luxury retailer Burberry, which fell 2.4pc.\nOil prices continued to edge lower ahead of an OPEC+ meeting on Sunday. Traders expect the group to announce in increases to oil production.\nThe price of Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell 0.4pc to $66.75 per barrel.\n09:15 AM BST\nBritain’s housing market faces potential headwinds\nThe UK’s housing market is facing headwinds as it grapples with rising borrowing costs and a cooling labour market, warns an economist.\nMartin Beck, economist at WPI, said the increase in the UK’s borrowing costs risked putting pressure on the housing market.\nIt comes after long term borrowing costs climbed to 5.75pc on Wednesday morning, a 27 year high. Following some jitters in the bond market they have settled at 5.56pc today.\nMr Beck said: “The headwinds are clear. Mortgage rates remain elevated by the standards of most of the last 15 years and rising bond yields are already pushing up the cost of fixed-rate loans.\n“The jobs market is softening, consumer sentiment is fragile and speculation over property tax hikes in November’s Budget may cause some potential buyers to delay.”\n08:42 AM BST\nHouse prices rise for third month in a row\nHouse prices rose for the third month in a row as mortgage rates eased and continued wage growth helped sales remain resilient.\nThe value of a typical home rose 0.3pc in August compared to July, according to the Halifax house price index.\nAverage house prices stood at £299,331, which was up 2.2pc compared to the same time last year.\nAmanda Bryden of Halifax said: “The story of the housing market in 2025 has been one of stability. Since January, prices have risen by less than £600, underlining how steady the market has been despite wider economic pressures.\n“While the wider economic picture remains uncertain, the housing market has shown over recent years that it can take these challenges in its stride.”\nThe rise in house prices comes as the number of homes for sale hit a 10-year high in June.\nHalifax said there continues to be challenges with the affordability of homes however there are “signs of improvement” as lenders offer more flexible affordability assessments and mortgage rates ease.\nHouse prices have risen more slowly in recent months following a rapid increase at the start of 2025 when buyers sought to take advantage of the final months of stamp duty break on property purchases.\n07:45 AM BST\nSunny weather provides boost to retail sales\nRetail sales rose by 0.6pc in July, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), as shoppers splashed out on clothing and footwear.\nGood weather and the women’s Euro football tournament helped to drive shoppers to spend more during the month.\nThe rise in monthly retail sales beat analysts’ expectations of a 0.2pc increase.\nThe increase in sales is a boost for retailers as they grapple with an increase in labour costs after the rise in employers’ national insurance contributions came into effect in April.\nDespite the monthly increase, in the three months to July retail sales volumes fell 0.6pc, as households cut back on spending in May.\nThe new retail sales figures come after the ONS delayed releasing the data by two weeks “to allow for further quality assurance”. The statistics body has come under scrutiny for the reliability of its data.\n06:50 AM BST\n5 things to start your day\n-\nReeves accused of wasting billions in taxpayer cash with costly debt binge | Chancellor urged to copy US treasury and borrow more money via cheaper, short-term loans\n-\nBritain’s biggest tour operator slashes flights as tax fears hit bookings | Package holiday airline Jet 2 has cut 200,000 seats to winter sunspots amid fall in demand\n-\nFed official faces criminal investigation over mortgage scandal | Trump ordered governor’s removal from US central bank as he pushes for lower interest rates\n-\nBritain’s biggest wind farm operator sues US after Trump blocks project | Ørsted seeks to force American officials to allow it to finish a $1.5bn project near Rhode Island\n-\nLloyd’s of London reverses net zero ban | Insurers no longer have to meet targets designed to curb support for polluting projects\n06:49 AM BST\nWhat happened overnight\nGood morning\nThanks for joining me.\nOn Wall Street, the S&P 500 gained 0.8pc, to finish at 6,502.08.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on TGT. Target Corporation's share was trading at $95.98 as of August 29th. TGT’s trailing and forward P/E were 11.19 and 13.05 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nCopyright: nicoletaionescu / 123RF Stock Photo\nTarget Corporation (TGT) has seen a sharp decline, down roughly 65% from its 2021 highs, drawing attention during its latest earnings release. Initial analysis suggested an asymmetric risk-reward setup, with a bear scenario near $86 and a bull case of $205, underpinned by modest assumptions for sales growth, forward margins, multiples, and buybacks. This superficially attractive setup briefly tempted an investor, but deeper qualitative analysis revealed several warning signs. These included a CEO transition with minimal insider ownership, flat to negative comparable store sales, declining transaction volumes, stagnant digital sales since 2022, and weakening pricing power amidst inflation and looming tariffs.\nMarket share losses across multiple categories further highlighted underlying operational challenges. Risk assessment tools flagged at least 17 yellow and red indicators, while management commentary on operational levers was vague and unconvincing, with odd prioritization of dividend policy and avoidance of buybacks. These factors implied that relying purely on multiples to justify upside could be misleading, potentially creating a value trap, with revised risk-reward scenarios dropping the bear price to $60 and the bull case to $160. Ultimately, the exercise highlighted the tension between short-term valuation appeal and long-term operational reality.\nThe investor recognized the pull of quick value trades but reaffirmed adherence to principles and a disciplined investment style, emphasizing that potential short-term gains should not override rigorous analysis and alignment with a consistent, quality-focused strategy. Target’s situation underscores the importance of integrating quantitative risk-reward metrics with qualitative business assessment to avoid misjudging fundamentally challenged stocks.\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Target Corporation (TGT) by LongYield in May 2025, which highlighted digital momentum, cost control, and long-term strategy despite near-term sales weakness and margin pressures. The stock has appreciated roughly 1.7% since then. Francesco Ferrari shares a similar approach but emphasizes deeper operational risks, management concerns, and the potential for a value trap despite attractive multiples.", "content_hash": "4a2ce602c0a2253366ed488da2434c54", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on AGX. Argan, Inc.'s share was trading at $228.22 as of August 29th. AGX’s trailing P/E was 31.83 according to Yahoo Finance.\nSophie McAulay/Shutterstock.com\nArgan is a specialized holding company with four operating subsidiaries, led by Gemma Power Systems, which focuses on engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) of natural gas-fired power plants and renewable energy projects. Its other subsidiaries—Atlantic Projects Company, The Roberts Company, and Southern Maryland Cable—serve global power installations, heavy industries, and telecom infrastructure.\nDespite appearing as a diverse collection of engineering firms, Argan operates as a mini-conglomerate in mission-critical infrastructure construction, delivering high-margin, long-term projects that require reliability from Day One. This focus generates sticky customer relationships, strong backlogs, and resilient cash flow.\nThe company is well-positioned to benefit from secular tailwinds such as the AI infrastructure boom, where data centers require massive, reliable power, and natural gas’s role as a bridge fuel, supporting Gemma’s ongoing EPC projects. U.S. infrastructure spending, industrial reshoring, and energy security investments further expand Argan’s project pipeline. The company maintains a clean balance sheet with $525–546 million in cash, zero debt, and a history of strong free cash flow generation, providing financial flexibility to navigate cyclical lumpiness and pursue optionality through buybacks, dividends, or tuck-in M&A.\nAt $214/share, Argan trades at a premium, reflecting expectations for sustained high margins, backlog growth above $2 billion, and continued on-time execution of complex projects. However, significant risks exist: fixed-price EPC contracts expose the company to cost overruns, supply chain disruptions, international project losses, and disputed receivables.

Since General Atlantic made its initial minority investment in the company in 2019 -- and will still hold roughly 49 million shares -- I don't believe the offering is an indictment of DLocal.\nInvesting groups like General Atlantic have a multitude of reasons for selling a given stock, and after a 50% pop over the last year is as good a time as any.\nIf anything, this week's drop makes me interested in adding to my DLocal position. DLocal connects some of the largest merchants in the world to over 2 billion people in emerging economies from more than 40 countries across Latin America, Africa, and Asia, with its suite of 900-plus payment options.\nGrowing total payment volume (TPV) by 53% in its latest quarter -- and guiding for 40% to 50% TPV growth in 2025 -- DLocal could prove to be a great long-term buy at just 21 times free cash flow.\nShould you invest $1,000 in DLocal right now?\nBefore you buy stock in DLocal, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and DLocal wasn’t one of them.

So, it's not surprising that the world's biggest tech players are pouring investment into this high-potential area. Meta Platforms and Alphabet both lifted capital spending forecasts in their recent earnings calls, citing ongoing investment in AI infrastructure. And Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) chief Jensen Huang predicted the AI buildout could be worth $3 trillion to $4 trillion by the end of the decade.\nTwo semiconductor stocks in particular stand to gain the most from this spending boom. Let's check them out.\n1. Nvidia\nNvidia is the world's No. 1 designer of graphics processing units (GPUs), the chip needed to drive key AI tasks -- but the tech giant hasn't stopped there. It's also developed an entire array of AI products and services to suit the needs of any customer, from the big tech player to the small start-up. So Nvidia is positioning itself to be the \"go to\" destination for companies as they set off on the AI path.\nThough Nvidia serves a wide variety of AI players in the market, it's important to note that a great deal of its sales comes from technology giants such as Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft. Though Nvidia doesn't name its biggest customers, these players each have publicly spoken of their relationship with Nvidia -- and each of these companies is spending big on AI. For example, Meta predicts $66 billion to $72 billion in capital spending this year, and much of this investment will support AI buildout.\nThese technology powerhouses aim to build the best AI platforms and do so in the most efficient manner, and today, the company offering chips and related products and services to do so is Nvidia. In the latest quarter, Nvidia reported double-digit revenue growth and called demand for its latest chip Blackwell Ultra \"extraordinary,\" so it's clear tech giants continue to flock to this AI leader. And Nvidia's plan to update its chips annually should keep this trend going.\nAll of this means, as the AI buildout continues toward potentially $4 trillion, Nvidia is likely to be one of the biggest winners.\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\nNvidia may design chips, but to bring those chips to market, it relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). And so do many other companies, from Advanced Micro Devices to Broadcom. In fact, TSMC produces about 90% of today's advanced chips, according to an article in Wired. Therefore, the chip manufacturer benefits not only from Nvidia's strength, but from every chip designer's growth during this AI boom.\nOn top of this, TSMC is taking steps to invest more in U.S.-based production, a move that should shield the company and its customers from import tariffs down the road. TSMC this year announced $165 billion in investment in chip manufacturing in the U.S. -- this includes the development of six advanced wafer production fabs in Arizona, two packaging fabs, and a research and development center. The first fab already is producing at volume, construction of the second fab is complete, and construction of the third has started. These moves should streamline the process of working with U.S. chip designers and help TSMC keep up with demand as infrastructure spending increases.\nThe chipmaker has a solid earnings track record, generating double-digit growth quarter after quarter, and in its recent earnings report said it expects ongoing strength in AI demand -- this is as both companies and countries increase their spending on chips and related products and services. All of this bodes well for TSMC, making it a fantastic stock to buy and hold throughout the AI revolution.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

These breakthroughs have shifted the tech economy and are on track to bring significant productivity gains.\nMany investors believe such a transformation is not possible without one company, and the company usually cited is Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC). However, it would not be possible for TSMC to manufacture its most advanced chips without equipment provided by semiconductor equipment maker ASML (NASDAQ: ASML).\nInterestingly, ASML has struggled recently despite its market power. Its total returns slightly beat the S&P 500's performance over the last five years. Still, given ASML's importance, a closer examination of the company may offer clues as to whether it can outperform the market over the next five years.\nASML and the AI market\nASML produces machines that, in turn, produce semiconductors. At the lower end of the market, it competes with companies like Lam Research and Applied Materials.\nNonetheless, it stands out with its leadership in extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV), the technology that allows foundries to build the world's most advanced semiconductors. No company has matched ASML's prowess in EUV machines, including Huawei, which wants to skirt the export bans that limit ASML's ability to sell in China.\nAmid its market power, its highest-end EUV machines reportedly sell for more than $400 million, and its clients spend billions every year on machine maintenance. As an essential product, these companies have to do business with ASML.\nOver time, demand is on track to rise significantly. Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29% for the AI chip market through 2030. That should bode well for ASML's sales for the remainder of the decade.\nHowever, the only companies competing to build the most advanced chips are TSMC, Samsung, and lately, Intel. Even though additional foundries may buy its less-advanced equipment, the company can only sell equipment to a small number of clients.\nMoreover, the pace of foundry construction drives cyclicality in this business. The shortage of AI chips is likely to result in increased business for TSMC and, by extension, ASML. Still, Intel's recent cutbacks could have weighed on ASML's near-term financial performance.\nASML by the numbers\nIndeed, the numbers point to significant cyclicality. In the first half of 2025, revenue of 15.4 billion euros ($18.0 billion) rose by 34% compared to the same period in 2024. Increases in net service sales and net service and field option sales drove the revenue surge. It also resulted in a 53.7% gross margin, up from 51.2% over the same period.\nASML also kept cost and expense growth in check during that time frame. Consequently, its net income for the first two quarters of the year was more than 4.6 billion euros ($5.4 billion).\nDespite those gains, the outlook for the year's second half has become bleaker. The company expects 15% annual net sales growth for 2025, with gross margins pulling back to 52%. That news led to the stock dropping after the Q2 earnings announcement, and its stock has yet to recover from that decline.\nStill, such pessimism has taken ASML's P/E ratio to 28. That is a multiyear low and far below the 41 average over the previous five years. That potentially sets up new shareholders to benefit from multiple expansion as the market for AI-ready semiconductors grows.\nASML in five years\nOver the next five years, ASML is likely to outperform the market.\nIndeed, ASML faces a near-term slowdown, and the fact that it fell slightly short of the S&P 500's returns over the last five years is somewhat concerning.\nNonetheless, ASML's EUV machines are a crucial part of meeting the rapidly growing demand for AI chips. Thus, even if the industry faces some short-term cyclicality, the company's financials and stock performance should trend higher at a relatively rapid pace.\nAdditionally, the fact that ASML trades at a discounted valuation will likely add to the returns. Between the growth rate of its industry and the discounted valuation, investors who buy now and hold for five years will likely be glad they became long-term shareholders of ASML.\nShould you buy stock in ASML right now?\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and ASML wasn’t one of them.

It boasts one of the most valuable brand names in the world, an army of loyal customers, and has consistently proven its innovative qualities over time. However, the tech leader has faced challenges lately, one of which is the threat of tariffs. Furthermore, Apple has fallen behind some of its similarly sized tech peers in the rapidly expanding artificial intelligence (AI) market.\nThe tailwind AI is providing to two of them, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), could enable both to surpass Apple in terms of market capitalization within the next three years. Here's why Amazon and Alphabet look like better buys right now.\n1. Amazon\nAmazon's current market cap is $2.4 billion, compared to Apple's $3.4 trillion. That sounds like a massive difference, but it's worth noting that Amazon has consistently grown its revenue faster than its peers over the past three years, despite having higher sales numbers.\nThe e-commerce specialist should maintain that momentum for several reasons. First, it remains a leader in the cloud computing market. Even as it loses ground to some of its closest competitors, Amazon's cloud unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), remains a strong performer. The company's AWS sales in the second quarter increased by 17.5% year over year to $30.9 billion, outpacing the rest of the business. AWS is also responsible for most of Amazon's profits.\nSecond, Amazon is capitalizing on the rise of AI, thanks to a suite of AI-related services it offers through its cloud. The company is also implementing the technology in-house. For instance, Amazon's industrial robots utilize AI-powered algorithms to optimize travel distances in the company's warehouses, enabling them to handle and deliver packages more efficiently and cost-effectively.\nThird, Amazon's advertising business should represent yet another important growth driver. As of the end of 2024, the company's advertising revenue run rate was $69 billion, more than doubling since 2020. Amazon is one of the most visited websites in the world, making it an attractive hub for advertisers. These three growth drivers -- the cloud, AI, and advertising-- should maintain solid momentum in the next three years, and well beyond that, for that matter.\nCEO Andy Jassy believes we are still in the early innings of the cloud and AI revolutions. Amazon's most important business, cloud computing, is less exposed than Apple to tariff-related concerns. True, if President Donald Trump's policies lead to an economic downturn, spending will decrease for consumers and businesses, resulting in lower revenue for the company's e-commerce and cloud units. Even so, this potential challenge would also impact Apple. Additionally, the latter may have to contend with heavy tariffs on imported goods from abroad, which would disrupt its primary source of revenue and profits.\nLastly, Amazon's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 34.6 may be higher than Apple's 29.2, but the former's premium is well-deserved. Amazon is well-positioned to outpace Apple in the next few years and become a more valuable company by market cap. It should deliver excellent results well beyond that.\n2. Alphabet\nAlphabet's market cap is $2.5 trillion. It has also grown its revenue faster than Apple much more often than not in the past three years, and has not surpassed the iPhone maker in quarterly sales.\nAlphabet's advertising business remains its biggest source of sales, thanks to the company's dominance in search. Even AI chatbots haven't made a significant impact on Alphabet's search empire, especially as the company has adapted to this new landscape. Alphabet has added the now highly successful AI overviews to its search engine. Elsewhere, the company's cloud and AI businesses are helping supercharge top-line growth. In the second quarter, Alphabet's cloud division grew by almost 32% year over year, much faster than even AWS.\nThe parent company of Google recently signed a $10 billion, six-year cloud deal with Meta Platforms. In other words, business is booming for Google Cloud. The rest of Alphabet's business, including YouTube, a leader in the streaming industry, is also performing well.\nYet, the stock's forward P/E is 22, much lower than Amazon's and Apple's. The market remains concerned that Alphabet may be forced to sell its Chrome browser as part of an antitrust lawsuit, which could significantly disrupt its advertising business. If that happens, Alphabet's shares will plunge. It's worth keeping that risk in mind, while also remembering that forcing companies to divest part of their operations in high-profile antitrust cases is a very rare outcome for the U.S. government. If Alphabet can overcome this obstacle, though, the stock will soar and, over the next three years, could perform well enough to overtake the battered Apple.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

The first is how well it achieves its aim of tracking the S&P 500 index (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). The second reason, which may actually be more important to you, is how you can expect it to perform from here.\nWhat does Vanguard 500 Index ETF do and how well does it do it?\nFrom a big-picture perspective, Vanguard 500 Index ETF's only goal is to track the performance of the S&P 500 index. The S&P 500 is a portfolio of roughly 500 stocks selected by a committee to be representative of the broader U.S. economy. The stocks in the index are market-cap weighted, so the largest businesses have the biggest impact on performance. That's logical and is basically how the economy works.\nVanguard 500 Index ETF's value on the last trading day of August was $593.08 per share. The price that the exchange-traded fund (ETF) traded for among investors was $592.70 per share. It is basically tracking along with the value of its portfolio, which is the value of index. Performance-wise, the S&P 500 index is up 227.6% over the past decade while Vanguard S&P 500 Index ETF is up 227.5%, which is virtually identical.\nSo, Vanguard S&P 500 index ETF does what it sets out to do. But it also does it for a very attractive cost -- a 0.03% expense ratio. That's as close to free on Wall Street as you can probably get and lower than some of the other S&P 500 index alternatives. So if you want to track the S&P 500 index, then Vanguard S&P 500 index ETF could be a good buy for you right now.\nDo you want to track the S&P 500 index?\nFrom a long-term perspective, the S&P 500 index has been a wonderful investment choice. A look at the long-term performance graph below shows that the trend is up and to the right. Even some of the worst recessions and bear markets are mere blips along the way higher at this point. If you are looking for an easy investment that doesn't require a lot of thought, Vanguard S&P 500 Index ETF could be a great choice for you.\nThe problem is that the S&P 500 index swings between bull and bear markets. To put that another way, stocks move higher in a jagged pattern. That's an issue right now because the S&P 500 index is currently trading near all-time highs. It could easily keep moving higher, but if you care at all about valuation, you'll likely be worried that the next big move could be lower.", "content_hash": "de885a83102071b06f531f3cc3875e1f", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Projects that commence construction sooner can be placed in service anytime before Dec. 31, 2029, and still qualify for the credit.\n“TPO isn’t new — it already accounts for about 45% of residential installs in the U.S., with companies like Sunrun, Palmetto (LightReach), EnFin, and GoodLeap leading the charge,” Aurora Solar said.\nSunrun CEO Mary Powell said during an Aug. 6 earnings call that the company “is well positioned to continue to generate strong financial returns under the enacted legislation” as it “primarily benefits from the commercial investment tax credit known as 48E, as 94% of new customer additions are subscribers.”\nThird-party solar financing generally comes in two forms: leasing agreements and power purchase agreements, according to a January explainer from the Environmental Protection Agency.\n“In the lease model, a customer signs a contract with an installer/developer and pays for the use of a solar system over a specified period of time, rather than paying for the power generated,” EPA said. “In the PPA model, the solar energy system offsets the customer’s electric utility bill, and the developer sells the power generated to the customer at a fixed rate, typically lower than the local utility.”\nInvestment bank Jeffries said in an Aug. 7 note that it expects residential-focused solar company Sunrun to benefit in 2026 “as 25D expiration provides an assist for TPOs,” and noted that market consultants estimate TPOs will grow 25% in 2026 compared to this year.\nHomeowners who don’t want to opt for a TPO structure can qualify for the 25D credit if their solar system's original installation is completed by the end of the year, even if it's not yet been placed in service.

Chances are that virtually everyone reading this would have their hands raised. AI has been the hottest topic in the stock market and business world over the past couple of years, and there's probably not even a close second.\nSince the technology hit the mainstream due to the success of generative AI tools like ChatGPT, it has become virtually impossible to escape. With this increased interest in the technology has come increased investor interest in companies dealing with AI in almost any capacity. And this has led to many of these companies' valuations surging to unprecedented levels.\nAlthough AI consumer applications are what most people know and interact with, at the heart of the technology are AI chips. If you're looking to take advantage of a dominant company in the industry, look no further than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) -- also known as TSMC. It's by far the biggest no-brainer AI chip stock to buy right now.\nTSMC is the go-to chip manufacturer\nTSMC is the world's leading semiconductor (chip) foundry. The foundry business model means that it doesn't produce chips that can be bought in stores or online; instead, companies come to TSMC with their chip designs and TSMC uses its manufacturing power to bring the chips to life.\nNo chip manufacturer comes close to Taiwan Semiconductor's abilities, making it the go-to for most of the world's top tech companies. Apple uses TSMC for its hardware; Qualcomm uses it for processors; Tesla uses it for self-driving chips; Advanced Micro Devices uses it for its central processing units (CPUs); and Nvidia notably uses it for its graphics processing units (GPUs).\nThese are just a handful of TSMC's clients, too. Dozens of others rely heavily on the company. As of the second quarter, TSMC had a 70% market share in the global foundry market, according to research company TrendForce. This explains why the company's revenue and profits have soared over the past few years.\nThe AI pipeline starts with TSMC\nTo understand the importance of TSMC to the AI world, it's helpful to work backward, starting with the end-user AI applications that many people interact with today. These applications must be trained using vast amounts of data (and I do mean vast). The size of this data means that AI developers must rely on data centers, which allow for the storage, processing, and scaling of these massive AI models.", "content_hash": "231215c3fd82d0af764085508165989a", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

With fiscal worries pushing 30-year yields to just shy of 5%, short wagers stand at their highest level since February.\nThose bets — a departure from a previous view that leaned toward a dovish Fed and lower yields after a series of weaker-than-expected economic data — will be tested when the US releases its employment report. A number that is significantly weaker than the 75,000 jobs economists are expecting would bolster the case for more rate cuts and ramp up pressure on bearish investors to recalibrate their positioning.\n“If we get enough bad data to tip the scales we could have a break out in yields lower for the short end,” said Kathryn Kaminski, chief strategist and portfolio manager at AlphaSimplex Group. That “could be sort of a catalyst to signal that things in the labor market are a little bit worse than we thought.”\nSteepening Curve\nThe gap between shorter term yields and those on longer-term Treasuries has grown in recent weeks, as investors weigh data suggesting a slowing economy against fiscal worries.\nTwo-year yields, which tend to more closely track Fed policy expectations, on Wednesday hit the lowest level since May after a weaker-than-expected report on hiring and firing by US employers caused traders to almost fully price in a 25 basis-point cut this month.\nYields were two basis points lower across maturities on Thursday at 10:00am London. The 10-year was around 4.20%.\nRising Treasury Volatility Is Evoking ‘Liberation Day’ Memories\nWhile the possibility of a 50 basis-point cut in September is seen as slim, traders in the SOFR options market have nevertheless resumed hedging against such an outcome over the last week.\nThe recent bearish positioning, however, suggests that some traders believe that recent evidence of cooling growth is an anomaly, according to Sean Simko, head of fixed income investment management at SEI Investments Corp.\n“A strong number will move yields higher, faster than a weak number will push yields lower, unless the number is very weak,” he said.\nMeanwhile, longer-term yields have headed higher in recent weeks as investors demand increased compensation for financing government deficits. The Trump administration’s spending and tax cut plans are projected to worsen the country’s fiscal position unless tariff revenue growth is sustained, an outcome that a federal court ruling jeopardized last week.\nExplainer: Why Long-Dated Bonds Have Made Investors So Wary\nA faster pace of rate cuts could allay some of those concerns, at least temporarily, if falling yields make it easier for the US to service its debt.\nIt’s Friday’s number, however, that will likely dictate the trajectory for yields over the next few weeks.\nSteven Englander, head of global G-10 FX research at Standard Chartered, said in a note that any number below 40,000 jobs would move markets toward a 50 basis point cut.\n“To take a cut off the table completely, we think NFP would have to rise to 130k or more, with positive revisions,” he said.\nHere’s a rundown of the latest positioning indicators across the rates market:\nJPMorgan Treasury Client Survey\nJPMorgan’s Treasury client survey showed shorts extending to the most elevated since Feb. 3 and rising by eight percentage points in the week to Sept. 2. The net long position is now the smallest since Feb. 3.\nMost Active SOFR Options\nIn SOFR options across Sep25, Dec25 and Mar26 tenors over the past week the 96.00 strike has been active following recent flows including buyer of the SFRU5 96.00/96.125/96.25 call fly and SFRZ5 96.00/95.875 1x2 put spreads. Also the SFRU5 96.00/96.125 call spread was bought in heavy size on Friday, along with the SFRZ5 95.6875/95.8125/96.00/96.125 call condor. Following heightened activity around these types of flows, the 96.125 strike was also heavily featured over the past week.\nSOFR Options Heatmap\nIn SOFR options across Sep25, Dec25 and Mar26 tenors, the 96.125 strike remains the most populated, where a large amount of Sep25 calls lie, largely due to a massive position in the SFRU5 96.125/96.25 call spread which has been built over recent weeks to a size in the region of 350,000 options. The 95.625 strike also contains a heavy amount of open interest largely due to positioning in Sep25 puts and Dec25 calls. There also remains a large amount of 95.75 Sep25 puts in open positions.\nTreasury Options Skew\nTreasury options skew in the long-end of the curve continues to favor puts, while the front and belly of the curve favors calls, indicating traders paying a higher premium to hedge a selloff in long-bond futures. The skew fits demand for steepeners, which remains a crowded position and premium on bond puts vs. the rest of the curve.\nCFTC Futures Positioning\nIn the week ending Aug. 26, hedge funds extended net short positioning across the front-end and belly of the futures strip, while asset managers were bullish long-end of the curve, shown by CFTC data.\n--With assistance from Elizabeth Stanton, Liz Capo McCormick and David Watkins.", "content_hash": "4927c05f89b09c3dccd939a633b3877d", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

While the impacts are manifold (and widespread), U.S. companies managed through the first half of 2025 with varying degrees of success—and an array of mitigation tactics.\n“With regards to our U.S. pricing decisions, given tariff-related cost pressures, we’re doing what we said we would do. We’re keeping our prices as low as we can for as long as we can,” said the big box retailer’s president, CEO and director C. Douglas McMillon during an earnings call last month. “Our merchants have been creative and acted with urgency to avoid what would have been additional pressure for our customers and members.”\nMore from Sourcing Journal\nWalmart posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.68—below the $0.74 per share expected by analysts—but revenue for Q2 surpassed the $176.16 billion projection, reaching $177.4 billion.\nAccording to the executive, the impact of tariffs has been “gradual enough that any behavioral adjustments by the customer have been somewhat muted.” However, as the retailer replenishes inventory at new, post-tariff prices, it’s seeing its costs increase weekly—a trend he expects to see continue into the third and fourth quarters.\nExecutive vice president and chief financial officer John David Rainey chimed in, saying that as Walmart embarks on Q3, the firm’s “momentum has persisted and our inventory is at a healthy level,” up about 4 percent year over year. That’s primarily attributable to the heightened cost of imported products and the timing of receipts, he said.\n“In this tariff-impacted period, we’re closely monitoring customer demand and managing quantity decisions as we measure the price elasticity of impacted items,” he added.\nTarget’s troubles aren’t constrained to a CEO shakeup driven by dampened consumer demand and boycotts.\nIn an August earnings call, outgoing CEO Brian Cornell said that as one of the nation’s biggest importers, Target was “facing some major financial and operational hurdles as we entered the year.” Existing hardships were compounded by the subsequent (and frequent) changes to tariff and trade policy announced by the Trump administration as the year has gone on, he added.\nAccording to executive vice president and chief financial officer James Lee, the company’s Q2 gross margin rate fell 1 basis point from the same period last year. That change was mostly the result of “about 210 basis points of pressure within merchandising,” or inventory adjustment costs prompted by the slowdown in Q1 sales as well as tariff pressures (including the cost of cancelling purchase orders).\nAdditionally, Lee said Target’s inventory costs more than it did a year ago due to tariffs, among other circumstances. “As such, our Q2 ending inventory units saw a low single-digit decline versus last year,” he said. The national retailer’s adjusted earnings per share rang in at $2.05 in the second quarter, compared to $2.57 one year ago. “It’s notable that the vast majority of this decline was driven by the combined impact of inventory adjustment costs and tariff-related costs,” he added.\nJoanne Crevoiserat, CEO and director of the Coach and Kate Spade parent, said the firm is looking ahead to 2026 and expects “continued growth” after a Q2 that saw remarkably stronger-than-expected revenue of $1.72 billion, outpacing its $1.67 billion estimate—an 8.3 percent year-over-year increase.\n“Our guidance calls for mid-single-digit top-line growth and mid-to-high single-digit earnings growth, inclusive of tariffs. And we’re clear eyed about the environment. We’re incorporating the latest news on tariffs, both in how it could pressure consumers as well as the impact on our business,” she said. Despite the tariffs, Crevoiserat said the firm is continuing to expand its operating margin in 2025, and is positioned to “fully offset” the duty impacts in time.\nGetting into the nuts and bolts, Scott Roe, Tapestry’s chief financial officer and chief operating officer, said he expects inventory levels to come down modestly in 2026. The CFO said the company is “facing greater than previously expected profit headwinds from tariffs and duties with the earlier than expected ending of de minimis exemptions being a meaningful factor.”\n“In aggregate, the total expected impact on profitability this year from tariffs is $160 million, representing approximately two thirty basis points of margin headwind,” he added. The company is mitigating the impacts by “leveraging our agile supply chain to optimize our global manufacturing footprint, minimizing our tariff exposure where possible,” and working with longstanding service providers to drive efficiencies where possible.\nThe Baltimore-based athleticwear brand delivered a disappointing Q1 earnings report in early August, having missed forecasts for both earnings per share and revenue. The company posted EPS of $0.02—short of the $0.03 that was projected—amounting to a 33.3 percent miss. Revenue also fell short of forecasts, ringing in at $1.1 billion compared to the anticipated $1.13 billion. It anticipates revenue decline to continue into 2026, to the tune of 6 percent to 7 percent.\nAccording to CEO Kevin Plank, Under Armour expects to see fiscal challenges linger next year in the North American market due to higher costs from tariffs and softer demand from consumers. “Yet we see this as an inflection point, not a ceiling. Despite the environment, we’re executing a phase plan to rebuild brand loyalty, improve revenue quality and lay the groundwork for sustainable growth,” he said. Much of the brand’s future strategy revolves around premium brand positioning and trying to sell more products at full price.\nPlank addressed the Trump administration’s tariff announcements in late July, which brought “increased pressures” to an already challenging landscape. “Following those updates, we estimate approximately $100 million in additional tariff-related costs along with softer than expected demand in fiscal 2026,” he said. Combined even with mitigation efforts and “disciplined” selling, general and administrative (SG&A) management, “our profitability is projected to be about half of what it was last year,” he explained. “None of this is ideal. We don’t like this.”\nThe specialty retailer’s chief financial officer, Robert Ball, said Abercrombie has seen about $5 million in adverse impact from tariffs during the second quarter, chiefly manifested in the cost of sales, and expects $90 million net impact from tariffs for the year.\nLower gross margin was “partially offset” by about 60 basis points of operating expense leverage, he said. “We ended the second quarter with inventory in a clean current position with inventory at cost up 10 percent and units up 7 percent,” he added.\nSpeaking to the logistics strategy that the company is leveraging to remediate tariff impacts, Ball said, “In anticipation of tariffs, we did selectively clear third quarter receipts early within our bonded warehouses driving around one point of the cost increase. As we alluded to last quarter, we saw a normalization of freight costs and unit mix that drove sequential improvement in year-over-year inventory comparisons.”\nThe company expects that China sourcing will remain in the low single digits for the year, and it has little exposure to the de minimis exemption that’s been terminated, “so it’s not a factor.”\n“Globally, we remain nicely diversified across 16 countries and the team is continuing to evaluate supply chain footprint changes, vendor negotiations and operating expense efficiencies that will largely take shape in fiscal 2026,” he said. Abercrombie doesn’t expect broad price increases in 2025.\nWith tariff rates evolving constantly and trade agreements continuing to be negotiated, the company is avoiding “making any sort of knee jerk reactions,” Ball said. “What we are doing is we’re staying on offense. We’ve got great teams. We’ve got proven playbooks to address disruptions like this, just like we have in the past. But changes particularly in this space are complicated.”\nThe Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein parent company saw a 4 percent increase in revenue on a reported basis, and a 1 percent increase on a constant currency basis, outperforming its guidance for Q2. Between the two brands, Calvin Klein saw a 5 percent revenue increase (and a 3 percent increase in constant currency), while Tommy Hilfiger saw a 4 percent increase in revenue, remaining flat in constant currency.\nChief financial officer Zac Coughlin said the firm is expecting Q3 gross margin to decline approximately 175 basis points from the year-ago period. “The impact of tariffs will be felt much more heavily in the fourth quarter given when new rates take effect in the timing of sell through,” he said. The company expects SG&A as a percentage of revenue to grow by about 75 basis points compared to fiscal 2024.\nHow is the company planning to keep shoppers engaged? “We are investing more into marketing in the third quarter to capitalize on key consumer moments, and to support our brand building cut through campaigns amplified by mega talent,” he said.\nGap Inc. saw better-than-expected results during the second quarter, driven in large part by its namesake brand.\nThe firm saw an overall 1 percent increase in comparable sales for Q2 (driven by positive comps for Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic), and earnings per share hit $0.57, a 6 percent jump from the previous year. It closed the quarter with robust cash balances of around $2.4 billion, showing solid financial standing and a capacity for future investments. The Gap brand itself saw its seventh consecutive quarter of positive comps, leading to a 4 percent increase.\nKatrina O’Connell, executive vice president and chief financial officer, said the company is remaining mindful as trade policy evolves of its financial outlook for the remainder of 2025. “It was exciting to see continued strength at Old Navy and Gap with emerging growth at Banana Republic, all of which helped us navigate the quarter despite choppiness at Athleta where we welcome new leadership,” she said.\nOperating margin fell 10 basis points from the year-ago period to 7.8 percent, while earnings per share for the quarter were $0.57—an increase of 6 percent versus last year’s earnings per share of $0.54. End of quarter inventory levels were up 9 percent year over year, “primarily as a result of accelerated receipts and higher cost due to tariffs,” O’Connell said. “We remain committed to our disciplined inventory management principles, and we believe we ended the quarter with the right inventory composition.”\nDuring Q1, Gap Inc. previewed an estimated net tariff impact for 2025 amounting to about $100 million to $150 million, based on the Trump administration’s stated April tariff rates. “I am proud that the teams have since mitigated the majority of that impact,” O’Connell said. Based on new tariff rates announced in late July, Gap Inc. still expects net sales to grow between 1 percent and 2 percent year-over-year in 2025.\nUrban Outfitters delivered strong performance across all its brands in Q2, with shining stars being Nuuly and Anthropologie.\nDuring its earnings call, the company reported an 11 percent increase in total sales and a 22 percent bump in net income, setting new records for the second quarter. Nuuly, the company’s rental service, saw impressive revenue growth of 53 percent and a 48 percent increase in average active subscribers, while the company’s wholesale segment saw revenue grow by 18 percent, leading to a 15 percent increase in gross profits, reaching $566 million.\nNotably, though, SG&A expenses escalated 13 percent, but Urban was also able to obtain a 20 percent increase in operating income, reaching $174 million. Anthropologie saw retail segment comps increase 6 percent, while Free People saw a 14 percent increase in total revenue. Full-year gross margin is projected to increase by about 100 basis points for fiscal 2026.\nCo-president and chief operating officer Frank Conforti said that despite an “exceptional quarter,” the trade environment has, and will, present challenges.\nThe landscape continues to change as tariff rates have increased for many countries,” he said. “As of today and based on new assumptions, we believe the impact for the second half of the year could be approximately 75 basis points to gross margins.” Urban’s teams are continuing to put together strategies to mitigate impact, “including negotiating better terms with our vendors, diversifying our countries of origin, changing our mode of transportation from air to ocean, and strategically adjusting pricing to minimize the impact on our customers.”\nNonetheless, Conforti said tariffs represent a “temporary challenge” to the business, and he noted that he’s confident in the company’s ability to manage through the maelstrom “and still achieve approximately 100 basis points of gross margin improvement for the full fiscal year 2026.”", "content_hash": "d401308008e94dcd3295d265007ac4f8", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

When they function well, they offer more than just investment oversight, they provide continuity, stability, and governance across generations.\nYet, as families age and wealth move into the hands of younger successors, the challenges of transition can be as much about psychology and relationships as they are about balance sheets.\nFrom Founders to Heirs\nOne of the defining challenges for family offices is the shift in priorities between generations. The vision and objectives of a founder often diverge significantly from those of their children or grandchildren. This shift can reshape the entire focus of a family office.\n“The next generation’s objectives and purpose can vary hugely from the previous one,” says Daniel Aghdami, partner at Heidrick & Struggles. “This can lead to a different focus of investments, often a reduction of risk appetite, reduction of investment asset classes, and a move from active to passive investing.”\nThe consequences ripple beyond portfolio allocation. A sudden shift in risk appetite or investment approach can create new staffing requirements. Family offices may find themselves seeking new skills - for example, in sustainable investing or digital assets to meet the next generation’s preferences. In some cases, staff turnover is inevitable as roles evolve.\nNavigating Succession Dynamics\nSuccession is often seen as the transfer of wealth, but in reality, it is the transfer of influence, responsibility, and identity. This is where the role of the family office stretches far beyond finance.\n“Often, the question of suitable governance arises as older family members retire from the boards of the family’s foundations, operating companies, and the family council,” explains Aghdami. “The family office can play a vital role in ensuring continuity and success in the transition, in collaboration with external experts, with its established trust and knowledge of the family dynamics.”\nImportantly, preparing the next generation requires foresight. Training, mentoring, and gradual exposure to responsibilities can make the difference between a smooth succession and a disruptive one.\n“The family office can also play an important role in preparing the next generation well in advance,” Aghdami says. “That might mean assessing and upskilling younger family members to take on increasing responsibilities within the family entities.”\nBut succession is not just about the young. “One of the biggest challenges is preparing the older generation for the transfer of wealth and power,” he adds. “Many first-generation principals can find the process of relinquishing oversight and responsibility difficult, as well as deciding who will take responsibility for what.”\nThis dual challenge - empowering the young while easing the transition for the older - sits at the heart of family continuity.\nModels of the Modern Family Office\nNot all family offices are created equal. Their structure often depends on scale, investment complexity, and the preferences of the family.\nSmaller family offices typically adopt a simpler approach. “They tend to have a more straightforward investment focus, often relying on asset allocation and external fund managers,” Aghdami notes. “Some will have a highly specialised focus on one or two asset classes, while others prioritise tax efficiency and concierge services over outright investments.”\nLarger, institutional-style family offices, by contrast, resemble professional asset managers. Their processes, governance, and teams are often sophisticated, with less day-to-day involvement from principals.\nThe question of whether to establish a single-family office, a multi-family office, or a hybrid model is equally nuanced. “This largely depends on the family’s wealth, how much of that is investable, and the complexity of investments and non-financial needs,” Aghdami explains.\nAs a rule of thumb, families with net worths above €400m ($465m) may consider establishing their own dedicated family office. Hybrid models, however, can offer flexibility. “A hybrid model can make sense if they want to keep the size of their own single-family office small but rely on the greater resources of a multi-family office for access to and structuring of certain deals.”\nIn some cases, success itself changes the equation. Aghdami highlights how families sometimes transform their family office into a commercial business in its own right. “B-Flexion is a great example of this, having opened several of its subsidiary asset managers to external investors.”\nGovernance for Generational Harmony\nIf investment management is the technical heart of a family office, governance is the cultural soul. Clear rules and processes are essential in preventing disputes and ensuring cohesion across generations.\nGovernance models vary widely, but their importance is universal. “Family constitutions and councils are still very relevant,” says Aghdami. “In many cases, they’re being adapted to accommodate advances in governance requirements and evolving best practices.”\nIn complex, multi-generational families, some opt for highly independent governance structures. “The boards of the legal entities within the family-owned group can be made up entirely of independent board members representing the interests of all shareholders,” Aghdami explains. “The family council may only be consulted for very big decisions.”\nThis professionalisation ensures that the family’s wealth and businesses are managed effectively, while still maintaining a framework for family voices to be heard.\nStriking the Right Balance\nAt the core of governance is a delicate balance: how much influence should the family retain compared to external professionals?\nFor smaller families, the involvement of principals remains high. For larger families with complex investments and global operations, reliance on independent professionals tends to grow. What matters is designing governance structures that respect the family’s values while ensuring sound business practices.\nBuilding For Tomorrow\nAs demographics shift and generational transitions accelerate, family offices face an era of change. Whether in investment philosophy, governance, or succession planning, the ability to adapt is key.\nWhat remains constant is the need for stability. A family office that succeeds in balancing financial stewardship with family harmony becomes not just a manager of wealth, but a guardian of legacy.\nAnd in that sense, its value goes far beyond money.\n\"Family offices at crossroads\" was originally created and published by Private Banker International, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

But its newly appointed CEO, Antonio Filosa, won over at least one fan in dealership owner David Kelleher when he bluntly admitted the automaker had been wrong to kill the Jeep Cherokee in 2023.\n\"I'm sure it wasn't his decision, [but] he took credit for it,\" Kelleher said in an Automotive News article recently. \"At that moment, I'm like, 'This is the right guy.'\"\nAdmitting a mistake is often a difficult first step, and Filosa's humble ability to admit fault by the automaker will serve him well as he tries to give Stellantis direction and, yes, brings back the Jeep Cherokee.\nWelcome back!\nFilosa has a full plate trying to address spiraling sales along with the company's soured relationships with dealers, suppliers, and unions -- all of which deteriorated under former CEO Carlos Tavares.\nFilosa also needs to right-size many of the automaker's 15 brands, as well as its joint venture with Chinese electric vehicle maker Leapmotor. Meanwhile, Stellantis is seen as the most vulnerable of the Detroit automakers to tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts.\nOne big step toward fixing its stumbling brands would be to bring back the Cherokee and revitalize the Jeep brand, which is arguably the heart and soul of Stellantis.\nThe Jeep Cherokee is returning this fall as a hybrid with a starting price of just under $37,000. The upcoming Cherokee will drive longer, taller, and wider, and Stellantis hopes the vehicle will be a big volume player in the midsize SUV segment. Sales of the model peaked at nearly 240,000 units in 2018.\nJeep makeover\n\"A few years ago, we left the largest segment in North America, a highly competitive segment where customers demand the best from their midsize\" utility vehicles, Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf said at an Aug. 7 media briefing, according to Automotive News. \"We used that time to make sure we got the all-new Jeep Cherokee right, and that it delivers on everything we know our core customers and new customers are asking for: that means more standard equipment, more cargo space, more fuel economy and efficiency.\"\nThe Cherokee will be a crucial part of Jeep's ongoing makeover.

While the impacts are manifold (and widespread), U.S. companies managed through the first half of 2025 with varying degrees of success—and an array of mitigation tactics.\n“With regards to our U.S. pricing decisions, given tariff-related cost pressures, we’re doing what we said we would do. We’re keeping our prices as low as we can for as long as we can,” said the big box retailer’s president, CEO and director C. Douglas McMillon during an earnings call last month. “Our merchants have been creative and acted with urgency to avoid what would have been additional pressure for our customers and members.”\nMore from Sourcing Journal\nWalmart posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.68—below the $0.74 per share expected by analysts—but revenue for Q2 surpassed the $176.16 billion projection, reaching $177.4 billion.\nAccording to the executive, the impact of tariffs has been “gradual enough that any behavioral adjustments by the customer have been somewhat muted.” However, as the retailer replenishes inventory at new, post-tariff prices, it’s seeing its costs increase weekly—a trend he expects to see continue into the third and fourth quarters.\nExecutive vice president and chief financial officer John David Rainey chimed in, saying that as Walmart embarks on Q3, the firm’s “momentum has persisted and our inventory is at a healthy level,” up about 4 percent year over year. That’s primarily attributable to the heightened cost of imported products and the timing of receipts, he said.\n“In this tariff-impacted period, we’re closely monitoring customer demand and managing quantity decisions as we measure the price elasticity of impacted items,” he added.\nTarget’s troubles aren’t constrained to a CEO shakeup driven by dampened consumer demand and boycotts.\nIn an August earnings call, outgoing CEO Brian Cornell said that as one of the nation’s biggest importers, Target was “facing some major financial and operational hurdles as we entered the year.” Existing hardships were compounded by the subsequent (and frequent) changes to tariff and trade policy announced by the Trump administration as the year has gone on, he added.\nAccording to executive vice president and chief financial officer James Lee, the company’s Q2 gross margin rate fell 1 basis point from the same period last year. That change was mostly the result of “about 210 basis points of pressure within merchandising,” or inventory adjustment costs prompted by the slowdown in Q1 sales as well as tariff pressures (including the cost of cancelling purchase orders).\nAdditionally, Lee said Target’s inventory costs more than it did a year ago due to tariffs, among other circumstances. “As such, our Q2 ending inventory units saw a low single-digit decline versus last year,” he said. The national retailer’s adjusted earnings per share rang in at $2.05 in the second quarter, compared to $2.57 one year ago. “It’s notable that the vast majority of this decline was driven by the combined impact of inventory adjustment costs and tariff-related costs,” he added.\nJoanne Crevoiserat, CEO and director of the Coach and Kate Spade parent, said the firm is looking ahead to 2026 and expects “continued growth” after a Q2 that saw remarkably stronger-than-expected revenue of $1.72 billion, outpacing its $1.67 billion estimate—an 8.3 percent year-over-year increase.\n“Our guidance calls for mid-single-digit top-line growth and mid-to-high single-digit earnings growth, inclusive of tariffs. And we’re clear eyed about the environment. We’re incorporating the latest news on tariffs, both in how it could pressure consumers as well as the impact on our business,” she said. Despite the tariffs, Crevoiserat said the firm is continuing to expand its operating margin in 2025, and is positioned to “fully offset” the duty impacts in time.\nGetting into the nuts and bolts, Scott Roe, Tapestry’s chief financial officer and chief operating officer, said he expects inventory levels to come down modestly in 2026. The CFO said the company is “facing greater than previously expected profit headwinds from tariffs and duties with the earlier than expected ending of de minimis exemptions being a meaningful factor.”\n“In aggregate, the total expected impact on profitability this year from tariffs is $160 million, representing approximately two thirty basis points of margin headwind,” he added. The company is mitigating the impacts by “leveraging our agile supply chain to optimize our global manufacturing footprint, minimizing our tariff exposure where possible,” and working with longstanding service providers to drive efficiencies where possible.\nThe Baltimore-based athleticwear brand delivered a disappointing Q1 earnings report in early August, having missed forecasts for both earnings per share and revenue. The company posted EPS of $0.02—short of the $0.03 that was projected—amounting to a 33.3 percent miss. Revenue also fell short of forecasts, ringing in at $1.1 billion compared to the anticipated $1.13 billion. It anticipates revenue decline to continue into 2026, to the tune of 6 percent to 7 percent.\nAccording to CEO Kevin Plank, Under Armour expects to see fiscal challenges linger next year in the North American market due to higher costs from tariffs and softer demand from consumers. “Yet we see this as an inflection point, not a ceiling. Despite the environment, we’re executing a phase plan to rebuild brand loyalty, improve revenue quality and lay the groundwork for sustainable growth,” he said. Much of the brand’s future strategy revolves around premium brand positioning and trying to sell more products at full price.\nPlank addressed the Trump administration’s tariff announcements in late July, which brought “increased pressures” to an already challenging landscape. “Following those updates, we estimate approximately $100 million in additional tariff-related costs along with softer than expected demand in fiscal 2026,” he said. Combined even with mitigation efforts and “disciplined” selling, general and administrative (SG&A) management, “our profitability is projected to be about half of what it was last year,” he explained. “None of this is ideal. We don’t like this.”\nThe specialty retailer’s chief financial officer, Robert Ball, said Abercrombie has seen about $5 million in adverse impact from tariffs during the second quarter, chiefly manifested in the cost of sales, and expects $90 million net impact from tariffs for the year.\nLower gross margin was “partially offset” by about 60 basis points of operating expense leverage, he said. “We ended the second quarter with inventory in a clean current position with inventory at cost up 10 percent and units up 7 percent,” he added.\nSpeaking to the logistics strategy that the company is leveraging to remediate tariff impacts, Ball said, “In anticipation of tariffs, we did selectively clear third quarter receipts early within our bonded warehouses driving around one point of the cost increase. As we alluded to last quarter, we saw a normalization of freight costs and unit mix that drove sequential improvement in year-over-year inventory comparisons.”\nThe company expects that China sourcing will remain in the low single digits for the year, and it has little exposure to the de minimis exemption that’s been terminated, “so it’s not a factor.”\n“Globally, we remain nicely diversified across 16 countries and the team is continuing to evaluate supply chain footprint changes, vendor negotiations and operating expense efficiencies that will largely take shape in fiscal 2026,” he said. Abercrombie doesn’t expect broad price increases in 2025.\nWith tariff rates evolving constantly and trade agreements continuing to be negotiated, the company is avoiding “making any sort of knee jerk reactions,” Ball said. “What we are doing is we’re staying on offense. We’ve got great teams. We’ve got proven playbooks to address disruptions like this, just like we have in the past. But changes particularly in this space are complicated.”\nThe Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein parent company saw a 4 percent increase in revenue on a reported basis, and a 1 percent increase on a constant currency basis, outperforming its guidance for Q2. Between the two brands, Calvin Klein saw a 5 percent revenue increase (and a 3 percent increase in constant currency), while Tommy Hilfiger saw a 4 percent increase in revenue, remaining flat in constant currency.\nChief financial officer Zac Coughlin said the firm is expecting Q3 gross margin to decline approximately 175 basis points from the year-ago period. “The impact of tariffs will be felt much more heavily in the fourth quarter given when new rates take effect in the timing of sell through,” he said. The company expects SG&A as a percentage of revenue to grow by about 75 basis points compared to fiscal 2024.\nHow is the company planning to keep shoppers engaged? “We are investing more into marketing in the third quarter to capitalize on key consumer moments, and to support our brand building cut through campaigns amplified by mega talent,” he said.\nGap Inc. saw better-than-expected results during the second quarter, driven in large part by its namesake brand.\nThe firm saw an overall 1 percent increase in comparable sales for Q2 (driven by positive comps for Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic), and earnings per share hit $0.57, a 6 percent jump from the previous year. It closed the quarter with robust cash balances of around $2.4 billion, showing solid financial standing and a capacity for future investments. The Gap brand itself saw its seventh consecutive quarter of positive comps, leading to a 4 percent increase.\nKatrina O’Connell, executive vice president and chief financial officer, said the company is remaining mindful as trade policy evolves of its financial outlook for the remainder of 2025. “It was exciting to see continued strength at Old Navy and Gap with emerging growth at Banana Republic, all of which helped us navigate the quarter despite choppiness at Athleta where we welcome new leadership,” she said.\nOperating margin fell 10 basis points from the year-ago period to 7.8 percent, while earnings per share for the quarter were $0.57—an increase of 6 percent versus last year’s earnings per share of $0.54. End of quarter inventory levels were up 9 percent year over year, “primarily as a result of accelerated receipts and higher cost due to tariffs,” O’Connell said. “We remain committed to our disciplined inventory management principles, and we believe we ended the quarter with the right inventory composition.”\nDuring Q1, Gap Inc. previewed an estimated net tariff impact for 2025 amounting to about $100 million to $150 million, based on the Trump administration’s stated April tariff rates. “I am proud that the teams have since mitigated the majority of that impact,” O’Connell said. Based on new tariff rates announced in late July, Gap Inc. still expects net sales to grow between 1 percent and 2 percent year-over-year in 2025.\nUrban Outfitters delivered strong performance across all its brands in Q2, with shining stars being Nuuly and Anthropologie.\nDuring its earnings call, the company reported an 11 percent increase in total sales and a 22 percent bump in net income, setting new records for the second quarter. Nuuly, the company’s rental service, saw impressive revenue growth of 53 percent and a 48 percent increase in average active subscribers, while the company’s wholesale segment saw revenue grow by 18 percent, leading to a 15 percent increase in gross profits, reaching $566 million.\nNotably, though, SG&A expenses escalated 13 percent, but Urban was also able to obtain a 20 percent increase in operating income, reaching $174 million. Anthropologie saw retail segment comps increase 6 percent, while Free People saw a 14 percent increase in total revenue. Full-year gross margin is projected to increase by about 100 basis points for fiscal 2026.\nCo-president and chief operating officer Frank Conforti said that despite an “exceptional quarter,” the trade environment has, and will, present challenges.\nThe landscape continues to change as tariff rates have increased for many countries,” he said. “As of today and based on new assumptions, we believe the impact for the second half of the year could be approximately 75 basis points to gross margins.” Urban’s teams are continuing to put together strategies to mitigate impact, “including negotiating better terms with our vendors, diversifying our countries of origin, changing our mode of transportation from air to ocean, and strategically adjusting pricing to minimize the impact on our customers.”\nNonetheless, Conforti said tariffs represent a “temporary challenge” to the business, and he noted that he’s confident in the company’s ability to manage through the maelstrom “and still achieve approximately 100 basis points of gross margin improvement for the full fiscal year 2026.”", "content_hash": "d401308008e94dcd3295d265007ac4f8", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

When they function well, they offer more than just investment oversight, they provide continuity, stability, and governance across generations.\nYet, as families age and wealth move into the hands of younger successors, the challenges of transition can be as much about psychology and relationships as they are about balance sheets.\nFrom Founders to Heirs\nOne of the defining challenges for family offices is the shift in priorities between generations. The vision and objectives of a founder often diverge significantly from those of their children or grandchildren. This shift can reshape the entire focus of a family office.\n“The next generation’s objectives and purpose can vary hugely from the previous one,” says Daniel Aghdami, partner at Heidrick & Struggles. “This can lead to a different focus of investments, often a reduction of risk appetite, reduction of investment asset classes, and a move from active to passive investing.”\nThe consequences ripple beyond portfolio allocation. A sudden shift in risk appetite or investment approach can create new staffing requirements. Family offices may find themselves seeking new skills - for example, in sustainable investing or digital assets to meet the next generation’s preferences. In some cases, staff turnover is inevitable as roles evolve.\nNavigating Succession Dynamics\nSuccession is often seen as the transfer of wealth, but in reality, it is the transfer of influence, responsibility, and identity. This is where the role of the family office stretches far beyond finance.\n“Often, the question of suitable governance arises as older family members retire from the boards of the family’s foundations, operating companies, and the family council,” explains Aghdami. “The family office can play a vital role in ensuring continuity and success in the transition, in collaboration with external experts, with its established trust and knowledge of the family dynamics.”\nImportantly, preparing the next generation requires foresight. Training, mentoring, and gradual exposure to responsibilities can make the difference between a smooth succession and a disruptive one.\n“The family office can also play an important role in preparing the next generation well in advance,” Aghdami says. “That might mean assessing and upskilling younger family members to take on increasing responsibilities within the family entities.”\nBut succession is not just about the young. “One of the biggest challenges is preparing the older generation for the transfer of wealth and power,” he adds. “Many first-generation principals can find the process of relinquishing oversight and responsibility difficult, as well as deciding who will take responsibility for what.”\nThis dual challenge - empowering the young while easing the transition for the older - sits at the heart of family continuity.\nModels of the Modern Family Office\nNot all family offices are created equal. Their structure often depends on scale, investment complexity, and the preferences of the family.\nSmaller family offices typically adopt a simpler approach. “They tend to have a more straightforward investment focus, often relying on asset allocation and external fund managers,” Aghdami notes. “Some will have a highly specialised focus on one or two asset classes, while others prioritise tax efficiency and concierge services over outright investments.”\nLarger, institutional-style family offices, by contrast, resemble professional asset managers. Their processes, governance, and teams are often sophisticated, with less day-to-day involvement from principals.\nThe question of whether to establish a single-family office, a multi-family office, or a hybrid model is equally nuanced. “This largely depends on the family’s wealth, how much of that is investable, and the complexity of investments and non-financial needs,” Aghdami explains.\nAs a rule of thumb, families with net worths above €400m ($465m) may consider establishing their own dedicated family office. Hybrid models, however, can offer flexibility. “A hybrid model can make sense if they want to keep the size of their own single-family office small but rely on the greater resources of a multi-family office for access to and structuring of certain deals.”\nIn some cases, success itself changes the equation. Aghdami highlights how families sometimes transform their family office into a commercial business in its own right. “B-Flexion is a great example of this, having opened several of its subsidiary asset managers to external investors.”\nGovernance for Generational Harmony\nIf investment management is the technical heart of a family office, governance is the cultural soul. Clear rules and processes are essential in preventing disputes and ensuring cohesion across generations.\nGovernance models vary widely, but their importance is universal. “Family constitutions and councils are still very relevant,” says Aghdami. “In many cases, they’re being adapted to accommodate advances in governance requirements and evolving best practices.”\nIn complex, multi-generational families, some opt for highly independent governance structures. “The boards of the legal entities within the family-owned group can be made up entirely of independent board members representing the interests of all shareholders,” Aghdami explains. “The family council may only be consulted for very big decisions.”\nThis professionalisation ensures that the family’s wealth and businesses are managed effectively, while still maintaining a framework for family voices to be heard.\nStriking the Right Balance\nAt the core of governance is a delicate balance: how much influence should the family retain compared to external professionals?\nFor smaller families, the involvement of principals remains high. For larger families with complex investments and global operations, reliance on independent professionals tends to grow. What matters is designing governance structures that respect the family’s values while ensuring sound business practices.\nBuilding For Tomorrow\nAs demographics shift and generational transitions accelerate, family offices face an era of change. Whether in investment philosophy, governance, or succession planning, the ability to adapt is key.\nWhat remains constant is the need for stability. A family office that succeeds in balancing financial stewardship with family harmony becomes not just a manager of wealth, but a guardian of legacy.\nAnd in that sense, its value goes far beyond money.\n\"Family offices at crossroads\" was originally created and published by Private Banker International, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

But its newly appointed CEO, Antonio Filosa, won over at least one fan in dealership owner David Kelleher when he bluntly admitted the automaker had been wrong to kill the Jeep Cherokee in 2023.\n\"I'm sure it wasn't his decision, [but] he took credit for it,\" Kelleher said in an Automotive News article recently. \"At that moment, I'm like, 'This is the right guy.'\"\nAdmitting a mistake is often a difficult first step, and Filosa's humble ability to admit fault by the automaker will serve him well as he tries to give Stellantis direction and, yes, brings back the Jeep Cherokee.\nWelcome back!\nFilosa has a full plate trying to address spiraling sales along with the company's soured relationships with dealers, suppliers, and unions -- all of which deteriorated under former CEO Carlos Tavares.\nFilosa also needs to right-size many of the automaker's 15 brands, as well as its joint venture with Chinese electric vehicle maker Leapmotor. Meanwhile, Stellantis is seen as the most vulnerable of the Detroit automakers to tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts.\nOne big step toward fixing its stumbling brands would be to bring back the Cherokee and revitalize the Jeep brand, which is arguably the heart and soul of Stellantis.\nThe Jeep Cherokee is returning this fall as a hybrid with a starting price of just under $37,000. The upcoming Cherokee will drive longer, taller, and wider, and Stellantis hopes the vehicle will be a big volume player in the midsize SUV segment. Sales of the model peaked at nearly 240,000 units in 2018.\nJeep makeover\n\"A few years ago, we left the largest segment in North America, a highly competitive segment where customers demand the best from their midsize\" utility vehicles, Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf said at an Aug. 7 media briefing, according to Automotive News. \"We used that time to make sure we got the all-new Jeep Cherokee right, and that it delivers on everything we know our core customers and new customers are asking for: that means more standard equipment, more cargo space, more fuel economy and efficiency.\"\nThe Cherokee will be a crucial part of Jeep's ongoing makeover.

And chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT are at the forefront of the innovation, making it easy for companies to do more with less and automate repetitive tasks with ease.\nThe problem, however, is that expectations can become overblown, potentially setting investors up for disappointment. With generative AI in its early innings, there's still a lot to be proven. Will it lead to job losses and radically change day-to-day operations, as many people are both anticipating and fearing? That's still up for debate.\nEven OpenAI CEO Sam Altman thinks that expectations may be getting too high. He has warned investors in the past about getting their hopes up, and he recently reiterated his concerns.\nIs an AI bubble already here?\nWorries of an AI bubble aren't new, as valuations haven't been skyrocketing for many stocks. And even Altman believes the market may indeed be in one. While he does believe AI will be transformative and incredibly important for innovation, he does worry that expectations are getting a bit too ambitious.\n\"Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI?,\" he said. \"My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.\"\nA few years ago, when OpenAI was in the midst of developing GPT-4, Altman said that \"people are begging to be disappointed.\" And while the chatbot has been improved since then, it may not be up to the level that many people were expecting by now. But that hasn't stopped valuations from becoming incredibly inflated.\nMany AI stocks are trading at excessive valuations\nFinding overvalued AI stocks isn't hard right now. Perhaps the best example is Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR). While the data analytics company has benefited from enhancing its platform to use AI, its valuation has gotten excessive. At a market cap of around $370 billion, it's now one of the most valuable companies in the world, worth more than blue chip stocks such as Coca-Cola, Wells Fargo, and T-Mobile US.\nWhile Palantir's business has been growing at a fast rate of around 50% year over year, it still has generated a fairly modest $3.4 billion in revenue over the trailing 12 months, putting it at a price-to-sales multiple of around 110. And its price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 520 is gargantuan.\nPalantir is perhaps the most recognizable example of a company whose valuation has taken off to obscene levels due to AI, but there are other cases as well.\nMicrosoft, for instance, is trading close to 40 times its trailing earnings, which is a higher-than-typical valuation for the tech stock. But with its Copilot assistant and AI-powered personal computers, expectations are also elevated that Microsoft's growth may soar due to AI in the future. In its most recent quarter, it grew at a rate of 18%, which is solid but arguably not worth such a high P/E multiple, suggesting that expectations are sky high for Microsoft as well.\nInvestors should tread carefully with AI stocks\nAI has the potential to truly change businesses in meaningful ways, and many tech companies are ramping up spending and investments in anticipation of that. But that doesn't mean that the payoff will line up with investor expectations. And if that doesn't happen, it can make a stock vulnerable to a sizable sell-off in the future.\nWhether it's Palantir, Microsoft, or another AI stock, it's always important to consider a stock's valuation when buying it. Even if the business may be performing well, that doesn't mean it's a good investment at any price. Valuation matters, which is why when it comes to AI, investors should consider Altman's warnings carefully.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

A higher percentage of people buying and holding stocks make more money in the long run than option traders do.”\nMore News from Barchart\nThat might surprise some traders, but it’s true that options introduce an element of risk that most stock positions don’t carry – specifically, an expiration date. While most traditional buy-and-hold investors can simply ride out periods of choppy or unfavorable price action by practicing patience, options trades typically don’t offer that luxury of time.\nSo, does that mean you should avoid options entirely? Let’s break it down.\nShares vs. Options: Pros and Cons\nWhy Shares Can Feel Safer\n-\nLong-term bias: Stocks historically trend higher over time, especially if you buy fundamentally strong companies.\n-\nSimplicity: You own part of a business; profits and losses are easier to understand.\n-\nFlexibility: You can hold indefinitely, collect dividends, or use shares as collateral.\nHow Options Introduce Complexity\n-\nPricing model: Volatility, interest rates, and time premiums make option pricing less intuitive, and can contribute to overpaying at entry.\n-\nTime decay: As a buyer, your option will lose value at an increasing rate until it expires. That means the underlying stock can do nothing and your option will still lose value.\n-\nExpiration date: Unlike a traditional stock position, your option will expire, which adds the difficulty of timing to your strategy.\nBut here’s the catch: Options can be powerful when used strategically — like generating income with covered calls, hedging stock positions with puts, or defining risk with spreads.\nThe problem is that many traders treat options like lottery tickets, misunderstand the risks, overtrade, or use the wrong strategies.\nTakeaway for Traders\nJim’s preference for shares over options is rooted in probability and preference, but options still have a place in a well-rounded toolkit — if you understand the mechanics, strategies, and risks.\nThat’s where education matters.", "content_hash": "a968c69e6d7de81ea481c794d91310f0", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

But 2025 has not been a straight climb for BABA stock. After peaking in mid-March, shares stalled, weighed down by trade tensions, U.S. restrictions on artificial intelligence (AI) chip exports, and lingering questions about China’s economy.\nThen came Q1 — and a sharp turn. Alibaba stock soared 13% after blowout cloud results and growing excitement around the firm's new custom AI chip, designed to bypass Nvidia (NVDA) curbs and power a wave of innovation. Add to that Alibaba's aggressive bets on China’s cutthroat “instant commerce” market, and investors are finally warming up again.\nWith cloud growth accelerating and AI ambitions expanding, BABA stock is now trading at its highest levels since March. But with September here, is the stock your next big buy? Or is it time to cash out?\nAbout Alibaba Stock\nAlibaba has transformed into a tech titan, reshaping China’s digital landscape, now valued at a market capitalization of $330 billion. Founded by Jack Ma in 1999, the company now dominates e-commerce through Taobao, Tmall, and Alibaba.com while expanding into cloud computing, AI, fintech via Ant Group, and logistics through Cainiao.\nAlibaba's bets on AI infrastructure and “instant commerce” are redefining its edge, placing it firmly among global tech heavyweights. After years of regulatory turbulence, the company’s resurgence is drawing fresh investor attention worldwide.\nThat resurgence is playing out in BABA stock's price action. Starting 2025 in the $80 range in January, the stock rocketed to a 52-week peak of $148.43 by March before sliding to $95.73 in April.\nBut momentum is back. Up 61% year-to-date (YTD) and returning 66% over the past 52 weeks, BABA stock closed at $135 after a 13% jump on Aug. 29, fueled by blowout first-quarter cloud results and excitement over its custom AI chip. Trading volume spiked to 82.17 million while the 14-day RSI climbed to 67.93, flashing bullish momentum. Investors are betting on Alibaba’s AI-powered growth story — and September could be the real test.\nAlibaba is priced at just 17.2 times forward earnings, trading below the industry median. With analysts projecting double-digit profit growth next fiscal year, this discount looks less like weakness and more like a rare entry point before the market wakes up to BABA’s upside.\nAlibaba Jumps Despite Mixed Q1 Report\nOn Aug. 29, Alibaba dropped its Q1 earnings, and the market reaction was anything but boring. Shares of the Chinese tech giant gapped higher, even though the results were a mixed bag.\nFor the quarter, adjusted earnings fell 10% year-over-year (YOY) to RMB 14.75 per American depositary share (ADS), missing forecasts. Revenue climbed a modest 2% to RMB 247.65 billion ($34.6 billion) — also shy of estimates. On the surface, it looked underwhelming. But things get interesting: net income skyrocketed 78%, thanks to gains from equity investments and the disposal of its stake in Turkish e-commerce firm Trendyol. Investors love profits, even when they come from clever maneuvers.\nThe real star of the quarter was Cloud Intelligence. Revenue there surged 26% YOY to RMB 33.4 billion ($4.7 billion), beating expectations and accelerating from the previous quarter’s growth. Alibaba credited AI adoption for the boost, signaling that it wants to be China’s Microsoft (MSFT) or Alphabet (GOOGL) in the AI race.\nThe company reported triple-digit growth in AI-related products for the eighth-straight quarter and pledged to spend $50 billion over the next three years on AI infrastructure. CEO Eddie Wu called AI a “significant” driver for cloud revenue going forward.\nE-commerce, accounting for over 50% of Alibaba’s revenue, delivered mixed results. China's e-commerce revenue rose 10% to RMB 140.1 billion ($19.5 billion), while the international unit jumped 19%, driven by AliExpress and other platforms.\nHowever, adjusted earnings in the core commerce division fell 21%, due to heavy investments in instant commerce — Alibaba’s bold bet on delivering products within an hour via Taobao. Competition here is brutal, with Meituan (MPNGY) and JD.com (JD) in the ring, but Alibaba’s management sees this as a trillion-yuan gross merchandise value (GMV) opportunity in three years.\nAlibaba is not just betting on cloud growth — it is building its own AI chip to sidestep U.S. restrictions on Nvidia’s high-end processors. With Washington tightening export curbs and Beijing quietly urging companies not to buy even Nvidia’s older models, Alibaba’s move feels like both defense and offense.\nThe chip, still in testing, is designed for a wide range of AI tasks, from training large models to powering retail operations. It ties directly into Alibaba’s Qwen AI models and its larger push to weave AI across e-commerce and cloud. For China’s largest cloud provider, developing homegrown chips could ease geopolitical headwinds, reduce dependency on foreign tech, and sharpen its competitive edge in the AI arms race.\nAnalysts tracking Alibaba expect its earnings path to look like a dip before a rebound. Fiscal 2026 profits are projected to dip 5% YOY to $7.83 per share, then climb by 25% to $9.81 per share in fiscal 2027.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for Alibaba Stock?\nWall Street is turning bullish on Alibaba after Q1, with analysts hiking price targets on confidence in its cloud growth and expanding AI ambitions. CFRA kept a “Buy” rating, with analyst Angelo Zino stating that Alibaba’s investments in quick commerce and AI are reshaping its operations and positioning it for long-term gains.\nMeanwhile, BofA Securities also lifted its price target to $152 from $135, citing triple-digit AI revenue growth for eight consecutive quarters and rising cloud investments. With management committing RMB 380 billion in AI and cloud infrastructure over three years, analysts see Alibaba carving out a powerful role in the GenAI race while strengthening its global commerce play.\nGoldman Sachs analyst Ronald Keung bumped his target to $163 and maintained a “Buy” rating, noting bigger near-term losses in September but expecting them to shrink by year-end as Alibaba focuses on higher-quality users, trims subsidies, and sharpens delivery efficiency. Keung sees the company evolving into an “AI + everyday consumption app” and an “AI + Cloud hyperscaler.”\nJPMorgan analyst Alex Yao went even further, hiking his target to $170 from $140 and keeping an “Overweight” rating, arguing Alibaba’s food delivery and instant commerce arms are now operating at scale. Meanwhile, Bernstein analyst Robin Zhu lifted his target to $160 and kept an “Outperform” rating, impressed by Alibaba’s user figures. Zhu expects food delivery losses to be halved by October, calling Q2 the spending peak before momentum shifts profitably.\nOverall, analysts are upbeat, with BABA stock currently having a “Strong Buy\" rating overall. Of the 22 analysts covering the stock, 19 suggest a “Strong Buy,” one advises a “Moderate Buy,” one recommends a “Hold,” and one has a “Strong Sell.”\nThe mean price target of $162.28 suggests the stock could surge by 19% from current price levels. The Street-high target of $195 represents potential upside of 43%.\nOn the date of publication, Sristi Suman Jayaswal did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Unlike many of her peers in the wealth management space, her Ark Invest portfolio isn't heavily allocated toward blue chip stocks that churn out steady, predictable cash flows. Instead, Wood gravitates toward more exciting opportunities -- companies that carry higher risk but also the potential for multibagger returns.\nIn the financial services sector, this philosophy is on full display. While more prudent investors lean toward stalwarts like Visa, Mastercard, or Bank of America for exposure, Wood's strategy takes a different path.\nWood has taken a keen interest in SoFi Technologies(NASDAQ: SOFI), a fast-growing neobank reshaping how consumers interact with their money. SoFi stock has already surged by 68% so far this year, handily outpacing the returns seen across the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite by a wide margin.\nEven after a blockbuster run, SoFi stock could still carry monster potential. Let's unpack what could send shares of SoFi even higher, and perhaps sooner than many investors may expect.\nKeep your eyes on the Federal Reserve\nLast year, the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates three times. Since then, rates have held steady -- though Chairman Jerome Powell recently hinted another interest rate reduction could come as soon as next month.\nAt first glance, lower interest rates might seem like a headwind for SoFi since compressed net-interest margins can pressure its lending operation. But that's only half the narrative.\nAs the charts above show, SoFi's revenue growth and profitability have remained resilient even during prior reductions to the federal funds rate.\nLower borrowing costs can unlock pent-up demand for refinancing student loans and mortgages -- areas where SoFi enjoys activity. The company's ability to merge consumer engagement, technology-driven infrastructure, and a full suite of financial services under one roof positions SoFi to capitalize on these tailwinds.\nA contrarian view might suggest that falling interest rates could reinvigorate SoFi's lending segment and, more importantly, expand cross-selling opportunities across its ecosystem.\nSoFi is returning to crypto\nAccording to a recent survey from Motley Fool Money, younger investors are significantly more likely to invest in cryptocurrency compared to Gen X and baby boomers. SoFi's core user base skews younger, with strong adoption among millennials and Gen Z -- the very demographics driving interest in crypto investing and fintech innovation.\nWith crypto investing now returning to SoFi, the company has a clearer path to compete with other tech-driven financial apps like Robinhood Markets. This move could also attract new users who prefer trading crypto directly though an integrated platform rather than relying on stand-alone exchanges such as Coinbase Global.\nIs SoFi stock a buy right now?\nPerhaps the strongest bear case against SoFi centers on valuation. By traditional banking benchmarks, the stock is undeniably expensive. As the charts illustrate, SoFi trades at multiples that suggest a technology premium rather than a standard financial sector profile.\nI think SoFi's valuation should be considered through the lens of growth and optionality. SoFi is more than just a digital bank -- it's an integrated financial ecosystem that spans lending, investing, insurance, and more. Each new product not only broadens the company's total addressable market (TAM), but also deepens customer engagement -- driving higher lifetime value. This flywheel effect is something that legacy incumbent banks struggle to replicate.\nInvestors tend to pay a premium for companies that are profitable, growing, and actively expanding into new markets -- three qualities that position a business for long-term success. SoFi checks each of these boxes. Its premium valuation isn't a reflection of hype -- it's a reflection of the company's position as a multi-product platform still in the early innings of growth.\nFor long-term investors, SoFi represents a compelling opportunity to buy and hold as the company doesn't just survive in a crowded financial landscape, but steadily continues to build a differentiated platform designed to scale for years to come.\nShould you buy stock in SoFi Technologies right now?\nBefore you buy stock in SoFi Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoFi Technologies wasn’t one of them.

Other key metrics show no sign of growth on the horizon. Endava's headcount fell by 5% from a year ago. Headcount is a useful measure with consulting firms because they adjust hiring based on anticipated future workload.\nEndava is also struggling to diversify its client base. The number of clients generating at least 1 million British pounds in revenue fell to 133 at June 30 from 146 a year ago. And the company's top 10 clients accounted for 37% of revenue in the recently completed quarter, up from 34% in the same period last year.\nAbout 38% of revenue was generated in North America, similar to the revenue mix a year ago.\nImmediate Market Reaction\nInvestors were disappointed with the quarter as well as with the guidance for what is to come. Endava stock, already down 52% year to date, was down another 22% in premarket trading ahead of the market opening in New York.\nWhat to Watch\nThe bull case from Endava today is that the company is simply caught up in a difficult macro environment. Tariffs, inflation, and questions about the economy have put big corporate IT projects on hold, limiting new business opportunities for now.\nThe bear case is that AI has permanently disrupted the IT consulting industry.\nEndava's guidance for its new fiscal year doesn't give bulls much to get excited about. The company sees first-quarter earnings of between 0.17 and 0.19 British pounds per share, well short of the 0.27 British pounds consensus estimate. For the year, management is forecasting earnings of 0.82 to 0.94 British pounds per share compared to a consensus estimate of 1.12 British pounds.", "content_hash": "023371bae911e46e3834e4ac5ae01370", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

However, that steep decline doesn't seem justified considering the rapid pace at which the company's revenue and earnings have been increasing.\nThe stock took another hit following the release of its fiscal 2026 second-quarter results (for the three months ended Aug. 2) on Aug. 28. Marvell crashed nearly 19% following its latest quarterly report. Let's see why that was the case.\nInvestors were spooked by Marvell's guidance\nMarvell is known for manufacturing application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). These are programmable chips that can be customized to perform specific tasks, unlike graphics processing units (GPUs), which are general-purpose computing chips. The specific nature of ASICs allows them to carry out the tasks they are designed for with high efficiency and speed.\nAs such, these chips are being used in artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, helping Marvell achieve excellent growth from this segment. The company reported a year-over-year increase of 58% in its revenue last quarter to just over $2 billion. And its adjusted earnings more than doubled year over year to $0.67 per share.\nThe data center business played a central role in driving such outstanding growth, accounting for almost three-fourths of Marvell's revenue last quarter. What's more, the company saw strong increases in its other businesses -- enterprise networking, carrier infrastructure, and its consumer segment -- as well. These segments were not in good shape a year ago, so their return to growth is good news for investors.\nHowever, the market was focused on the company's data center forecast, since this segment is the biggest factor driving Marvell's growth. And that explains why the stock plunged big time after management said that its data center revenue will remain flat in the current quarter as compared to the second quarter.\nAlso, the revenue estimate of $2.06 billion for the ongoing quarter was slightly short of Wall Street's expectations. However, investors seem to be missing the bigger picture.\nThe company's outstanding growth could be here to stay\nManagement said on the earnings conference call that it expects its custom AI processor business to grow in a nonlinear manner, depending on the rollout of AI infrastructure by its clients. The company has been supplying its custom AI chips to the leading cloud computing companies, and it is forecasting an improvement in its customer base.", "content_hash": "246f08f3109e523dbc0ce75244a8eb3a", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The company has announced another round of layoffs, impacting less than 1% of corporate staff, building on last February’s 2% reduction, or more than 1,500 positions.\nSince assuming leadership of the world’s largest sportswear brand, Hill has focused on reversing declining sales, reigniting innovation, and strengthening relationships with wholesale partners. In its fiscal Q4 earnings announcement in June, Nike indicated that sales and profit declines are expected to moderate in upcoming quarters, signaling that the most challenging period may be behind the company. Analysts were advised to anticipate early benefits from the turnaround, as the realignment begins to take tangible shape.\nWith its teams reorganized and its focus sharpened, Nike is laying the groundwork to emerge stronger, reconnect with its audience, and reclaim its stride in the global sportswear arena.\nAbout Nike Stock\nHeadquartered in Beaverton, Oregon, Nike is a global leader in athletic and casual footwear, apparel, and equipment. Its portfolio includes renowned brands such as Nike, Jordan Brand, and Converse, while its operations span worldwide retail, wholesale, and direct-to-consumer channels.\nThe company is valued at a market capitalization of approximately $110 billion, reflecting its entrenched position in the industry. Beyond products, Nike provides performance equipment, digital experiences, and consumer engagement platforms that reinforce brand loyalty and global recognition.\nOver the past 52 weeks, NKE stock has seen a decline of 8%. Year-to-date (YTD), the stock has dropped 1.2%. However, in the last three months, shares have surged 20%, highlighting renewed investor confidence.\nNKE trades at 2.47 times sales, a multiple above the industry average though slightly below its five-year historical range, suggesting a relative discount amid strong underlying fundamentals.\nDividends remain consistent, with 23 consecutive years of growth. Nike pays an annual dividend of $1.60, equating to a yield of 2.07%. Its most recent dividend of $0.40 is scheduled for Oct. 1, payable to shareholders of record on Sept. 2.\nNike Surpasses Q4 Earnings\nNike reported its fiscal Q4 results on June 26, and while revenue and net income declined, the company surpassed analysts’ expectations. Revenue fell 12% year-over-year (YOY) to $11.1 billion but came in above the Street’s forecast of $10.72 billion.\nNike Direct declined 14%, driven by a 26% drop in Nike Digital, while Nike Stores grew 2%. Wholesale revenue fell 9%, reflecting ongoing adjustments in channel strategy and inventory management. Gross margin contracted by 440 basis points to 40.3%, primarily due to higher wholesale and factory store discounts, supply-chain cost pressures, and channel mix headwinds.\nNet income dropped 85.9% to $211 million, and EPS mirrored this decline, falling to $0.14 from $0.99 in the prior year. Despite these steep reductions, results exceeded the Street’s expectation of $0.12, prompting a market reaction that lifted NKE stock 15.2% in trading on June 27.\nCash and short-term investments totaled $9.2 billion, down $2.4 billion from last year, reflecting the combined impact of share repurchases, dividends, bond repayments, and capital expenditures outweighing cash generated from operations.\nInventory remains elevated, yet the company is actively managing excess stock through value stores and select partners. Nike anticipates modest headwinds in the next two quarters as it laps prior-year clearance activity, and digital traffic is expected to remain down while the company repositions Nike Digital toward a full-price model and reduces classic footwear franchises.\nAnalysts expect Nike’s Q1 2026 EPS to fall 61% YOY to $0.27, with full-year 2026 EPS expected to decline 22% to $1.69. Fiscal 2027 is anticipated to see a strong rebound, however, with EPS rising 53% to $2.59, reflecting optimism in the company’s strategic realignment and long-term growth prospects.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for Nike Stock?\nAnalysts maintain a positive outlook for NKE stock as the firm's realignment progresses. HSBC upgraded NKE from “Hold” to “Buy,” raising the price target to $80 from $60, citing tangible evidence of a near-term sales recovery despite potential tariff impacts on fiscal 2026 gross margins.\nBernstein increased its target to $90 from $85 while maintaining an “Outperform” rating, reflecting confidence in Nike’s strategic execution. Likewise, Williams Trading raised its target to $100 from $73 with a “Buy” rating, while Jefferies analyst Randal Konik reaffirmed his “Buy” rating with a $115 target.\nNKE stock maintains a consensus rating of “Moderate Buy” among 36 analysts covering the stock. Of these analysts, 14 recommend a “Strong Buy,” three have a “Moderate Buy,” 17 advise a “Hold,” and two advise a “Strong Sell\" rating.\nNKE stock’s average price target of $78.59 represents potential upside of 5% from here. The Street-high target of $120 reflects a 61% potential gain from current levels.\nOn the date of publication, Aanchal Sugandh did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

It allows consumers to divide their purchases into manageable installments at checkout, whether online or in-store. Focused on transparency and user empowerment, Affirm avoids hidden fees and traditional credit pitfalls.\nThe company partners with merchants to generate revenue and utilizes advanced technology to assess borrower eligibility instantly. In addition to flexible payment solutions, Affirm offers services such as Adaptive Checkout and high-yield savings accounts, aiming to simplify financial decisions and promote responsible spending for both shoppers and businesses. The company has a market capitalization of $26.5 billion currently.\nAFRM stock is holding up well of late. Over the past 52 weeks, the stock has gained 105%, and shares are up by 40% year-to-date (YTD). After the company reported its Q4 results on Aug. 28, AFRM stock gained 10.6% in the following session. Shares also reached a 52-week high of $100 on Aug. 29, although they are now down 15% from this high.\nAffirm’s Q4 Results Topped Estimates\nOn Aug. 28, Affirm announced solid Q4 results for fiscal 2025. Revenue for the period increased 33% year-over-year (YOY) to $876.42 million. This figure exceeded the $839.9 million that Wall Street analysts were expecting.\nAt the heart of this growth was Affirm’s network revenue, which grew by 37% from the prior-year period to $306.57 million. Interest income stood at $419.09 million, up 24% YOY. The company also reported EPS of $0.20, a significant turnaround from the $0.14 loss per share in the year-ago period. Wall Street analysts were expecting EPS of $0.11 for the quarter.\nAffirm also recently expanded its partnership with Stripe, becoming the first buy-now-pay-later provider to be directly incorporated into the Stripe Terminal. This essentially means that shoppers physically accessing Stripe’s point-of-sale (POS) devices can now select the company’s services at checkout. This is important for Affirm because it likely implies that its transaction volume will increase, as well as its merchant adoption, without facing the burden of high integration costs.", "content_hash": "c4fc4b066172a8da9c71a84c5c395396", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The stock market's most-followed index finished the period up 1.91%, marking its fourth consecutive month of positive returns and fifth overall positive month of 2025. Unfortunately, it wasn't a good month for all stocks in the index.\nThree stocks in particular had a really bad month: The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD), Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), and Gartner (NYSE: IT). These stocks lost between 25% to 37% of their value in the month.\nThe reason for the disappointing month varies. The Trade Desk's revenue growth has slowed (up 19% year over year to $694 million), and its new chief financial officer took over on Aug. 21 after its previous one stepped down after almost 12 years with the company. There are also concerns that stricter privacy rules will hurt the company's ability to use targeted advertising, its main business proposition.\nSuper Micro Computer's fiscal fourth-quarter results weren't very encouraging, with the company missing both revenue and adjusted earnings per share estimates. It also cut its fiscal 2026 guidance from $40 billion to $33 billion, which discouraged investors, as the company was already trading at a premium.\nGartner met analysts' estimates for the second quarter, but its total contract value (a key part of its business) increased by a light 4.9% year over year.

Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +1.53%.\nInterest Rates\nDecember 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) today are up +5 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield is down -2.9 bp to 4.188%.\nDec T-notes climbed to a 4.75-month high today, and the 10-year T-note yields fell to a 4-week low of 4.168%. Signs of a slowdown in the US labor market are bullish for T-notes after today’s weaker-than-expected ADP employment report and the rise in weekly initial unemployment claims to a 10-week high. The labor market weakness has boosted the chances of a Fed rate cut at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting to 99%, according to the swaps market. Also, today’s upward revision to Q2 nonfarm productivity and downward revision to Q2 unit labor cost are supportive for T-note prices. In addition, T-notes garnered support from today’s 1% fall in WTI crude prices to a 2-week low, which reduced inflation expectations as the 10-year breakeven inflation rate fell to a 1.5-week low of 2.395%.\nEuropean government bond yields today are moving lower. The 10-year German bund yield is down -2.5 bp to 2.716%. 10-year UK gilt yield is down -2.8 bp to 4.720%.\nEurozone July retail sales fell -0.5% m/m, weaker than expectations of -0.3% m/m and the biggest decline in 13 months.\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 2% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\nUS Stock Movers\nHomebuilders are climbing today after the 10-year T-note yield fell to a 4-month low, a bullish factor for housing demand.

The company's shares are down 2% year-to-date, while the S&P 500 is up 9%. But none of that means the biotech company is no longer attractive.\nIn fact, Vertex's challenges this year might have created a solid entry point for a company that can be an excellent growth stock in the next five years and perhaps beyond. Here's why investors shouldn't give up on this biotech stock just yet.\nIt has done it before\nIn 2012, Vertex Pharmaceuticals made a breakthrough when it earned approval for Kalydeco, the first medicine that treated the underlying causes of cystic fibrosis (CF). In the 13 years since, the biotech has launched many other, and even better, treatments for the disease. The latest is Alyftrek, which earned the green light in December. Other pharmaceutical companies have tried to challenge Vertex, but none have been successful.\nAs the only company in this niche, Vertex has strong pricing power. It's also worth pointing out that many CF patients must take daily medication for their entire lives. The company's drugs treat the underlying causes of the disease but don't cure it. Vertex has been riding the wave of its CF breakthroughs over the past decade. Revenue and earnings have generally grown rapidly, although the bottom line was in the red last year due to expenses related to an acquisition.\nEven with that, the general trend is clear. And the best news is that Vertex Pharmaceuticals still has room to grow in its core area of cystic fibrosis. Patients are now living longer, partly thanks to the company's medicines. Thousands more eligible people with CF have yet to start treatment. And Vertex is working on newer medicines for the few who don't qualify for any of its current therapies.\nGiven the company's track record, there is a good chance it will crack the code once again. Vertex's CF franchise alone should help power solid growth through the end of the decade at the very least.\nNew products will kick in\nVertex Pharmaceuticals has earned approval for two non-CF products in the past few years. The first is Casgevy, a medicine it developed with CRISPR Therapeutics. Casgevy is a one-time, gene-editing cure for beta-thalassemia (TDT) and sickle cell disease (SCD), two rare blood-related conditions. The second is Journavx, a non-opioid pain inhibitor (the first of its kind) approved for the acute treatment of pain.\nThese products are not yet making a significant impact on Vertex's financial results. Journavx was only approved in January, so that's not surprising. But the medicine fills a need. Opioid-based therapies come with severe side effects and the very real potential of addiction and abuse. Vertex sees a market of at least 80 million patients who could benefit from the medicine, and the company has already secured third-party coverage for large populations in the U.S.\nOnce sales of this medicine start ramping up, it should improve Vertex Pharmaceuticals' already solid results. Casgevy, approved in 2023, is a complex therapy to manufacture and administer, which is why it has yet to make a meaningful contribution to Vertex's top line. But with 60,000 patients, a price of $2.2 million in the U.S., and very little competition, it could eventually become a blockbuster drug, further improving Vertex's financial results.\nThe pipeline is in good shape\nMany of Vertex's issues over the past year have been due to pipeline setbacks. Some of the company's clinical trials, such as VX-993 for acute pain and Journavx for lumbosacral radiculopathy (LSR), were unsuccessful. The biotech also had to give up the development of a medicine for type 1 diabetes (T1D). Even with all those challenges, Vertex's pipeline remains pretty strong.\nVX-993 was abandoned as a potential monotherapy for acute pain, but it is being tested in diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Vertex will no longer pursue an indication for Journavx in LSR, but is also testing the medicine in a phase 3 study for DPN. Furthermore, the biotech plans to submit regulatory applications for zimislecel, a therapy for T1D, next year.\nVertex Pharmaceuticals has several more late-stage pipeline candidates and others in earlier stages of development. The company should add at least one product to its lineup relatively soon. Solid clinical progress could propel Vertex's shares in the next few years, while the company continues to record consistently growing revenue and earnings.\nThe company can still be a growth powerhouse despite the challenges it has faced lately. That's why the stock looks like a buy, especially at current levels.\nShould you buy stock in Vertex Pharmaceuticals right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Vertex Pharmaceuticals, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vertex Pharmaceuticals wasn’t one of them.

It reported a loss instead.\n-\nAmerica's Car-Mart has reported negative free cash flow for five straight years.\nAmerica's Car-Mart (NASDAQ: CRMT) stock got itself in a one-car pile-up this morning, falling 21.6% through 10:05 a.m. ET after reporting a big fiscal first-quarter 2026 loss -- where Wall Street had expected a profit.\nAnalyst forecasts had the used-car dealer earning $0.83 per share on $359.2 million in Q1, which ended July 31, but the company had to admit it lost $0.69 per share instead. Revenue also came up short at $341.3 million.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nAmerica's Car-Mart Q1 \"earnings\"\nNot all the news was horrible. Sales by units moved declined 5.7%, but revenue declined only 1.9% -- so pricing was strong on the cars America's Car-Mart did manage to sell in the quarter. Indeed, the average price per car sold grew 1.4% year over year. Gross profit margin also expanded 160 basis points to 36.6%, and allowances for future credit losses (i.e., bad loans) as a percentage of sales declined modestly.\nIs America's Car-Mart stock a sell?\nSo why did America's Car-Mart end up losing money? Reviewing the income statement, it appears higher selling, general, and administrative expenses exacerbated the shortfall in sales, and provisions for credit losses in the quarter rose as well. On the bottom line, losses per share more than quadrupled year over year, which explains why investors were upset. (Well, that, plus the fact that Wall Street had promised them a profit this quarter, and Car-Mart failed to deliver).\nUltimately, what we're looking at here is a used-car dealer that, while nominally \"profitable,\" has burned cash for five years straight and now looks likely to burn cash again for a sixth year.

The coordination signals intent to narrow jurisdictional gaps that have complicated market structure questions for years.\nFor crypto market infrastructure, the SEC’s policy track has already affected exchange-traded products. On July 29, the Commission permitted in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto ETP shares, aligning bitcoin and ether products with the mechanics used by other commodity-based ETPs and removing a source of friction for authorized participants.\nPer the SEC’s press release, in-kind processes now stand alongside prior cash-only mechanics, which had been a constraint on spreads and operational efficiency.\nThe enforcement backdrop has changed. Earlier this year, the SEC moved to dismiss its civil action against Coinbase through a joint stipulation, citing ongoing work by an internal crypto task force.\nAs the agency noted in its press release, the dismissal followed the creation of a unit focused on developing a comprehensive framework, and it arrived after two years of litigation that centered on whether several traded assets were unregistered securities.\nIn May, the Commission likewise dismissed, with prejudice, its case against Binance entities and founder Changpeng Zhao, closing one of the highest profile matters from the prior policy cycle (SEC).\nTaken together, the agenda, the joint SEC-CFTC effort, and the ETP changes outline a pathway that reduces venue and product uncertainty even as final rules remain pending. Allowing crypto to trade on national exchanges and ATSs would move liquidity into environments governed by exchange surveillance programs, best-execution duties, and market-data regimes.\nBroker-dealer guidance, if it addresses custody and net capital treatment with sufficient detail, would frame how intermediaries handle crypto alongside other securities. Per Reuters, the Commission is also weighing exemptions or safe harbors for certain offers and sales, a concept with antecedents in prior staff and commissioner statements, but now positioned for notice-and-comment rulemaking.", "content_hash": "e430aa10976368dcec071afbd5f4b2e7", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

By partnering with Greystar, the firm can add operational scale and market reach.\nIn the news release announcing the deal, Luke Simpson, co-CEO of Denver-based Grand Peaks, said partnering with Greystar positions the firm’s portfolio and residents to benefit from industry-leading practices. “Greystar’s reputation for excellence and innovation makes them the ideal partner to ensure our communities continue to thrive,” he said.\nRichard Friedman, senior managing director of client services and strategic partnerships at Greystar, said Grand Peaks’ portfolio, industry reputation and culture make them a natural fit for his organization.\n“At Greystar, we seek partnerships with organizations that share our commitment to delivering exceptional resident experiences and operational excellence,” he said in the news release.\nGrand Peaks’ portfolio isn’t the only one that Greystar has absorbed over the last half decade.\nIn February 2024, Atlanta-based Wood Partners transferred property management operations to Greystar.

What Does That Mean for Hard-Hit TSLA Stock?\n-\nCoreWeave Just Gave This Data Center Stock a Big Boost. Should You Buy Shares Now?\nTesla stock has been a volatile investment in 2025. Versus its April low, the EV stock is up roughly 56% at the time of writing – but it is still down over 20% versus its year-to-date high set in mid-January.\nSlowing EV Sales to Hurt Tesla Stock\nAccording to Karl Brauer, the elimination of federal tax credits could see the share of EVs in overall U.S. vehicle sales crash to around 4% only heading into 2026.\nThis could prove catastrophic for TSLA stock given the company is already grappling with a demand problem in Europe and, more recently, in India.\nRecent reports confirm its EU sales were down 40% on a year-over-year basis in July while the company has received orders for just 600 cars in well over a month in India.\nNaturally, therefore, if rollback of incentives under President Donald Trump results in a material hit to TSLA sales in the U.S. as well, the EV stock may reverse gains it has accumulated since April.\nCould Optimus Initiative Help TSLA Shares?\nBillionaire Elon Musk isn’t particularly concerned about Tesla’s sales slump. According to him, as much as 80% of the company’s future value will come from Optimus humanoid robots.\nIn a recent social media post, TSLA’s chief executive even said the automaker’s Optimus initiative could soar its market cap to about $25 trillion over the long term.\nThe automotive and clean energy firm is committed to producing some 5,000 Optimus robots this year.

The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit Court said, “The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax.” The case now appears to be headed to the Supreme Court for a final decision.

It’s reportedly planning to beef up Siri to beat it instead\nApple finds itself at a critical crossroads in the AI race: The company is working on its own homegrown solutions, using both Siri, its smart assistant, and Apple Intelligence, its attempt to bake AI directly into the entire Apple ecosystem. But despite analysts increasingly urging the tech giant to make bold acquisitions, Apple is reportedly working on its own AI-powered search solution for the web, like Perplexity or ChatGPT, that could launch as early as next March.\nAccording to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who has deep connections within Apple, the company plans to launch an AI-powered search feature called World Knowledge Answers, integrated into Siri, by early next year. This system will function as an “answer engine,” similar to ChatGPT and Google’s AI overviews, providing summarized responses to search queries.\nThe new Siri architecture represents a complete rebuild using large language models, moving away from the first-generation system that Apple couldn’t make work properly. The company has been testing partnerships with Google for AI models, while keeping its own models for processing user data to maintain privacy standards.\nApple’s approach differs significantly from competitors, who have invested tens of billions in AI cloud infrastructure. Instead, the company maintains its “asset-light strategy,” focusing on on-device processing and selective partnerships rather than massive data-center investments.\nUnder (AI) pressure\nApple’s struggles in AI have become painfully evident to Wall Street observers. While the company’s stock has rebounded recently, only down roughly 2.5% year to date, it’s the worst performer among all Magnificent Seven stocks and the only one with a negative return so far this year. This disappointing performance comes as competitors like Nvidia and Microsoft have surged to new highs, capitalizing on the AI boom that Apple has seemingly watched from the sidelines.\nProminent analysts, led by Wedbush Securities’ Dan Ives, have repeatedly called for Apple to acquire Perplexity, the fast-growing AI search engine that has captured significant market attention. Ives described such a deal as a “no-brainer” that could cost Apple around $30 billion for a company currently valued at approximately $18 billion to $20 billion. The acquisition would provide Apple with an immediate AI search capability that could transform both Siri and Safari, giving the company a legitimate competitor to Google’s search dominance. Perplexity even has its own web browser now, called Comet, and it’s mighty impressive in its own right.", "content_hash": "7edb1006b89bf421cfcaf58ee9729287", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

It reported another blowout earnings report, and the market is getting more excited about its prospects.\nDown-to-earth coffee\nDutch Bros has been expanding fast across the country, picking up loyal customers and establishing itself as a real contender in coffee. Its stores have distinct branding and differentiated beverages, and it's focused on fun, friendly service and beverage innovation.\nIt has expanded carefully and deliberately, making smart decisions along the way. That includes bringing in a new CEO and management team to steer its expansion plan, pilot new menu options, and open new stores in formats that meet the demands of each location. It also only recently launched a mobile ordering service through its membership plan.\nThe results have been strong. Revenue increased 29% year over year in the second quarter, driven by both new stores and higher same-shop sales. Same-shop sales increased 6.1% year over year, and they were even higher for company-operated stores at 7.8%. Dutch Bros has also become quite profitable. Contribution margin widened 0.3 percentage points over last year to 31.1%, and net income increased from $31.2 million to $45.5 million.\nManagement raised its full-year guidance after the report.\nA Dutch Bros on every corner?\nThe company opened 31 new stores in the second quarter, and it's planning on opening at least 160 stores this year. However, it will need to accelerate in the coming years to meet its goals. It recently said it's shooting for 2,029 stores by 2029, and it raised its long-term goal from 4,000 stores to 7,000.\nIf it can manage that while keeping same-shop growth steady, that's going to be some monster growth over many years, and it's easy to see why investors are crazy about this stock. It's up 130% over the past year, and it trades at a rich valuation of 80 times forward one-year earnings. However, looking out 10 years, it's likely to make investors very happy, even those who buy it at this price. A good strategy to buy excellent stocks that are trading at premium levels is dollar-cost averaging, which you might want to consider in this situation.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Dutch Bros right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Dutch Bros, consider this:", "content_hash": "c8b9c7f0681561c76977958a05c90755", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Fortunately, federal student loan servicers are here to help. These government-approved companies offer free support to borrowers, helping them manage payments, explore repayment plans and even pursue loan forgiveness. But not all servicers are created equal.\nAs new legislation reshapes the landscape of student loan repayment–most notably the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) and the introduction of the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP)–choosing the right servicer has never been more important. In this article, we’ll highlight three of the best federal student loan servicers and explain how they can help you stay on top of your loans, avoid costly mistakes and make the most of available repayment options.\nQuick Take: Trump Administration vs. Federal Student Loan Repayment Plans\nAfter the passing of the OBBBA, the Institute for College Access and Success (TICAS) is warning against a new repayment plan that the Trump administration is introducing within the next few months. The student loan borrower advocacy organization has a few concerns when it comes to the future of student loan debt and subsequent student loan payments. Here are a few key takeaways:\nThe Department of Education has introduced a new repayment plan option, called Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP), to replace older plans that allowed borrowers to repay based on their specific income and eventually gain student loan forgiveness that may no longer be available. RAP was introduced under OBBBA.\nUnder the new regulations, three other income-driven repayment (IDR) plans: Income-Contingent Repayment (CIR), Pay As You Earn (PAYE), and Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) are being phased out by 2028.\nThough RAP is a new option, student loan borrower advocates warn there could be long-term negative consequences to signing up for the plan, as borrowers who consolidate their student loans through the federal direct loan program will have to choose between RAP and the standard plan, which does not depend on a borrower’s income.\nYou should note that with RAP, your monthly payments for each year are determined based on your income, and after a fixed term, you would qualify for student loan forgiveness.\nThis differs from other IDR plans because it has higher monthly payments and uses a different formula where the percentage of income that is counted toward your monthly debt collection payment increases for every $10,000 in additional income earned by the borrower, with a cap of $100,000. However, other IDR plans use a fixed repayment formula and factor in inflation.\nHere’s a closer look at three of the best federal student loan servicers.\nAidvantage is here to help you better understand and manage repayment of your federal student loans. It offers various flexible repayment plan options, including Standard, Graduated, Extended and IDR plans like SAVE. This can help you find a plan that matches your financial situation and potentially lowers your monthly payments. It also helps manage loan forgiveness programs such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) and Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) forgiveness.\nAidvantage provides military benefits, including assistance with the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA), Military Service Postponement and the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students (HEROS) Act.\nNelnet\nNelnet is a federal student loan servicer designed to simplify the repayment process. It handles your monthly payments, supports you through each stage of your loan and helps you explore options to reduce your monthly burden.\nIn addition to servicing federal loans, Nelnet also offers private student loans for both undergraduate and graduate students. Loan amounts range from $1,000 to $500,000, depending on your degree and program–making it a flexible option for borrowers with varying financial needs. Compared to other lenders, Nelnet’s rates are competitive, with APRs typically ranging from 3.47% (fixed) to 5.81% (variable).\nBorrowers who enroll in automatic debit payments receive a 0.25% interest rate reduction, and payments can be made online or through a mobile app for added convenience. Nelnet also provides support for loan consolidation, forgiveness programs, disability discharge, and bankruptcy-related issues.\nMOHELA\nMOHELA is a servicer focused on providing personalized repayment solutions to meet the diverse needs of borrowers. Like other servicers, it offers a variety of repayment plans and flexible payment options to help you stay on track.\nLike Nelnet, borrowers who sign up for auto-debit payments can receive a 0.25% interest rate reduction, making repayment more affordable. MOHELA also features an information center with educational resources to help borrowers better understand their loans and repayment strategies.\nWhile interest rates vary depending on the type of loan and issuing entity, here are some current estimates to help you plan:\nDirect Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans (Undergraduate): 6.39% fixed\nDirect Unsubsidized Loans (Graduate/Professional): 7.94% fixed\nDirect PLUS Loans (Parents & Graduate/Professional Students): 8.94% fixed\nEditor’s note on political coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

HASI has $357 million in commercial paper with a 5.46% interest rate maturing in 2025.\nOn August 11, TD Cowen reiterated a ‘Buy’ rating on the stock and a $40 price target. With a spread of about 2.5% over 2024 to 2027, TD Cowen expects portfolio expansion to drive adjusted earnings per share growth. Similarly, the research firm has raised its estimate for HASI 2027 adjusted EPS to $3.16, which falls within management’s expected guidance range of $3.03 to $3.26. The firm also expects the company to generate a dividend per share of $1.76, implying a 56% payout.\nAnalysts at UBS also share similar sentiments, having raised the stock’s price target to $39 from $38 on August 11, while reiterating a Buy rating. The research firm revised its core EPS estimates for 2025, 2026, and 2027 to $2.66, $2.86, and $3.11, respectively.\nHA Sustainable Infrastructure Capital, Inc. (NYSE:HASI) offers financial solutions to companies and projects that focus on energy efficiency, renewable energy, and other sustainable infrastructure initiatives.

Thanks to the solid quarterly numbers, HPE stock was up over 5% in morning trading on Sept. 4.\nHPE also closed the acquisition of Juniper Networks during the quarter, which is reshaping its business mix toward higher-growth and higher-margin opportunities.\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nTesla Now Has an India Problem. What Does That Mean for Hard-Hit TSLA Stock?\n-\nCoreWeave Just Gave This Data Center Stock a Big Boost. Should You Buy Shares Now?\nWith strong execution, expanding demand across artificial intelligence (AI), networking, and hybrid cloud, and a sharper focus on profitability, HPE has solid momentum going ahead, which will support its share price.\nA Strong Quarter Backed by Broad Demand\nRevenue for the quarter totaled $9.1 billion, representing a 19% year-over-year increase. Even when excluding Juniper’s $480 million contribution, sales of $8.7 billion came in strong, reflecting strong demand. Importantly, annualized recurring revenue hit $3.1 billion, up 75% from a year ago. Stripping out Juniper, that figure still rose 40%, reflecting its shift toward a more predictable, higher-margin business model.\nHPE Stock’s Growth Catalysts\nHPE’s growth is now tied to high-margin networking, AI, and hybrid cloud solutions, all areas with long runways ahead. The integration of its Intelligent Edge business with Juniper under the banner of HPE Networking positions it well to deliver solid growth and margins. Notably, networking is a higher-margin business benefitting from the surge in AI adoption and the ongoing refresh of enterprise and cloud infrastructure. This alignment makes it one of HPE’s most promising growth engines.\nMomentum in HPE’s networking business was strong in Q3. The market recovery has been steady, with enterprise demand remaining strong across campus and branch networks, where both wired and wireless upgrades are driving business. The rise of secure access service edge (SASE) and next-generation data center switching has also supported growth. A notable bright spot has been Wi-Fi 7, where orders surged at a triple-digit pace sequentially. On the cloud side, demand for AI-related networking infrastructure is growing rapidly, with Juniper’s routing solutions and HPE’s data center switching solutions seeing robust traction. These trends powered HPE Networking to $1.7 billion in revenue last quarter, a 54% year-over-year jump, reflecting broad-based strength across Intelligent Edge and Juniper.", "content_hash": "4344d8ef99005116a354c6762be806e4", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Ciena beat the sales forecast by $50 million and reported quarterly profit of $0.67 per share.\nCiena Q3 earnings\nThe news wasn't quite as good as that sounds; the $0.67 per share was only an adjusted, non-GAAP number, and actual earnings as calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) were only $0.35 per share. Still, this was a 250% improvement over the $0.10 per share in GAAP profit Ciena earned a year ago.\nSo it was still pretty good news.\nEven with operating expenses rising, up nearly 14% in the quarter, Ciena's sales are rising even faster, up 29% year over year, and this is driving tremendous profits for the company.\nIs Ciena stock a buy?\nAnd why? Communications networks are \"fundamental to the underpinning, growth, and monetization of AI,\" argues CEO Gary Smith, and Ciena equipment helps to keep network speeds rising. Although Ciena is still just three-quarters through its fiscal 2025, Smith says his company has \"visibility well into fiscal year 2026,\" and is \"confident in the continued momentum of our business.\"\nThe big question for investors is whether Ciena will be able to repeat its Q3 performance. Right now, management says sales should exceed $1.2 billion in Q4, but that would be only about 11% growth and thus half the rate of increase seen in Q3. With Ciena stock trading for a heady 127 times trailing earnings and growth perhaps slowing, the stock's starting to look a bit too rich for my taste.\nShould you buy stock in Ciena right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Ciena, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ciena wasn’t one of them.

When a steady hand disappears — whether it’s a boss, mentor or parent — decisions that used to feel guided suddenly fall entirely on one person.\nBefore that happens, these six lessons can help build financial resilience and independence.\nThe Value of Planting Seeds Early\nWhen Buffett famously said “Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago,” he was talking about long-term planning, and it’s a lesson for more than just investments. Planning ahead, with things like consistently adding to savings, is one of the best ways to develop a healthier financial position over time.\nLearn More: Warren Buffett’s Top 4 Tips for Getting Richer\nThe Importance of Cash Flow\nIt’s easy to be complacent about money with a safety net in place, so it’s important to be prepared in terms of cash flow. Keeping track of income and being cautious with spending can keep essentials covered and prevent a last minute scramble for cash in the case of an emergency. A healthy cash flow is the backbone of financial stability.\nConfidence Is Key\nLeaning too much on someone else for financial guidance can slow progress toward independence and leave doubts about making decisions. When every choice feels guided, it’s easy to second-guess instincts or wait for permission. Mistakes are inevitable, but taking responsibility and learning from them builds both resilience and lasting confidence.\nLife Doesn’t Always Go To Plan\nUnexpected bumps in the road like job losses or health emergencies can hit extra hard after the loss of a safety net. It’s never going to be easy to predict what might happen, but preparing for emergencies as much as individual circumstances allow can help. Things like building an emergency fund and thinking through worst-case scenarios can make it a lot easier to stay on track when life throws a curveball.\nStress Can Lead To Poor Decisions\nFinancial stress often triggers poor decisions, but trying to develop patience and focus can help avoid acting without thinking. Keeping a clear head when things get messy, whether it’s a market dip or a personal setback, protects long-term goals. Emotional resilience is just as important as any financial plan.", "content_hash": "2a18cbdef302b9dcbf4c5d34929ac58f", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

But not all servicers are created equal.\nAs new legislation reshapes the landscape of student loan repayment–most notably the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) and the introduction of the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP)–choosing the right servicer has never been more important.

The student loan borrower advocacy organization has a few concerns when it comes to the future of student loan debt and subsequent student loan payments. Here are a few key takeaways:\nThe Department of Education has introduced a new repayment plan option, called Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP), to replace older plans that allowed borrowers to repay based on their specific income and eventually gain student loan forgiveness that may no longer be available. RAP was introduced under OBBBA.\nUnder the new regulations, three other income-driven repayment (IDR) plans: Income-Contingent Repayment (CIR), Pay As You Earn (PAYE), and Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) are being phased out by 2028.\nThough RAP is a new option, student loan borrower advocates warn there could be long-term negative consequences to signing up for the plan, as borrowers who consolidate their student loans through the federal direct loan program will have to choose between RAP and the standard plan, which does not depend on a borrower’s income.\nYou should note that with RAP, your monthly payments for each year are determined based on your income, and after a fixed term, you would qualify for student loan forgiveness.\nThis differs from other IDR plans because it has higher monthly payments and uses a different formula where the percentage of income that is counted toward your monthly debt collection payment increases for every $10,000 in additional income earned by the borrower, with a cap of $100,000. However, other IDR plans use a fixed repayment formula and factor in inflation.\nHere’s a closer look at three of the best federal student loan servicers.\nAidvantage is here to help you better understand and manage repayment of your federal student loans. It offers various flexible repayment plan options, including Standard, Graduated, Extended and IDR plans like SAVE. This can help you find a plan that matches your financial situation and potentially lowers your monthly payments. It also helps manage loan forgiveness programs such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) and Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) forgiveness.\nAidvantage provides military benefits, including assistance with the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA), Military Service Postponement and the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students (HEROS) Act.\nNelnet\nNelnet is a federal student loan servicer designed to simplify the repayment process. It handles your monthly payments, supports you through each stage of your loan and helps you explore options to reduce your monthly burden.\nIn addition to servicing federal loans, Nelnet also offers private student loans for both undergraduate and graduate students. Loan amounts range from $1,000 to $500,000, depending on your degree and program–making it a flexible option for borrowers with varying financial needs. Compared to other lenders, Nelnet’s rates are competitive, with APRs typically ranging from 3.47% (fixed) to 5.81% (variable).\nBorrowers who enroll in automatic debit payments receive a 0.25% interest rate reduction, and payments can be made online or through a mobile app for added convenience. Nelnet also provides support for loan consolidation, forgiveness programs, disability discharge, and bankruptcy-related issues.\nMOHELA\nMOHELA is a servicer focused on providing personalized repayment solutions to meet the diverse needs of borrowers. Like other servicers, it offers a variety of repayment plans and flexible payment options to help you stay on track.\nLike Nelnet, borrowers who sign up for auto-debit payments can receive a 0.25% interest rate reduction, making repayment more affordable. MOHELA also features an information center with educational resources to help borrowers better understand their loans and repayment strategies.\nWhile interest rates vary depending on the type of loan and issuing entity, here are some current estimates to help you plan:\nDirect Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans (Undergraduate): 6.39% fixed\nDirect Unsubsidized Loans (Graduate/Professional): 7.94% fixed\nDirect PLUS Loans (Parents & Graduate/Professional Students): 8.94% fixed\nEditor’s note on political coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

What Does That Mean for Hard-Hit TSLA Stock?\n-\nCoreWeave Just Gave This Data Center Stock a Big Boost. Should You Buy Shares Now?\nWith strong execution, expanding demand across artificial intelligence (AI), networking, and hybrid cloud, and a sharper focus on profitability, HPE has solid momentum going ahead, which will support its share price.\nA Strong Quarter Backed by Broad Demand\nRevenue for the quarter totaled $9.1 billion, representing a 19% year-over-year increase. Even when excluding Juniper’s $480 million contribution, sales of $8.7 billion came in strong, reflecting strong demand. Importantly, annualized recurring revenue hit $3.1 billion, up 75% from a year ago. Stripping out Juniper, that figure still rose 40%, reflecting its shift toward a more predictable, higher-margin business model.\nHPE Stock’s Growth Catalysts\nHPE’s growth is now tied to high-margin networking, AI, and hybrid cloud solutions, all areas with long runways ahead. The integration of its Intelligent Edge business with Juniper under the banner of HPE Networking positions it well to deliver solid growth and margins. Notably, networking is a higher-margin business benefitting from the surge in AI adoption and the ongoing refresh of enterprise and cloud infrastructure. This alignment makes it one of HPE’s most promising growth engines.\nMomentum in HPE’s networking business was strong in Q3. The market recovery has been steady, with enterprise demand remaining strong across campus and branch networks, where both wired and wireless upgrades are driving business. The rise of secure access service edge (SASE) and next-generation data center switching has also supported growth. A notable bright spot has been Wi-Fi 7, where orders surged at a triple-digit pace sequentially. On the cloud side, demand for AI-related networking infrastructure is growing rapidly, with Juniper’s routing solutions and HPE’s data center switching solutions seeing robust traction. These trends powered HPE Networking to $1.7 billion in revenue last quarter, a 54% year-over-year jump, reflecting broad-based strength across Intelligent Edge and Juniper.", "content_hash": "4344d8ef99005116a354c6762be806e4", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Ciena beat the sales forecast by $50 million and reported quarterly profit of $0.67 per share.\nCiena Q3 earnings\nThe news wasn't quite as good as that sounds; the $0.67 per share was only an adjusted, non-GAAP number, and actual earnings as calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) were only $0.35 per share. Still, this was a 250% improvement over the $0.10 per share in GAAP profit Ciena earned a year ago.\nSo it was still pretty good news.\nEven with operating expenses rising, up nearly 14% in the quarter, Ciena's sales are rising even faster, up 29% year over year, and this is driving tremendous profits for the company.\nIs Ciena stock a buy?\nAnd why? Communications networks are \"fundamental to the underpinning, growth, and monetization of AI,\" argues CEO Gary Smith, and Ciena equipment helps to keep network speeds rising. Although Ciena is still just three-quarters through its fiscal 2025, Smith says his company has \"visibility well into fiscal year 2026,\" and is \"confident in the continued momentum of our business.\"\nThe big question for investors is whether Ciena will be able to repeat its Q3 performance. Right now, management says sales should exceed $1.2 billion in Q4, but that would be only about 11% growth and thus half the rate of increase seen in Q3. With Ciena stock trading for a heady 127 times trailing earnings and growth perhaps slowing, the stock's starting to look a bit too rich for my taste.\nShould you buy stock in Ciena right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Ciena, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ciena wasn’t one of them.

Planning ahead, with things like consistently adding to savings, is one of the best ways to develop a healthier financial position over time.\nLearn More: Warren Buffett’s Top 4 Tips for Getting Richer\nThe Importance of Cash Flow\nIt’s easy to be complacent about money with a safety net in place, so it’s important to be prepared in terms of cash flow. Keeping track of income and being cautious with spending can keep essentials covered and prevent a last minute scramble for cash in the case of an emergency. A healthy cash flow is the backbone of financial stability.\nConfidence Is Key\nLeaning too much on someone else for financial guidance can slow progress toward independence and leave doubts about making decisions. When every choice feels guided, it’s easy to second-guess instincts or wait for permission. Mistakes are inevitable, but taking responsibility and learning from them builds both resilience and lasting confidence.\nLife Doesn’t Always Go To Plan\nUnexpected bumps in the road like job losses or health emergencies can hit extra hard after the loss of a safety net. It’s never going to be easy to predict what might happen, but preparing for emergencies as much as individual circumstances allow can help. Things like building an emergency fund and thinking through worst-case scenarios can make it a lot easier to stay on track when life throws a curveball.\nStress Can Lead To Poor Decisions\nFinancial stress often triggers poor decisions, but trying to develop patience and focus can help avoid acting without thinking. Keeping a clear head when things get messy, whether it’s a market dip or a personal setback, protects long-term goals. Emotional resilience is just as important as any financial plan.", "content_hash": "2a18cbdef302b9dcbf4c5d34929ac58f", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Monthly mortgage payments often exceed the one‑third income threshold, even for households earning nearly double that “ideal” salary. Experts say the bigger obstacle isn’t just today’s mortgage rates, but persistently high home prices fueled by tight inventory and homeowners holding on to their low-rate mortgages.\nAll things considered, $74,000 per year doesn’t sound like a bad salary. It’s about $12,000 more than the average salary in the U.S. and enough to afford $1,800 in rent in most major U.S. cities.\nAmericans consider that amount of money to be the “perfect salary,” according to a recent survey of more than 2,000 U.S. adults by Talker Research. This is the average amount respondents said they would need in order to be happy, and half of respondents said the current amount of money they make isn’t enough to support their lifestyle, even beyond housing.\nWhile the average amount was $74,000, that’s not nearly enough to afford to buy a home in all but two U.S. states: West Virginia and Louisiana, according to Realtor.com—and even doubling that “perfect salary” to $148,000 won’t get you a house in every state.\n“Earning the ‘perfect salary’ may still fall short of affording a median-priced home in most states,” Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com, said in a statement.\nThe median-priced new home in the U.S. costs more than $410,000, and an existing home will set you back more than $422,000, U.S. Census Bureau and National Association of Realtors data shows. And in states like California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Colorado, and Washington, buyers can expect to shell out well over $600,000 to buy just a median-priced home.\nAssuming you purchase a home for $422,000, put down a conventional 20%, and your mortgage rate is about 6.5%, that means you’d end up spending nearly $2,500 on your monthly mortgage payment. That would be well over one-third of a monthly gross salary, which is generally discouraged. Most real estate experts warn against spending more than one-third of your salary on housing.\nBut assuming a $148,000 salary, that $2,500 payment wouldn’t feel as overbearing—that is, if you have the ability to shell out on the down payment and can even find a home that meets your needs within that median price range.\nThe biggest hurdles for U.S. homebuyers\nWhile much of the housing-market conversation has been focused on mortgage rates—which continue to hover in the mid-6% range—a sticky problem is home prices remain historically high.", "content_hash": "1eb08d62d914e285e01e390172eca45e", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

A year ago, the rate averaged 6.35%.\nBorrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also fell. The average rate slipped to 5.6% from 5.69% last week. A year ago, it was 5.47%, Freddie Mac said.\nMortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors’ expectations for the economy and inflation.\nRates have been mostly declining since late July amid growing expectations that the Fed will cut its benchmark short-term interest rate at the central bank’s meeting of policymakers later this month.\nA similar trend happened in the leadup to September last year, when the Fed cut its rate in for the first time in more than four years. At that time, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage got down to a 2-year low of 6.08%, but soon after climbed again, reaching above 7% by mid-January.\nWhile the Fed doesn’t set mortgage rates, its actions can influence bond investors’ appetite for long-term U.S. government bonds, like 10-year Treasury notes. Lenders use the yield on 10-year Treasurys as a guide to pricing home loans.\nThe Fed has kept its main interest rate on hold this year because it’s been more worried about inflation potentially worsening because of President Donald Trump’s tariffs than about the job market.\nBut in a high-profile speech last month, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled the central bank may cut rates in coming months amid concerns about weaker job gains following a grim July jobs report, which included massive downward revisions for June and May,\nThe government’s August job market snapshot is due out Friday. Ahead of it, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.18% from 4.22% late Wednesday.\n“Historically, a weaker or softer-than-expected jobs report fuels optimism for Federal Reserve rate cuts and can lower bond yields, thereby nudging mortgage rates downward,” said Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com. “Conversely, a robust job report may reinforce inflation concerns and elevate Treasury yields, putting upward pressure on mortgage rates. This setup underscores the potential for increased mortgage rate volatility ahead.”\nThe housing market has been in a slump since 2022, when mortgage rates began climbing from historic lows. Sales have remained sluggish so far this year as the average rate on a 30-year mortgage has mostly hovered above 6.5%.", "content_hash": "ce2718e8b539689fae4e37e3c3eebdef", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Email pr@fool.com\nPeng Shen: Good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we are pleased to see the integration of AI with the insurance and healthcare sectors begin to deliver satisfying results. Revenue growth accelerated further with quarterly revenue reaching million, up 23.9% year over year. Powered by AI, the company's improved operational efficiency significantly, driving an 85.9% year over year increase in operating profit and lifting the operating margin by 3.9 percentage points. Our EasterTech business leverages technological innovation to bring inclusive protection for more users. Our Waterdrop Guardian AI application suite has been rolled out across customer acquisition, sales, underwriting, customer service, quality assurance, and other key processes.\nWith that, FYP in Q2 increased 80% year over year and productivity per capita improved significantly. Waterdrop Medical corresponding platform has also upgraded its risk assessment system by integrating large language model capabilities in case authenticity and transparency. As of June 30, it has raised medical funds for 3.54 million patients. With the market rebounding, the number of patients enrolled in our eFine platform also reached a historical high, with nearly 1,000 patients enrolled in 2025, where operations remain robust and improving. We keep improving our AI technology stack. Our self-development multi-agent collaboration framework can be reused a lot. It helps us quickly build different types of agented chatbots and let AI agents collaborate within milliseconds.\nThanks to this, we can provide more stable AI agents to handle more and more complex situations. We are also creating proxy reward models and adding the GRPO algorithm. This allows agents to break away from fixed scripts and change their communication strategies according to what customers do. To fix the slow responding issue when making AI agent calls, we used a distributed key-value cache. It significantly speeds up the influence of the first token. As of June 30, the company has submitted 60 patent applications related to large language models, with nine of them filed internationally. Our AI-driven business innovation was recently included in Harvard Business School's case collection, receiving recognition from the world-renowned academic institution.\nBased on these technologies, we will continue to expand the use of AI in our insurance and healthcare sectors, constantly creating value for our business and the industry. The company also actively engaged in social return initiatives. As of June 30, 2025, our Waterdrop welfare platform has collaborated with 118 public charitable organizations. It has initiated over 15,500 public welfare projects. In July, it participated in the relief efforts for the Swab disease in North China, providing assistance to the affected people through monitoring and material donations. This year marks our ninth anniversary of the company's start to establish. We are very grateful for the continuous support from our shareholders and investors over time.\nThe company has actively conducted share repurchase in the open market for four consecutive years. To keep repaying shareholders' trust, our Board recently approved two new initiatives. On one hand, we are pleased to announce that our Board has recently approved an enhanced cash dividend of $10.9 million, representing a 50% increase over the previous dividend. The dividend per ordinary share was $0.3 and this dividend per ADS will be $0.3. The Board has also authorized its annual share repurchase plan. Since our first share repurchase program was launched in 2021, we have repurchased approximately 55.7 million ADS for $109 million as of August 31, 2025.\nLooking ahead, we will build on the current performance and make further efforts to achieve the business goals for the year of 2025 and the medium and long-term business development, striving to create more value for our stakeholders. Next, I will now pass the runway to introduce the development of the insurance business in Q2.\nRan Wei: Thank you, Peng Shen. In Q2, our insurance business delivered robust growth. The first-year premium reached billion, up 80.2% year over year and 53.1% quarter over quarter. Insurance-related revenue was about million, up 28.7% year over year and 12.2% quarter over quarter. Operating margin improved to 23.1%, up by nearly two percentage points year over year, driven by our deeper AI integration. For short-term products, we increased the investment in customer acquisition and technology, representing FYP to billion, up 95% year over year and 62.1% quarter over quarter. In customer acquisition, we continuously tap into AI capabilities, integrate on user outreach and recommendation AI model, and drive continuous breakthrough in customer acquisition from a public domain.\nWe are increasingly applying AI tools to enhance the production, speed, and quantity of marketing materials to support front-end customer acquisition efforts. At the same time, we use AI to facilitate better conversion of different scenarios. For example, our new AI Pro insurance model, the app, and the Mini Program use a large network model for real-time matching and convert nearly 50% better than the traditional advertising slot. In the voice services, narrow AI medical insurance experts continue to improve efficiency. In Q2, it assisted in achieving a 155% increase in the scale of insurance premiums compared to Q1. And points continue expanding in the second half of the year.\nIn weak comp scenarios, AI medical insurance experts launched as of March and by June lifted FIP per lead 58% compared to that in May. On products, we expanded our portfolio. We have new long-term medical plans such as which requires no health declaration and guarantee renewal for five years. We also rolled out a mid to high-end plan with zero deductible and nationwide eligibility. And version 6.0 of our maternity series, Jiahao Yun, we were the first in the market to accept extended mothers with pre-existing conditions. Our products for people with pre-existing conditions contributed a quarterly premium of million, a year-on-year increase of 146.6%.\nIn terms of long-term insurance, we actively explore the efficiency improvement of AI tools for online sales consultants and planners, which contributed to the long-term FIP reaching CNY770 million. A year-on-year increase of 45.4% and a sequential increase of 30.5%. With the assistance of AI tools, the productivity of the traditional online sales team has achieved double-digit growth both year on year and quarter on quarter and Shenandoah independently contributed FIP of million. We've given online sales consultants and planners an insurance product knowledge-based query tool called Life Planner Co-Pilot. It's based on life to an array model, the knowledge base has information on about 7,000 insurance products. It helps consultants search for relevant insurance contract terms in real-time.\nIn total, it has handled 300,000 insurance product-related consultations. Through months of internal testing, we launched the Kueyi AI in August. Think of it as an insurance-focused deep seat. It delivers expert underwriting answers for every informed product with industry-leading accuracy. And we plan to open the platform to our partners to accelerate AI adoption across the industry value chain. Besides tools for agents, we have launched an AI super pre-sales assistant on Wecom. It can receive customer consultation 24/7. It can figure out what customers' insurance needs and their intention to buy insurance on its own, match suitable products based on customers' situations, and make an appointment with the most appropriate salesman for them.\nAccording to the data since it launched, the AI assistant is more efficient than a human assistant and has effectively improved the team's work efficiency. On the supply side of long-term products, we keep pushing health insurance innovation. We kept refining our Zixin's order of critical units aligned with easy health declarations and introduced the cost-effective study official series critical unit plan and rolled out a no health declaration income protection insurance product. Besides, disability insurance crossover across the million to in quarterly FYP for the first time and is scoring a strong user effect. Since its rollout in March, our AI customer service agent has scaled rapidly, aiding avoid support alongside tax.\nIn joint alone, it handled 215,000 service sessions, lifting first contact resolution rate. Online insurers now achieved 100% AI coverage. Meanwhile, in Q2, our AI quality control assistance boosted Q and A efficiency by 94% compared with the traditional manual way. This concludes the insurance business update. Now I will hand over to our Board Secretary, Jasmine Lee, to review our Q2 progress in order of core funding and healthcare sectors.\nJasmine Lee: Thank you, Ran Wei. As of June 2025, around 480 million people cumulatively donated RMB70 billion to about 3,540,000 patients through our WhatsApp medical profiling platform. That is by Tactical Group, we again increased R and D investment on our personal medical profiling risk control. For case-level risk, like language model metrics can now identify 15 high-risk scenarios like suspected identity, abnormal spending, or ethical violations. It does this by analyzing every word in the campaign's context, comments, and hidden clues which greatly improves the detective accuracy. For fund-level risk, a dynamic monitoring algorithm checks the diagnose timeline, commercial insurance payout, and the fundraising speed. If anything wrong with the fund, it will automatically limit or post the campaign.\nThen menu review will be carried out within minutes. To address malicious promotion activities, we have developed an abnormal behavior recognition model. We incorporated crucial factors such as donation conversion rate, information dissemination patterns, and SaaS characteristics. This model shows the top accuracy in the industry. This model can detect and stop the malicious campaign in real-time. On May 27, we partnered with Guangzhou civil affairs bureaucracy to launch the order of Cool Help. It is the first project under our new designation as a government-endorsed platform that integrates social and public welfare resources. This project ensures that welfare resources can accurately reach the target population by integrating the system with Zhihoban's platform.\nAt the same time, in places like Guangzhou, co-health space, and hospitals, the platform is improving its serviceability and actively responding to and exploring the government-enterprise collaboration innovation model. Turning to our healthcare business. We continue to advance on a steady and upward trajectory. Digital clinical trial business has entered a phase of rapid scale-up coupled with efficiency gains. Yifan platform expanded its collaboration to 198 pharmaceutical and contracted research organizations. Meanwhile, we initiated service for 114 new programs. The number of patients enrolled also reached a historic high with 999 patients enrolled in 2019, representing a 34.2% year-over-year revenue growth. Our digital omni-channel marketing business also accelerated. We renewed our three-year contract with a leading global multinational pharmaceutical.\nThrough the application of AI in patient services and health education management, we achieved a 105% increase in productivity per capita, representing a substantial enhancement in our service capability. Looking ahead, we will deepen our L and M capabilities and algorithmic position to unlock further growth as healthcare digital wide vision accelerates. Now I will hand over to Xu Xiaoying, our Head of Finance Department to discuss our financial performance in this quarter.\nXu Xiaoying: Thank you, Jasmine Lee. Hello, everyone. I will now walk you through our financial highlights for 2025. Before I go into detail, please be reminded that all numbers quoted here will be in RMB and please refer to our earnings release for detailed information on our financial performance on both the year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis respectively. On the base of steady growth in the previous quarter, the company has further achieved significant year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter growth in both revenue and profit this quarter.\nAs Peng Shen and Ran Wei just mentioned, further development of the company's AI application was to improve the efficiency of our business operation in multiple segments, including customer acquisition, sales, service, and quality control providing strong motivation for the performance growth in the second quarter. In Q2, Waterdrop achieved remarkable financial results with total raw money amounted to million, representing a year-on-year increase of 23.9% and a quarter-on-quarter increase of 11.2%. By segment, the insurance business contributed million showing a year-on-year increase of 28.7%. The corresponding service fees generated million remaining stable on year-on-year. The digital clinical trial solutions used RMB27.7 million with a year-on-year increase of 34.2%. Meanwhile, the company has been making its operation more efficient.\nIn the second quarter, the total operating costs and expenses were around million, which is about 18.7% higher than the same period last year as the growth rate of the cost and expenses was lower than that of the revenue. This quarter, the operating cost was for million, a 30.5% increase from last year. This was mainly because the cost of referral and service fee went up by about million this quarter. Also during this quarter, the company made additional efforts in the medical refining business to assist help more users. Moreover, as the company has been enhancing its AI capability to attract more users during this quarter, it acquired users while considering both efficiency and user experience.\nThe sales and marketing expenses amounted to million, representing a 26.3% increase compared to last year. This is primarily due to an increase of million in marketing expenses for third-party traffic channels. General and administrative expenses decreased by 21.9% year over year to million for 2019. This was primarily because the company tightened its operational control and allowance for credit losses were RMB13.4 million less than last year. The R and D expenses were million remaining stable for the same period of last year. In the future, we will continue to pull resources to accomplish major adjustments, the internal structure of R and D expenses, and allocate more resources to the AI capabilities building.\nIn terms of the operating profit in Q2, the company's operating profit reached million, showing a high-speed year-on-year growth of 85.9%. The operating profit margins of the company as a whole and its insurance business have both further improved. Net profit attributable to the company's ordinary shareholders reached RMB140 million, up 58.7% year over year. As of June 30, 2025, we held billion in cash reserve with operating cash flow remaining positive, providing a solid foundation for continued growth and strategic investment. In conclusion, Waterdrop's excellent performance in this quarter further demonstrates its robust operational stability and the effective synergy among diverse business segments. Looking ahead, we will continue to leverage technology and AI to expand our user base.\nAt the same time, we will optimize our operations to enhance efficiency, thereby facilitating the stable growth of business revenue and profits. Additionally, we will persist in creating long-term value for shareholders and society. And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we will conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for joining.

You can sign up to receive this newsletter every week via email here.\nIf you want a glimpse of how AI could reshape corporate staffing, look to Salesforce.\nCEO Marc Benioff said during a Labor Day podcast that the company has already cut 4,000 customer support roles after deploying its own AI agents. “I’ve reduced it from 9,000 heads to about 5,000 because I need less heads,” Benioff said, calling the past eight months “the most exciting” of his career. (A Salesforce spokesperson later clarified that many of the affected jobs were support engineers who were shifted into other roles.)\nStill, Salesforce may be an outlier. Benioff was likely promoting his own AgentForce platform. Gartner predicted back in March that half of all organizations will abandon plans to shrink their customer service staff because of AI. In a poll of 163 customer service leaders, 95% said they intend to keep human agents and use AI more strategically.\nCustomer service is a particularly sensitive area for automation, since it involves direct contact with customers. Many companies may prefer a human touch. Other roles behind the scenes—like software engineering—may prove easier to replace. Junior developers, for example, are increasingly vulnerable as coding agents such as Cursor and Claude Code take on much of the basic work. A recent Stanford study found that employment for 22- to 25-year-old software engineers fell nearly 20% between late 2022 and July 2025, even as hiring for older engineers grew.\nOther research points to broader disruption. A new study from the Gerald Huff Fund for Humanity estimates that AI will put 45 million U.S. jobs at risk by 2028, including roles such as retail managers, HR coordinators, and administrative assistants—often the rungs younger workers climb toward stable, middle-income careers. The Fund warns that this “hollowing out” of entry-level jobs “threatens long-term mobility for an entire generation.” It advocates for a Universal Basic Income (UBI) as a cushion for displaced workers.\nReskilling remains another challenge. Research from LinkedIn found that many professionals feel overwhelmed by the pressure to learn new AI tools, describing it as “another job” added to their workload. Nearly half said they aren’t using AI to its full potential, and 30% admitted they rarely or never use it (31% acknowledged exaggerating their AI skills at work). Meanwhile, more than a third of executives say they plan to hire and evaluate employees based on AI expertise.\nFor many workers, there’s no simple path through this AI-powered transition. While it’s human nature to ignore major disruptions, experts say there are real advantages to embracing AI and exploring the possibilities. The best strategy may be to expand their use of AI beyond general chatbots like ChatGPT, and find specialized tools—perhaps including new AI agents—that can handle mundane, low-skill tasks. Doing so frees up time for higher-order, uniquely human work, much of which requires creativity and empathy.\nWhat the Google antitrust decision means for AI search companies\nA federal court in Washington, D.C., decided that Google will not have to sell off its Chrome browser after being found guilty of monopolistic practices in internet search and advertising last year. The remedies chosen by Judge Amit Mehta are more surgical: Google will no longer be able to ink exclusive deals that establish its search service as the default on other platforms.\nThat change directly impacts one of Google’s most lucrative arrangements: its multibillion-dollar payments to Apple to keep Google Search as the iPhone’s default. Google will likely go on paying Apple to put Google Search on the popular devices, but it will no longer be able to pay Apple to be the only search service on the devices. This opens the door for other search providers—including new AI search upstarts—to pay for a presence on Apple devices too.\nMehta’s decision also compels Google to periodically share its search index—including data on the quality and popularity of links—with competitors. Google built its whole company around its search index, a vast and ever-changing database of all the sites and content on the internet (or at least everything that Google’s web crawlers can reach). Now Google will have to share that crown jewel, including data about the quality and popularity of indexed web content, with a new wave of AI search providers like OpenAI and Perplexity. These new players—which deliver fully fleshed answers to users, not just a list of links—can use the index data to improve the quality and accuracy of their own search results.\nActivists are using AI to unmask ICE agents\nThe federal government has long failed to pass any meaningful legislation to protect people’s privacy from surveillance technologies. Now, in a strange twist, the government has become a victim of its own inaction. As Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids spread and become more bold, activists are attempting to use AI to unmask, then publicly identify, ICE agents.\nPoliticoreports that a Netherlands-based immigration activist Dominick Skinner and a group of volunteers have developed an AI model that analyzes the faces of ICE agents within screenshots of ICE raid and arrest videos. If at least 30% of the agent’s face is visible, the AI can generate a reasonable facsimile of the agent’s whole face. Using the AI-generated image, activists can use image search tools to find the ICE agent on social media or elsewhere, Politico reports. Skinner says his group has now publicly identified at least 20 ICE officials recorded wearing masks during arrests. The AI unmasking project is part of a larger effort called the ICE List, an activist web archive that has published the identities of more than 100 ICE employees and agents.\nThe Department of Homeland Security insists that the ICE agents wear the masks to avoid being doxxed and harassed. But critics say the sight of masked agents (sometimes displaying no badge or other agency identification) manhandling alleged undocumented immigrants on the street presents a powerful image of callous authoritarianism and unaccountable government force.", "content_hash": "70cd2f35050d0be83b22ccfea7411877", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

On August 28, the company unveiled a new ultrafast charging architecture designed for passenger electric vehicles.\nThe architecture can deliver up to 600kW of power and also provides megawatt charging capability for heavy-duty commercial applications. Powered by Eaton, the system features vehicle-to-everything (V2X) capabilities and a modular DC Grid design. Additionally, it can be deployed for 30% less capital expenditure and has a 30% smaller footprint.\nIts competitive edge stems from combining ChargePoint’s Express chargers and Eaton’s electrical infrastructure solutions. Therefore, it can synchronize between onsite renewable energy storage and vehicle batteries to help reduce fueling costs.\n“The new ChargePoint Express architecture, and particularly the Express Grid variant, will take DC fast charging to levels of performance and cost not previously imagined,” said Rick Wilmer, CEO of ChargePoint.\nChargePoint Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CHPT) provides electric vehicle (EV) charging hardware, software, and services to power charging stations.

Experienced aviation professionals, including former Israeli Air Force pilots, will guide the initiative.\nA 360-Degree Pivot for Nukkleus\nNukkleus has undergone a notable transformation from a fintech company to a defense contractor. In January 2024, Nukkleus terminated existing customer and supplier contracts and shifted focus to payment services. By November, it entered a settlement agreement to sell its payment services subsidiary for just £1,000 (approximately $1,372), pending shareholder approval.\nThe company's pivot from foreign exchange trading technology to defense and aerospace represents a complete overhaul of its business model. Nukkleus is positioning itself as an acquirer of Tier 2 and Tier 3 defense suppliers, which target the industrial backbone of national security infrastructure across the U.S. and Israel.\nThe pending acquisition of Star 26 Capital, which specializes in Iron Dome generator systems, marks a crucial step in this transformation. Combined with subsidiary Rimon's tactical vehicle outfitting capabilities and the recent NATO-aligned joint venture with Mandragola, Nukkleus is building a diversified defense portfolio.\nHowever, investors should carefully weigh its strategic potential against financial headwinds. It ended the June quarter with only $1.52 million in cash and a working capital deficit of $53.4 million. Nukkleus faces substantial doubt about its ability to continue operations without additional financing, as it burned through nearly $3 million in operating cash flow during the first half of 2025.", "content_hash": "a389487447e1b72ce5ac1d47c04bc540", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Chances are if you grew up in the U.S., you are more than familiar with Kraft Mac & Cheese, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Oscar Meyer hotdogs, or even Lunchables. Not to mention the ketchup and pickles.\nBut as the title here says, KHC actually did cut the cheese… out of part of its business. The company announced earlier this week that it is splitting back into two companies. Yet, this is not as simple as reversing the 2015 combination. Kraft Heinz is now a powerhouse in the food industry that generates $25 billion in revenue, dominating supermarket shelves as much as ever.\nThe two separated businesses will be named Global Taste Elevation Co. and North American Grocery Co.\nThe former will get the ketchup, mac & cheese, cream cheese, and a range of sauces and seasonings, a $15 billion separate business, and soon, a separate ticker symbol. These are considered the more growthy product lines. That’s a relative term, since earnings growth has been tough to come by in KHC’s current form. And if there’s one thing this stock market needs to lift prices, it’s growth.\nThe latter will be led by hot dogs, Kraft “singles” cheese slices, Lunchables, and to wash it down, Maxwell House coffee. These are the more stable brands, accounting for a $10 billion piece of the pie. I’d assume this is where most of KHC’s stout 5.94% dividend yield will end up.\nWhat does all of this mean for the stock, which will soon be two separate trading companies? Heck if Wall Street knows just yet. This separation of business lines has been rumored and even encouraged for a while. But it won’t take effect for nearly a year.\nAh, but the charts might offer a clue. So let’s walk down that aisle and check them out.\nStarting with the daily chart, the stock’s immediate dip on the announcement was followed by a Wednesday bounce. But the chart is still quite weak. The one bright spot is a looming date with that support level around $25-$26 a share. Not too far south of here.\nThe weekly view below prompted me to stretch back beyond the typical 4 years I look at and present to you. I went back to the start of 2020, the year of the pandemic. We can see that KHC, apart from that nice dividend, has had no share price growth since that year.\nKHC Faces Off Against MAHA Movement and Is Winning for Now\nFinally, the monthly chart is well worth a look in this case. Because I think it lends credence to that classic investment cry of “people are not going to stop buying cheese, hot dogs and coffee!” OK, that’s not the same as water and electricity, and KHC is hardly a utility.\nBut no matter how much the U.S. government’s “Make America Healthy Again” (“MAHA”) movement penetrates the broader population, the country is not likely to go all-in on organic this or that any time soon. So yes, this looks like a consumer staples stock as far as I can see.\nThat’s where the bullish case could be. The stock price is more than 40% off its first day of post-merger trading back in 2015. And, KHC trades 70% off its 2017 high. Even including the dividends, the stock is down about 43% over the past 10 years, a period in which the S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has quadrupled in value. I believe the technical term for that type of laggard performance is “yikes.”\nHow to Trade KHC Stock Here\nKHC started with a single product. It was in 1869, and it was horseradish. Henry J. Heinz took his mother’s recipe. And that started an iconic American brand, which has now become a not-so-hot dog of a stock.\nWhat happens from here is too opaque to do more than guesstimate. And with a stock like this, down so far but with a real business behind it, the option part of my brain skips the typical collar strategy and goes right to buying call options. Or as options players know them, “LEAP” calls. That’s a plain old call option, but with a very long time until expiration.\nHow long? Let’s look at the longest one I could find, expiring on Jan. 15, 2027, more than 16 months from now. The goal here is to essentially set it and forget it unless or until the stock really spikes. There’s a long time for that to happen.\nKHC’s volatility is a big part of my motivation here. See that “Historic Volatility” level of around 30%? That means that in the past 12 months, KHC’s volatility level has been higher than its current 26 level 70% of the time. That means buying options is not very expensive, despite the recent stock price decline.\nIf I decided I wanted to profit on the stock above the $30 level, $1 above where it traded as recently as July 30 of this year, it would cost me $1.83 a share. That’s a long way up from where it trades, since I’d need the stock to get not only to $30, but also above the call option cost.\nSo I would not be profitable at expiration until KHC rose above $31.83. But if the recovery story is embraced by the market, there’s some upside here for a relatively small cost. And with that early 2027 expiration date, that’s about 6-7 months post breakout into the two stocks from the one KHC.\nThis is evidence that regardless of how you slice it, this popular set of more than 50 food product lines can be approached in many different ways. The stock may wiggle around like its Jell-O brand for a while. But for those who want to take a shot, while also being patient to let this one play out, there are options.\nOn the date of publication, Rob Isbitts did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Crude prices today added to Wednesday's losses on concerns of a global oil supply glut following a report from Reuters that OPEC+ is considering an increase in its crude production levels. Crude prices remained lower after weekly EIA crude inventories unexpectedly rose. Losses in gasoline prices were limited after weekly EIA gasoline supplies fell more than expected to a 9-month low.\nToday's global economic news was mainly weaker-than-expected, a negative factor for energy demand and crude prices. The US Aug ADP employment change rose +54,000, weaker than expectations of +68,000. Also, US weekly initial unemployment claims rose by +8,000 to a 10-week high of 237,000, showing a weaker labor market than expectations of 230,000. In addition, Eurozone July retail sales fell -0.5% m/m, weaker than expectations of -0.3% m/m and the biggest decline in 13 months. On the positive side, the US Aug ISM services index rose +1.9 to 52.0, stronger than expectations of 51.1 and the strongest pace of expansion in six months.\nReduced Russian crude output is tightening global oil supplies and is supportive of prices. Ukrainian drone and missile attacks on Russian refineries have curbed Russia's crude-processing runs to 5.09 million bpd in the first 27 days of August, the lowest monthly average in over 3.25 years.\nCrude prices have support on concerns that the ongoing war in Ukraine could lead to additional sanctions on Russian energy exports, reducing global oil supplies. US Treasury Secretary Bessent said Tuesday that the US \"will be examining sanctions on Russia very closely this week\" due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. President Trump has threatened \"very big consequences\" if Russia doesn't come to the negotiating table. Last Friday, German Chancellor Merz and French President Macron called for secondary sanctions on Russia for its war in Ukraine. They said they will push for measures targeting \"companies from third countries that support Russia's war.\"\nA decrease in crude oil held worldwide on tankers is bullish for oil prices. Vortexa reported Monday that crude oil stored on tankers that have been stationary for at least seven days fell by -18% w/w to 72.67 million bbl in the week ended August 29.\nConcerns about higher OPEC production are negative for crude prices after OPEC+ on August 2 endorsed an additional 547,000 bpd increase in its crude production for September 1. OPEC+ is boosting output to reverse the 2-year-long production cut, gradually restoring a total of 2.2 million bpd of production by September 2026. OPEC+ has 1.66 million bpd of supplies that are currently due to remain offline until late 2026. OPEC+ will meet again on September 7 to discuss crude production levels. OPEC Aug crude production rose by +400,000 bpd to 28.55 million bpd, the highest in over two years.\nToday's weekly EIA report was mainly bearish for crude and products. EIA crude inventories unexpectedly rose +2.4 million bbl versus expectations of a -1.9 million draw. Also, EIA distillate stockpiles unexpectedly rose +1.7 million bbl versus expectations of a -1.7 million draw. In addition, crude supplies at Cushing, the delivery point of WTI futures, rose by +1.59 million bbl. On the positive side, EIA gasoline inventories fell -3.8 million bbl to a 9-month low, a larger draw than expectations of -1.4 million bbl.\nToday's weekly EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of August 29 were -3.8% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were -1.6% below the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -13.2% below the 5-year seasonal average. US crude oil production in the week ending August 29 fell by -0.1% w/w to 13.423 million bpd, modestly below the record high of 13.631 million bpd posted in the week of 12/6/2024.\nBaker Hughes reported last Friday that the number of active US oil rigs in the week ending August 29 rose by +1 to 412 rigs, just above the 3.75-year low of 410 rigs from August 1. Over the past 2.5 years, the number of US oil rigs has fallen sharply from the 5.25-year high of 627 rigs reported in December 2022.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Wheeler posted about her decision on social media, stating: \"The last weeks of intense outside interest in Opendoor have come at a time when the company needs to stay focused and charging ahead.

(STZ): Things Got Worse Just When You Thought They Couldn’t! Says Jim Cramer\nWe recently published 10 Latest Stocks Jim Cramer Discussed Amidst Market Uncertainty. Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\nWith the year’s third quarter heading to a close, Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) has once again started to feature on Cramer’s morning show. As was the case early in the year, Cramer continues to believe that the firm is struggling in a weak beer market. Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ)’s shares have lost 32% year-to-date on these concerns. The latest dip came in August after the stock sank by 6.6% as the firm cut its fiscal year 2025 earnings per share guidance to $11.30 to $11.60, from an earlier $12.60 to $12.90, and added that beer sales could drop by as much as 4%. Cramer cited Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) as an example of never thinking that things couldn’t get worse:\n“Now I’m going to give you an example of Constellation Brands, STZ. There are a lot of people who thought, how much more negative could they be? Beers bad! Wine and spirits are bad. Hispanic numbers are bad. And then it comes out, and it’s horrendous! So I mean just when you think things couldn’t get worse!”\nHere are the CNBC TV host’s previous comments about Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ):\n“Okay, look, here’s a stock that’s been horrendous, I don’t know if we have a chart. . .oh, look at that. It’s been terrible, right here and I’m not saying they’re wrong. Bank of America goes to a Sell because they think numbers are gonna come down again. So we got to go over this.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of STZ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Following the company's release of second-quarter results, the stock fell as much as 8.5% in the morning session. By 11:30 a.m. ET today, Salesforce had recovered to a 5.7% overnight price drop.\nAnother earnings beat for Salesforce, but wait -- there's more\nWall Street's average analyst had expected second-quarter earnings to rise about 8.6% year over year, landing near $2.78 per share. Revenue was targeted at roughly $10.1 billion, reflecting an 8.7% increase. The enterprise software giant exceeded the consensus analyst targets across the board, posting earnings of $2.91 per share on sales of $10.2 billion.\nLooking ahead, management set full-year guidance targets just above the current analyst projections. So it was a beat-and-raise performance, but the stock still took a tumble.\nWhy investors wanted more from Salesforce's AI moves\nSalesforce investors were probably looking for stronger guidance targets. After all, CEO Marc Benioff recently said that his company is removing roughly half of its customer support staff in favor of artificial intelligence (AI) tools. Specifically, deploying agentic AI systems to support human customer service specialists can deliver top-notch support outcomes at a faster pace and lower cost.\nBut this report highlights how the company isn't exactly laying off that redundant support staff. Instead, the workers are being redeployed into sales and marketing operations, where the human touch makes a bigger difference these days. So, if you were hoping for a large cost-cutting effect from Salesforce's agentic AI moves, the reported financials told a different story.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Salesforce right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Salesforce, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Salesforce wasn’t one of them.

Shafi claimed the company only spent $50,000 a month on marketing and PR to acquire new users, court records show. In reality, IRL spent about $200,000 per month on advertisements to help inflate the number of users and hid that data from potential investors, authorities claim. In 2021, IRL raised $170 million in a Series C funding led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, solidifying its coveted status as a unicorn with a $1.17 billion valuation and landing it among the top 10 most downloaded social media apps on Apple. Now, Shafi faces obstruction of justice, securities fraud, and wire fraud felony charges, along with civil charges from the Securities & Exchange Commission.\nAuthorities allege investors specifically asked Shafi during the Series C process about “user acquisition channels” on the platform. Shafi claimed that IRL was different from other social media apps.\n“This is a free organic channel (users are not incentivize or paid for these invites, and must invite each friend individually with no bulk invites),” an email written by Shafi to an investor excerpted in the indictment states. “Unlike other apps that spend aggressively to acquire new users, we spend very little.”\nMeanwhile, Shafi allegedly concealed IRL’s ad spending by invoicing the expenses to a third party firm, the indictment states.\n“Shafi had spent millions of dollars on paid advertising in the form of incentive advertising, a type of advertising in which users are provided a reward in a third-party app if they download IRL,” the DOJ stated in an announcement. “In the lead up to Series C, Shafi asked his vendor for a ‘big burst’ of ads for ‘a few days’ to drive more installs of the IRL app.”\nSoftBank has since sued Shafi for $150 million and the IRL founders, in turn, have sued their former venture capital investors and board members. In legal filings, Shafi has previously denied wrongdoing.\nA Delaware Chancery Courtmemorandum opinion written by Vice Chancellor Lori W. Will summarized the opposing views of the VCs and the IRL founders: According to Will, Shafi and the other founders claim the VCs “panicked” after the SEC began deposing them as part of an investigation into IRL’s users and “feared reputational damage in Silicon Valley that would impair future investment prospects.” To protect themselves, the founders alleged, the VCs commissioned an outside firm that reported the platform’s users were mostly made up of bots. According to Will’s opinion, the VCs have countered that the entire platform was a “hoax because its users were almost entirely bots.” The VC-designated board members believe that Shafi was “appropriately suspended” for alleged misconduct and that shutting down the company was the only “responsible path for all investors.”\nLawyers for Shafi did not respond to a request for comment. A SoftBank spokesperson declined to comment. Shafi and the other founders have denied the bot allegations.\nAuthorities from DOJ and the SEC allege Shafi first began using “incentive advertising” to juice IRL’s downloads and user base back in 2019. Shafi paid the ad company through a third-party firm so that the expenses wouldn’t appear on IRL’s books, according to an indictment. Shafi hid the payments by including them on IRL’s general ledger as “consulting” fees, it states. By 2020, Shafi had increased his ad spending from $3,000 a day to $5,000 a day with an alleged goal of driving about 12,000 daily app installations on iOS devices and 6,500 on Androids. That year and into 2021, Shafi allegedly began spending hundreds of thousands a month on the ads, still paying through the third party.\nAll told, the SEC claims Shafi spent $5.7 million on ads between 2019 and 2021. However, in his pitch deck to investors, authorities allege Shafi touted that IRL’s growth stemmed from friends inviting other friends. When a prospective investor asked about a spike in users, Shafi claimed it was because of “seasonality around the holidays.” In his talking points with investors, Shafi allegedly listed four marketing vendors, but left out the ad company IRL was paying.\nThe Series C funding round closed and Shafi sold $7.5 million in his own stock options while SoftBank and others invested $170 million. Afterward, IRL hired a chief financial officer who allegedly asked Shafi about IRL’s payments to the third-party firm paying the ad company. In response, the indictment claims Shafi switched gears, allegedly directing someone affiliated with the company to create “false invoices” to make it look like the money spent on the ads was paying for Amazon Web Services, short message service (SMS), and Google Cloud costs.\nMeanwhile, the SEC and the DOJ claim Shafi was using IRL to fund his personal expenses, before and after the Series C. The indictment states Shafi used IRL business credit cards to pay for “luxury hotel stays” in Hawaii for his wedding guests, thousands of dollars for “art classes,” “air purification services,” tens of thousands on a trip to Japan, and hundreds of thousands at high-end luxury clothing and furniture stores. The SEC complaint states Shafi reimbursed IRL about $2.5 million for he and his wife’s personal expenses but didn’t repay others that included “spiritual and alternative medicine” services and various “luxury resort” hotels in Hawaii. Shafi has claimed in legal filings he never hid the practice of using the same credit card for business and personal expenses, and that it dated back to when he founded the company and personally funded it.\nIn 2022, the SEC subpoenaed Shafi and others at IRL about user metrics and vendor payments. In response, IRL launched its own internal investigation, the indictment states.\nAt that point, authorities claim Shafi tried to mask his involvement with the ad spending by allegedly asking the person who created the fake invoices to say he was behind it all and Shafi had no involvement. Shafi also allegedly restored his phone to a “previously saved backup,” which deleted current data and content. Two days later, IRL imaged Shafi’s entire phone as part of its internal investigation. Later, the SEC claims Shafi “falsely denied” in sworn testimony that he wiped his phone after getting the SEC subpoena.\nWill’s summary of the final months at IRL note the SEC investigation prompted lots of back and forth at the startup. The company hired outside counsel and multiple law firms and investigators to respond to the agency’s subpoenas. One outside firm reported the platform was overrun with bots and had few human users, while another found scant bot activity. In April 2023, after the SEC deposed two of the VC-appointed board members, a special board committee allegedly told Shafi to resign or he would be suspended over his use of the IRL credit cards to pay for his personal expenses. Shafi allegedly refused and the board suspended him.\nAfter Shafi’s suspension, IRL user numbers tanked, court records show. By June, the board voted to dissolve the company and distributed $40 million in cash to investors. The lawsuits are ongoing.", "content_hash": "dc38e6892ae9c8768eb37a936ed37649", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

But the outlook for the industry heading into the fall is murky, with the loss of tax incentives, high interest rates, and a gloomy economic landscape weighing on the market.\nBut first, the good news.\nToyota, the world's largest automaker, reported August sales in the US jumped 13.6% to just under 225,367 vehicles. Its top-selling RAV4 crossover led the way with a 20% jump. The trusty Camry sedan also saw a surge of 14%, with both the Camry and RAV4 now fully hybrid.\nToyota's luxury Lexus division also reported double-digit sales gains.\nFord said US sales in August rose 3.9% compared to a year ago to 190,206 vehicles sold. Powering the gains were Ford SUVs, Maverick pickups, and EV sales, the company said.\nThe compact Maverick pickup sales surged 16.4% to 11,956 units sold, making it a record August sales month, Ford said. Ford's SUVs, like the Explorer and Bronco, climbed 9.2% in the month to 73,000 units sold, making it Ford's best August for SUV sales in 22 years.\nNot surprisingly, sales of EVs like Mustang Mach-E (up 35%) and the F-150 Lightning (up 21%) spiked nearly 20% to another record August of 10,671 units sold.\nAutomakers like Ford are raking in EV sales ahead of the expiration of the federal EV tax credit on Sept. 30.\nKia also reported big sales gains with its EVs. Kia said the full-size EV9 hit 2,679 units sold in August, up 54% compared to the prior month. The midsize EV6 and compact Niro EV notched sales gains of 39% and 57%, respectively, month over month. Kia said it was the fourth consecutive month of EV sales gains.\nOverall, Kia US sales jumped 10.4% year over year in August, with the aforementioned EV9 and Kia Sportage SUV having their best sales months ever.\nKia's K5 sedan, Soul SUV, Telluride full-size SUV, and Carnival minivan, among others, all saw sales gains in the month.\n\"Kia delivered another sales milestone by recording more than 83,000 sales in a single month — our best-ever monthly sales result — keeping us firmly on track to achieve our third consecutive annual sales record and our highest ever market share,\" said Kia America vice president Eric Watson in a statement.\nThe company set August sales records for the Elantra N and Elantra hybrid sedans, the Santa Fe hybrid, the Palisade SUV, IONIQ 5 EV, and Santa Fe SUVs.\nHyundai said its electrified vehicles, which include both hybrids and full EVs, accounted for 32% of all its vehicles sold, with its volume IONIQ 5 EV sales surging 60% year over year.\nThese major automakers' wins come as the industry grapples with tariffs and persistently high interest rates. While Ford makes a majority of its vehicles in the US, it builds one of its bestsellers — the Maverick — in Mexico. The company has had to raise prices on the Maverick to adjust for tariff costs, but thus far, consumers are still buying.\nKorea-based Kia and Hyundai, which both build a significant number of vehicles in their home country, are currently paying 25% tariffs to import vehicles into the US. A preliminary deal for 15% tariffs has been agreed to but not finalized.\nThe two brands have localized a good deal of production in the US, having completed their $12.6 billion factory in Georgia earlier this year.\nRounding out the top automakers, Honda actually saw sales dip in August, though a Honda representative notes this was because last August was a rather large one for the Japanese automaker due to the CDK dealer software hack that occurred earlier in the summer. The hack meant depressed sales in June and July that were then pushed into August, artificially boosting that month's total.\nJapanese rivals Mazda (7261.T) and Subaru (FUJHY) did not fare as well in August. Mazda sales were down 7.6% year over year, with Subaru down nearly 3%, as the two Japanese firms are more reliant on imports subject to auto tariffs. Both Mazda and Subaru have raised prices this year due to tariffs.\nA 'challenging' next few months\nCox Automotive reports August's monthly sales pace, or seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR), hit 16 million, a slight decline from July's strong 16.4 million level but a large jump over last year's 15.1 million pace.\nNow, the bad news.\nWhile August overall was a strong month for the industry, the outlook for the rest of the year is likely to be muted.\nCox Automotive projects the surge in EV sales to wrap up in September and the new-vehicle market to slow in the fourth quarter as high prices and tight inventory put a lid on demand.\n\"Sales of EVs will likely fall dramatically when tax credits expire, and market conditions for other vehicles will become more challenging in future months,\" Cox senior economist Charlie Chesbrough said. \"More tariffed products are replacing existing inventory, and prices are expected to be pushed slowly higher, leading to softer sales in the coming months.\"\nWhile the Federal Reserve is expected to cut its benchmark rate by 0.25% later this month, it still won't be enough to pull down auto loan rates, which have been stuck in the high single digits for most loans.\nAdd in a weaker jobs picture in August, with private payrolls shrinking heading into the fall, and the market now has given buyers more reasons to pull back from purchasing big-ticket items like cars.\nAnd let's not forget that those pesky tariffs — pushing up the costs of imported autos — are still with us for the indefinite future.\n\"Shoppers can expect the tariffs to increase car prices by as much as $6,000 on vehicles priced under $40,000. Higher car prices mean higher car taxes, financing, car insurance, and other ownership costs. This price pressure will make cars less affordable for consumers,\" Kelley Blue Book said in a report last month.\nThis story has been updated.\nPras Subramanian is the lead auto reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The cost of Britain’s debt, which typically follows US rates, also dipped in a welcome move for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who is scrambling to balance the books ahead of her autumn Budget.\nUS private sector hiring totalled just 54,000 in August, according to figures from ADP.\nThis was down by nearly half from 106,000 in July and was well below the 75,000 economists had expected.\nADP’s chief economist Nela Richardson said: “The year started with strong job growth, but that momentum has been whipsawed by uncertainty.”\nAt the same time, weekly jobless claims jumped by more than expected, rising from 229,000 to 237,000 in the week to August 30, the highest reading since June, according to separate figures from the Department of Labor.\nThe figures come after data released at the start of August showed such a large slowdown in US jobs that Mr Trump sacked the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, claiming that the numbers were “rigged”.\nThe government’s employment report for August is due on Friday and will be closely watched by Federal Reserve officials ahead of the central bank’s next interest rate decision on September 17.\nFed Chair Jay Powell opened the door to a September cut in a speech last month, when he warned of “an abrupt slowdown in labour force growth” under Mr Trump.\nBefore Thursday’s jobs data, US Treasury yields had been rising after a US court ruling that many of Mr Trump’s trade tariffs were illegal brought new investor fears that tariff revenues would be hit, swelling the US debt pile.\n05:36 PM BST\nSigning off...\nThanks for joining us today as government borrowing costs globally have fallen on hopes that the US will begin cutting interest rates again.\nThat’s all for today, but you can read all our latest economics and business stories here.\n05:33 PM BST\nGilt yields ease on US rate cut hopes\nGilts and other global government bonds eased further this afternoon after yields jumped earlier in the week on concerns over mounting government debt.\nThe UK’s 10-year gilt yields fell to 4.73pc from 4.75pc this morning, while the yield on 30-year gilts dropped to 5.58pc from 5.60pc this morning.\nInvestors are looking to US government jobs data due out tomorrow, and hoping for further cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve.\n“All eyes will be on Friday’s non-farm payrolls report with bad news likely to be interpreted as good news as it will raise the market probability that the Fed cuts rates,” said Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor.\nDavid Morrison, senior market analyst at financial services provider Trade Nation, said the employment data “is likely to play a central role in shaping the direction of equities, currencies and commodities over the coming fortnight”.\n“There are signs that the bond market rout could be over,” said Kathleen Brooks, research director at trading group XTB.\nShe warned that risks still loomed, particularly a confidence vote in France next week that could topple the minority government.\n04:59 PM BST\nFTSE rises as markets shrug off Chinese drop\nWorld stocks were mostly higher today as dovish comments from Federal Reserve officials and a smooth auction of 30-year debt in Japan eased some recent bond market jitters.\nChinese bourses tumbled overnight on reports that Beijing wanted to cool a red-hot stocks rally, especially the tech sector. But the UK and Europe had a much easier day and Wall Street has risen this afternoon.\nThe FTSE 100 closed up 0.4pc, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 finished 0.8pc higher. France’s Cac 40 lost 0.3pc, but Germany’s Dax added 0.8pc. The pan-European Stoxx 600 rose 0.7pc.\nIn New York, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq added about 0.4pc, while the Dow added 0.4pc.\nStocks gained as angst about rising long-term government borrowing costs in the likes of Britain, Germany and the US eased.\n04:48 PM BST\nWall Street rises as pressure eases in bond market\nWall Street is drifting higher this afternoon as traders await an update on the US job market tomorrow that could raise hopes of interest rate cuts.\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.4pc as it clawed back more of its losses since setting a record high last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5pc, and the Nasdaq rose 0.3pc.\nStocks got some lift from easing pressure from the bond market, where US Treasury yields fell following some numbers this week on the job market to come in weaker than economists expected.\n04:13 PM BST\nSticky inflation and strong wage growth means ‘no UK rate cuts’\nThe Bank of England will not cut interest rates until at least February as a result of sticky inflation, a leading firm of economists has said.\nPantheon Macroeconomics points to changing bets in the money market, which no longer forecast another rate cut by December.\nIt blamed “hawkish summer data”.\n“Growth at or above potential, sticky CPI inflation and still-strong wage growth have pushed the market to price our base case for no more rate cuts this year,” it said.\n“The market now sees just a 41pc chance of another rate cut by year-end, down from 75pc the day after the [Monetary Policy Committee’s August meeting]. That seems to be a fair balance of risks: the data say no to another cut, but a tax-hiking Budget poses dovish risks.”\n03:50 PM BST\nTraders increase bets on US interest rate cuts\nMoney markets have increased their confidence in US interest rate cuts this afternoon after further signs that America’s jobs market is slowing.\nThe number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits increased more than expected last week, while hiring by private employers slowed in August.\nWill Compernolle, of FHN Financial, said: “If this momentum continues into upcoming months, firms would soon be shedding workers faster than hiring them to the point of negative job growth.”\nThe US Federal Reserve is charged with setting rates that ensure both full employment and stable prices.\nWall Street is more than fully pricing in two quarter of a percentage point cuts by the end of the year. The central bank currently has a target of 4.25pc to 4.5.pc for its main interest rate.\n03:27 PM BST\nWall Street flat as investors await jobs figures\nWall Street is holding steady this afternoon as the countdown ticks to an update tomorrow on the US job market that could clear the way for the cuts to interest rates.\nThe S&P 500 and Dow Jones are up less than 0.1pc, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is flat.\nUS Treasury yields were also easing in the bond market following other signals on the job market.\nOne report suggested US employers, excluding the government, nearly halved their hiring last month. Another said that more US workers applied for unemployment benefits last week in an indication of rising redundancies.\nA comprehensive report on the job market from the US Labor Department will arrive on Friday, and it will likely carry much weight with the US central bank.\nA slowdown in the job market could push the Federal Reserve to consider cutting its main interest rate for the first time this year at its next meeting in a couple pf weeks. Such cuts can give the economy and job market a kickstart, though they can also push inflation higher.\nUntil now, the Fed has kept rates on hold this year because it’s been more worried about inflation potentially worsening than about the job market.\n02:32 PM BST\nBanks warn Chancellor over tax threat\nThe UK banking industry’s main lobby group has warned Rachel Reeves against a tax raid on the city in her Autumn budget, arguing the move would undermine Labour’s growth agenda.\nDavid Postings, the chief executive of UK Finance, said in a letter to Ms Reeves that increased taxes on Britain’s banks would “risk undermining the sector’s ability to drive growth, innovation, and productivity across the UK economy”.\nHe added such measures “would would run counter to the government’s aim of supporting the financial services sector and make the UK less competitive internationally, potentially driving capital and investment to other jurisdictions”. The letter was first reported by Sky News.\nThe letter added: “Many of our members have recently noted, efforts to boost the UK economy and foster a strong financial services sector would not be consistent with further tax rises on the sector, which already makes a substantial contribution to the public finances.”\nThe Institute of Public Policy Research, a left-leaning think tank, has argued that taxing the cash banks hold at the Bank of England could raise £8bn for the Exchequer.\nShares in Britain’s lenders slumped last week amid concerns No 11 could use a bank tax to help plug the hole in the country’s finances.\n01:57 PM BST\nUS unemployment claims surge as momentum cools\nUS jobless claims hit 237,000 over the past week, up by 8,000 over the previous week, their highest level since June.\nApplications for unemployment insurance came in ahead of expectations, suggesting the US jobs market has continued to cool.\nSeparately, US payroll operator ADP reported that private sector employment had increased by just 54,000 in August - half the number of jobs created in July.\nNela Richardson, chief economist at ADP, said: “The year started with strong job growth, but that momentum has been whipsawed by uncertainty.”\n“A variety of things could explain the hiring slowdown, including labour shortages, skittish consumers, and AI disruptions.”\n12:51 PM BST\nReeves must cut spending to reassure markets, says Deutsche Bank\nRachel Reeves must force through spending cuts in the Government’s Autumn budget to reassure investors and not attempt to tax her way out of the UK’s financial black hole, analysts at Deutsche Bank have warned.\nSanjay Raja, Deutsche Bank’s senior economist, pointed out Labour had so far “pushed through nearly 9x more taxation than spending cuts”. He added that relying on introducing further “tax measures to raise revenues would also push headline inflation higher in the coming year”.\nThe comments come after Labour failed to push through a series of welfare reforms in June after pushback from backbench rebels. The climbdown is expected to cost £3bn and has eaten into the Chancellor’s fiscal headroom.\nMr Raja said a package of spending cuts “would give markets confidence that the Government is taking a more holistic approach to achieving a more efficient public sector - adding some positive sentiment to the gilt market”.\nLast night, Ms Reeves rejected claims of a £50bn black hole in the UK’s finances, a projection made by leading economic researchers, in an interview with the BBC.\nAsked about the prospect of further welfare reforms, Ms Reeves said: “The welfare state should always be there for people who really need it, but we also need to do more to ensure that everyone who can work does work.”\n12:01 PM BST\nAirline shares plunge as holidaymakers cut back\nShares in Britain’s airlines have plunged today as holidaymakers cut back on winter breaks and package holidays amid a gloomy economic outlook.\nBudget airline Jet2 saw its stock slump by as much as 25pc on Thursday, before recovering slightly, as it warned consumers were holding off on plans to catch some winter sun, blaming a “less certain consumer environment”. Jet2 said it had reduced the number of seats on sale for the coming season.\nJet2 was down around 15pc as of midday, while shares in rival easyJet were down 3.3pc and Ireland’s Ryanair was down almost 3pc.\nElsewhere, the FTSE 100’s quarterly reshuffle will see Burberry return to the index after dropping out last year. On the FTSE 250, meanwhile, shares in Currys climbed 17pc as it announced a share buyback programme, defying wider misery among retailers.\nOverall, the FTSE 100 was trading up around 0.2pc at midday and the FTSE 250 was up 0.68pc.\n11:18 AM BST\n‘Self-defeating’ tax rises pushing up borrowing costs\n“Self-defeating” tax rises and persistent inflation are to blame for the recent surge in Britain’s borrowing costs, Rachel Reeves has been warned.\nSimon French, chief economist at Panmure Liberum, said the increase in UK gilts – a benchmark for the cost of servicing the national debt - was creating “angst” around Britain’s fiscal position.\nHe said: “Self-defeating tax increases, asymmetric inflation, and central bank asset sales are all UK factors that have acted to amplify the global grind higher in sovereign interest rates.”\nIt comes after the UK’s long-term borrowing costs surged to a 27-year high this week.\nHe added that there were “acute doubts” about whether the Chancellor could plug the hole in public finances “through any other mechanism than through tax increases”.\nMr French said: “This has been amplified by well-flagged concerns over the upcoming Autumn Budget.”\n10:31 AM BST\nConstruction industry suffers longest downturn since the pandemic\nThe UK’s construction industry is suffering its longest continuous downturn since the pandemic as house building continues to decline.\nConstruction activity in the UK fell for the eight month in a row as the industry suffers from a drop in housing and civil engineering projects. Employment also continued to fall as businesses freeze recruitment.\nThe UK construction PMI for August rose to 45.5, up slightly from 44.3 a month earlier, yet still far below the 50-point mark which separates expansion from contraction.\nIt marks a blow for Labour’s housebuilding targets as a dismal picture for the sector threatens the government’s ambitions of building 1.5m new homes by the end of the parliament.\nBusiness optimism in the sector fell to its lowest level since December 2022.\nTim Moore, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: “Elevated business uncertainty and worries about broader prospects for the UK economy meant that construction sector optimism weakened in August.”\nFigures released by the Office for National Statistics earlier this week revealed that builders started 35,000 new homes in the first three months of 2025, well short of the number required to meet Labour’s house building target.\n09:49 AM BST\nReeves denies Britain is heading for IMF bailout\nRachel Reeves has rejected claims that a massive debt burden and runaway welfare spending will effectively bust Britain.\nThe Chancellor said that claims by senior economists in The Telegraph that the Government could be forced to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were not credible.\nIt came as Ms Reeves confirmed she will unveil her Budget on Nov 26, leaving it as late as possible as she considers how to meet an expected fiscal shortfall of up to £50bn.\n09:35 AM BST\nOil prices slide\nThe price of oil fell this morning as traders predict that OPEC+ is likely to boost supplies. Brent crude, the international benchmark, slid to $66.78 per barrel on Thursday.\nThe OPEC+ alliance is due to meet on Sunday to decide on whether it should boost production.\nThe price of Brent oil has fallen around 10pc this year as OPEC+ rapidly increases supplies in an attempt to boost market share.\nVivek Dhar, an analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said: “With Brent oil futures currently sitting above $65 a barrel, it makes sense that OPEC+ are at least considering boosting production further.”\n08:55 AM BST\nLong-term borrowing costs ease\nBritain’s long-term borrowing costs have edged slightly lower to 5.58pc this morning as nerves in the bond market ease.\nThe interest rate on UK long-term borrowing rose to 5.75pc on Wednesday, before dropping back to close at 5.6pc.\nKathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, said: “There are signs that the bond market rout could be over … Some governments including the UK’s are talking once more about public sector spending cuts, which may boost demand for Gilts in the short term.”\n08:41 AM BST\nGold to reach almost $5,000 if Fed independence damaged, says Goldman Sachs\nGold prices could climb to almost $5,000 an ounce if Donald Trump continues to damage the independence of the US Federal Reserve and investors move holdings from the Treasury market into gold, according to Goldman Sachs.\n“A scenario where Fed independence is damaged would likely lead to higher inflation, lower stock and long-dated bond prices, and an erosion of the dollar’s reserve-currency status,” analysts at the bank said in a note. “In contrast, gold is a store of value that doesn’t rely on institutional trust.”\nEarlier this week the spot gold price hit a record of $3,578 an ounce and has been one of the strongest performing major commodities this year.\nGoldman Sachs has forecast that gold will climb to a baseline of $4,000 an ounce by mid-2026 but could rise to nearly $5,000 if just 1pc of the US treasury market moved to gold.\nThe rise in the price of gold has been powered by central banks increasing their holdings of gold and expectations the Federal Reserve will begin to cut interest rates.\nMr Trump’s threats to the independence of the Fed have also boosted the price of gold. The US President has attempted to sack governor Lisa Cook and repeatedly labelled chairman Jerome Powell a “numbskull”.\n08:16 AM BST\nMarkets open in London\nThe FTSE 100 fell as much as 0.2pc to 9,155.74 in early morning trading today as EasyJet and BT weighed on the blue-chip index. However, the FTSE 250 edged 0.2pc higher to 21,366.61 as the market opened.\nThe fall in the FTSE 100 comes despite a rally overnight on Wall Street which sent shares in tech companies higher.\nThe pound was largely unchanged at $1.34 against the dollar as traders took stock following several days of jitters in the bond market.\nThe pound fell to its lowest level in a month on Tuesday as the currency came under pressure from rising borrowing costs.\n07:53 AM BST\nWhat happened overnight\nGood morning. Thanks for joining me.\nFive things to start the day\n-\nReeves denies Britain is heading for IMF bailout | Chancellor says ‘serious economists’ dispute that 1970s-style debt crisis will happen\n-\nWhy the debt markets are giving the world’s strongmen a boost | The leaders of Russia, China and India met in Beijing with reasons to be cheerful\n-\nRival Heathrow bidder in talks with foreign airports to run new terminal | Operators from Dubai, Dublin and Singapore have expressed interest in the £50bn expansion plan\n-\nM&S hackers claim responsibility for Jaguar Land Rover attack | JLR could be vulnerable to ransom demands after group says it accessed customer data\n-\nUS home ownership falls for first time since 2016 | White House to consider declaring a housing emergency, says US treasury secretary\nWhat happened overnight\nWall Street mostly rose yesterday. The S&P 500 gained 0.5pc, to reach 6,448.26. The tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1pc, to finish at 21,497.73, after a judge ruled that tech giant Google would not be forced to offload its Chrome browser and Android operating system.\nHowever, the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 leading American companies closed down 0.1pc, at 45,271.23.\nIn the bond market, the yield on 10-year US Treasury notes dropped to 4.221pc from 4.287pc on Tuesday night.\nStocks in Asia largely climbed higher on Thursday as an auction of Japanese long term debt helped to ease investors nerves over bond markets.\nAustralian shares rose 1pc, recovering from their biggest one-day sell-off since April. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 gained 1.6pc.", "content_hash": "5b9a267abe621d3fc2377631d805cf18", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

On August 20, UBS reduced the price target on the company’s stock to $40 from $42, while keeping a “Neutral” rating, as reported by The Fly. The analyst noted the continuous headwinds, which are impacting the upside potential. On the positive side, Range Resources Corporation (NYSE:RRC) saw efficiency gains and consistent well performance in Q2 2025, which helped in driving healthy FCF and building operational momentum. Its financial results helped $74 million in share repurchases and dividends, while reducing the net debt to $1.2 billion.\nIts GAAP revenues and other income for Q2 2025 came in at $856 million, while GAAP net cash provided from operating activities stood at $336 million. Range Resources Corporation (NYSE:RRC) remains well-positioned to benefit while in-basin demand opportunities materialize along with a global call on natural gas. The company remains one of the few producers in Appalachia possessing enough high-quality inventory to help the required growth in baseload supply.

The vessel is scheduled to dock on October 1 at the Port of Rimouski.\nThe shipment marks the second installment of wind-powered shipment via TOWT by Café William. For the Sherbrooke, Quebec–based roaster, the voyage is part of a broader effort to reduce the carbon footprint of coffee production.\n“This is more than just our second voyage; it’s a powerful demonstration of our long-term commitment,” said Rémi Tremblay, president and CEO of Café William, in a release. “Talking about commitments isn’t enough. You have to live them, repeat them, and keep strengthening them.”\nCafé William is one of Canada’s largest importers of organic and Fair Trade-certified coffee, sourcing beans from farms where workers are paid fairly and growing practices avoid synthetic pesticides.\nFor convenience services providers, sourcing coffee with a reduced carbon footprint and Fair Trade certification may appeal to workplaces looking to align breakroom offerings with corporate sustainability goals.", "content_hash": "1168f2955e60c4b7b72a4f0d50776f8e", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}
