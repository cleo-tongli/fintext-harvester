(TSX:ETG; OTCQB:ERLFF – the “Company” or “Entrée”) has today filed its interim financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025. All numbers are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.
Q2 2025 HIGHLIGHTS
Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi Joint Venture Mining Licences
-
The Joint Venture Agreement between the Company and Oyu Tolgoi LLC (“OTLLC”), with an effective date of June 30, 2008, as amended on February 3, 2025 (the “Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JVA”), requires OTLLC, as Manager, to hold title to the Shivee Tolgoi and Javkhlant mining licences (the “Licences”) on behalf of the joint venture (“Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV”) participants.
-
In February 2025, OTLLC and Entrée’s wholly owned subsidiary Entrée LLC duly executed and lodged License Transfer Agreements (the “License Transfer Agreements”) and supporting documentation with the Mongolian tax authority (the “MTA”) for the assessment of tax on the transfer of the Licences in accordance with applicable laws of Mongolia. The calculations of the values of the Licences for corporate income tax purposes must be confirmed by the MTA and taxes assessed and paid before the documentation necessary to affect the transfer of the Licences may be submitted to the Mineral Resources and Petroleum Authority of Mongolia (“MRPAM”) for registration.
-
During the second quarter 2025, the Company and OTLLC actively engaged with the MTA and provided all materials necessary for the MTA to confirm the calculations of the values of the Licences in accordance with applicable laws of Mongolia. On August 1, 2025, Entrée LLC filed a claim with the Administrative Court of Mongolia seeking an order for the MTA to review and provide confirmation of the calculations of the values of the Licences. See “Outlook and Strategy” below.
State Interest in Area of Licences
-
On April 9, 2025, the Government of Mongolia adopted Resolution No. 170, which establishes the boundaries of certain mineral deposits of strategic importance, including the Oyu Tolgoi group of deposits (the “Oyu Tolgoi Strategic Deposit”). The Licences are included in the boundaries of the Oyu Tolgoi Strategic Deposit. The Minister of Industry and Mineral Resources is assigned to oversee the implementation of Resolution No. 170.
-
The State already holds 34% of the economic benefit that OTLLC derives from its 80% contractual interest in the area of the Licences by virtue of Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi LLC’s shareholding in OTLLC and the 2009 Oyu Tolgoi Investment Agreement (the “OTIA”). The Company has consistently maintained its willingness to fulfil any obligation under Mongolian law to provide the State 34% of the economic benefit that the Company derives from its 20% contractual interest in the area of the Licences. During the second quarter 2025, the Company continued its efforts to engage with representatives of the Government of Mongolia and Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi LLC (“EOT”) to resolve issues around the State’s interest. See “Outlook and Strategy” below.
Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property Update
-
First Oyu Tolgoi Lift 1 Panel 1 underground development work on the Shivee Tolgoi mining licence area waste zone commenced in October 2024 in the southwest corner of the Hugo North Extension (“HNE”) deposit in rock classified as waste. As at May 30, 2025, ~230 equivalent metres of lateral development primarily on the return air level had been completed by OTLLC.
-
On June 6, 2025, the Company, OTLLC, and Rio Tinto separately announced a pause in Oyu Tolgoi Lift 1 Panel 1 underground development work on the Shivee Tolgoi mining licence area. Under the 2025 Oyu Tolgoi Mine Plan approved by MRPAM, work in the HNE deposit footprint had been conditionally scheduled to commence in June 2025. Development work in the ore zone cannot proceed until transfer of the Licences from Entrée LLC to OTLLC has been completed.
-
In the second quarter 2025, the final hole of the 2024 HNE in-fill diamond drilling program was completed. The 2024 program comprises a total of 5,340.70 metres of drilling in 10 surface holes, and 6,566.88 metres of drilling on the Shivee Tolgoi mining licence in 27 underground holes. The 2024 drilling program will support the Lift 2 Panel 1 Pre-Feasibility Study and the updated resource model for Hugo North (including HNE), which will include Lift 2 mineralization.
-
For 2025, the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Management Committee approved an in-fill diamond drilling program at HNE comprised of ~8,329 metres of drilling on the Shivee Tolgoi mining licence in 19 underground holes and ~9,050 metres of drilling in 5 surface holes. As at June 30, 2025, 965 metres of drilling on the Shivee Tolgoi mining licence in 5 underground holes had been completed, with 2 of the underground holes still in progress. In addition, 1,728 metres of drilling in 2 surface holes had been completed, with both surface holes still in progress. The 2025 drilling program is intended to focus on gaps in the geological model.
-
Regional exploration programs on the area of the Licences commenced in the second quarter 2025.
-
In the second quarter 2025, the Company continued to announce new analytical results from deposit and regional diamond drilling programs conducted by OTLLC between 2022 and 2024. See the Company’s press release dated May 14, 2025, available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca, OTC Markets at www.otcmarkets.com and on the Company’s website at www.EntreeResourcesLtd.com. Additional results will be reported by the Company as they become available from OTLLC.
Oyu Tolgoi Underground Development Update
The Oyu Tolgoi project in Mongolia includes the Oyu Tolgoi mining licence, which is 100% owned and held by OTLLC and the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV property (the “Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property”), which is a joint venture between Entrée and OTLLC. Rio Tinto International Holdings Ltd. (“Rio Tinto”) owns 66% of OTLLC and is the manager of operations at Oyu Tolgoi. On July 16, 2025, Rio Tinto announced the second quarter 2025 was a record quarter for Oyu Tolgoi copper production as it ramps up to become the world’s fourth largest copper mine before the end of the decade. Refer to Rio Tinto’s press release dated July 16, 2025, titled “Rio Tinto releases second quarter 2025 production results” available on its website at www.riotinto.com for further details.
-
The second quarter 2025 was a record quarter for copper production, due to the continued underground ramp-up with improving head grade and recovery rates.
-
New material handling records were set achieving a monthly average in June of 34 ktpd and a single day record high of 47 ktpd for the underground mine.
-
Year-on-year, the project saw rising contribution from the higher-grade underground mine, with Panel 0 construction on the Oyu Tolgoi mining licence complete and the conveyor to surface - the second largest in the world by capacity - becoming operational between these periods.
-
Rio Tinto noted engagement continues with the Company and the Government of Mongolia on the transfer of the Licences to allow mining in the Panel 1 Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV area. The underground mine plan offers flexibility in terms of panel sequencing depending on the timing of the transfer of the Licences.
-
Project ramp-up remains on track to reach an average of ~500 thousand tonnes of copper per year (100% basis and stated as recoverable metal) from 2028 to 2036.
-
The filtration and thickener facilities for the concentrator conversion have commenced load-commissioning. Ball Mill construction is complete, and load commissioning is forecast to be completed in the third quarter 2025.
-
Construction of primary crusher 2 is progressing to plan and remains on track to be completed during the fourth quarter 2025.
Corporate
-
For the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2025, the Company’s operating loss was $0.6 million and $1.3 million, respectively, compared to $0.9 million and $2.0 million for the comparative periods in 2024. The decrease was due to higher legal costs in 2024 for both commercial negotiations with OTLLC and Rio Tinto and the arbitration proceedings.
-
For the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2025, the operating cash outflow before changes in non-cash working capital items was $0.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively, compared to $0.9 million and $1.9 million in the comparative periods in 2024.
-
As at June 30, 2025, the cash balance was $5.7 million and the working capital balance was $5.6 million.
-
On January 24, 2025, the Company closed a non-brokered private placement issuing 2,577,700 units at a price of C$2.21 per unit for aggregate gross proceeds of C$5.7 million ($4.0 million).
OUTLOOK AND STRATEGY
Arbitration Award and Transfer of Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Licences
On December 19, 2024, a partial final award (the “Award”) was made by the three-member international arbitration Tribunal appointed in connection with the Company’s binding arbitration proceedings against OTLLC and Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. (together, the “Respondents”). The Tribunal ruled in favor of the Company on all issues and dismissed the Respondents’ counterclaims.
A principal objective of the Company is to affect the transfer of the Licences from the Company’s Mongolian subsidiary Entrée LLC to OTLLC in accordance with applicable laws of Mongolia as the next step in the implementation of the Award. Under the terms of the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JVA, the Manager (OTLLC) is required to hold all assets, including the Licences, on behalf of the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV participants. Transfer of the Licences to OTLLC, as Manager and owner of an 80% or 70% (depending on the depth of mineralization) participating interest in the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property, is necessary to maximize operational efficiencies, provide certainty with respect to taxes and royalties, and minimize delays to Lift 1 Panel 1 lateral development work on the Shivee Tolgoi mining licence area.
In February 2025, License Transfer Agreements were executed by Entrée LLC and OTLLC to govern the transfer of the Licences. The parties jointly lodged the License Transfer Agreements and supporting documentation with the MTA for the assessment of tax on the transfer of the Licences.
Corporate income tax at a rate of 10% of the value of the Licences (with certain deductions allowed) will be assessed. The methodology to calculate the value of the Licences for corporate income tax purposes is set out in Decree No. 302 passed by the Minister of Finance on December 31, 2019 (the “Methodology”). The calculations must be confirmed by the MTA and taxes assessed and paid before the documentation necessary to affect the transfer of the Licences may be submitted to MRPAM for registration. As part of the Award, the Tribunal issued a final and binding declaration that all fees and taxes assessed on the transfer of the Licences pursuant to applicable laws of Mongolia will be for the account of the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV, with OTLLC contributing the Company’s 20% share as a Loan under Section 10.1 of the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JVA.
The Company and OTLLC have been actively engaged with the MTA and have provided all materials necessary for the MTA to confirm the calculations of the values of the Licences in accordance with the Methodology. No confirmation has been received from the MTA within the timeframe prescribed by law. On May 19, 2025, Entrée LLC lodged a formal complaint with the MTA. On July 3, 2025, the MTA advised Entrée LLC in writing it cannot confirm the calculations of the values of the Licences and provide a tax payment certificate until the percentage of State ownership is determined.
On August 1, 2025, Entrée LLC filed a claim with the Administrative Court of Mongolia seeking an order for the MTA to review and provide confirmation of the calculations of the values of the Licences in accordance with applicable laws of Mongolia.
Failure to complete the transfer of the Licences to OTLLC in a timely fashion will result in delays, which may be significant, to Oyu Tolgoi Lift 1 Panel 1 lateral development work on the Shivee Tolgoi mining licence area. Such delays could have an adverse effect on development costs and schedule, the business, assets, future cash flow, and financial condition of the Company, and the Company’s share price.
State Ownership
The Company is also focused on the resolution of outstanding issues regarding the State’s interest in the Oyu Tolgoi Strategic Deposit. The Minerals Law of Mongolia provides the State may be an up to 34% equity participant with any private legal entity in the exploitation of a mineral deposit of strategic importance (a “Strategic Deposit”) where proven reserves were determined through funding sources other than the State budget. The Parliament of Mongolia may determine that the State receive royalty payments in lieu of an equity interest.
On April 9, 2025, the Government of Mongolia adopted Resolution No. 170, which establishes the boundaries of certain Strategic Deposits, including the Oyu Tolgoi Strategic Deposit. The Licences are included in the boundaries of the Oyu Tolgoi Strategic Deposit. The Minister of Industry and Mineral Resources is assigned to oversee the implementation of Resolution No. 170.
The State already holds 34% of the economic benefit that OTLLC derives from its 80% contractual interest in the area of the Licences by virtue of EOT’s shareholding in OTLLC and the OTIA. The Company has consistently maintained its willingness to fulfil any obligation under Mongolian law to provide the State 34% of the economic benefit that the Company derives from its 20% contractual interest in the area of the Licences.
The Company has been actively attempting to engage with representatives of the Government of Mongolia and EOT to resolve issues around the State’s interest. On June 11, 2025, a new Prime Minister of Mongolia was appointed and on June 18, 2025, a new Cabinet was appointed.
On July 2, 2025, the Parliament of Mongolia approved a resolution to establish a Temporary Oversight Committee, to be chaired by O. Batnairamdal, to conduct a special investigation related to the protection of Mongolia’s interests and the enhancement of benefits derived from the exploitation of the Oyu Tolgoi Strategic Deposit. The scope of the special investigation includes reviewing the determination and valuation of the resources within the area of the Licences and assessing the basis for determining the percentage of State ownership.
The Company is also aware a resolution was approved by the Government of Mongolia at a July 23, 2025 Cabinet meeting, instructing relevant government members to conduct negotiations with foreign investors from certain companies including Entrée LLC. These negotiations are to be carried out within the framework of the Constitution of Mongolia, international treaties, and applicable laws and regulations. The goal is to finalize draft agreements, develop relevant proposals and conclusions, and present the finalized versions to the Cabinet meeting.
The Company is currently seeking to understand the engagement process and will update the market in due course. To date, no formal notice or communication has been received by the Company or Entrée LLC with respect to Resolution No. 170, the Temporary Oversight Committee, or the July 23, 2025 resolution instructing relevant government members to conduct negotiations.
If the Company is unable to resolve issues regarding the State’s interest in a timely fashion or in a manner that is acceptable to the Company, it could have an adverse effect on the business, assets, future cash flow, and financial condition of the Company, and the Company’s share price.
Potential Conversion of Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JVA
Notwithstanding the formal execution of the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JVA that governs development work and mining on the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property, the Company and OTLLC remain committed to working towards the potential conversion of the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JVA into a more effective agreement of equivalent economic value. The agreement would include a mechanism for the Company to fulfil any obligation under Mongolian law to provide the State 34% of the economic benefit that the Company derives from the area of the Licences. Conversion of the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JVA would be subject to Toronto Stock Exchange acceptance and the requirements of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 – Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions applicable to a related party transaction.

He went over five stocks new investors should consider buying — and when to sell others – as the S & P 500 trades near record highs. Apple: This stock has had a big rally following the company's announcement last week of an additional $100 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing. It just goes to show: Don't give up on Apple. The next major test will come if a U.S. judge in Alphabet's antitrust case ends its search exclusivity deal with the iPhone maker. If that happens, Apple management will have to come up with a plan to offset the $20 billion worth of annual payments from Alphabet. We remain confident and maintain our ""hold, don't trade"" thesis on the stock. Amazon: The company's cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services, isn't growing as fast as hoped. That was seen in second-quarter earnings late last month. Still, we're staying long on the stock. AWS is a huge business, and demand for cloud infrastructure is incredibly high. Abbott Laboratories: We've been selling down the position on the belief that Abbott just doesn't have the same oomph that it used to. Its recent earnings report suggested the headwinds in China could be more prolonged than previously thought. Jim said if it fell much further, we'd consider rebuilding the position. Broadcom: This company is one of the linchpins of the AI trade thanks to its custom chips and networking equipment. The scale of the AI buildout is so immense that, despite all the negatives, we just have to plow through and the stay the course. We did trim our Broadcom position for a big gain on Aug. 6, to not be greedy. BlackRock: The financial stock is well positioned for more upside as the broader equities market continues to trade near record highs. That's because BlackRock shares typically work best in a portfolio when assets are growing from appreciation and contributions. Bristol Myers Squibb: Could the rise in M & A activity and a more hands-off approach from antitrust regulators put Bristol Myers in play? Jim says it's possible, though not certain. A forthcoming trial on its new schizophrenia drug Cobenfy could help quell some concerns about its commercial potential that arose after prior results fell short of investor expectations. Capital One: If the U.S. economy goes south, Capital One could get hit because it's heavily levered to the health of the consumer. So far, however, there are no serious warning signs that could impact credit quality. Additionally, we continue to celebrate Capital One's recently-completed blockbuster acquisition of Discover Financial. Costco: This is a great stock to own during macroeconomic uncertainty, as the wholesale retailer attracts value-conscious customers. ""When times get tough, people go to Costco,"" Jim said. Investors should consider buying more. Salesforce: The idea that ""AI is eating software"" has won over Wall Street, and the argument has its merits, as we explored earlier this week . We accordingly downgraded our rating on Salesforce. But we're not ready to bail altogether. We want to see the latest revenue contributions from Agentforce in its upcoming earnings report, and its big annual Dreamforce conference this fall has historically been a positive catalyst. CrowdStrike: Investors should consider buying CrowdStrike as shares tumble due to a broad slump in the cybersecurity sector. The stock's move lower, however, has nothing to do with the company's fundamentals. That's why it's a solid time to capitalize on the dip. Cisco Systems: This is our newest addition to the Club's portfolio, which we initiated on July 17. The computer networking equipment powerhouse has a big opportunity to benefit from AI. Plus, the firm has a strong track record of returning capital to shareholders. Cisco posted a top and bottom line beat Wednesday evening. The company, however, missed revenue estimates for its security segment, which sent shares lower. It didn't change our thesis on the stock though. Coterra Energy: This stock has become a cruise to nowhere, and we opted to exit the rest of our small remaining position. It's a tough market for the underlying commodities that Coterra depends on for revenue, and operational issues caught us by surprise too. DuPont: Shares are in a lull ahead of DuPont's forthcoming breakup, experiencing what many on Wall Street call ""spin purgatory."" Although we don't know with certainty when the stock will pick up again, it will happen in a span of days, rather than weeks or months. That means investors should buy DuPont stock again anytime it dips lower ahead of the split. Danaher: We're holding this lagging stock as we await more clarity on potential catalysts. The company could spring back to life if an IPO window opens for biotech, which could boost orders for Danaher. That being said, Danaher's increased focus on life sciences has made the firm lose some of its optionality. Disney: New to the Club? Disney is one to buy. Theme parks are strong, movies are very good and streaming is fine. Nothing is great enough to lift the stock to the $130s. But it most certainly belongs in the $120s. Dover: It's been a lackluster 2025 for Dover, with shares down 4.5% year to date. But more aggressive portfolio management could be a way to improve investor sentiment. By divesting one of its far-flung businesses, management could unlock more value. Eaton: This stock's performance has been nowhere near impressive as of late, but members should stick with Eaton. The industrial conglomerate has decent exposure to secular growth themes with its aerospace and data center businesses. Jim, however, wishes management would split the company in two because it's more difficult for them to create value together. GE Vernova: This power equipment maker has a huge growth opportunity as the data center build out continues to raise demand for offerings like gas turbines. ""Here's a stock that almost seems to be invented for this moment,"" Jim said of GE Vernova. He isn't happy, however, that management has been resistant to adding production capacity for its turbines. Goldman Sachs: This might be ""one of the cheapest stocks"" the Club owns, Jim said. That's because shares will be worth much more as Wall Street dealmaking picks up. More IPOs and M & A deals can lead to an upside to revenue for Goldman's highly lucrative investment banking business. Home Depot: With rates still high, this retailer has had a lackluster stock performance. That being said, Home Depot is the ideal stock to own during an interest-rate-cutting cycle. Lower borrowing costs should cause a much-needed rebound in the housing market, which means more business for Home Depot. Honeywell International: Yet again, Jim pounded the table on Honeywell's spinoff into three public companies. ""The three pieces could be worth dramatically more than the stock is selling for,"" he said. ""My conviction is very high for this."" Let's hope it helps its share price, too. Honeywell stock has underperformed the market in 2025, down nearly 3% year to date versus the S & P 500's 9.7% gain. Linde: Jim described Linde as the ""perfect industrial."" The company continues to thrive in various macro backdrops, as seen in its many consecutive beat-and-raise quarters. Plus, Linde's immense pricing power makes us love the stock even more. Eli Lilly: We double upgraded Lilly on Wednesday after a great sign of confidence from management and the board of directors in buying up a bunch of stock in the open market. While it's usually not our style to adjust the rating so soon after we downgraded it, when the facts change, we must change with them. Meta Platforms: Buy this stock on its next dip. Meta shares could run higher if management effectively monetizes WhatsApp. The social media behemoth has made recent strides to turn WhatsApp into a moneymaker by rolling out advertisements back in June. Meta clearly has the toolbox to make another great ads business. Just look at the reach of the company's platforms like Instagram and Facebook. Microsoft: We recommend members buy shares on any weakness. The firm had a picture perfect quarterly earning report in late July, fueled by accelerated revenue growth in its cloud computing business. This put to bed any question of Microsoft's leadership in generative AI. Nvidia: The company reports on Aug. 27, and this quarter at least will hinge on how well they're meeting demand for Blackwell chips rather than its China business. As with Broadcom, the size of the AI buildout and the money that will flow to Nvidia makes the stock a must-own. Palo Alto Networks: Shares have been weighed down by weakness in cyber, along with concerns about management's intent to acquire CyberArk. The market's reaction is overblown though. ""I feel very good about this situation,"" Jim said of Palo Alto. Starbucks: This is Jim's favorite consumer-facing stock we own right now. Patience is required on the turnaround, led by CEO Brian Niccol, because when things really get better, it will be too late to buy. TJX Companies: There's nothing to do with TJX ahead of earnings next week. After a two-month downtrend, the stock has climbed back up into the low-to-mid $130s. We were right to stay the course despite those worrying about a technical breakdown. Texas Roadhouse: Investors should ""buy this one aggressively,"" Jim said. Although elevated beef prices weighed on profitability in the second quarter, the restaurant chain has great revenue growth and has executed well on what it can control. Plus, there's no telling when we'll see Texas Roadhouse stock this low again following its earnings-induced selloff last week. Wells Fargo: This bank stock is undervalued. Jim said he'd buy some now if the portfolio didn't own any. He forecasted that shares could rally past its record highs, and still not be too expensive. Plus, Wells has a decent chance to grab more M & A deals moving forward now that its $1.95 trillion asset cap has been removed.

Ralph Spielman, who retired in 2016 from a career as a corporate travel administrator and lives with his wife in New York City, calls retirement “terrifying.” Anxiety about running out of money in retirement “was always a worry and still a worry,” Spielman said. “Worry is probably spending a lot more time in my brain than it really should.”
Spielman said he is anxious “all the time” about the money he and his wife spend in retirement, often asking himself: “What kind of curve are we going to be thrown?”
This anxiety has been peaking for people a few years away from retirement age who are worried about a paucity of savings, and staying high in the first years of retirement amid fears that spending too much will cause them to run out of money, Kerry Sette, head of Consumer Insights & Research at Voya Financial, said.
That’s a reasonable concern; a 2024 Morningstar study predicted that 45% of Americans will run out of money in retirement. Data from the Alliance for Retirement Income reveals that 54% of baby boomers and Generation X (combined) are fearful about outliving their savings, up from 48% last year, and a Vanguard study said the average 401(k) balance for Americans aged 55 to 64 is only $271,000.
Research also shows, however, that some retirees are overly cautious about spending money in retirement and can afford to spend a little more freely. “I’ve been told by our advisers that a number of their well-to-do clients struggle to spend money in retirement out of fear they’ll spend too much. They don’t end up with the retirement they would’ve liked to have had,” said Craig Hawley, president of Nationwide Annuity.
But as Fritz Gilbert, author of “Keys to a Successful Retirement,” wrote on his Retirement Manifesto blog: “It doesn’t do us any good to be the richest corpse in the graveyard.”
Consider these survey results:
“If you think about it, we’ve had a market crash, the highest inflation in 40 years, supply-chain issues, geopolitics, higher interest rates, hurricanes and wildfires. It’s having a cumulative effect. And in the 50-plus segment, everyone’s just kind of waiting for the rug to be pulled out from under them. The net result is financial anxiety,” said Sette.
“Anxiety makes it very hard to plan for retirement,” said Jason Fichtner, executive director of the Alliance for Retirement Income’s Retirement Income Institute. This nervousness, Fichtner added, is causing some people in their early 60s to claim Social Security rather than wait, even though delaying would deliver larger monthly benefits.
More workers are relying on their own savings
“A lot more is being asked of the generations moving into retirement,” said Hawley.
Their parents and grandparents often had generous pensions delivering guaranteed lifetime income. But some boomers (who are ages 61 to 79) and many Gen X-ers (ages 45 to 60) enter retirement with little or no pension income, relying primarily on their own savings for today’s longer lives.
“Gen X-ers are completely depending on their own savings,” said Jean Chatzky, host of the HerMoney podcast and an education fellow with the Alliance for Lifetime Income. “I think that engenders even greater fear.”
Some Americans in their 50s and 60s are also shouldering caregiving costs for parents or spouses, plus financial support for their adult children.
Many worry they’ll incur sizable health and long-term-care expenses themselves. Fidelity estimates that a 65-year-old retiring in 2025 can expect to spend $172,500, on average, on health costs in retirement. And “savings can quickly be wiped out when long-term care needs arise,” said Natalie Kean, Justice in Aging’s director of federal health advocacy, at a recent Alliance for Health Policy conference in Washington, D.C.
“I think all those things collide and result in the anxiety we’re seeing, and how people may be having to rethink what their golden years will look like,” said Hawley.
Debra Wallace, a widowed freelance writer and publicist in Huntingdon Valley, Pa., with a teenage son, is spooked about retirement.
“Things are tight,” said Wallace, who has no 401(k) and calls her earnings modest. “I don’t know if retirement is in my future.”
In the coming years, Wallace expects to sell her house and downsize to a smaller home while scratching out a living. “It’s not a great plan for retirement,” she said.
Freelance writing, she noted, doesn’t bring in nearly what it once did. “Print magazines used to pay $1, $1.50 or $2 a word; some people even got $3 a word. Today, if you’re lucky, digital pays 50 cents a word,” said Wallace.
Tackle the worry
There are a number of ways to lessen financial anxiety, whether you are nearing leaving your full-time job or in the throes of retirement, which could relieve worries.
If you’re not yet retired, here’s what experts suggest:
Get a financial adviser or meet with the one you have. Only 40% of the 55-to-65-year-olds that Nationwide surveyed work with an adviser.
“You don’t have to hire an adviser to manage your money. You could hire one for a flat fee just to do a checkup,” said Fichtner.
Use an online financial calculator to estimate your cost of living in retirement. The big financial services companies have free retirement calculators to help.
“Many people have never run the numbers on how much it’s actually going to cost them to live in retirement,” said Chatzky. “If you’re not on track to get where you want to be, now is the time to make changes like downsizing or shifting your lifestyle to funnel more into retirement accounts and reset the clock on how long you’re going to work.”
Consider purchasing an insurance-company annuity for guaranteed monthly income. Studies have shown that retirees tend to give themselves more freedom to spend money from an annuity than by tapping their savings.
You could buy an annuity paying the same amount for the rest of your life. Or a bridge annuity providing monthly income just until you claim Social Security. Or a deferred annuity that will begin providing income at age 80 or so, when you might need it for long-term care or health expenses.
Look for an online support group of others planning to retire. Stephen Anderson, a retired emergency-medicine physician who splits his time between central Washington and Florida, runs the Exploring Retirement section of the American College of Emergency Physicians site. It’s for retired doctors and “for people who haven’t retired but want to know how to plan before they do.”
If you’re already retired, it’s understandable to be nervous about spending money.
“Unless you hit the lottery, the question of paying for extra expenses in retirement is always going to be on your mind,” said Anderson.
To alleviate spending fears, you may want to follow this advice:
Remember that Social Security benefits provide something of an inflation hedge. They have built-in, annual cost-of-living adjustments or COLAs. The 2025 COLA is 2.5%; inflation is currently running at 2.7%, slightly higher than the rate this spring.
Determine your safe withdrawal rate — the percentage of your retirement savings you can afford to withdraw annually. For decades, financial advisers have recommended a 4% withdrawal rate (its creator recently raised this guideline). But to feel safe, you might want to be more conservative with a slightly lower rate.
Gilbert and his wife currently use a 3.25% withdrawal rate. At the end of each year, they recalculate the rate based on the size of their retirement portfolio and how the stock market performed.
“I’m pretty confident we’ll be OK, but it’s been a work in progress to teach myself the freedom to spend,” said Gilbert, who retired seven years ago at age 55.
A sophisticated retirement calculator can let you track expenses to determine a safe withdrawal rate from your savings. For example, the Boldin retirement site’s PlannerPlus software ($144 a year) does this and lets you plug in what-if scenarios to see what a comfortable withdrawal rate would be if you cut expenses.
If you’re worried that potential long-term-care costs could sharply raise your expenses, Gilbert advised, estimate what they might cost and subtract that number from your net worth to calculate your safe withdrawal rate.
“The average long-term-care stay is three years, so if you think your cost might be $7,000 a month, you’d subtract $200,000 from your net worth to get your withdrawal rate,” he explained. “You can make the math work for you to address some of your anxieties.”
Automate your spending and give yourself a spending free pass, Gilbert advised. He automatically has an amount equal to his safe withdrawal rate transferred each month from his savings account to checking. “If I don’t spend the money and it keeps growing, toward the end of the year, I’ll spend it,” Gilbert said.
He and his wife also allow themselves the freedom to spend up to $100 on anything they want, worry-free. “Those smaller purchases — maybe it’s $50 for you or $25 — give you a level to just buy something without getting anxious about it,” Gilbert said.
Ignore the financial headlines. That’s especially important if the market drops during your retirement.
Anderson learned this when stocks tanked in 2022 shortly after he retired. “What several years has taught me, and my financial planner told me, is not to get overly nervous about what happens month to month in the stock market,” he said.
Gilbert agrees. “I don’t worry about whether the market’s not doing well, whether the headlines are screaming bear or bull,” he said. “You can’t live by the headlines and get all anxious. You’ve just got to develop a plan, know you’ve got a safe withdrawal rate, and ignore the noise.”",cec00cbbe4daae72deceff1e3cdc2ad0,trafilatura,9806,0

Here what could happen to future benefits,Social Security turns 90 . Here what could happen to future benefits,2025-08-14 21:00:00+00:00,gdelt_cnbc_com,cnbc.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Ninety years ago, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act, which created the program that now sends monthly benefit checks to millions of Americans, including retirees, disabled individuals and families.
But by the time the program celebrates its centennial, benefits may not look the same as today's Social Security payments.
The reason: Social Security's trust funds, which the program relies on to help pay benefits, are facing a looming shortfall.
Starting in 2033 — two years before its 100th anniversary — the program may only be able to pay 77% of scheduled benefits for retirees, their families and survivors, Social Security's trustees projected in an annual report released in June.
However, should those funds be combined with Social Security's trust fund for disability benefits, as has happened in prior emergencies, payments may be cut one year later, in 2034. At that point, 81% of scheduled benefits would be payable, Social Security's trustees project.
Importantly, Social Security benefits would not disappear entirely. The program would still have ongoing income from payroll taxes to help fund benefit payments.
That scenario is not inevitable. Changes to the program may be enacted sooner to shore up its funding and prevent sudden benefit cuts.
Most, 83%, of surveyed Americans think Social Security reform should be a top priority for Congress, even if it means benefit cuts or tax increases for future beneficiaries, according to a new poll from the Bipartisan Policy Center's American Savings Education Council. The group polled more than 4,000 adults.
""This is the time for action,"" said Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, who is among the lawmakers pitching a plan to help restore the program's solvency, told CNBC.com.
Pitch for a new $1.5 trillion investment fund
Cassidy has teamed up with Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia., to co-lead a bipartisan pitch — the centerpiece of which is a new $1.5 trillion investment fund for Social Security, separate from Social Security's current trust funds.
The initial $1.5 trillion outlay would be borrowed. Because the money would be held in escrow and could be liquified, it would not increase the national debt, Cassidy said.
The funds would be invested more aggressively than Social Security's current trust funds, which are invested in U.S. Treasury securities. Because those investments are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, they are secure. However, the average rate of return over a one-year period was around 2.5% in 2024.
In contrast, the S&P 500 has returned an annual average of around 10%, though those results vary from year to year.
Investing the proposed separate investment fund in stocks, bonds and other investments could cover an estimated 70% of Social Security's trust fund shortfall, Cassidy said. That would make it much more doable for lawmakers to address the remaining 30%, he said.
The senators' plan does not include any benefit cuts or tax increases for seniors, Cassidy said. It would provide benefit increases for two cohorts — beneficiaries age 80 and older who are at less than 200% of the federal poverty level, and low earners who have a long work history earning low wages.
Lawmakers could consider increasing the size of the investment fund to help cover the rest of the shortfall, he said.
Rights to manage the fund would be left to a bidding process, which could result in lower fees and higher returns, Cassidy said.
Critics, including Rep. John Larson, D-Conn., have said investing in other securities as the senators' plan suggests would privatize Social Security and therefore threaten Americans' retirement security.
In response, Cassidy points to the federal Railroad Retirement system, which in 2001 moved from investing solely in government bonds to more aggressive instruments, including stocks. That change was approved by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and has helped the program operate with a positive balance today.
Still, some experts are dubious.
In a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, Andrew Biggs, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said while he applauded the first bipartisan plan to fix Social Security in two decades, he questions whether the plan could work.
Among the concerns he details are the amount of money that the plan requires the government to borrow, as well as the increased investment risk that would be required without a guarantee of higher returns.
Another proposal calls for the wealthy to pay more
Cassidy and Kaine are not the only lawmakers looking at potential solutions to solve Social Security's dilemma.
Larson has a plan that has been reintroduced in multiple sessions of Congress that would provide benefit increases while increasing taxes on the wealthy. The last time Social Security was meaningfully enhanced was in 1971 under President Richard Nixon, Larson said in an interview with CNBC.com.
More than 5 million Americans currently receive below poverty-level checks from Social Security, according to Larson.
Larson's most recent proposal from 2023 would temporarily increase benefits for all beneficiaries, while also providing specific enhancements for those receiving minimum benefits; widows or widowers in two-income households; and children of deceased, disabled or retired workers who are full-time students. The plan also proposes changing the way annual cost-of-living adjustments are calculated.
To pay for those benefit increases, Larson's plan calls for income over $400,000 to be subject to payroll taxes. In 2025, workers stop contributing to Social Security for the year once they reach an income of $176,100. Both employers and employees pay a 6.2% tax on wages up to that threshold.

How having a 'bridge' strategy can help Social Security claiming
The Bipartisan Policy Center poll finds a majority of Americans support lifting the cap on income subject to payroll taxes, with 65% of Democrats and 62% of Republicans. That includes a ""significant majority"" of respondents with annual household incomes over $200,000, according to the results.
Larson's plan also called for a separate 12.4% tax on net investment income for taxpayers making over $400,000.
Larson plans to reintroduce his plan in the current session of Congress with some tweaks.
""We'll be rolling out a presentation in September that will include not only protecting Social Security, but also enhancing it,"" Larson said.
The plan will also make it Congress' responsibility to act more frequently to help ensure benefits continue to meet individuals' needs, he said.
""I think that that's got to be paramount to keeping this in check,"" Larson said.
Larson plans to push for a vote on his bill. But he also wants an open debate.
""There has to be a public discussion,"" Larson said.
What Americans want from Social Security
Most Americans — 64% of Democratic voters and 61% of Republicans — want Congress to work together across party lines to reform Social Security, the Bipartisan Policy Center found in its recent poll.
That's as 41% of surveyed Americans expect Social Security will be their primary source of income in retirement, according to the BPC. Moreover, 74% of Americans worry Social Security will run out before they retire, while 80% worry Congress will cut benefits.
Nevertheless, the poll results show Americans would welcome a ""comprehensive, balanced reform package that entails both benefit adjustments and tax increases,"" said Emerson Sprick, director of retirement and labor policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.
Increasing taxes on the wealthiest 1% to help repair the program's finances had the most support among BPC's poll respondents, with 85% of Democrats and 72% of Republicans. That's in contrast to the 65% of Democrats and 62% of Republicans who support a higher cap on payroll taxes.
A majority of voters also support adjusting benefits for those most in need, with 63% of Democrats and 62% of Republicans; reducing benefits for higher income individuals, with 64% of Democrats and 61% of Republicans; and increasing the amount that both employees and employers pay into the program, with 61% of both Democrats and Republicans. Most voters also support encouraging legal immigration that would result in more workers paying into the program, with 64% of Democrats and 54% of Republicans.
The urgency of addressing Social Security's funding woes will increase over time.
Two new laws have provided generous enhancements for certain Social Security beneficiaries. The Social Security Fairness Act increased benefits for some public pensioners, while President Donald Trump's ""big beautiful"" budget and tax package provides a tax deduction for seniors.
The changes in both laws will accelerate the trust fund depletion dates. The Fairness Act was included the Social Security trustees' latest projections. The more recent ""big beautiful"" legislation will move the insolvency date for the retirement trust fund to late 2032 up from the early 2033 trustees' projection, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
Senators who are elected in 2026 will be in office during those projected depletion deadlines, Sprick said.
As the trust fund depletion dates come closer, there will be more discussion about Social Security's future on Capitol Hill, Sprick said. The current proposals on Capitol Hill are a start, he said.
""We've put this off for way too long; the political process moves very slowly,"" Sprick said. ""But that does not negate the fact that these conversations are moving in the right direction.""",4e9218d9de955ef034484e43072a5ef4,trafilatura,9732,0

Since last month's third annual meeting of the CNBC Investing Club, the S & P 500 and Nasdaq hit nine and 14 record closing highs, respectively. Both stock benchmarks hit those milestones again Wednesday. From our July 11 gathering at the New York Stock Exchange to Wednesday's market close, the S & P 500 advanced more than 3.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained roughly 5.5%. The market lost some ground Thursday morning after the July producer price index came in hotter than expected. That PPI followed Tuesday's rather benign July consumer price index , which boosted stocks and raised expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut during its September meeting. Despite the hot PPI, a rate cut next month still remains pretty much a lock, according to the CME FedWatch tool . The odds, however, did dim slightly on the prospect of two more rate reduction before the end of 2025. The big questions for investors and the Fed have been whether Trump's tariffs will rekindle worrisome inflation and hurt the labor market. After all, fostering price stability and maximum employment are the pillars of the central bank's dual mandate. Back on Aug. 1, the government's jobs report was released and showed some signs of cracks as July non-farm payroll growth was much weaker than expected, and the additions taken together from the prior two months were revised sharply lower. Over the past month, we picked our spots in over a dozen trades — both taking profits and adding to positions. The Club started a new position in Cisco Systems on July 17 and made two subsequent buys of the computer networking equipment powerhouse's shares. Cisco reported its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter after Wednesday's close, beating estimates on both the top and bottom lines with a slightly better-than-expected guidance kicker. We're going to talk more about Cisco and the Club's other 30 positions during Thursday's monthly meeting, which will be livestreamed at noon ET. The recorded video will be available to members later in the afternoon. The reaction to earnings reports was behind the portfolio's best and worst-performing names over the past month. GE Vernova , for example, can thank its blowout earnings release for sending the industrial stock to No. 1. Conversely, the biggest laggard was Eli Lilly, which had its worst session in years following disappointing results for a key late-stage trial. Here's a breakdown of our three best and three worst-performing stocks over the past month ahead of Thursday's August monthly meeting. Winners GE Vernova up 17.6% GEV YTD mountain GE Vernova (GEV) year-to-date performance Shares surged after the power equipment maker posted a strong quarter and raised guidance last month. GE Vernova makes products to support the energy grid, which needs more juice to support all the AI data centers being built. The stock hit a record high that session, and several more since the July 23 earnings release. Jim Cramer described the industrial name as ""maybe the best story in the entire market"" as a result. The Club raised its GE Vernova price target by $150 to $700 per share due to the company's growing backlog and strong demand. Still, we reiterated our 2 rating, which means we would want to wait for a pullback before adding to our position. On July 17, the Club booked some profits in a small sale of GE Vernova just in case ahead of the Street's lofty quarterly expectations. Broadcom up 12.7% AVGO YTD mountain Broadcom (AVGO) year-to-date performance Broadcom led the recent rally in chip stocks. Nvidia was our fourth-best performer since July's annual meeting. The group, in part, received a boost after Trump said he would exempt companies from his planned semiconductor tariffs if they committed to invest in U.S. manufacturing. News such as Samsung's $16.5 billion deal to supply semiconductors to Tesla improved investor sentiment around the AI trade as well recently. We did, however, sell some Broadcom last week after the stock's big run and ahead of its quarterly earnings report. The trim doesn't reflect a change in our conviction. Instead, we're anticipating some profit-taking after Broadcom's quarterly report on Sept. 6, and we wanted to get ahead of that. That's been a trend amongst its peers, at least. Advanced Micro Devices shares dropped 7% in a session following its earnings report last week despite management issuing upbeat guidance. Apple up 10.5% AAPL YTD mountain Apple (AAPL) year-to-date performance Rounding out our top three performers was Apple. Shares of the iPhone maker saw an initial boost following quarterly earnings report in late July. Investors cheered Apple's biggest revenue growth since 2021, and CEO Tim Cook's remarks about more generative AI investments. But the bulk of Apple's gains came last week. Apple announced an additional $100 billion investment into domestic manufacturing, bringing the company's total U.S. investment to $600 billion over the next four years. The news showcased Cook's ability to get on a better footing with the Trump administration to mitigate tariff headwinds. Laggards Eli Lilly down 16.7% LLY YTD mountain Eli Lilly (LLY) year-to-date performance The drugmaker has had a rough month. Eli Lilly stock initially moved lower in late July after rival Novo Nordisk, the company's main competitor in GLP-1s, lowered its 2025 sales growth outlook. The Club made a sale of Eli Lilly as a result, locking in big profits. The bulk of Lilly's losses, however, came in early August. Alongside its earnings release on Aug. 7, the company revealed subpar results from a late-stage trial on its weight loss pill. The stock, in turn, had its worst session in years. As a result, we lowered our Eli Lilly price target to $800 from $1,000 and downgraded the stock to our 3 rating. That view shifted Wednesday, with our double upgrade back to our buy-equivalent 1 rating after CEO David Ricks and several other company insiders bought lots of shares of the depressed stock. CrowdStrike down 9.7% CRWD YTD mountain CrowdStrike (CRWD) year-to-date performance Shares have experienced a consistent decline amid broader weakness in the cybersecurity sector. CrowdStrike stock, for example, shed 5% in a single session earlier this month following negative commentary from peer Fortinet's management team regarding the highly anticipated firewall refresh cycle. That didn't make sense to us because CrowdStrike is cloud-native and doesn't sell traditional firewall equipment. The negative sentiment spread to fellow Club holding Palo Alto Networks , too, as shares fell despite management never hyping up the refresh cycle. That's because sometimes when a stock in a certain sector plunges, it can bring down its peers, even if the others have nothing to do with the reason why it's down. Palo Alto stock has recently been digging itself out of the big hole left following the July 29 rumors of a CyberArk deal and the official announcement by the company a day later. Salesforce down 8.2% CRM YTD mountain Salesforce (CRM) year-to-date performance Shares have slumped with the rest of the enterprise software names. Part of the stock's weakness can be attributed to investor concerns about generative AI's impact on software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies like Salesforce. The emerging technology poses a risk to Salesforce's seat-based licensing models and, in turn, its sales growth. This week's ""AI ate software"" note from Melius Research outlined these worries, prompting us on Monday to downgrade Salesforce to a hold-equivalent 2 rating. Still, we're holding on to see if Salesforce's Agentforce, its set of AI tools, will help the stock in the long run. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

The company also issued slightly better than expected guidance, driven by strong growth for its networking products. Revenue in the quarter ended July 26 increased 8% year over year to $14.67 billion, exceeding the LSEG-complied analyst consensus estimate of $14.62 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) increased 14% on an annual basis to 99 cents, beating expectations of 98 cents, LSEG data showed. GAAP stands for generally accepted accounting principles. CSCO 1Y mountain Cisco Systems 1 year Cisco stock, which is also one of the 30 names that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average , dipped slightly in what was a choppy after-hours trading session. Shares closed at a 52-week high of $71.79 each last Friday and traded a couple of dollars below that level Wednesday night. Bottom line Overall, it was a pretty solid quarter for Cisco. The computer networking equipment and security company reported another quarter of huge order growth thanks to artificial intelligence infrastructure spending and an enterprise networking refresh cycle. When we review Cisco, we always focus on orders because that's the best leading indicator of where revenue is headed. It's always been an order story, and we liked what we saw in the fiscal fourth quarter. However, it wasn't all clean. Sure, the security segment had positive order growth as well, but it reported a big revenue miss that will raise some flags. Still, what matters to us is that Cisco has turned into a misunderstood AI play. The company is taking in billions of dollars of orders from webscale, also known as hyperscaler, customers, and big opportunities are ahead from big corporations and sovereign AI — countries expanding their capabilities and infrastructure. Hyperscalers are the household big tech names like Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Microsoft . In a market that rewards AI-exposed companies with lofty valuations, Cisco trades at a very reasonable high teens price-to-earnings multiple. That valuation is too cheap to us. Why we own it Cisco Systems is an enterprise networking equipment provider that has made big strides to appeal to webscale customers and bring in over $1 billion in AI infrastructure orders. The company has also increased its presence in the security market through its acquisition of Splunk. In addition, Cisco's long-term transition toward subscription software sales, which are sticky and come with higher margins, should help improve the stock's undemanding price-to-earnings multiple. Competitors : Arista Networks , Hewlett Packard Enterprise , Juniper Networks Most recent buy : July 28, 2025 Initiated : July 17, 2025 Some analysts believe Cisco won't get full credit for its AI business until the company breaks out when these orders will turn into revenue. During the earnings call, management explained it recognized roughly $1 billion of AI revenue from webscale customers during fiscal year 2025. We'll see if that added information helps the stock earn more credit in the weeks ahead. We are reiterating our buy-equivalent 1 rating and keeping our $78 price target for now. We initiated Cisco on July 17 and made two subsequent buys over the next two weeks. Commentary Total Product orders increased 7% in fiscal Q4 year over year with growth across all geographies, with segment revenue up 10% to $10.89 billion. Starting off with Networking , product orders increased by a double-digit rate, representing the fourth consecutive quarter of such growth. A big reason behind this order surge is Cisco's fast growing AI infrastructure business and its ability to capture share from webscale customers. The momentum in this business continued in the fiscal fourth quarter with orders exceeding $800 million, bringing the fiscal year 2025 total to over $2 billion. That's double management's original target for the year. During the earnings call, CEO Chuck Robbins pointed out that orders from four out of the top six webscale customers, each grew orders in the triple digits. Even better, two of those customers each placed total orders of over $1 billion across Cisco's four business segments in the fiscal year. One reason why Cisco has made huge strides in its AI efforts is due to a major partnership with Nvidia . The two companies have teamed up to integrate Cisco's Nexus switches with Nvidia's Spectrum-X architecture to provide what the company describes as low latency, high speed networking for AI clusters. Cisco has also integrated a security solution for AI factories. Beyond Nvidia, Robbins said Cisco has a close relationship Advanced Micro Devices and is working with AMD on some sovereign AI deals, including the one with Humain, a newly launched Saudi Arabian AI company. Cisco is also receiving orders from neocloud providers. CoreWeave , which rents out Nvidia chips to customers for AI workloads, is an example of a neocloud. Robbins said there were several large deals in the quarter from these neoclouds that were not mentioned in the disclosed webscale AI infrastructure order figure. In addition to the webscale networking order growth story, there's a strong refresh cycle happening from enterprise customers adopting the company's Catalyst 9000 switches as well as routers, wireless access points, and industrial internet-of-things, or IoT, devices. While it's still early, Robbins pointed out that enterprise AI orders are starting to ramp up and the company is growing a customer pipeline ""in the hundreds of millions."" By division, Networking revenue increased 12% to $7.63 billion, by far Cisco's biggest, and management called out growth across most of its portfolio. They saw double-digit growth in internet infrastructure and enterprise routing and good growth in switching. Server revenue, however, declined. The Security division, product orders increased by mid-single digits. Still, we were disappointed by the significant revenue miss, even with 9% year-over-year increase. Cisco boosted its solutions in this industry last year when it paid $28 billion to acquire Splunk, so we would have preferred to see more strength. However, Robbins is very upbeat about the future. He explained on the earnings call how orders for the newer, refreshed products within Security increased by above 20%. The weakness mostly came from its U.S. federal government business, which has been hurt by budget cuts. When backing out the federal business, the rest of world security order growth increased by double digits in the fourth quarter. Cisco has about two-thirds of its security portfolio growing above 20%, which gives management confidence in its ability to hit its long-term target of 15% to 17% growth from its Security and Observability business. Observabilit y and Collaboration grew slightly in fiscal Q4 but missed estimates. Services revenue was flat at $3.79 billion, which missed estimates. Lastly, we always appreciate Cisco's consistent approach to returning cash to shareholders. The company bought back $1.3 billion worth of stock in the quarter at an average price of $64.65. It has $14.2 billion remaining under its authorization. Guidance Cisco expects fiscal 2026 first quarter revenue of $14.65 billion to $14.85 billion. The midpoint of $14.75 billion is a beat against the consensus of $14.62 billion. It also sees non-GAAP EPS of 97 to 99 cents. The midpoint of 98 cents is a penny higher than the consensus. For the full-year 2026, Cisco expects revenue of $59 billion to $60 billion. The midpoint of $59.5 billion is a slight beat against the consensus of $59.4 billion. It sees non-GAAP EPS of $4 to $4.06. The midpoint of $4.03 is a penny higher than estimates. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long CSCO, AMZN, META, MSFT. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) -TRADING DAY
Making sense of the forces driving global markets
By Jamie McGeever, Markets Columnist
Stocks around the world raced to fresh highs on Tuesday, with investors betting that U.S. inflation is tame enough to pave the way for a rate cut next month, although they remain on edge over the pressure President Donald Trump continues to bear on the Fed and other public and private sector institutions.
More on that below. In my column today I look at Latin American currencies and ask whether their attractive ""carry"" will be enough to sustain their remarkable outperformance so far this year.
If you have more time to read, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today.
1. Trump weighing lawsuit against Fed's Powell overrenovations, White House says 2. Trump rebukes Goldman's Solomon and bank's economicsresearch on tariff impact 3. Trump picks Heritage economist Antoni to lead U.S. laborstatistics agency 4. AI startup Perplexity makes bold $34.5 billion bid forGoogle's Chrome browser 5. Treasuries have dozed off for the summer: Mike Dolan
Today's Key Market Moves
* FX: Dollar weakens 0.5% as Fed rate cut bets strengthen. * STOCKS: New highs for Japan's Nikkei 225 and TOPIX,Australia's ASX, the S&P 500, Nasdaq and MSCI All Countrybenchmarks. Russell 2000 U.S. small caps index +3%, best daysince May. * SHARES/SECTORS: All 11 sectors in the S&P 500 rise, ledby communications +1.8%. U.S. airlines fly: United +10%, Delta+9%. Japan's Softbank +7%, taking gains in past week to ~30%. * BONDS: Treasury yields dip 3 bps at the short end andrise up to 4 bps at the long end. Curve steepest in a month. * COMMODITIES: Oil falls, WTI futures down 1.2% towards$63/bbl. Demand and supply issues at play, traders also lookingahead to Trump-Putin meeting in Alaska on Friday.
Today's Talking Points:
* Weakness in the long end of the U.S. bond market and steepening of the yield curve. Reasons? Unease about the apparent certainty of a rate cut next month, deepening concern over Fed credibility and independence in the face of Trump's pressure on Chair Jerome Powell. On Powell's potential replacements, James Bullard and Stephen Miran both stressed on Tuesday that Fed independence is of paramount importance.
* Deepening unease around Trump's interference in the economic arena. He has intensified his verbal attacks on Powell for not cutting rates, and is considering a lawsuit against him related to renovations at the Fed's Washington HQ. He has fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, called for the CEO of Intel to resign, and on Tuesday hit out at Goldman Sachs' CEO and chief economist for the bank's analysis of the impact of tariffs.
* Another whoosh in U.S. and global equities, which lifts many benchmark indices to new highs. With Trump's trade war on pause and the earnings season winding down, AI-related optimism and rate cut hopes are underscored by Perplexity AI's unsolicited $34.5 billion all-cash offer for Alphabet's Chrome browser, and July's in-line CPI inflation report.
High-flying LatAm currencies may struggle to carry on
As U.S. President Donald Trump has upended many global economic norms this year, investors have faced several counterintuitive swings, including the dollar's plunge and record highs in bitcoin and U.S. stocks.
Now we can add another to that list: the stellar outperformance of Latin American currencies against the dollar.
At the start of the year Mexico's peso was thought to be particularly vulnerable to looming U.S. tariffs, and domestic fiscal concerns were expected to limit the Brazilian real's upside.
But last week, one index tracking the region's currencies against the greenback, MSCI's International EM Latin America Currency Index, rose to the highest level since it was launched in 2009, bringing its year-to-date gains up to 20%.
For comparison, MSCI's EM Asian currency index and global EM currency indexes both peaked in early July, but their year-to-date gains at that time were only around 7%. And both have eased back since.
Bank of America analysts estimate that Latin American currencies have appreciated more than 5% this year in real terms, moving from 3.2% undervalued to 2.2% over-valued versus averages over the last decade.
What accounts for this outperformance? And, perhaps more importantly, can it continue?
CARRY ON
Price was obviously one major catalyst here. Many of these currencies were simply cheap at the start of the year. The Brazilian real and Mexican peso both depreciated around 20% in calendar year 2024.
But the key factor is 'carry', the yield and interest rate differential relative to the U.S. dollar. In nominal and inflation-adjusted terms, the carry in Latin America is among the highest in the world, thanks to borrowing costs in Mexico and particularly Brazil.
The Brazilian central bank's benchmark Selic rate is an eye-popping 15%, and even factoring in above-target inflation, real rates and bond yields are still close to 10%. Mexico's central bank may have cut rates 325 basis points in the past year, but its policy rate is still more than 330 bps higher than the U.S. fed funds rate.
When you factor in the liquidity of these two currencies relative to most of their EM counterparts, you can see why foreign investors have flocked to them. The real is up 14% against the dollar this year, and the peso is up 12%. Even the Colombian peso, facing headwinds from a renewed wave of domestic political violence and uncertainty, is up 10% this year.
Citing high real carry, analysts at UBS and Barclays remain positive on emerging market currencies, including Latin America's big two. That's partly because the gap with U.S. rates is likely to persist, especially in Brazil, even if local rates fall, given that the Fed may soon be easing policy as well.
RETHINK
Upside potential in the second half of the year is bound to be capped, however, precisely because of the bumper gains in the first six months.
Emerging market local currency government bonds have returned 12% in dollar terms this year, while EM stocks are up 16%, outpacing hard currency bonds (+7%), U.S. corporate bonds (+5%), U.S. Treasuries (+4%), and U.S. equities (+8%), according to Bank of America.
""This strong rally is prompting many investors to reassess their exposure to EM rates and currencies,"" BofA analysts wrote last week.
This exposure was highlighted in BofA's August global fund manager survey released on Monday. The closely-watched poll showed that investors' biggest rotation recently has been into emerging markets, with a 15 percentage point jump from the month before. Their largest overweight position now, by some distance, is in EM assets.
Significantly – and perhaps ominously from an exchange rate perspective – investors' biggest short position is in the U.S. dollar.
And when considering headwinds, we can't forget tariffs. While the vulnerabilities in Asian countries have been a key investor focus, Brazil is also clearly in Trump's line or fire, as it faces 50% tariffs on many of its U.S.-bound goods. Trade talks between Brasilia and Washington have broken down completely, with President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva saying U.S.-Brazil relations are at a 200-year low.
Mexico has more breathing room, having secured a three-month truce to safeguard the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), stave off 30% levies, and negotiate a broader trade deal. But until the ink dries, uncertainty will persist.
The Trump 2.0 era has taken markets on a wild ride with many unexpected turns. Latin American exchange rates have enjoyed a dramatic upward climb, and while this doesn't mean they'll necessarily plummet, investors may want to buckle up.
What could move markets tomorrow?
* Chinese corporate earnings, including Tencent, LenovoGroup * Thailand interest rate decision * Japan tankan survey (August) * Japan producer prices (July) * U.S. Fed officials on the stump: Richmond Fed PresidentThomas Barkin, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, AtlantaFed President Raphael Bostic * Bank of Canada minutes

Many experts are sounding the alarm that Social Security's Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) trust fund is projected to be depleted by 2033. If Congress does not act, it will only be able to pay about 77% of promised benefits, according to the latest Social Security Trustees report.
Social Security becoming insolvent would create a crisis for a lot of low-income seniors who depend on that income, Andrew Biggs, author of ""The Real Retirement Crisis,"" said in a recent episode of the Decoding Retirement podcast.
However, he added that it's ""very, very unlikely to happen.""
This embedded content is not available in your region.
Biggs is not among those who believe there's a retirement crisis on the horizon or that Americans might have to plan for an across-the-board cut in their benefits. He argued that while Congress will eventually need to address Social Security, retirees and those nearing retirement are doing better financially than many people think.
""We can see how many people are offered retirement plans, how many people are contributing, how much they're contributing, how much retirement savings are, how much retirement incomes are,"" said Biggs, who is also a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.
""When you look at those things and you start pulling on the strings of this 'retirement crisis' narrative, it falls apart very, very quickly,"" he said.
Biggs explained that his work in the Social Security Administration's policy office, which used highly sophisticated models to forecast future retirement incomes and replacement rates, changed his thinking about the ""retirement crisis.""
At the time, he said, career SSA staff would read alarming headlines about a looming crisis and note, ""Our models aren't showing that.""
In fact, they showed that future replacement rates for typical retirees would be about the same as today's. By most measures — income, wealth, poverty rates, or even self-reported financial security — current retirees are doing well, Biggs said.
That doesn't mean no one faces challenges. But when it comes to household retirement savings, the data tells a far more optimistic story.
In one example, a Vanguard survey asked retirees if the nation faces a retirement crisis, and about 60% said yes. Yet, when asked if their own finances amounted to a retirement crisis, only 4% agreed.
Other research from the Federal Reserve finds that just about 5% of retirees say they are truly struggling. That, he said, is a solvable problem — and one we should address directly rather than fueling fear over crises that don't actually exist.
Biggs also noted that most people who should be saving for retirement actually are. He cited Federal Reserve data showing that retirees without any formal retirement plan often fare better than expected. This group, which you might assume faces the greatest hardship, has an average replacement rate of about 90% of pre-retirement income, Biggs said.
That's partly because lower-income workers receive a higher replacement rate from Social Security, and partly because many, such as farmers or small-business owners, draw retirement income from sources outside formal plans.
In addition, Biggs noted that recent data showed that 88% of Americans approaching retirement have some form of retirement savings.
""So a lot of it's just getting the numbers right,"" he said. ""The number of times I hear statistics being used like 'nearly half of Americans approaching retirement have no retirement savings' — those numbers are simply wrong. It's really not even a matter of interpretation. They're just wrong.""
The perception gap about retirement
So, how does Biggs reconcile his view with the Employee Benefit Research Institute's (EBRI) annual Retirement Confidence Survey, which finds year after year that only about one in four Americans feels very confident they can maintain their pre-retirement standard of living in retirement?
""It is understandable that people will feel nervous about retirement,"" he said. ""If you think about it — say, if you're 35 years old and you're starting to save for retirement — you have to think about what is the path that your future earnings will take, which you don't know. You have to think about what is the rate of return you can get on your savings. You have to think when you might retire. You have to think about how long you might live. And you get one shot to get it right.""
He pointed out Gallup data spanning more than two decades that asks Americans whether they believe they'll have enough money in retirement to live comfortably. Historically, about 60% of working-age adults answer yes.
But when Gallup asks current retirees if they have enough money to live comfortably, that number jumps to 80%. That creates a significant gap, suggesting that many worry more about retirement than they ultimately need to.
Biggs admitted that it can all be quite confusing, especially given the number of pessimistic stories about retirement in the news.
A common concern is that 401(k) plans fall short for several reasons. Chief among them is the notion that only about half of US workers have access to an employer-sponsored plan, leaving the other half potentially saving little or nothing for retirement.
However, Biggs noted that there's a difference between coverage and participation.
For someone at the age and income level where saving for retirement is critical, lacking access to an employer-sponsored plan is a real concern, Biggs acknowledged. But at the same time, some of the statistics from household surveys showing much lower coverage rates are faulty.
In part, this is because of how these surveys are conducted, where ""somebody shows up at your door, calls you on the phone and asks, 'Are you offered a 401(k) at work?'""
""[The Social Security Administration] did a study where they looked at these surveys ... and then they matched those survey responses up to income tax data, which showed whether they were in a plan or not,"" Biggs said. And what they found is that many people answered these questions wrong, he noted.
""When they used income tax data for these very same people, the participation rate rose from about 50% to about 60% to 62%,"" he said. ""So a lot of this data ... we just assume the numbers are correct, and they're not.""
Balancing personal planning with national trends
If there is a crisis, Biggs wrote in his book, it's not with people saving through 401(k)s or IRAs or pensions — it's ""almost entirely on the governmental side.""
""Mathematically,"" he said, ""we do either have to pay more into the system or receive less out of it. Obviously, the sooner Congress does something about it, the better off we are. But Congress has known about this long-term funding gap literally for over 40 years, and every year, including this year, they choose to kick the can down the road, and that just makes the problems more difficult to solve.""
Given that, what advice would Biggs give to folks who are planning for a potential increase in taxes or a reduction in benefits?
""If you're a lower-income American, to be honest, I would say really don't worry about it, especially if you're somebody age 50 today who's approaching retirement,"" he said, noting that most Social Security reform proposals keep benefits in place for low earners or increase them.
But if you're somebody in the middle or at the top of the income distribution, what you might want to do to prepare for Social Security's financing problems is save a little bit more in your 401(k) today, Biggs said.
""Save an extra percentage point or two toward retirement every year,"" he said. ""If we decide to fix Social Security by raising taxes, you can sort of dial back your contributions because those higher taxes will enable the system to pay higher benefits. But if, on the other hand, solvency is addressed by reducing benefits, you'll be prepared. That's something I think people can reasonably do today to protect themselves against whatever might happen in the future.""

Microsoft recently released a report on the jobs most likely to be replaced by artificial intelligence, and personal financial advisors landed at No. 30 on the list of 40, with a high AI applicability score. Advisors were alongside other professions at risk of an AI takeover, including market research analysts, editors and public relations specialists.
But advisors who spoke with WealthManagement.com don’t see AI as a threat. Rather, they view it as an extension of the tech innovation that’s been going on for decades; it can be used for certain tasks, such as proofreading and notetaking, to make them more efficient and create more capacity. However, as with other tech innovations, such as robo advisors, AI will not be able to replicate the human connection advisors have with their clients.
“I think the timeline for innovation is just going to accelerate because of this,” said Kevin Hrdlicka, head of wealth at Savant Wealth Management. “Twenty years ago, there wasn’t really even financial planning software. You did everything with Excel. Think of CRM workflows. Those are all things that have dramatically changed the roles for the people in the industry and financial advisors.”
Hrdlicka uses AI notetaking software as an example. Previously, his firm had a junior advisor who took notes at every meeting. Now, the notetaking technology handles that part so Savant can accelerate that advisor’s training and development.
“Hopefully that will bear out as people can gain knowledge faster than they could have before because they don’t have to be the scribe as part of their career,” he said. “We’re going to train on how to take good notes and follow up, but now there’s technology. It’s AI technology that will record and do a meeting follow-up, and it'll drop tasks into the CRM and all that stuff. It’s been really helpful for people in seeing that those are skills that weren’t adding a ton of value, and I can focus on things that are more important to the end client.”
The Microsoft report analyzes 200,000 anonymized user–AI conversations, sampled representatively from 9 months of Bing Copilot, Microsoft’s AI chatbot, usage in the U.S. during 2024. The company measured how successfully different work activities are assisted or performed by AI.
The report found that people commonly sought AI assistance for information gathering, writing and executing financial transactions. By itself, AI was performing tasks such as providing information and assistance, writing, teaching and advising.
“And to me, everything that [the report is] pointing to is, I think, accurate in the sense that being able to gather information quickly, model 10 different scenarios, those are things AI is going to help advisors with,” Hrdlicka said. “But I think it'll evolve how the human advisor works with end clients. It's more of a continuation across all industries of just change and technology that will impact how we do things.”
AI can help advisors lay a lot of the groundwork when advising a client on a certain life event. But the actual advice is going to be tailored to the individual client’s goals and values, he said.
“It can serve up strategies, it can bring ideas, but then once you actually have the goals that the client and the person has, I think that is going to be hard to replicate,” he said. “The best financial advice still comes from someone who knows your story, not from a spreadsheet.”
Brandon Galici, founder and financial planner at Galici Financial in San Juan Capistrano, Calif., said it’s not just the knowledge and information the financial advisor brings to the client relationship; it’s how to apply it. AI might be able to come up with some softer side, behavioral finance-type questions. But he doesn’t believe that will be enough to get people to take action.
“'Why is anyone ever going to pay an advisor an AUM fee? You could do robo advisor, and it's so much cheaper and effective,’ Excuse me,” he said. “But that just hasn’t happened. And even those big companies are having a tougher time trying to get people on their platform without as much human connection.”
To be sure, Galici uses AI in his practice, primarily as a proofreader for the content he produces for clients. It speeds up some of his proofreading and research processes so he can spend more time on what he calls “high-value tasks.”
“That’s having those connections with clients, having conversations, sending emails back and forth where they feel seen, they feel heard, and they know that I’m helping them plan for their future, and I’m just constantly monitoring their situation.”
Chris Roy, a former senior client strategy at BNY Mellon Wealth Management, said human trust, connection, judgment, compliance and fiduciary guidelines will never be replaced by technology. But if firms use AI properly, it can “turbo-boost” advisors’ revenue generation and productivity.
“The firms that can develop secure proprietary AI models and ecosystems (which requires a huge investment) will see their advisors become far more productive and profitable,” he said. “Many big banks and wirehouses still operate on overnight old batch processing mainframes, which restrict their agility.”
A recent study by Northwestern Mutual found that most Americans trust advisors over AI on a range of financial planning strategies. For instance, 56% of Americans surveyed said they trust humans more to create a retirement plan, versus 13% who said they would trust AI more.
“Financial planning isn’t just about numbers on a spreadsheet—it’s an emotional discussion around a person’s life goals,” said Jeff Sippel, chief strategy officer at Northwestern Mutual, in a statement. “These conversations are complex, delicate and deeply personal. Clients want to discuss their options with a trusted financial advisor who understands their needs and the trade-offs associated with these big financial decisions at a human level.""
But the same study found that nearly half of Americans (47%) prefer to work with an advisor who understands and uses AI. The stat is even higher among younger investors, with 54% of Generation Z and millennials preferring to work with an advisor who uses the technology as part of their role.
Melissa Reaktenwalt, founder and advisor with EViE Financial Group in Upper Marlboro, Md., said she uses AI for many tasks, including notetaking, asset management and risk assessment. But she believes the human aspect of financial planning is still essential.
“There’s a place for financial advisors from a human perspective, not just from the job perspective, but also for clients and what clients are looking for. So I'm not initially concerned more than any other takeover or shift that AI is going to bring, but I do think it's worth financial advisors paying attention to, certainly because I think there are some technical aspects of the job that likely can be replaced and likely will be.”
She’s implemented a therapy model in her financial planning practice, allowing people to discuss how they feel about money.
“It’s the most important part when people can talk through some of those things and have a partner in that and have the ability to also use not just a chatbot, but a human as a sounding board for some of those things and some of their ideas for wealth management or managing or organizing their finances,” she said.
But she believes AI is part of a new wave of innovation that can be both exciting and scary.
“If we just let the thing run by itself, we still have to be in charge of that; there still has to be a guardrail of some sort,” she said. “For advisors, it’s really helpful to just understand that these tools are really powerful. They can be significant game changers for a business and specifically for smaller independent firms. But good grief, there’s still so much that we don’t know, and there’s a lot that still requires human direction and human guidance.”",dedb6d42e9c756b53962af92fcd2cd59,trafilatura,8013,0

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) are down -0.39%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) are down -0.30%.
Stocks are seeing some downward pressure today after today's strong US PPI report and today's +3 bp rise in the 10-year T-note yield. In addition, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly threw cold water on the idea of a -50 bp rate cut at the September FOMC meeting.
Today's PPI report was much stronger than market expectations. The PPI report suggested that the markets might have been overly optimistic about Tuesday's CPI report and that companies are passing through tariffs at the wholesale level at a higher pace than earlier thought.
The July US final-demand PPI report of +0.9% m/m and +3.3% y/y was substantially stronger than market expectations of +0.2% m/m and +2.5% y/y. The July US core final-demand PPI report of +0.9% m/m and +3.7% y/y was substantially stronger than market expectations of +0.2% m/m and +3.0% y/y.
The markets dialed back expectations for Fed easing in the wake of today's disappointing PPI report. The markets are no longer discounting any chance of a -50 bp rate cut at the September meeting and are now assigning a 93% chance of that rate cut. After Treasury Secretary Bessent's dovish comments on Wednesday, the markets temporarily assigned an 11% chance of a -50 bp rate cut at the September meeting. Nevertheless, the current 93% chance of a -25 bp rate cut in September is still substantially more dovish than the 40% chance assigned before the news of the weak July payroll report on August 1 and the in-line CPI report this past Tuesday.
US weekly initial unemployment claims fell by -3,000 to 224,000, which was close to expectations for a slight decline to 225,000. US weekly continuing claims fell by -15,000 to 1.953 million, which showed a slightly stronger labor market than expectations of a dip to 1.967 million.
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told the WSJ that she does not support a -50 bp rate cut at the September meeting, saying that ""would send off an urgency signal that I don't feel about the strength of the labor market."" Daly said she still supports two rate cuts this year, but that three cuts could be warranted ""if we saw more signs that the labor market was more precarious.""
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent today tried to backtrack a bit on his statements on Wednesday in which he said interest rates are ""too constrictive"" and that rates ""should probably be 150, 175 basis points lower."" He added, ""There's a very good chance of a 50 basis point cut. We could go into a series of rate cuts here, starting with a 50 basis point rate cut in September.""
In an interview with Fox Business today, Mr. Bessent said he was not telling the Fed what to do and that he was not calling for a series of Fed rate cuts with his comments on Wednesday. He said he was merely trying to say that models show the neutral rate is lower, although he didn't specify which models he was referring to. Mr. Bessent said he supports transparency and the call to clean up investment conflicts by members of Congress.
In recent tariff news, President Trump early Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. Last Wednesday, Mr. Trump announced that he will impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. Still, companies would be eligible for exemptions if they demonstrate a commitment to building their products in the US. However, the US will levy a separate tax on imports of electronic products that employ semiconductors. Also, Mr. Trump announced last Wednesday that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil. Last Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced ""within the next week or so."" According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.
The market's focus during the remainder of this week is on any tariff-trade news and Friday's Trump-Putin summit. On Friday, July US retail sales are expected to climb +0.6% m/m and retail sales ex-autos are expected to rise +0.3% m/m. Also on Friday, the July industrial production and manufacturing production reports are both expected to remain unchanged m/m. Finally, the University of Michigan's Aug US consumer sentiment index is expected to climb by +0.3 to 62.0.
Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 93% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and at 54% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.
Earnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 82% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates.
Overseas stock markets are mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 is up +0.29%. China's Shanghai Composite posted a 3.75-year high but then fell back and closed down -0.46%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -1.45% and fell back from Wednesday's record high.
Interest Rates
September 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) are down by -6 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield is up +2.9 bp at 4.262%. T-note prices fell back today on the strong PPI report, which resulted in reduced expectations for Fed rate cuts in the coming months. T-note prices were also undercut after Treasury Secretary Bessent today backtracked a bit on his comments yesterday, calling for aggressive Fed interest rate cuts. In a bearish factor, the 10-year breakeven inflation expectations rate today is up by +1.0 bp at 2.386%.
European government bond yields are higher. The 10-year German bund yield is up +2.3 bp at 2.703%. The 10-year UK gilt yield is up +2.9 bp at 4.618%.
Swaps are discounting the chances at 7% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.
US Stock Movers
The Magnificent Seven are all trading higher today, except for Tesla (TSLA), which is down more than -1%. The leader is Amazon (AMZN) with a gain of more than +2%.
Chip stocks are generally trading lower today on some give-back after yesterday's gains. ON Semiconductors (ON), Microchip Technology (MCHP), Align Technologies (ALGN), and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) are all down more than -2% today.
Cisco Systems (CSCO) is down more than -1% due to cautious management guidance for the current fiscal year.
Deere (DE) is down more than -6% on slightly lower management guidance for full-year net income as lower grain prices and tariff uncertainty are causing some farmers to pull back on equipment purchases.
Dow Inc (DOW) is down more than -1% despite a rating hike to neutral from underperform from BofA Global Research due to its view that the stock is oversold.
NetEase (NTES) is down more than -2% after a miss on Q2 sales and weaker-than-expected growth in its core gaming segment.
CVS Health (CVS) is up nearly +1% on an upgrade from Baird to outperform from neutral due to ""growing confidence"" in the company's turnaround.

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) are up +0.13%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) are down -0.03%.
The S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq 100 Index both posted new record highs today but have since fallen back. US stocks continue to see support from strengthening expectations for interest rate cuts through year-end as Treasury Secretary Bessent weighed in with his call for a 150-175 bp rate cut. Stocks are seeing support from today's sharp -6 bp decline in the 10-year T-note yield.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent today said that interest rates are ""too constrictive"" and that rates ""should probably be 150, 175 basis points lower."" He added, ""There's a very good chance of a 50 basis point cut. We could go into a series of rate cuts here, starting with a 50 basis point rate cut in September."" The Fed is currently targeting the federal funds rate in the range of 4.25%-4.50% and the effective rate is currently at 4.33%.
The markets have started to think about the chances for a -50 basis point rate cut in September, based on Monday's largely benign CPI report and the fact that the US labor market is slowing, with average monthly payroll growth in May-July of only +35,000. On a year-on-year basis, Tuesday's July headline CPI of +2.7% y/y was slightly weaker than expected, but the core CPI of +3.1% y/y was slightly stronger than expected.
The federal funds futures market today boosted the odds to 100% for a -25 bp rate cut in September and a slight 1% chance of a -50 bp rate cut. The market late Tuesday was discounting the odds of a -25 bp rate cut in September at 96%, up from 40% before the July payroll report released on August 1. The federal funds futures market is currently discounting an overall -64 bp rate cut by the end of this year to 3.69%, and an overall -136 bp rate cut to 2.97% by the end of 2026.
The markets are awaiting this Friday's Trump-Putin summit in Alaska for any progress in ending the Russian-Ukrainian war. President Trump on Monday downplayed expectations of a breakthrough, saying the summit is a ""feel-out meeting"" to end the war in Ukraine. Also, recent comments from Ukrainian President Zelenskiy dampened hopes for a quick end to the war when he rejected any talk of Ukraine ceding territory to Russia.
In recent tariff news, President Trump early Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. Last Wednesday, Mr. Trump announced that he will impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. Still, companies would be eligible for exemptions if they demonstrate a commitment to building their products in the US.

The market's focus this week is on corporate earnings results and any new trade or tariff news. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to fall by -1,000 to 225,000. Also on Thursday, the July final-demand PPI is expected to increase to +2.5% y/y from +2.3% y/y in June, and the July PPI ex-food and energy is expected to rise to +2.9% y/y from +2.6% y/y in June. On Friday, July US retail sales are expected to climb +0.5% m/m and retail sales ex-autos are expected to rise +0.3% m/m.

Martin Hoffmann, CEO and CFO, said that during the company’s second quarter earnings conference call to investors Tuesday that On implemented selective price increases in the U.S. in early July. He also said raising prices had no impact on the firm’s second quarter profitability.
More from WWD
“Considering our strong performance in Q2, continued powerful momentum in the first weeks of Q3, a strong order book for the fall/winter season and the continued efficiency tailwinds driven by our focus and commitment to operational excellence, we are increasing our 2025 guidance across all line items with high expectations for net sales growth, gross profit margin and adjusted EBITDA margin,” Hoffmann said. The company also raised guidance in the first quarter following an earnings report that was ahead of expectations.
The second quarter net loss was 40.9 Swiss francs, against net income of 30.8 million Swiss francs a year ago. Net sales grew by 38 percent to 749.2 million Swiss francs, from 567.7 Swiss francs a year ago.
The company now expects net sales at constant currency rates is forecasted to be up at least 31 percent year-over-year, ahead of prior guidance of at least 28 percent. Hoffmann said the increased outlook already includes the impact of a 20 percent incremental tariff on imports to the U.S. from Vietnam and the 10 percent assumed in previous guidance.
While not thrilled about the higher tariff rates, Hoffmann also isn’t worried about them. The CEO said that On has been paying around 20 percent import duty on the majority of imported product to the U.S. from its Southeast Asian manufacturing countries, and now that’s shifting to 40 percent for imports from Vietnam and to 39 percent for imports from Indonesia.
The U.S. disclosed last month that it has the framework for a preliminary trade agreement with Vietnam for a 20 percent tariff, with final terms still to be negotiated. The framework for a trade deal with Indonesia also disclosed last month, calls for a 19 percent tariff rate. Specifics for Trump’s trade deals have not been disclosed, and Hoffmann’s projections suggest that the new tariffs are stacked on top of existing duties.
“As a premium brand and as a fast-growing brand, we have multiple opportunities to compensate for these impacts of our cost sold,” he said. Hoffmann said investments and the upscaling of On’s abilities to drive more gross profit margin translates into innovative products that come at higher price points. Those factors have increased the DTC mix, created economies of scale on product cost and fostered supply chain optimization.
And even though there have been select price increases, there’s still one more option that On hasn’t yet needed to do.
“We have not even yet spoken to our retail partners, our factory partners, about mitigation efforts, which is still something we can do, but we haven’t needed it yet. So this gives us the confidence to raise basically all our financial numbers,” the CEO said.
Hoffman said that while the company is just a year-and-a-half into its three-year strategic plan, On is “far ahead of expectations.” He said the momentum for brand awareness growth will “carry forward with the launch of the Cloudboom MAX next week,” describing it as the first super shoe for the everyday runner and one that he and others at On will be wearing in their fall marathons.
The CEO also said that gross profit margin increased by 160 basis points year-over-year to 61.5 percent, an indication of the strength of the premium position of the brand. “The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the high DTC share, lower freight expenses as well as a net foreign exchange tailwind from the further depreciation of the U.S. dollar during the quarter,” he said.
As On continues to build iconic footwear franchises, the company also is starting to merge sports with fashion as it aims for a premium lifestyle focus with higher price points that allow for high profit margins.
“What truly excites me is that we’re not just creating footwear, we’re building iconic franchises. Today, we have nine distinct footwear franchises, each contributing more than 5 percent to our top line,” co-founder and co-chairman David Allemann said on the conference call. “That kind of balance isn’t an accident. It’s the result of a year’s long focused strategy to build resilience into our portfolio.”
He noted that the company is building a business that has the potential to have a “very high margin profile.” The business model has the brand expanding beyond footwear to include apparel. That transforms On to “somewhere between a sports brand and a fashion brand,” with a placement at the “intersection of performance, innovation and fashion” that allows it to have “very, very high price points,” the co-chairman said.
Iconic footwear franchises include Cloudsurfer and Cloudmonster, and the Swiss brand is seeing momentum with the newly launched Cloud 6. Footwear sales in the second quarter ended June 30 rose 36.0 percent at constant exchange. Apparel, representing just about 7 percent of total sales, is gaining traction. The Zurich-based brand previewed its Spring/Summer ’26 collection during Paris Fashion Week, and is set to launch an apparel line with brand ambassador Zendaya this fall. “What connects footwear and apparel is On’s strive in technological innovation and our routes in Swiss engineering and design,” Allemann said, noting that those factors allows the firm to “build a truly resilient portfolio.”
“But our product resilience is about more than just footwear and apparel — it’s our commitment to win in multiple sports,” Allemann said. “We started in running, but we successfully expanded to trail, outdoor, tennis and training, moving us closer to our vision of being the most premium holistic sportswear brand.”
He also emphasized that while On is fundamentally a sports brand, the cultural shift towards sport as the new “uniform” creates a lifestyle focus that unlocks a much larger addressable market. One example cited was the recent Loewe x On Cloudtilt collaboration sneaker, which retailed at $590 a pair and was “sold out almost entirely within days.”
The co-chairman said that wholesale — up 23 percent in the quarter — remains a vital distribution channel, citing success with “over 11,000 stores globally from the biggest players to local running specialty.” But it is the direct-to-consumer (DTC) business that is the standout that has driven large gains, both online and in physical retail. DTC represents 41.1 percent of total sales and remains a huge growth area for On.
The company, which operates 54 company-owned stores worldwide, is also seeing untapped potential for stores across Europe, particularly in France, Italy and Spain, as well as triple-digit growth in Asia, especially in Singapore and Thailand.
The co-founder also noted that a few weeks ago, the company launched its first LightSpray factory in Zurich, with four robotic arms. “It’s a path to the future of manufacturing, faster, less labor-intensive, in various locations with a much simpler supply chain that’s closer to consumer demand,” Allemann said. LightSpray technology cuts a multi-part production process into a three-minute, minimal-waste step, creating the lightest racing shoe — its Cloudboom Strike LS — that weighs just 170 grams.

Up to $400 million worth of classic cars will roll across the auction block in Monterey and Pebble Beach this week, marking the biggest test of the year for the collectible car market and wealthy owners.
An estimated 1,140 classic cars will come up for sale at Monterey Car Week, the annual gathering of classic car collectors from around the world. The sales total is estimated to come in between $367 million and $409 million, according to Hagerty. The midpoint of that range, at $388 million, would mark the third year of declines in sales, and an 18% drop from the recent peak of $471 million in 2022.
The high end of the market is the weakest. The Monterey auctions – held by RM Sotheby's, Gooding & Co., Mecum, Bonhams and others – have traditionally featured at least a half-dozen cars priced at $10 million or more. This year there's only one – the fewest in over a decade. The average sale price has dropped to $473,000 this year from $477,000 last year.
""Pebble Beach is the annual health check on the market,"" said Simon Kidston, a classic car advisor and dealer. ""Everybody waits to see what happens at Pebble Beach before committing to a major decision the rest of the year.""
Like the art market and other types of collectibles, classic cars have been in slow decline since the pandemic rally in 2021 and 2022. Collectibles prices are down 2.7% over the past 12 months, according to the Knight Frank Luxury Investment Index. Classic car prices are down 0.2% overall – better than the 20% drop in the art market but not as strong as jewelry (up 2.5%) or coins (up 13%).
Classic car dealers and auctioneers blame global uncertainty, with wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, along with weakness in China. Higher interest rates are also a factor, raising the opportunity cost of buying a classic car, since risk-free cash still earns over 4% or more. Some also point to a surging stock market for the past three years, which makes collectibles relatively less attractive.
Yet experts say the biggest reason for the classic car slowdown is a generational shift. Baby boomers, who have powered the classic car market for decades, are aging out or downsizing. The new generation of millennials and Gen Zers, who are coming into wealth and collecting, want newer and fewer collectible cars. The shift is expected to accelerate as an estimated $100 trillion is passed from older to younger generations, giving fuel to the new breed of collector.
""It's a big rotation,"" said McKeel Hagerty, CEO of Hagerty, the classic car insurance, auction and events company. ""Some of the older-guard collectors are framing it, 'The market is soft at the top end.' But there's a lot of depth in this market. It's just rotating to younger buyers and newer cars.""
That rotation has left the market for 1950s and 1960s cars with oversupply and falling prices. Many baby boomers are trying to clear their garages and sell, while others are passing their cars on to their kids, who often don't share the same passion.
Gooding & Co. is selling three Ferrari 250 GT California Spiders this week, including the most expensive lot of the week, a 1961 250 GT SWB California Spider with an alloy body and original hardtop estimated at over $20 million. ""Cal Spiders,"" as they're known, were made famous in the movie ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"" have long been a rare and special sighting at auctions. Seeing three at the same auction series is highly unusual.
Kidston said the alloy body Cal Spider would have likely fetched $25 million to $30 million a few years ago.
""It's one of the great road cars of all time,"" he said. ""It has intrinsic value, with provenance, sophistication, beauty and usability.""
Prices and demand for many cars that are over 50 years old are down as much as 20% to 30% from the peaks, dealers and brokers say.
""It's just the question of what clears the market, and can their egos handle it,"" Hagerty said. ""If it's an $18 million car, and it becomes a $13 million car, it's still a multimillion-dollar car, which is pretty amazing.""
Hagerty said that falling prices have driven more sales to the private market, directly between buyer and seller, rather than to the auctions. Sellers with prominent cars don't want their discounted sales prices to be public, so they opt to sell privately.
""That way nobody has to feel embarrassed,"" Hagerty said. ""We're seeing a surprisingly large amount of private sales. Sometimes a car will hit the market and sell in a couple of hours and close by the end of the day.""
At the same time, auctions of newer super cars are skyrocketing. Millennials and Gen Zers are bidding up prices for rare cars from the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. They also prefer cars that are more affordable and practical. Rather than keeping a $10 million 1962 Ferrari 250 GT SWB Berlinetta locked up in a private Garage Mahal, the new breed wants post-1980s Porsches, BMWs and later-model Ferraris they can enjoy every day and not have to constantly repair.
Along with affordable exotics, young collectors are also paying up for supercars, especially rare and highly specific Paganis, Bugattis and Rufs, the boutique German builder. A 1989 Ruf CTR ""Yellowbird"" sold in March for a record $6 million at Gooding & Co. at the Amelia Island sales.
Two years ago, the average model year of the cars being sold at Pebble was 1964. This year it's 1974, which still underestimates the bar-bell distribution of cars from the 1950s at one end and the 1980s and 1990s cars at the other.
Sales of modern supercars — defined as those from 1975 or later – will likely overtake sales of so-called ""Enzo-era"" Ferraris (made before 1988) at Monterey for the first time, according to Hagerty.
Some experts even worry that the modern supercar segment has become over-inflated and speculative. Like momentum trades in the stock market, which retail investors buy on the basic premise that someone else will buy it for more, modern supercars seem to be rising indiscriminately.
""If it's all solely reduced to what is more saleable, then collecting becomes very superficial,"" Kidston said. ""I don't believe collecting should be ruled by investing. You should keep an eye on the financial implications of what you buy. But it should not be the be-all and end-all. Otherwise it just becomes like bitcoin.""
Here are the top lots from Monterey Car Week, compiled by Hagerty:
1. 1961 Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spider Competizione

Individual coverage health reimbursement arrangements, or ICHRAs, a type of health plan in which employers provide nontaxed contributions to employees to pay for medical expenses, including monthly insurance premiums, are picking up momentum.
According to data, the number of people covered by ICHRAs jumped 50% from 2024 to about 450,000 in 2025.
For decades, health policy analysts and employers have tossed around the concept of shifting from traditional employer-sponsored health insurance to a defined contribution approach — giving employees a fixed amount of money with which to buy health coverage themselves.
But there wasn’t a practical way to do that due to regulatory, market, and administrative hurdles, Paul Fronstin, director of health benefits research at Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI), a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, told Yahoo Finance: “The emergence of individual coverage health reimbursement arrangements may finally offer a scalable vehicle for that long-anticipated shift.”
ICHRAs were created under regulations issued by the Trump administration in 2019 and have been gaining in popularity each year since.
This year, an estimated 500,000 people are covered through ICHRAs, according to data from the HRA Council, a trade association that works with vendors to help employers offer them. That’s up 50% from 2024, still a thin slice of the market for employer-sponsored health insurance coverage. About 154 million people were enrolled in coverage through their employers last year, according to KFF.
Who’s covered
The vast majority of ICHRA adoption is from small businesses with 20 or fewer employees, most of which are offering health coverage for the first time.
“It's definitely something for small businesses,” Fronstin said. “The market is developing from a group of employers that never offered health benefits or weren't offering health benefits. It’s really turning into a new benefit for these people that didn't have access to health coverage through the job. While they're not actually getting health coverage through their job, they're getting tax-free money from their employer to help pay for it.”
For now, ICHRAs are playing a role in expanding access to health coverage for people, rather than displacing traditional group plans among larger firms, he said.
Fronstin estimates that up to 700,000 people are in these arrangements.
“There are a number of factors that are driving the expansion of ICHRAs, but also some barriers that still need to be worked out to make it become a little bit more of a mainstay in the health insurance landscape,” Matt McGough, a policy analyst at KFF, told Yahoo Finance.
Nuts and bolts of do-it-yourself plans
It works like this.
Employers generally contract with an outside vendor or broker that helps employees navigate the process.
Workers do their own insurance shopping through individual insurance markets where they can typically find more choices for coverage than a traditional employer group plan that might offer only two or three choices of plans.
With a group plan, employers typically pay for the bulk of the premium. The employer contribution in a group plan depends on myriad factors, from the size of the firm to the industry, location, and the type of health insurance plan — Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) or Health Maintenance Organization (HMO).
While there are no annual minimum or maximum contribution requirements with these do-it-yourself arrangements, employers generally provide anywhere from $500 to $1,000 per month, depending on the cost of healthcare where the worker lives and whether it's individual or family coverage.
The contribution amount may be a set dollar amount or a percentage of a premium charged by a certain plan. And the plans are portable. If you're an employee, you can keep the coverage if you jump jobs, although you’ll no longer have the employer’s tax-free contribution.
For small businesses with no more than 50 employees, there is a tax incentive to offer these arrangements. They typically qualify for the health care tax credit, which adds up to roughly half of the employer contribution for two consecutive years.
What’s driving the interest in this coverage
The motivation for employers to offer an ICHRA: cost-control.
The set amount contribution allows employers to predict their costs more accurately than grappling with annual jumps in group plan healthcare premiums.
Half of large employers expect their average healthcare cost to rise by 6% next year, and they plan to reduce their employees' health care benefits to address those rapidly growing costs, according to a recently released report from Mercer.
An increasing number of employers are seriously considering plan design changes that would shift more cost to employees, such as raising deductibles or out-of-pocket maximums.
No one is saying these ICHRA arrangements are about to overtake the market. It will be a slow and cautious process over the next several years.
“There are a growing number of vendors, many backed by venture capital firms who act as management systems that process the payment and make sure everything is IRS compliant for the tax-advantaged benefits,” McGough said. “And that's certainly a signal of the market's momentum.”
As group coverage becomes more expensive and potentially unattainable for smaller businesses, an ICHRA could be more attractive, McGough said.
“We've heard over and over again from stakeholders across the board that this is like the transition from pensions to 401(k)s moving from that defined benefit to defined contribution,” McGough said. “Whether it will be as revolutionary as the 401(k) remains to be seen.”
“It's similar in the sense that it's shifting risk — investment risk and longevity risk from employers to workers,” Fronstin added.
They also shift the responsibility of plan selection and management to the individual.
What will push these arrangements to the next level is ”when a large employer moves into this market and goes out on a limb,” Fronstin said. “That’s going to get everyone else's attention.”
And this may take a major economic jolt. “The next recession is going to put employers' commitment to health benefits to the tests,” he said. “If unemployment goes back up to 10% for an extended period of time, like it was in 2010, employers may say, ‘Hey, I've got an opportunity here. I don't need to offer health benefits anymore the way I've been doing so to attract and retain employees, so I'm going to do something different.’”
Generally, no employer wants to be the first to make a change that could be seen as radical, particularly in a tight labor market where recruitment and retention are top concerns, per Fronstin. Health insurance is by far the most mentioned benefit when a worker is deciding whether to stay at or leave a current job.",2cbca5778c0c34c2330355819adf8378,trafilatura,6949,0

Klarna boosts revenue to $1m per employee using AI
Buy-now-pay-later firm Klarna reported AI-driven sales growth for the second quarter, enabling the company to generate revenues of $1 million per employee.
The Swedish company said it had 20% like-for-like sales growth in the second quarter, with total revenues coming in at $823 million for the period.
The firm also saw adjusted operating profits of $29 million, up significantly from the first quarter's $3 million.
""AI adoption continues to deliver significant, tangible results. As a result of this strategy, average revenue per employee reached $1.0m, up 46% [year on year in the second quarter],"" the company said in its quarterly report.
Klarna has aggressively leveraged AI to boost productivity performance. It has shed two in five jobs over the past two years as a result. ""This shift reflects the growing impact of AI and automation in eliminating manual, time-consuming work across Klarna,"" the company had said in its first-quarter results.

Euro zone industrial output shrinks more than expected
Industrial output in the euro zone saw a month-on-month decline of 1.3% in June, preliminary data from statistics agency Eurostat showed on Thursday.
Economists polled by Reuters had been expecting a decline of 1%.
The decline, which marked a sharp downturn from the 1.1% monthly uptick in output seen in May, was driven by a slowdown in multiple countries, including Germany, and a fall in consumer goods production.
On a monthly basis, German industrial production was down by 2.3%, Eurostat's data showed.
""Looking ahead, we think industrial production and overall economic activity will grow at only a slow pace in the second half of the year and beyond,"" Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said in a note following the data release.
""There should be some boost from looser fiscal policy in Germany, but it will not be huge and nor is it likely to last very long.""

Carlsberg's second-quarter sales miss expectations on soft volumes
Danish brewer Carlsberg on Thursday reported slightly weaker-than-expected second-quarter sales on weaker volumes, but nevertheless raised its 2025 guidance towards the upper end.
The world's third-largest brewer posted revenues of 25.7 billion Danish kroner ($4 billion) in the three months to June 30, just shy of the 26.4 forecast by analysts in an LSEG poll.
Reported operating profit in the first half of the year meanwhile came in at 7.23 billion Danish kroner, also below the 7.35 billion Danish kroner forecast. Organic volume growth over the period dipped 1.7%, including from the company's recently exited San Miguel brand.
CEO Jacob Aarup-Andersen cited a ""spending pause"" among consumers that he said was weighing on volume growth. ""The volumes do not flow in the way they did a couple of years ago,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""
The company nevertheless raised its full-year profit guidance to growth of between 3% to 5% — up from 1% to 5% previously — and flagged strength in its premium and alcohol-free brews.

Hopes of a sharp U.K. rebound 'likely to be dashed,' economist says
Month on month, the U.K. economy grew 0.4% in June after a 0.1% contraction in May, today's preliminary data showed.
George Brown, a senior economist at Schroders, said the slowdown reflected a drop in manufacturing following tariff frontloading in the first quarter.
""This drag should ease in the third quarter, even against a tougher global trade backdrop,"" he said.
""Still, hopes of a sharp rebound are likely to be dashed. The labour market has softened, and capacity constraints mean even tepid growth is generating inflation pressures.""

How Putin could try to outmaneuver Trump when they meet
Russian President Vladimir Putin's standing in the West may be pretty low, but he's a skilled and seasoned statesman who shouldn't be underestimated, analysts say — and he's likely to be looking to outmaneuver his less experienced U.S. counterpart when the leaders meet in Alaska on Friday.
Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump are meeting to try to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, but close followers of Moscow's leadership are skeptical that any lasting resolution will be reached at the summit.
Here are the opening calls
Good morning from London, and welcome to CNBC's live blog covering all the action and business news in European financial markets on Thursday.
Futures data from IG suggests a generally positive open for European indexes, with London's FTSE 100 seen opening 0.15% higher, France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX are seen opening around the flatline, and Italy's FTSE MIB slightly higher.
The pullback in sentiment among European bourses comes ahead of the latest indicator of the state of health of major regional economies, with gross domestic product readings from the U.K. and European Union on Thursday.
European markets had ended the day higher on Wednesday, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index rising 0.55% after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rallied to new records yesterday. Investors are gearing up for more inflation data to assess the state of the U.S. economy.
The producer price index, due Thursday, will be significant factors in the direction interest rates take at the Federal Reserve's next meeting in September.

In addition, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and St Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem today both threw cold water on the idea of a -50 bp rate cut at the September FOMC meeting. The dollar's interest rate differential improved with the 10-year T-note yield today up +3 bp and the 2-year T-note yield up +5 bp.
Today's PPI report was much stronger than market expectations. The PPI report suggested that the markets might have been overly optimistic about Tuesday's CPI report and that companies are passing through tariffs at the wholesale level at a higher pace than earlier thought.
The July US final-demand PPI report of +0.9% m/m and +3.3% y/y was substantially stronger than market expectations of +0.2% m/m and +2.5% y/y. The July US core final-demand PPI report of +0.9% m/m and +3.7% y/y was substantially stronger than market expectations of +0.2% m/m and +3.0% y/y.
The markets dialed back expectations for Fed easing in the wake of today's disappointing PPI report. The markets are no longer discounting any chance of a -50 bp rate cut at the September meeting and are now assigning a 92% chance of a -25 bp rate cut. After Treasury Secretary Bessent's dovish comments on Wednesday, the markets temporarily assigned an 11% chance of a -50 bp rate cut at the September meeting. Nevertheless, the current 92% chance of a -25 bp rate cut in September is still substantially more dovish than the 40% chance assigned before the news of the weak July payroll report on August 1 and the in-line CPI report this past Tuesday.
US weekly initial unemployment claims fell by -3,000 to 224,000, which was close to expectations for a slight decline to 225,000. US weekly continuing claims fell by -15,000 to 1.953 million, which showed a slightly stronger labor market than expectations of a dip to 1.967 million.
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told the WSJ that she does not support a -50 bp rate cut at the September meeting, saying that ""would send off an urgency signal that I don't feel about the strength of the labor market."" Ms. Daly said she still supports two rate cuts this year, but that three cuts could be warranted ""if we saw more signs that the labor market was more precarious.""
St Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said that a -50 bp rate cut at the September meeting would be ""unsupported by the current state of the economy and the outlook for the economy"" in his view. He said it is too early for him to make a decision on a rate cut at the September meeting.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent today tried to backtrack a bit on his statements on Wednesday in which he said interest rates are ""too constrictive"" and that rates ""should probably be 150, 175 basis points lower."" He added, ""There's a very good chance of a 50 basis point cut. We could go into a series of rate cuts here, starting with a 50 basis point rate cut in September.""
In an interview with Fox Business today, Mr. Bessent said he was not telling the Fed what to do and that he was not calling for a series of Fed rate cuts with his comments on Wednesday. He said he was merely trying to say that models show the neutral rate is lower, although he didn't specify which models he was referring to. Mr. Bessent said he supports transparency and the call to clean up investment conflicts among members of Congress.
The markets are awaiting this Friday's Trump-Putin summit in Alaska for any progress in ending the Russian-Ukrainian war. President Trump on Monday downplayed expectations of a breakthrough, saying the summit is a ""feel-out meeting"" to end the war in Ukraine. Also, recent comments from Ukrainian President Zelenskiy dampened hopes for a quick end to the war when he rejected any talk of Ukraine ceding territory to Russia.
In recent tariff news, President Trump early Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. Last Wednesday, Mr. Trump announced that he will impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. Still, companies would be eligible for exemptions if they demonstrate a commitment to building their products in the US. However, the US will levy a separate tax on imports of electronic products that employ semiconductors. Also, Mr. Trump announced last Wednesday that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil. Last Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced ""within the next week or so."" According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.
Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 92% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and at 53% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.
EUR/USD (^EURUSD) is down -0.37% due to dollar strength. Also, sentiment on the euro remains cautious due to the negative impact of US tariffs on the European economy. Meanwhile, market expectations are low for any significant progress at Friday's Trump-Putin summit in Alaska, which suggests that the Russia-Ukraine war will drag on and continue to dampen sentiment in the Eurozone economy.
Swaps are pricing in a 7% chance of a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.
USD/JPY (^USDJPY) is up +0.06% due to strength in the dollar. The yen saw some underlying support after US Treasury Secretary Bessent said the Bank of Japan is falling behind the curve in addressing inflation and that he expects a rate hike. However, the yen continues to be undercut by concern that US tariff policies will harm the Japanese economy.
December gold (GCZ25) is down -19.6 (-0.58%), and September silver (SIU25) is down -0.472 (-1.22%). Precious metals prices are trading lower today due to the mildly higher dollar and the rise in T-note yields that accompanied today's hawkish US PPI report.
Gold continues to have safe-haven support related to US tariffs and geopolitical risks, including the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. Fund buying of precious metals continues to support prices after gold holdings in ETFs rose to a 2-year high on Tuesday, and silver holdings in ETFs reached a 3-year high last Friday.

More recently, its highly anticipated second-quarter earnings report left investors wanting. The manufacturer of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) posted a wider-than-expected net loss of $206 million. As such, ACHR stock dropped more than 4% in the afterhours session following the disclosure.
As it relates to the equity, Archer incurred a loss per share of 36 cents. Unfortunately, Wall Street analysts had anticipated a loss of 25 cents per share. With the company being a pre-revenue enterprise, market participants may have grown antsy, especially amid broader economic challenges and political uncertainty.
Not surprisingly, ACHR stock represented one of the highlights in Barchart’s Unusual Stock Options Volume screener. This readout showcases the top 500 securities generating aberrant transactions in the derivatives space relative to established norms.
In Archer’s case, total options volume hit 224,325 contracts, representing a lift of nearly 75% against the trailing one-month average. Interestingly, call volume stood at 172,887 contracts, leaving put volume at 51,438 contracts. This yielded a put/call ratio of just under 0.30, suggesting bullish sentiment. After all, calls provide holders the right (but not the obligation) to buy the underlying security at the listed strike price.
Options flow, which focuses exclusively on big block transactions likely placed by institutional investors, denoted that net trade sentiment reached $81,500 above parity. While positive, the delta leaning toward the bulls was rather minimal. Gross bullish dollar volume was $1.664 million, while bearish volume was $1.583 million.
Essentially, sentiment was evenly matched, though the biggest transaction was for debit calls expiring Jan. 16 of next year. While it’s difficult to read the smart money’s intention, there does seem to be a slight optimistic bias heading into Q2 earnings. However, whether that sentiment holds for the rest of the week remains to be seen.
Still, irrespective of whatever the alpha dogs do, retail traders may want to give ACHR stock a closer look.
Using Russian Axioms to Identify a Signal in ACHR Stock
In an earlier Barchart article, I discussed my recent framework for identifying potential opportunities in the market. Using a discrete-event analysis inspired by Russian mathematician Andrey Markov, I seek out empirically valid ideas. While a detailed explanation is beyond the scope of this write-up, one of the key differences between the Russian approach and western methodologies is that the former is descriptive whereas the latter is prescriptive.
Put another way, the western philosophy involves forecasting where the stock should be. In contrast, I look at where the security has been under similar conditions — and then reverse engineer a probabilistic path forward given the current situation.
Another element that is different from western thinking is that my model is epistemologically consistent. Too often in the financial analysis industry, you’ll hear experts state that a security offers “good value” without defining what that term means. Such definitions — and the justification for their usage — should be incorporated in a complete analysis since share prices and their derivative ratios are continuous scalar signals. As such, it’s a category error to give them discrete labels such as “good” or “bad.”
In contrast, I avoid this epistemological pitfall by discretizing price action into a binary code, thus allowing for like-to-like comparisons. Rather than describing ACHR stock as “good value,” I instead rely on the only objective truth in the equities sector: at the end of the day, the market is either a net buyer or a net seller.
From this framework, we can build a surprisingly robust risk-assessment model. For example, in the past 10 weeks, the market voted to buy ACHR stock three times and sell seven times. During this period, the security incurred a downward trajectory. For brevity, we can label this sequence as 3-7-D.
Before we get into the good stuff, we need to establish our null hypothesis, the probabilistic performance expectation of ACHR stock assuming no mispricing. On any given week, the chance that a long position in ACHR will rise is only 44.67%, a conspicuously negative bias. Therefore, if we have a trading signal, we need to be able to beat the performance implied by the null.
Thankfully, this is the beauty of our alternative hypothesis. With the 3-7-D flashing, there’s a 68.42% chance that the following week’s price action will result in upside. While there’s still a nearly 32% chance of signal failure, a risk-tolerant speculator may be incentivized to consider a debit-based strategy.
Assuming the positive pathway, the median one-week return following the 3-7-D sequence flashing is 4.79%. Should the bulls maintain control of the market for the next three weeks, there could be an additional performance boost that could drive ACHR near the $10.50 level.
Putting the Crosshairs on a Specific Trade
Using the market intelligence above, the 9.50/10.50 bull call spread expiring Sept. 12 represents an awfully tempting proposition. This transaction involves buying the $9.50 call and simultaneously selling the $10.50 call, for a net debit paid of $42 (the most that can be lost in the trade). Should ACHR stock rise through the short strike price ($10.50) at expiration, the maximum profit is $58, a payout of over 138%.
To be clear, traders will need a little bit of help. While the $10.50 target is reasonable, past analogs suggest that the median expected performance forecast is around $10.48. However, it’s important to point out that the breakeven price for this trade is $9.92. This adds a relative margin of safety.
Of course, a lot rides on the empirical viability of the 3-7-D sequence. Running a one-tailed binomial test reveals a p-value of 0.0546. This means that there’s a 5.46% chance that the implications of the signal could materialize randomly as opposed to intentionally.
Here’s the deal: the threshold for statistical significance is 5%. However, the stock market is an open, entropic system, vulnerable to wild shifts thanks to exogenous factors. So, a p-value of 0.0546? In an industry where hand-waving and presuppositional fallacies double as analysis?
I’d be hard-pressed to ignore it.

On April 2, President Donald Trump announced potentially draconian tariffs on the U.S.'s major trading partners on ""Liberation Day.""
Major indices lost over 12% in the next six days, until President Trump backtracked and said tariffs would only apply for 90 days, pending negotiations, etc.
The S&P 500 index then recovered an amazing 28% from the low, creating the so-called TACO trade (Trump Always Chickens Out, meaning he offers harsh trade terms and pulls back, leading to stocks falling and bouncing).
While tariffs are on pace to settle lower than feared in April, they'll still pose a surprisingly significant drag on the US economy, leading to worries over another Great Depression-style stock market reckoning.
What is a tariff anyway?
For starters, what is a tariff? A tariff is an import duty, or a tax, on imported goods to a country, the U.S. in this case. So, to be clear, a tariff is a tax paid by the importer, which then has to pass the tax (or part of it) on to somebody else or absorb it.
That ""somebody else"" ultimately is the consumer. And there's the rub.
U.S. personal consumption (private spending) accounts for more than two-thirds of the nation's GDP, which measures its total economic output.
With higher tariffs come increases in costs of goods and services (inflation), leaving the consumer holding the bag, so to speak.
Lower disposable income translates to reduced consumer spending overall, which is a poor omen for the economic situation generally, and a problem for corporate profits and potentially, stock prices.
Tariff rates are much higher than last year
As of August 7, the president's various tariff deals have gone into effect, with a base rate of 10% or more, depending on the deals reached with the Trump administration.
This compares to negligible zero and 2.5% tariff rates for most countries that preceded President Trump's tariffs.
For the major U.S. trading partners, tariffs range from 10% for the UK to 50% for India. But most major U.S. trading partners (e.g., Japan & the European Union) settled on a 15% tariff rate, and made concessions for foreign direct investments (FDIs) into the U.S.
Still other nations, such as China, Canada, and Mexico (the three largest U.S. trading partners), are in a negotiation period, with tariffs currently set at around 30% for all of them.
Negotiations with China are set to conclude in November, so plenty of drama has yet to play out on that stage.
Meanwhile, about 95% of Canadian and Mexican imports are exempt from the 30% tariffs due to the MCA (Mexican-Canadian-American trade agreement) negotiated by Trump in his first term.
In the end, it may all be much ado about nothing if U.S. courts strike down the Trump administration's legal rationale for imposing the tariffs.
Smoot-Hawley tariffs coincided with Great Depression
The last time tariff rates were this high was nearly a hundred years ago, when the dreaded Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was implemented in 1930 to protect farmers and other key U.S. industries during the height of the Great Depression.
Tariffs of around 20% were applied to most goods, leading to retaliatory tariffs by other nations. This sparked a global trade war, which saw trade fall by 65% between 1929 and 1934.
Did the Smoot-Hawley tariffs cause the stock market crash of October 1929?
Not directly, but the passage of the legislation by the U.S. House in May of 1929, approximately five months before the crash, caused the market to begin to wobble.
All this set the stage for an era of protectionism, which augured poorly for an already nervous and overextended stock market. Excess leverage — that is, borrowing to speculate on stocks- was rampant.
All of this unfolded against the backdrop of a global depression, and voila: Black Tuesday of October 1929.
President Herbert Hoover signed the Smoot-Hawley tariffs into law in June 1930.
Stocks limped along for years and hit new lows in 1932, before bottoming around FDR's inauguration in March 1933.
The Smoot-Hawley tariffs were largely reversed in June 1934 in favor of bilateral trade agreements, and stocks continued to recover.
Are we heading toward another market crash?
The outlook for stocks is far from clear. On the one hand, President Trump's tariff regime has yet to show up materially in the data.
Hence, stocks have not experienced a pronounced negative reaction since August 7, when President Trump's tariff pause officially ended, and tariffs took effect.
However, stocks remain extremely jittery on tariff-related news, not unlike the stock market run-up to the 1929 crash.
On the other hand, we have a market that is marking new all-time highs. In recent weeks, over two-thirds of companies have reported second-quarter earnings, and 82% of them beat EPS expectations, allowing the market to grind back from recent jobs-related losses.
With most of the positive earnings data in the rearview mirror, however, one wonders what might fuel further upside in stocks.
Overall, the macro picture is biased to the downside, what with the tariffs' effect still to be felt in real time, a weak jobs number for July, and an uptick in jobless claims recently raising fresh concerns about the U.S. economic trajectory.
Is a crash like 1929's imminent? Hardly likely, given the absence of excess leverage or borrowing to speculate on stocks.
Still, the market is overvalued by most measures of healthy price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) at 29.4; more normal market P/E ratios are on the order of 15 to 20.
A look at the (SPY) (SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust) chart shows a solid rebound from August 1's disappointing NFP (non-farm payrolls) report (red oval).
But price is still below the pre-NFP high, potentially setting up a double-top formation. (A double top formation is created when price makes two attempts to surpass a particular price level and fails, resulting in a subsequent price decline.)
An alternative view is highlighted by the faster Tenkan Line (blue) still holding above the slower Kijun line (red). A move above the recent highs would suggest the uptrend is resuming, with price well above the cloud indicating that an overall uptrend remains in place.
Active investors will want to pay close attention to the coming days' price action to see if a new pre-NFP high can be made, or if it's only a bear flag correction higher, with more downside in store and a potential major double-top reversal pattern forming above.",d0226b75b9f22c6d33c01a9f8c9a19dd,trafilatura,6516,0

How? By convincing U.S. freight railroad companies to switch from diesel power to rechargeable batteries — part of a business model Langer estimates could make her company, Voltify, as much as $10 billion a year.
The rail industry needs to reduce its emissions by 5% a year by 2030 to reach net-zero goals, according to a 2023 report by the International Energy Agency. In addition, switching to battery electricity would save U.S. rail freight companies $94 billion over 20 years, according to a 2021 study published in the journal Nature Energy.
Voltify's VoltCars — essentially sodium-ion batteries on wheels — are designed to connect to existing freight locomotives.
Convincing the $80-billion U.S. rail industry to switch from a traditional and long-relied on fossil fuel to renewable energy might seem a tough task, but there are several reasons Langer said she is confident in Voltify's goal.
After a stint advising multiple early-stage companies in the climate industry, Langer noticed two things that limited their growth. ""Most of them rely on subsidies of governments, and [the] second [factor] is that they rely on manufacturing and scaling that just doesn't exist today,"" she said.
In a bid to overcome those hurdles, Langer held meetings with hundreds of people in the energy and materials industries, seeking opportunities. When she first met her co-founder Alon Kessel, it was a ""ding ding"" moment, she said.
Kessel knew the renewable energy market well, having co-founded Doral, a firm that owns and operates dozens of solar energy farms in the U.S. and Europe. He calculated that the six largest freight railroad companies in the U.S. — including Union Pacific and CSX — were collectively spending more than $11 billion a year on diesel, a figure verified by CNBC. Union Pacific, for example, spent almost $2.5 billion on fuel in 2024, per its annual report.
Langer and Kessel saw an opportunity. What if they could convince the large companies — known as Class 1 railroads — to convert their locomotives from diesel to battery power?
""Converting six companies is not that hard. And having that ability to create such an impact with just six companies, it's huge,"" Langer said. There is almost 140,000 miles of freight railroad track in the U.S., with the majority of the locomotives powered by diesel as there is little overhead electrification.
Langer and Kessel founded Voltify in 2023 and set about meeting the railroad companies. But they found initial resistance. ""There's a lot of skepticism, because this is such a traditional industry, and uptime and and reliability are key,"" Langer said. ""We've been figuring out what would be able to ... fit into their schedule, to fit into their operations without harming their efficiency.""
The companies' biggest concern was the amount of time it might take to charge the batteries, and that there would always be the power supply to do so. ""The rail companies, who have been very blunt about it, [said] 'Listen, we don't really care about the energy source. We just need to make sure that it's always up. There's always energy,'"" Langer said.
So Voltify spent about a year working on an algorithm that could forecast the energy demands of trains ""in every route,"" Langer said, and the company is also building its first solar-powered energy microgrid that Langer said is on track to be finished by the end of the year. ""Our calculations show that a network of these microgrids could eventually power all trains in North America,"" Langer told CNBC in an email. Voltify estimates that to do so would require 1,400 microgrids.
Voltify is in ""very active"" talks with three of North America's largest railroad companies, Langer said, adding that it is set to run a demonstration project with a smaller railroad company later this year. Voltify is also starting a pilot with a Class 1 railroad company in early 2026, and Langer said it is ""expected"" that this will become a commercial deployment after several months.
Voltify isn't the first company to come up with the idea of powering freight trains with batteries. In 2019, freight rail firm Wabtec developed a battery-electric locomotive called the FLXdrive, with the first trains set to operate in Australia after being ordered by miner BHP Group. The company also tested its battery-electric locomotive with GE, and said in an email to CNBC that it plans to test and operate FLXdrive trains in North and South American markets.
The technology can reduce diesel consumption and emissions by 30%, according to Tim Bader, Wabtec's director of external and engineering communications, in an email to CNBC. ""This benefit is critical since fuel is one of the major operating costs for a railroad,"" he said.
But as the technology is emerging, there are challenges such as charging time and battery capacity, plus a ""challenging"" business case given the infrastructure investments required. ""Like any emerging technology, these challenges will diminish as the industry continues to research and improve battery-power solutions,"" Bader said.
There's also ""substantial"" market potential for battery-powered passenger trains, according to Tobias Bauer, the acting CEO for Siemens Mobility North America, in an email to CNBC. ""Battery-powered trains represent a new and exciting platform for the rail market, particularly as operators seek alternatives for non-electrified routes,"" Bauer said.
Siemens Mobility has sold more than 400 diesel-electric Charger locomotives in North America, and in June launched its battery-electric train, the Charger B+AC, selling 13 to the New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Metro-North Railroad.
The new locomotive draws electricity from overhead catenary wires and transfers to battery power when needed, according to an online release. While the locomotives' range is currently up to 100 miles, Bauer said that is expected to grow as the battery technology advances.
In February, Siemens Mobility received an order from Swiss freight operator WRS Widmer Rail Services for two of its Vectron lithium-ion battery locomotives, which can be used for shunting without the need for overhead power lines. Asked about the potential for battery-powered freight trains, Bauer said: ""A full transition to battery-powered freight would depend on route specifics and charging infrastructure, but the potential is there.""

For investors charting their next investment course, the choice comes down to hopping aboard Royal Caribbean(NYSE: RCL), the current captain of luxury and growth, or placing a bet on a Carnival(NYSE: CCL, NYSE: CUK) comeback.
Both stocks have made strides since the COVID crash, but they're sailing in very different directions. Royal Caribbean is throwing launch parties for mega-ships, while Carnival is patching up its balance sheet and hoping for calmer waters ahead. One offers premium momentum, the other a potential value turnaround. So, which one deserves a spot in your long-term portfolio? Let's dive in.
Royal Caribbean: Smooth sailing ahead
Royal Caribbean isn't just cruising, it's making waves. The company has benefited from the post-pandemic travel boom and is seeing customers booking well into 2027. Its aggressive expansion strategy centers on a fleet of its new Icon-class ships, floating luxury hotels that are designed to command higher prices and appeal to families and upscale travelers.
In addition to its consistently strong public reception, Royal Caribbean has been navigating its finances with precision as well. While its debt ballooned during the pandemic like everyone else's, the company has made significant progress toward deleveraging. Its net debt has declined to $18.3 billion from a pandemic peak of $22 billion, and its credit profile has improved enough to earn confidence from institutional investors, including a BBB- rating from Fitch.
With an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin of 42% in Q2 2025, it's clear Royal Caribbean knows how to steer toward profitability even while expanding its fleet. And with a forward P/E ratio of roughly 20x, Royal Caribbean now trades above its pre-pandemic average of 14x, signaling investors are paying up for a chance at continued growth.
Carnival: Still bailing itself out
Carnival, the world's largest cruise operator, is finally seeing blue skies, but it's still got some storm clouds on the horizon. The company has made substantial progress in reducing its pandemic-era debt, aiming for a net debt reduction of $8 billion by the end of 2025. That's encouraging, but not enough to convince the rating agencies. Carnival still carries over $25 billion in net debt, and Fitch considers Carnival's debt as below investment grade, giving it a BB+ rating in June.
Carnival's focus remains on stabilization rather than growth. Instead of launching glamorous new ships, it's refining operations, tightening costs, and streamlining its global footprint. That measured approach is reflected in how the market values the company today. Carnival trades at a forward P/E ratio of about 13x-almost exactly where it traded in its healthier pre-COVID years - and its EBITDA margin is 24%. Its stock is still well below pre-COVID highs, and its recovery has lagged competitors.
But if you believe in turnaround stories, Carnival could offer deep value assuming management executes, interest rates don't spike, and customer loyalty holds.
What could sink the ship?
Both companies still face macro headwinds. Inflation has driven up operating costs across the board increasing the price of fuel, labor, and food. Even geopolitical instability can disrupt itineraries from time to time. And if interest rates stay high, debt refinancing could weigh heavily, especially for Carnival.
For Royal Caribbean, the biggest risk may be overextension. Building the world's largest cruise ships isn't cheap, and if the travel boom cools, pricing power could falter. For Carnival, the risk lies in balance sheet fatigue and brand perception. If policy changes alienate guests, it could take years to rebuild trust.
Who should be your portside portfolio pick?
If you're looking for a high-end company with a clear growth plan and improving fundamentals, Royal Caribbean is your ticket. It trades at a forward P/E about 50% higher than Carnival's, reflecting its premium pricing, newer fleet, and strong demand for luxury experiences like private islands and family focused mega-ships. With 42% EBITDA margins and a rising affluent customer base, Royal has outperformed Carnival nearly twofold in 2025, climbing 53% year-to-date. At a current price of $311 and a 12-month target near $347, analysts see an approximate 10% upside if growth continues It's not cheap, but you're paying a premium that the company has rightfully earned based on its performance.
Carnival, on the other hand, might appeal to the contrarian investor who believes in second acts. Its Q2 2025 EBITDA margin was almost half of Royal Caribbean's at 24%, but it trades around $29, far below its $50 to $60 pre-COVID range, suggesting a 2x long-term upside if its turnaround succeeds. With a global portfolio of brands like Princess Cruises and Holland America Line, Carnival has broad geographic reach and the flexibility to target different customer segments. And its dominance in the mass-market category and focus on budget-conscious travelers make it well-positioned if consumer spending slows. While the stock carries more risk, its comparative discounted valuation to its rival and its turnaround potential offer a compelling case for investors seeking higher long-term rewards.
Whichever you choose, pack your Dramamine, as volatility might be part of the voyage.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cpi-report-reveals-inflation-held-124151875.html,b8e3bb81e5fcc30cdc5e7da1155fda36,CPI report reveals inflation held steady in July as tariffs threatened wider impact,CPI report reveals inflation held steady in July as tariffs threatened wider impact,2025-08-14 00:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"An underlying inflation measure accelerated more than expected as prices of some goods typically imported from China, such as furniture and video and audio products, rose sharply. Others, including apparel and toys, moved up more modestly.
Some economists said the numbers won't be enough to keep the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates next month.
Prices overall increased 2.7% from a year earlier, similar to June, according to the Labor Department’s consumer price index, a measure of average changes in goods and services costs.
On a monthly basis, costs increased 0.2% after rising 0.3% the month before.
What is the meaning of core inflation?
But core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy items and is watched closely by the Federal Reserve because it better reflects longer-term trends, increased 0.3% - a six-month high - after rising 0.2% in June. That nudged the annual increase from 2.9% to 3.1%, the highest since February.
The cost of goods likely to be affected by tariffs turned in a mixed showing. Furniture prices increased 0.9% and video and audio products rose 0.8%. But apparel ticked up just 0.1% and toys were up 0.2%.
“Some monthly variation in price changes is normal and it remains the case that prices have risen the most since January for goods that are primarily imported,” economist Sam Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a note to clients.
Will the Fed cut rates in September?
Although core inflation picked up, the effect on imported goods was measured, and some economists said the moderate tariff impact won't keep the Fed from lowering interest rates in September.
""Although core annual inflation is back to its highest level since February, today’s CPI print is not hot enough to derail the Fed from cutting rates in September,"" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. ""There is some sign of tariff pass-through to consumer prices but, at this stage, it is not significant enough to ring alarm bells.""
With the labor market seemingly on solid footing, Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted last month that officials could wait until later in the year to lower rates to assess the effects of the tariffs. The central bank slashed rates by a percentage point late last year but has paused since December.
After a dismal jobs report revealed just 73,000 payroll gains in July and historically large downward revisions for the preceding two months, Fed funds futures markets raised the odds of a September rate cut to 86%. A report on employment in August, due out in early September, could determine the Fed's decision.
The Fed raises rates, or keeps them higher for longer, to fight inflation and lowers them to stimulate a weak economy. Tariffs are expected to both raise inflation and hobble growth, posing a dilemma for the central bank as it determines which challenge is more formidable.
Why are gas prices declining?
Gasoline prices fell 2.2%, the fifth drop in the past six months, and are down 9.5% over the past year. Regular unleaded averaged $3.14 a gallon on Aug. 11, down from $3.16 a month ago and $3.45 a year ago, according to AAA.
Oil prices have fallen this year on concerns the trade war will hurt the global economy and because of increased oil production by OPEC countries. That has led gas prices lower.
Are rents falling in the US?
Average rent increased 0.3%, pushing down the annual increase to 3.5%, the smallest since December 2021. Lower rents for new leases are finally pulling down rates for existing tenants.
Housing costs have been the biggest inflation driver, making up 35% of overall price increases in July.
Other service costs also increased sharply. Airline fares jumped 4% after falling for several months. Medical care costs rose 0.8% and car maintenance and repair bills rose 1%.
But car insurance costs, which generally have surged since the pandemic, edged up just 0.1%, and hotel rates fell 1%.
Are grocery prices increasing or decreasing?
Grocery costs dipped 0.1% after a 0.3% increase the previous month.
Egg prices tumbled 3.9%, continuing a decline amid the easing of a bird flu outbreak that had caused prices to soar. Other staples also got less expensive, with breakfast cereal prices down 0.7%; rice off 0.6%; chicken, 0.4%; and fresh fish and seafood, 0.5%.
Some other items got pricier: Uncooked ground beef rose 2.4%, bacon was up 0.6%, and bread rose 0.4%.
Do tariffs increase inflation?
Inflation has been pulled by conflicting forces this year. On the one hand, services prices that soared after the COVID-19 pandemic have climbed more modestly or drifted lower.
Rent increases, for example, have softened. Wage increases have slowed as pandemic-related labor shortages eased. And Americans grappling with higher inflation have reined in their spending on travel and recreational activities, which has lowered airfares and hotel rates.
Absent the tariffs, yearly inflation probably would already be at the Fed’s 2% goal, economists have said.
But the tariffs, which had minimal effects on consumer prices through the first five months of 2025, began delivering a bigger blow in June. Forecasters expect a growing impact on the cost of goods over the next few months.
Duties already in effect for weeks or months include a 30% tax on Chinese imports, 50% on steel and aluminum, and 25% on foreign cars. The average U.S. tariff rate has jumped from less than 3% in January to 15% to 20%.
Retailers and manufacturers have cushioned the hit to consumers by stocking up on inventory before the fees took effect and absorbing some cost increases themselves, among other strategies. But economists say those tactics have largely played out.
Meanwhile, the White House has reached deals with trading partners such as Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and the UK that set tariffs at 10% to 20%. On Aug. 7, Trump imposed levies of 10% to 50% on dozens of countries that didn’t reach agreements with the United States. In other words, the most far-reaching charges are looming.

After a rough start in 2025, NVDA stock has found its rhythm once again, returning stakeholders more than 35%. I wouldn’t call it life-changing performance per se. However, the freight train appears unstoppable.
What’s more, Nvidia is scheduled to release its earnings report on Aug. 27 after the market close. Undoubtedly, it’s going to be the disclosure that everyone on the Street will anxiously consume. Obviously, Nvidia represents one of the elite names in artificial intelligence. It’s also inking major deals for its most advanced AI chips. Further, analysts overwhelmingly rate NVDA stock as a consensus Strong Buy.
The list of fundamental strengths goes on and on. So, despite what many might consider sky-high multiples, the argument is that NVDA stock is undervalued relative to its true potential. However, this argument presupposes that the market hasn’t already priced in all the good stuff into NVDA. It would be an extraordinary claim that financial publication readers recognize Nvidia’s true value but the rest of the market does not.
That doesn’t mean that NVDA stock won’t swing higher — but for short-term traders and even long-term investors, there might be better ideas available.
Let’s consider the first-order principles of market demand. In the trailing 10 weeks (including this one), the market voted to buy NVDA stock seven times and sell three times. During this period, NVDA enjoyed an upward trajectory. For brevity, we can label this sequence as 7-3-U.
At first, it might sound strange to compress NVDA’s price action into a simple binary code. But now we have a falsifiable sequence by which we can extract forward probabilities through the study of past analogs. Long story short, when the 7-3-U sequence flashes, there’s only a 52.17% chance that the following week’s price action will rise.
The issue that I have is that the baseline probability is 59.25%. This is just descriptive math. I’m not saying I hate NVDA stock. I’m just saying that this particular hand at the blackjack table — the 7-3-U sequence — is unfavorable to the bullish speculator.
As an alternative, if you want to take a bet on a semiconductor specialist, investors may consider ChipMOS Technologies (IMOS).
Giving Three-Day Loser IMOS Stock a Chance
Based in Taiwan, ChipMOS Technologies specializes in semiconductor backend services — notably testing, assembly, packaging, bumping and wafer-level chip scale packaging solutions. Its services cater to a broad range of integrated circuits, including memory, mixed-signal, display driver ICs and ASICs.
Of course, Nvidia and ChipMOS are not related, other than the fact that both enterprises are under the broad semiconductor umbrella. Nvidia is a chipmaker, specifically a fabless semiconductor company. In contrast, ChipMOS is a semiconductor backend services provider: it takes chips that have already been fabricated and tests and packages them, along with other assembly services.
But the point of bringing up ChipMOS is not the business itself but the potential discount in IMOS stock. During the midweek session, IMOS stock dropped nearly 5%. Since the start of the year, it’s down roughly 12%. In fact, I selected IMOS in part because it was included in Barchart’s screener Three Day Losers.
Obviously, finding losers is easy business. Finding ones that can recover is the hard part. However, in the case of IMOS stock, I believe a comeback is possible based on a key quantitative signal.
Using the discrete-state analysis mentioned earlier for NVDA, in the trailing 10 weeks, the market voted to buy IMOS stock three times and sell seven times. During this period, the security suffered a downward trajectory. We can call this a 3-7-D sequence:
Now that we have a falsifiable signal, we can look back to the end of the dataset (January 2019) to discover how the market responded to the sequence. The name of the game is to only act when the signal can reliably beat the baseline probability or what is effectively our null hypothesis — the assumption of no mispricing.
As it turns out, the chance that a long position in IMOS stock may rise on any given week is exactly 50%, a coin toss. However, our alternative hypothesis is that, because of the 3-7-D sequence, a favorable mispricing exists. Indeed, past analogs suggest that the odds of upside stand at 60.87%.
Assuming the positive pathway, over the next three weeks, IMOS stock could potentially hit $17.41, making it an intriguing buy-the-dip prospect.
Running a Test on Empirical Validity
Anytime you’re dealing with a market signal, you want to see if it’s distinguishable from random noise. Therefore, I ran a one-tailed binomial test on the 3-7-D sequence, which spits out a p-value of 0.2024. Essentially, this means that there’s a 20.24% chance that the implications of the signal could materialize randomly as opposed to intentionally.
Admittedly, that’s a bit on the high side. However, you must also consider that the stock market is an open and entropic system. In other words, exogenous factors can easily enter the paradigm and disrupt the market’s trajectory. There’s no model that can consistently predict such impacts.
At the same time, the math that I’m running is descriptive. Stated differently, the forecasts are based on what has happened in like-to-like conditions. In traditional Western models, the math is prescriptive, which focuses on what should happen.
I believe the descriptive approach and forward extrapolation are much more faithful to actual market dynamics. But bottom line, you should consider the model with which you’re most comfortable.

Retail traders drove stock gains, but historical trends suggest a volatile September.
Hedge funds struggled with 'garbage' stock rallies, but might be better positioned for the fall.
Day traders have had a blockbuster summer, outpacing professional money managers and leaving some hedge funds bruised. But that dominance may be short-lived.
If historical trends hold, a seasonal pullback in retail activity could collide with a surge in volatility this September, threatening to derail the rally they helped drive.
While nothing has topped the meme-stock craze of 2021, retail traders have been enjoying a busy — and lucrative — summer.
Citadel Securities, which handles more than a third of the US retail equity trades, said in a client note last week that Main Street has remained consistently bullish over the last three months. Retail has bought up stocks in 14 of the last 16 weeks since April and options buying has been bullish for 14 consecutive weeks, according to Scott Rubner, head of equity and equity derivatives strategy at the Miami-based trading giant.
Their optimism has been rewarded. The S&P 500 has gained 8% since June and nearly 30% since its low in early April. The Nasdaq has fared even better. It's not just AI-adjacent companies driving the gains, either — day traders have led a rally in so-called ""garbage"" stocks with questionable business prospects, such as brick-and-mortar retailers Kohl's, American Eagle, and Krispy Kreme.
Many professional money managers, by contrast, have missed the boat on the stock rally, taking a cautious approach amid signs of economic threats. Citadel Securities' institutional clients have been bearish 8 of the past 12 weeks, Rubner said.
Some hedge funds have been punished. The surge in junk stocks has confounded models at equity quant funds, contributing to a weekslong bloodletting, Business Insider previously reported.
Many long-short equity hedge funds have navigated the market well, but those with more pessimistic outlooks have faltered.
One hedge fund exec told BI that brick-and-mortar retailers with significant tariff exposure nonetheless trading higher than before tariffs were announced — especially with recession indicators blinking — ""doesn't make sense to us fundamentally.""
David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital — which in the first quarter believed a recession and bear market were in the offing — lost 3.8% in the second quarter, trimming its year-to-date gain to just 4.1%, according to an August 7 investor letter seen by Business Insider.
""While we anticipated the possibility of 'rip your face off' rallies, we certainly didn't expect the market to reach new all-time highs so quickly,"" the letter reads. ""We still believe that the economy is slowing and could very well be headed into a recession. The market obviously disagrees.""
The diverging views among professional and amateur investors hit a new level in August after an unexpectedly poor jobs report and signs that inflation is ticking back up. Stocks fell that Friday, August 1 — but quickly rallied the following week.
""The US stock market does not always reflect the broader economy,"" Rubner wrote, noting that competition is increasing for ""dip alpha"" — that is, investors are quick to buy stocks after a market dip, betting that stocks just went on sale and will rise in short order.
A critical pivot point
As we head toward fall, the stage is set for a reversal of fortune.
If August is a lazy day at the beach for the stock market, September is like an icy cold plunge. While stocks generally rise in August — ""consistent with the number of vacations, pool parties, and the general unwillingness to put on a new short during August,"" Rubner says — September is the worst month for performance, according to data going back to 1928.
It's also historically more volatile.
This persistent seasonal quirk is in part a byproduct of the summer holiday — traders return from vacation and rebalance their books as they gear up for an end-of-year push, cutting positions to make room for new ones. Many mutual funds similarly rebalance in September, dumping losing positions and adding to the downward pressure.
September is also the nadir for retail traders. Retail participation traditionally thins as fall arrives, decelerating in August before hitting September, the lowest activity month of the year.
Whether they're reacting to September's historic weakness or a factor in driving it, if Main Street money pulls back, that may take some wind out of the market's sails. And both macroeconomic and fundamental weaknesses that the market previously shrugged off could loom large.
Einhorn's Greenlight says outside of companies benefiting from AI and the data center boom, ""it is hard to find other areas that are doing well."" The fund expects ""the increased bite from tariffs to show up on shelves and in the data by September or October.""
Additionally, Rubner expects systematic, factor-driven strategies to reach full exposure by the end of August, ""increasing vulnerability to downside shocks.""
In dissecting the rally in junk stocks and corresponding quant hedge fund losses, former AQR financial market research head Aaron Brown said in a column for Bloomberg that the likeliest resolution ""is that the garbage rally runs out of steam and the junk stock prices sag back.""
He continued: ""The nimble traders who took daily profits keep their winnings, the quant funds make back their losses, and the losers are less nimble day traders and medium or long-term investors who overpaid for junk.""
Overall retail participation in the US stock market has steadily increased, but a showdown is looming next month. Seasonal headwinds could test the resilience of the day traders and end their summer winning streak over the professional money managers.",fb704eeadc34dc5e9c60be9511901cff,trafilatura,5876,0

The company also stands on the cusp of a significant acquisition of the NFL Network.
With Q3 results in the rearview and an exciting deal on the way, should investors play DIS stock now? Or should they hold off on buying shares of the entertainment giant?
Founded in 1923, the Walt Disney Company is a global leader in the entertainment and media industries. Headquartered in Burbank, California, the company owns iconic brands such as Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and National Geographic. Its operations encompass television broadcasting, film production, merchandise licensing, and digital platforms, including Disney+. The company also runs internationally renowned theme parks and resorts. Disney has a market capitalization of $209 billion.
A transformation is underway in Disney’s sports segment, with its ESPN subsidiary launching a sports streaming service for customers on Aug. 21. This service brings the full suite of ESPN’s network under one umbrella. The launch of the service is timed to coincide with numerous sports events, including the start of the NFL season.
This also brings the bombshell news that ESPN would be acquiring the NFL Network, which has nearly 50 million subscribers, and other media assets. The addition of the NFL streaming rights gives the company more leverage for its upcoming sports streaming service.
Over the past 52 weeks, DIS stock has gained 34% as the company experiences growth in subscribers. DIS stock reached a 52-week high of $124.69 in late June but is now 8% off that mark. So far this year, the stock is up by nearly 4%.
Right now, shares of Disney trade at an attractive valuation. Its price sits at 19.3 times forward earnings, which is lower than the current industry average.
Disney’s Profits Climbed in the Third Quarter
Disney reported robust third-quarter results for fiscal 2025 on Aug. 6. The company’s revenue increased by 2% from the prior-year period to $23.65 billion. However, this figure fell just short of the $23.68 billion that Wall Street analysts were expecting.
At the heart of the growth was Disney’s growing subscriber count in its streaming services and growth in its domestic theme parks segment. The company’s total Disney+ subscribers for the quarter were 127.8 million, increasing 1.4% from the prior quarter.
This subscriber growth was, in turn, fueled by a 2.5% sequential increase in international subscriber count, while domestic subscriber growth (in the U.S. and Canada) remained flat. Its total Hulu subscriber count grew by 1.5% sequentially to 55.5 million.
Disney’s direct-to-consumer (DTC) segment’s operating income stood at $346 million, representing a significant turnaround from the $19 million operating loss it had reported a year earlier. On top of that, the experiences segment’s operating income climbed by 13% year-over-year (YOY) to $2.52 billion.
The company also reported gains in its profitability as its operational metrics grew. Adjusted EPS grew by 16% YOY to $1.61, which was higher than the $1.46 per share that Wall Street analysts were expecting for the quarter.
For Q4, Disney expects total Disney+ and Hulu subscriptions to increase by more than 10 million compared to the third quarter. The majority of the growth is likely to come from Hulu due to its expanded Charter deal, while the Disney+ subscriber count is expected to grow modestly.
For the current fiscal year, Disney expects adjusted EPS to be $5.85, representing an 18% increase from the prior year. Its DTC segment is forecast to report an operating income of $1.30 billion.
Wall Street analysts are soundly optimistic about Disney’s future earnings. For the current fiscal year, EPS is projected to increase 18.3% annually to $5.88, followed by 10% growth to $6.47 in the next fiscal year.
What Do Analysts Think About Disney Stock?
In the eyes of Wall Street analysts, Disney remains a sweetheart in the entertainment industry. Recently, Rosenblatt raised its price target on DIS stock from $140 to $141, while maintaining a “Buy” rating. The price target revision came after the company’s Q3 report, with Rosenblatt analysts highlighting its theme park growth.
Needham analyst Laura Martin also maintained a “Buy” rating on DIS stock with a $125 price target. The rating is based on several positive developments, such as Disney's recent profitability gains.
Reflecting positive sentiment, Evercore ISI Group analyst Vijay Jayant maintained an “Outperform"" rating, hiking the price target from $134 to $140. Expecting the company to continue its track of sustained earnings growth, Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne raised the price target from $120 to $140 as well, with an unchanged “Outperform” rating.
Disney remains a favorite on Wall Street, with analysts awarding it a consensus “Strong Buy” rating overall. Of the 28 analysts rating the stock, a majority of 20 analysts rate it a “Strong Buy,” two analysts suggest a “Moderate Buy,” and six play it safe with a “Hold” rating. The consensus price target of $134.52 represents 17% potential upside from current levels. The Street-high price target of $152 indicates 32% potential upside from here.
The Bottom Line
Disney’s operations might be in a growth phase at the moment, with growing subscribers and additions in theme parks, such as the company's planned seventh theme park set to be built in Abu Dhabi. Disney’s bottom-line gains are also notable. Therefore, investors may want to consider DIS stock now.

If you have checked into a hotel recently, you have probably experienced what the hospitality industry calls “personalization.” According to the hotel property management company, OTA Sync, guest expectations have increased as they no longer book rooms: They book experiences.
Does that sound familiar to you, as a convenience services operator? You aren’t just creating a breakroom: you are creating an experience. Knowing your customer — making it personal, finding issues that resonate in a positive nature, making people feel that their happiness is important to you — that makes sense. Unfortunately, it is often done on such a superficial level, and its inadequacy is so transparent that it is annoying.
A perfect model
The hotel industry provides a perfect model of the right way to do personalization — and the wrong way. Let me share a recent example of the wrong way.
After four grueling hours in Orange County traffic, I checked in at the Omni Resort. I’m tired, I want to get to my room (and maybe the bar) to relax and get settled. Instead, I am greeted by a desk clerk who has been trained in personalization.
Desk Person: Where did you come in from today?
Me: Encino.
Desk Person: Oh, that’s not too far. How was your drive down?
Me: Ugh! It was a long drive.
Desk Person: Any special plans while you are here?
Me: Yes. I have organized a group of 28 golfers. Do you not have any of that information?
To compound the annoyance, I just had the same conversation with the hotel valet when I pulled up in my car.
Here is what is suggested by Hotel Technology News. “Hotel staff should be well-versed in the nuances of having these types of conversations. Not every guest is going to want to engage, and that’s okay too. But staff should recognize when to keep the conversation going or simply send guests with what they need to get on their way.”
The right way (did not happen)
Of course, there was a right way to greet me at the hotel and make me feel like the special person that I am. The right way would have required a more thoughtful approach.
Desk Person: Hi, Mr. Tullio. I see you are here as the coordinator of a large golf group. Have you played the courses before?
Me: I’ve only played one of the two courses.
Desk Person: You and your group are in for a treat. The North course is the home of the NCAA Championship. I see that your trip coordinator is Sarah, and she put a note on your account: “Please have Mr. Tullio contact me directly if his group has any questions or concerns or if I can do anything to enhance your stay.” May I make a couple of suggestions for your group? We had a golf group in recently, and here is something they enjoyed…
The desk clerk tells me a story about the great experience that another golf group had last month, out at the practice green, with cocktails, at happy hour, hearing the band, having a putting contest, before heading into the dining room.
Then, after giving me some drink tickets and two bottles of water, he sends me to my upgraded room — a token of appreciation as the organizer. (Or at least that’s what I was told.) Now, I can relax, and I’m feeling special!
The lesson for operators
- Use some data to prepare for a sales meeting or a customer service meeting, and know who you are dealing with.
- Before a sales presentation, the rep should speak to the customer service department to find out if the sales prospect is a former customer.
- For both sales and customer service, look up the contact person on LinkedIn. Have they ever worked for a company that your company has served? Do they have shared contacts — names you can drop?
- Do you understand what industry they are in so that you can tell them a story about how you provided a wonderful solution for a company that was similar to theirs?
As a customer service representative, before you visit a customer, in addition to checking their LinkedIn profile, ask the sales rep about the client. What do they know about them? Have there been any serious issues pertaining to the account?
It is certainly more impressive to visit a client or prospect and say, “We are so excited about the opportunity to serve you again.” Much better than being told by them, “We did business with your company 10 years ago” and not having a clue about that. In short, there are three keys to a successful call:
- Be prepared.
- Use your data.
- Know your customer.
There is one more thing: don’t be afraid to spoil people. That’s something I learned a long time ago. Instead of a meeting, make it a lunch meeting. Pretty basic but very effective. Instead of coming to a meeting empty-handed, offer sports tickets or an invitation to a client event. Just like the perks during the hotel check-in process that can make everything better, perks matter.
This Omni story just happened last week. Unfortunately, it was the wrong approach and —on an amusing note — it continued at check out.
Desk Person: How was your stay at the Omni?
Me: Excellent, thank you.
Desk Person: What was your favorite part of your stay here at Omni?
Me: Ugh. Dealing with the front desk.

After pricing shares at $37 yesterday, the Peter Thiel-backed startup opened at $90, the latest sign of high investor interest in crypto-related companies as the Trump administration and Republican-led Congress have moved to reduce regulations and pass key pieces of crypto legislation.
Bullish stock, now trading under the ticker BLSH, reached as high as $118 a share before falling in midday trading. It was hovering at around $80 a share as markets were nearing the closing bell on Wednesday. The company had a market cap of around $12 billion, according to Yahoo Finance data.
Original story:
Another highly anticipated IPOs is happening today. Cryptocurrency trading platform Bullish is expected to make its debut on the stock market.
Already, its stock’s initial public offering price has been revised up multiple times, suggesting a healthy appetite for shares. However, only time will tell if its IPO will end up going the way of Circle or eToro, two other crypto-related companies that went public in recent months.
Here’s what you need to know about Bullish’s IPO.
What is Bullish?
Founded in 2021, Bullish is a cryptocurrency exchange that focuses on spot and derivatives trading. Its CEO is Thomas Farley, who was previously the president of the NYSE Group, which operates the New York Stock Exchange.
Bullish received an early investment from VC heavyweight Peter Thiel.
The company says it has more than 275 employees. For its most recent quarter, which was its Q1 2025 period, Bullish says it had $647 billion in total spot volume, according to its Form F-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Additionally, Bullish says it had $111 billion in total perpetual futures volume for the quarter.
The company said its average daily volume totals around $2.6 billion, and that trading volume for Q1 2025 was up 78% versus the same quarter a year earlier.
However, Bullish isn’t only a crypto exchange. In 2023, the company purchased the crypto media outlet CoinDesk from the Digital Currency Group. CoinDesk, according to Bullish, now has 48 million unique visitors annually. It also receives more than 600 million monthly API calls to its CoinDesk Data offerings.
Bullish IPO share price rises yet again
One already notable thing about Bullish’s IPO is that ever since the company announced its intention to go public, its estimated IPO share price has continually risen.
As Fast Companyreported yesterday, Bullish initially said its shares would be offered for $28 to $31 each. But on Monday, the company upped its estimated initial share price to between $32 and $33 each.
That estimated initial share price was again revised upwards later in the day yesterday, to its final IPO offering price of $37 per share.
In addition to its increased IPO price, Bullish also raised the number of shares it offered in its IPO. Initially, Bullish said it would issue 20.3 million shares in its IPO. Its final share issue was nearly 50% higher, at 30 million shares.
In its Form F-1 filed with the SEC, Bullish says its plans to use the proceeds from its IPO “for general corporate and working capital purposes, including funding potential future acquisitions.”
When is Bullish’s IPO?
Bullish priced its shares yesterday and is expected to begin trading today: Wednesday, August 13, 2025.
What is Bullish’s stock ticker?
Bullish’s stock will trade under the ticker “BLSH.”
What exchange will Bullish shares trade on?
Bullish shares will trade on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
What is the IPO share price of BLSH?
Bullish’s IPO price is $37 per share.
As previously noted, that’s a significant increase from the $28 to $31 price range that Bullish shares were forecast initially to begin trading at. It’s also higher than BLSH’s revised expected range of between $32 and $33 each.
The fact that BLSH shares have been continually revised upwards suggests there is strong interest in the stock.
How many BLSH shares are available in its IPO?
In the company’s latest press release on the matter, Bullish announced that it is offering 30,000,000 ordinary shares in its IPO.
How much did Bullish raise in its IPO?
With 30 million shares sold at $37 each, it means that Bullish raised approximately $1.11 billion from its IPO.
How much is Bullish worth?
Bullish is now valued at around $5.4 billion, according to Reuters.
How have other crypto IPOs done this year?
Bullish’s IPO will be closely watched today as its performance will be used to judge investor confidence in other potential cryptocurrency-related IPOs.
In general, investors have been more bullish (no pun intended) on cryptocurrencies and crypto-related companies since President Donald Trump took office.
Trump’s administration is seen as being much more friendly to the crypto industry, and it has passed significant laws giving clarity to the regulations surrounding the industry.
When it comes to IPOs, this crypto-friendly climate has perhaps benefited no other company more than Circle Internet Group (NYSE: CRCL), an issuer of stablecoins.
Since CRCL shares went public in early June, they have surged more than 400% as of yesterday’s close (at one point, they were up more than 750%).
However, while Circle shares have surged, another crypto company has seen less stellar results since its IPO.
In May, crypto trading platform eToro Group Ltd. (Nasdaq: ETOR) went public. But according to Yahoo Finance data, as of yesterday’s market close, ETOR shares have lost 2.4% of their value since its IPO.
Many on Wall Street will be eagerly watching Bullish’s stock price over the next several weeks to see if it will follow in the footsteps of Circle or eToro—or somewhere in between.",36dde470df23fd9ac951a86a154e1c6b,trafilatura,5814,0

Quantum computers use atomic particles to perform complex calculations beyond the abilities of today's supercomputers, positioning them to revolutionize numerous industries.
Many businesses are battling to produce technology that overcomes the challenges inherent in quantum machines. Two for investors to consider are IonQ(NYSE: IONQ) and Quantum Computing Inc.(NASDAQ: QUBT), which also refers to itself as QCi.
These companies use different techniques to build quantum devices. IonQ employs ions to perform calculations while QCi utilizes photons.
Between IonQ and QCi, one proves to be a better quantum computing investment right now. To understand which one and why, let's dive into both businesses in more detail.
Where Quantum Computing Inc. is at today
Current quantum computers are prone to calculation errors due to the delicate nature of atomic particles, preventing these machines from scaling up, and limiting their widespread use. Many quantum companies try to minimize errors by subjecting particles to freezing temperatures in expensive, bulky cryogenic equipment.
Quantum Computing Inc. takes a different approach. It embraces the inherent chaos of harnessing these particles in a technique called entropy quantum computing. This method allows QCi's machines to operate at room temperature, use less power, and integrate with ordinary computer servers.
Despite these advantages, its technology hasn't taken off. In the first quarter, QCi produced revenue of just $39,000. However, its Q1 operating expenses totaled $8.3 million. This chasm between income and expenses eventually will become a death knell for the business if sales don't pick up.
But perhaps the company is turning a corner. In April, it sold one of its computers to a large automotive manufacturer, and in July, it secured a purchase valued at $332,000 from a major U.S. bank. The bank's sale is significant considering QCi produced revenue of $373,000 in all of 2024.
IonQ's financial ups and downs
IonQ's technology also operates at room temperature by using lasers to carefully control ions. It's been winning customers and growing revenue, a sign that its approach shows promise in surmounting quantum computing's shortcomings. In 2024, sales reached $43.1 million, up from the prior year's $22 million.
But in Q1, the company's revenue of $7.6 million was flat year over year. This underwhelming result was not a good sign for a business with a Q1 operating loss of $75.7 million.
Then in Q2, IonQ's sales trajectory changed once again. This time, revenue came in at an impressive $20.7 million, nearly double the prior year's $11.4 million. Part of this massive increase came from the company's recent acquisitions, as it works toward building a quantum computer network akin to the infrastructure underpinning today's internet.
However, the acquisitions resulted in additional expenses, which catapulted IonQ's Q2 operating costs to $181.3 million, a huge increase over 2024's $60.3 million. Consequently, its Q2 operating loss ballooned to $160.6 million versus a loss of $48.9 million in the previous year.
To bolster its finances, IonQ executed a $1 billion equity offering in July. This adds to the $1.3 billion in total assets the company exited Q2 with, while total liabilities stood at $168.2 million.
Choosing between IonQ and Quantum Computing Inc.
In deciding between these two quantum computing companies, one factor to weigh is share price valuation. This can be assessed through the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, which measures how much investors are willing to pay for every dollar of revenue generated over the trailing 12 months.
IonQ's P/S multiple is substantially lower than QCi's, indicating it's a better value. In fact, QCi's P/S ratio is so high, its stock looks overpriced.
IonQ's superior sales growth and share price valuation make it a better investment over QCi in the emerging field of quantum computing. That said, buying IonQ stock carries risks, especially in the current macroeconomic climate, which could see inflation rise as a result of the Trump administration's aggressive tariff policies.
IonQ's operating expenses are already accelerating, and the economic environment could drive those costs higher. While its balance sheet sports the funds to maintain operations in the short term, the longer-term picture remains murky.
Whether IonQ's tech can achieve the quantum computing dominance it seeks is far from certain, and both it and QCi face large competitors with deep pockets, such as Microsoft, which is developing its own quantum computing solution. So only investors with a high risk tolerance should consider IonQ stock.

Hulls said there were aspects to being the CEO that he loved, but there are parts that drain him. “The honest truth is that my brute-force style got results and still can, but being the backstop of last resort, 24/7, year after year, comes with a constant weight.” He is now the executive chairman and ex-COO Lauren Antonoff is the new CEO.
Life360 cofounder Chris Hulls is resigning in his own unfiltered way after 20 years—and he isn’t sanitizing the reason the $9 billion location-tracking company has appointed chief operating officer Lauren Antonoff as his replacement.
“I disdain corporate speak and owe more than the standard ‘I want to spend more time with my family and Lauren is a great visionary product-centric strategic operator,’” wrote Hulls in a sign-off blog post. “Comms wrote me a draft. Legal wanted to chime in too. A lot of people had advice on what to say. But I ignored it and decided to share my own thoughts without talking points or filters, in this single message to anyone who wants to read it.”
According to Hulls, he’s burned out.
“After nearly two decades of being the last line of defense, I feel it more than I used to,” wrote Hulls. “There are parts of the CEO role I love that fuel me, and parts that drain me. When I’m running on empty, everything suffers.”
Hulls wrote that he told the board two years ago when he turned 40 he wanted to transition out of the CEO position before he turned 45, and when the company and the senior leadership team were ready for it. Hulls is stepping aside now to serve as executive chairman because the CEO role should be held by someone who is “all in on every aspect of it, every single day, and that’s Lauren,” he wrote. Hulls said his brain isn’t wired for cleaned-up messages and superlatives common in CEO communications.
“I’ve never overhyped or played into the Silicon Valley kool-aid drinking tech bro stereotypes,” wrote Hulls.
Antonoff’s appointment took effect this week.
Record-High Turnover in the Corner Office
The CEO transition triggered at Life360 comes as corner-office turnover is smashing new records for frequency. Data from executive recruitment firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas found CEO exits at U.S. companies rose 12% during the first half the year with 1,234 CEOs leaving their jobs behind. The latter is a 12% increase over last year and the highest year-to-date number since Challenger began tracking CEO departures at public, private and non-profit companies in 2002.
Among tech firms, 138 CEOs left their roles through June 2025, a 16% increase over 2024. Challenger attributed the rise in CEOs heading for the hills to uncertainty, seismic shifts in tech, and mounting pressure on traditional leadership structures. The firm found one-third of new CEOs were interim appointments rather than full-fledged, succession-vetted replacements.
Overall, some 47% of CEO replacements came from outside the company while internal appointments, like Antonoff’s at Life360, occurred 53% of the time. Only 25% of new CEO appointments in 2025 so far are women.
Future Plans
Antonoff has served as chief operating officer at Life360 since May 2023 and previously held senior positions at GoDaddy and Microsoft. As CEO, Antonoff will collect a $515,000 salary and a target bonus of the same amount. Life360 also granted her one-time promotion equity grants valued at a total of $8.4 million and split among restricted-stock units and performance-based stock units. She also got another performance-share grant valued at $3.6 million.
Hulls said he and Antonoff are completely aligned when it comes to Life360 users and long-term vision, but in other ways the two are “polar opposites.”
“The challenges that wear me down at this scale are exactly the ones that fire her up,” Hulls wrote. “She’s fresh, relentless, and loves the work. I can call her at midnight to talk Life360, and she’s not just available, she’s energized.”
Over the past year, Hulls and Antonoff have been testing out a setup in which Hulls served as exec chair with Antonoff steadily taking on more and more responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the company, he wrote. Hulls and Antonoff found the two “click in a way that makes product work a joy.”
“We spar, challenge each other, and sharpen ideas, and we have a lot of fun doing it,” Hulls wrote. “I hope one day we can be like Jeff Weiner and Reid Hoffman at LinkedIn, one of those leadership duos people point to as a model for how to scale and evolve a company. Much of what’s launched this year, and what’s still to come, has her fingerprints all over it.”
The Life360 board will also undergo a small shakeup with the Antonoff appointment. John Philip Coghlan, who served as chairman of the board for 16 years, will continue on as a director while Hulls serves as executive chair. The board appointed Mark Goines as lead independent director to counterbalance the new structure. Goines has served as a board member since 2019.
In a statement, Antonoff thanked Hulls.
“Chris has been an amazing partner, and I’m thankful to him and the Board for the trust and confidence they have placed in me. I’m energized and honored to lead the company forward, staying grounded in our mission and focused on delighting our members with products that deliver real peace of mind.”
Hulls said he’ll be there if Antonoff needs her.
“If she ever needs a pit-fighter, I’ll be here to tussle—whether that’s taking on patent trolls, bottom-feeding class action lawyers, causing trouble on TikTok, or injecting a little crazy in a way only a founder can,” wrote Hulls.",899284d2e767ecbba255fe8883f11db4,trafilatura,5743,0

China's economy lost momentum in July, with growth faltering across the board, as weak domestic demand persisted and Beijing intensified efforts to curb excess capacity.
Retail sales last month rose 3.7% from a year earlier, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Friday, sharply missing analysts' estimates for a 4.6% growth in a Reuters poll and slowing from June's 4.8% growth.
Industrial output rose 5.7% from a year ago in July, its weakest level since November last year, according to LSEG data, and weaker than analysts' expectations for a 5.9% rise.
Fixed-asset investment in July expanded 1.6% for the year-to-date, undershooting economists' forecasts for a 2.7% growth and slowing from 2.8% in the first six months. Within that segment, the contraction in property investment worsened, slumping 12% in the first seven months, government data showed.

Japan's economy expanded 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, compared to the first three months of the year, as the country grappled with the volatile tariff policy out of the United States.
This was compared to the revised 0.1% growth seen in the first quarter, and was higher than the 0.1% increase expected by economists polled by Reuters.
On a year-over-year basis, Japan's GDP expanded 1.2% in the second quarter, falling short of the first quarter's 1.8% growth.
The GDP reading comes as Japan struggled to cope with an uncertain trade environment in the second quarter, with the country only reaching a trade deal with the U.S. on July 23.
The deal sees Japan face a 15% blanket tariff on all exports to the U.S., including automobiles.

In a Thursday interview with CNBC, economist Marc Sumerlin confirmed that he's in the running to be the next Federal Reserve chair.
""I got a call last Wednesday that said there was going to be a list [and] I was going to be on it. That's as much as I know right now,"" he said. ""I'm waiting for more guidance on where we go from here.""
Sumerlin also voiced his support for a big interest rate cut. The former senior economist under then-President George W. Bush said that a 50 basis-point rate cut ""seems like pretty much a no-brainer to me.""
One basis point equals 0.01%, so a 50 basis-point cut would be half a percentage point.

Equities may have further upside from here, but investors should still be mindful of elevated volatility going forward, according to UBS.
""While the VIX index of implied stock volatility has fallen to the lowest level since December last year, market swings could pick up quickly if trade tensions escalate significantly, economic data weakens faster than expected, or if geopolitical risks worsen,"" the bank wrote in a Wednesday note to clients. ""Investors who are already allocated to equities in line with their strategic benchmarks should consider structured strategies with capital preservation features, while those underallocated should prepare to add exposure on potential market dips or consider a disciplined approach to phasing into stocks.""
UBS added that a ""well-diversified portfolio"" is suited for helping investors hedge against volatility while also setting them up for future gains.

Western reagent suppliers including U.S.-based Thermo Fisher Scientific and Germany's Merck have profited in the world's second-largest pharmaceutical market from the compounds used in lab tests for analysis and quality control.
But rising Chinese import tariffs due to the trade war with the U.S. and longer-term concerns about costs or access are spurring Chinese companies to request products from local rivals like Shanghai Titan Scientific and Nanjing Vazyme Biotech instead, the executives and managers said.
The five who spoke to Reuters work at Chinese firms involved in the purchase or supply of reagents and their comments are an early sign of an expected industry shift toward more Chinese purchases.
China's reagent market for lab and diagnostic use has been to some extent supplied by imports, which were valued at $5.76 billion in 2024, down slightly from $5.83 billion in 2023, according to U.N. Comtrade data.
""It is actually more advantageous (for reagents to be local) because the timeliness requirement is high,"" said Ma Xingquan, co-president of pharmaceutical research firm ChemPartner PharmaTech.
Most reagents it uses in its pre-clinical work are products that are made in China by firms including Titan and Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology, he said.
ChemPartner's usage of locally made reagents would probably increase further as new products become available, Ma added.
TARIFF BUMP
The rush to use domestically made reagents has accelerated since April, the month China raised duties on U.S. goods to 125%, a manager at Titan and an executive at Vazyme said, though the levies have since been lowered as Beijing and Washington continue trade talks.
Some Chinese drugmakers were worried about tariff policy uncertainty, Titan product manager Yang Dong said.
Since April, more than 90% of Vazyme's customers have discussed replacing imported reagents with its products, Vazyme Senior Vice President Xu Xiaoyu said.
""Before April, customers were only saying long term, they hope to be able to replace (reagents) with those locally made, it would be better,"" Xu said. ""But to customers these tariffs are like a shock in a short period of time. They clearly felt this type of direct impact... their impetus (for replacement) will be stronger.""
Titan and Vazyme are both forecast to report strong sales growth this year, according to brokers.
China International Capital Corp expects Titan's annual revenue to grow 22% to 3.52 billion yuan ($490.39 million) this year, while Vazyme's revenue is set to rise 15% to 1.59 billion yuan over the same period, according to Soochow Securities.
""There is still a lot of room for substitution of imported biological reagent enzymes, clients are strongly interested in locally-made replacements,"" Soochow said in a recent note.
Shares in Titan and Vazyme have risen about 54% and 18% respectively since the start of the year. Merck and Thermo Fisher shares have fallen about 21% and 8% respectively over the same period.
CHINA CHALLENGES
Morningstar analyst Max Jousma expects China's reagents market to grow more than 10% annually over the next five years, driven by government support for the biotech and pharmaceutical sectors and growth in research and development activity and in-vitro diagnostic testing.
Merck and Swiss diagnostics group Roche Holding are moving some of their reagent production closer to their Chinese customers.
In 2023, Merck announced plans to invest 70 million euros ($81.35 million) in a reagents facility in Nantong that is on track to begin operations next year.
Merck declined to comment on any short-term shifts in ordering patterns from Chinese customers. ""The decision to invest in reagent manufacturing in Nantong reflects our commitment to supporting the growing needs of life science and biopharma customers in China and the broader Asia-Pacific region,"" it said in a statement.
Roche is expanding production, laboratory and logistics facilities from 2028 in Suzhou, where it produces reagents for diagnostic systems, the company said in a statement. The expansion will help it meet increasing demand for diagnostic solutions in China and parts of Asia-Pacific, it said.
Thermo Fisher declined to comment on its reagent sales and strategy to compete against local manufacturers in China, citing a policy of not providing details of its business by product line or country.
Chinese drugmakers that use reagents from Western companies and are looking to purchase substitutes from local firms will face some challenges given the products are difficult to switch during or after the regulatory approval process because of a need for material consistency, industry experts said.
""Switching reagents will cause significant disruption and delay for drug development,"" said Huang Linfeng, a scientist specialising in RNA biology at Duke Kunshan University.
Another hurdle is manufacturer access to technology or processes, some of which could still be protected under patent or not disclosed, said Cheng Shaojun, a vice-general manager at supplier Fu Chen (Tianjin) Chemical Reagents Co.
""(Reagent) production equipment is also not necessarily able to be bought,"" he added.

The global market for memory chips was valued at $240.77 billion last year and is expected to more than triple to $791.82 billion by 2033, according to the consultancy Imarc Group.
The Asia-Pacific region currently dominates the market, holding a share of 39.4% in 2024 due to its strong manufacturing base, technological improvements, and robust consumer electronics industry.
The region's significant investments in research, along with its role as a hub for semiconductor production, further solidify its dominance, Imarc said.
Micron Technology (MU) has seen a dramatic surge in DRAM sales.
Micron CEO Mehrotra: AI adoption 'a key driver'
The Boise, Idaho, company, which makes memory and storage chips for data centers, computers and smartphones, boosted its fiscal-fourth-quarter-earnings outlook, citing improved DRAM pricing and strong execution.
Micron, the largest U.S.-based memory-chip manufacturer, now expects to earn an adjusted $2.85 a share on revenue of $11.2 billion in the quarter ending Aug. 28.

Analysts were looking for earnings of $2.51 a share on revenue of $10.75 billion.
Micron had previously guided to fiscal Q4 adjusted earnings of $2.50 a share on sales of $10.7 billion. In the year-earlier quarter the company earned an adjusted $1.18 a share on revenue of $7.75 billion.
Micron's fiscal third-quarter revenue DRAM reached $7.1 billion, up 51% from a year earlier and accounting for 76% of its total.
“AI adoption remains a key driver of DRAM content growth for smartphones, and we expect more smartphone launches featuring 12 gigabytes or more compared to eight gigabytes of capacity in the average smartphone today,” Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra told analysts during the third-quarter-earnings call in June.
Mehrotra said the company had completed “a strategic reorganization of our business units around key market segments to capitalize on the tremendous AI growth opportunity ahead.”
The company, which beat Wall Street's fiscal-Q3 earnings and revenue forecasts, said data-center DRAM revenue had reached a record for a fourth consecutive quarter.
Chris Versace, lead manager for the TheStreet Pro's portfolio was impressed with Micron's revised guidance.
""That is the latest in a string of positive data points that inform us [that] demand for AI and data center chips is robust,"" he wrote in his Aug. 11 column. ""It may also confirm that the expected seasonal strength in smartphones and PCs is starting to play out.""
Analyst notes improving DRAM sales
Versace said that over the past few weeks he and the rest of the market digested the prospects for higher capital spending levels from Meta (META) , Alphabet (GOOGL) , Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) .
""Last week, July revenue reports from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Foxconn (FXCOF) underscored the ongoing strength in AI and data center demand, with Foxconn sharing that it sees its connected device end market entering the peak season in [second-half] 2025,"" he said.

""We see all the above as positive for our shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Marvell (MRVL) , as well as incrementally constructive for Qualcomm (QCOM) , Universal Display (OLED) and Apple (AAPL) shares,"" Versace added.
Micron shares are up 46% this year and up 32% from this time in 2024.
Mizuho raised its price target on Micron to $155 from $150 and affirmed an outperform rating on the shares after the company raised its August-quarter guidance for revenue, gross margin and EPS, citing ""improved pricing, particularly in DRAM, and strong execution,"" according to The Fly.
The investment firm sees continued strength in legacy DRAM pricing into the second half and high-bandwidth memory driving a five-times bump in average selling price from traditional DRAM. It said it would be buyers on any pullback in the stock price, seeing the DRAM memory market being ""stronger for longer."" (HBM is used for high-performance applications including artificial intelligence and graphics processing.)
JP Morgan boosted its target on Micron to $185 from $165 and maintained an overweight rating on the shares. The company issued a positive preannouncement on a strengthening pricing environment, the investment firm said. JP Morgan calls Micron well positioned for fiscal 2026.
And Deutsche Bank raised its target on Micron to $155 from $150 and reiterated a buy rating, based on Micron's outlook for stronger DRAM pricing. Deutsche Bank added that Micron was confident it could sell out its 2026 high-bandwidth-memory supply.

But logistics experts are warning that those higher prices are currently hiding in ""the middle mile,"" otherwise known as warehouses and distribution centers, and are yet to come.
The Trump administration's back-and-forth on tariffs has had U.S. importers scrambling to pull forward their freight to mitigate those rates, with that inventory now sitting in warehouses.
Zachary Rogers, lead author of the Logistics Managers' Index and assistant professor of supply chain management at Colorado State University, explained during the Port of Los Angeles July news update that the increase in inventory is the reason why price increases related to the tariffs have not been seen across the board.
""We are seeing price increases right now in back-to-school kids' apparel, toys, and things like that,"" said Rogers. ""But consumers haven't seen the really big impact of any inflation yet because it is sitting in the middle mile (warehouses). I would expect that we will see inventories move down in September.""
Rogers said retailer inventories generally peak in the middle of October, but with the front-loading this year, warehouse capacity has moderately expanded as well as prices.
""Essentially, what this is telling us is peak season is happening in sort of a bifurcated way,"" said Rogers.
Mike Short, president of global forwarding at C.H. Robinson, told CNBC that peak season items, which will make their way onto store shelves for the holidays, were pushed two to three months earlier this year and are being stored. Comparing this peak season to last year, however, volumes are not as strong.
""We've seen customers that are actually having to bring that inventory into their own distribution centers, and they're actually having to have to carry that cost,"" said Short. ""But whether that (warehouse costs) gets passed on to the end consumer or not, is really spread across the board, and that also goes with tariffs, carrying costs. It's really across the board on what our customers are deciding to do.""
Short said they are having active conversations with clients on how to manage their inventory and bring in their freight in a timely and efficient manner.
""We've seen with our customers is, instead of the supply chain expense being a line item in their P and L (profit and loss statement), it's becoming a boardroom C-level conversation,"" said Short.
The pulling forward of freight may have been a mitigation tool to avoid higher tariffs, but warehouse space has gotten tighter as a result, which has also increased prices..
Karl Siebrecht, CEO of flexible warehouse firm Flexe, said that across the company's enterprise and mid-market customers, they are seeing increased demand for flexible warehousing from some importers and distributors to buffer their Q4 inventory.
""They brought in earlier than typical to get ahead of tariffs,"" he said. ""At the same time, many retailers' inventory levels are softer due to continued uncertainty around tariffs and consumer confidence more broadly.""
Siebrecht said that inventories leaving warehouses will start to hit in September and October, which will go to retailers' distribution centers.
""This inventory then starts flowing outbound in later Oct and early Nov in time to stock retail shelves and fill up ecommerce fulfillment centers for Black Friday, said Siebrecht. "" Replenishment to retail stores and FCs continues through mid December.""
That buildup of inventory is being reflected in activity at the U.S.'s busiest ports. Gene Seroka, executive director for the Port of Los Angeles, said that as of now, the number of vessels calling the port for the month of August is ""really solid"".
""It is less than July, and less than what we witnessed last August,"" said Seroka, ""But that is due to a buildup of inventory. So not a loser of a month, but really, I think we're going to start to see the product dwindle, just simply because of all the inventory that's in the country.""
The ever-changing landscape of tariffs has also impacted supply chains. Vietnam, a winner in the China-plus-one manufacturing strategy, is now facing a 30% transloading fee. Short says this fee, along with the latest 50% tariff on India, shows just how dynamic the situation is for companies, especially as China finds new places to ship its products.
""We're seeing freight going more from China to Europe,"" said Short. ""We're seeing freight going more into Mexico. We're seeing freight go into Southeast Asia, or originating from Southeast Asia. But honestly, up until this point, our volumes into the U.S., out of all of Asia, have remained fairly steady and and who knows what the future holds, but it has not been as devastating as once people would have thought at the beginning of when tariffs started to be the topic of conversation.""
It's unclear how consumers will react once if this supply chain situation results in higher priced items.
Peter Boockvar, Bleakley Advisory Group CIO, said that consumers still have PTSD from the 2021 and 2022 spike in prices, and that is one reason why overall consumer confidence ""is well below its pre-Covid levels.""
""There is no patience for further increases in their cost of living and people don't care if tariffs are a possible one-time step up in price or not. To them, it's another inflationary pain point with more tariff hits to come,"" he said.",731ac633d6295a311bf29d17788f8c06,trafilatura,5514,0

Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee thought about that Wednesday as he toured Mel-O-Cream Donuts in Springfield, Illinois.
Even inside a donut shop, the effects of tariffs on the economy can be seen. ""It's sort of surprising, because donuts seem like a very local product, and yet they get some ingredients like palm oil that are coming from Indonesia,"" Goolsbee said. The Trump administration set tariffs on Indonesia at 19%.
""They have to now figure out what are the tariff rates, and the tariffs went up a significant amount. If that happens, that could have a multi-thousand-dollar impact on their operation,"" he continued. But, he added, ""I hope it's not a sign of something more extended or broader in the way that the Covid inflation ... generated its own snowballing, in which it was supposed to go away and it didn't go away.""

That tariff will cost Chris Larson, a co-owner of Mel-O-Cream, ""about $4,000 per shipment per week,"" he said. And that used to be somewhere ""closer to $2,000 to $2,100 weekly. Now it's going to move up to $4,200 ... for the exact same product.""
Goolsbee's visit matters because he's one of just 12 people in the country who get to decide what to do with interest rates. The Fed's rate-setting committee will next decide whether to cut or hold on Sept. 17, and the perspectives of businesses like Mel-O-Cream are instrumental in helping him determine his next vote.
Larson's hope? That the Fed will cut interest rates, which would help Mel-O-Cream finance new equipment to cut costs in labor and blunt the impact of tariffs.
""What is the cost of money in order to expand, to upgrade, to update? What do those things look like?"" Larson said. ""Those things do concern us, and we would love to see, as everyone would, the interest rates would come down.""
Goolsbee said he wasn't yet ready to tie his hands to an interest rate cut in September.
""Let's get a few months of data before we make any conclusions. The hardest thing that the Fed ever has to do is get the timing right at moments of transition,"" he said Wednesday on NBC News' ""Here's the Scoop"" podcast. ""I think as we go through this fall, September, November, December, all of those are live moments that we could be cutting rates.""
Government data Thursday showed that wholesale prices paid by U.S. companies rose much more than expected. Another measure, the consumer price index, showed Tuesday that inflation remained stubbornly high in July.
The Fed's target for inflation is 2%, lower than the most recent consumer inflation reading of 2.7% and producer inflation reading of 3.3%. Even with those numbers, the market still anticipates a cut next month.
President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on hundreds of trading partners around the world could affect the cost of most of the imports that businesses buy from overseas. With a myriad of rates as high as 50%, businesses may be faced with a new maze of rates and tariff bills, as well as the uncertainty that comes with the on-again, off-again tariff rollout.
""The Fed, by law, is supposed to maximize employment and stabilize prices. So it's inflation and employment that are really the twin towers of how we think about setting of rates,"" Goolsbee said, underscoring the Federal Reserve's role in the broader economy.
""There are parts of the job market where there's still basically labor shortages. It's very hard for people to find workers. And that's what you kind of saw here at the donut factory,"" he said.
Goolsbee oversees the Seventh Federal Reserve District, which includes Iowa, much of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin.
Some of his colleagues, including Jeffrey Schmid, of the Kansas City Fed; Alberto Musalem, of the St. Louis Fed; and Beth Hammack, of the Cleveland Fed, are sounding similarly cautious tones about the economy. All three current Federal Open Market Committee voters have said in recent days that it's either too early to decide or that keeping rates steady for now would be their preference.
The futures market predicts the Fed will cut by 0.25% at its next meeting. But some, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, think the Fed should make a more dramatic cut, by up to a half-point.
Musalem said Wednesday on CNBC that a cut that large would be ""unsupported by the current state of the economy.""
Amid unrelenting attacks from Trump and his administration against the FOMC and Chair Jerome Powell, Goolsbee, who was an economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said economic indicators should drive monetary policymaking, not politics.
""The FOMC and my own thinking are that what should drive interest rate decisions should be the economic conditions and the economic outlook,"" he said. ""I invite anybody to look at the minutes or read the transcripts of the FOMC — the people on that body take extremely seriously that it is the economy that should drive the decisions. And that is what drives the decisions.""
""This is a committee made up of people from a lot of different perspectives. And as I say, they keep track of, word for word, what everyone says at the meetings. And you can look at it yourself.""",f5177ddab87f599dc3127f2d02593542,trafilatura,5489,0

So she convinced a family member to tag along.
""They would meet up with me when my son needed to be nursed,"" she said. ""We also had the evenings together.""
The trip worked so well that Colkmire took more business trips with non-colleague companions.
""My grandma went to Houston with me, a friend went to St. Paul, and my mom helped me when I needed to do a job in Washington D.C.,"" she said. ""Each person loved getting the free trip.""
More than half of business travelers (55%) have had loved ones join their work trips, according to a survey of 4,000 adults from the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and Spain published Wednesday by the travel tech company TravelPerk.
Among C-suite executives, the number jumped to 73% — with executives saying they've had partners (53%), children (22%), friends (21%), and even pets (7%) join their business trips, according to TravelPerk's data.
Companionship and cost savings
For some, bringing loved ones on business trips is a way to reclaim time together, according to Jean-Christophe Taunay-Bucalo, TravelPerk's president and COO.
""Traveling for work can be lonely,"" he told CNBC Travel. ""Work trips can be an opportunity to experience something new, and by taking a loved one along, you remain connected.""
Plus, business travelers don't have to miss family time, be it bedtimes or birthdays, said Taunay-Bucalo.
""For me, it's about having the best of both worlds, and sometimes performing at my peak also means seeing my kid at the end of a work day — it provides some normality,"" he said.
Other business travelers who spoke to CNBC said there is another motivation — money.
Colkmire, who now runs a travel website, recalled the time she joined her husband on a work trip to Vienna, Austria.
""Our expense was cut in half, which was a huge blessing so that we were able to explore an area of the world that we had not yet been to without breaking the bank,"" she said.
Bridgette Borst Ombres, a former journalist turned public relations consultant, said she has used work trips to create ""budget-friendly mini-vacations"" for her family.
""Attending a tech conference at Disney World in Orlando, Florida, was the perfect business trip to bring along my husband and then-2-year-old daughter,"" she said. ""The conference lasted two days, so while I was working, my husband took our daughter to visit his dad, who lived in the area, and we'd meet up for dinner in the evenings.""
I didn't keep [my] travel plans a secret, nor did I broadcast them to coworkers.Bridgette Borst Ombresfounder of The Commsultant
After the conference ended, Ombres and her family spent a few days at Walt Disney World.
""My hotel was covered by my company for the first two days, but I paid for the additional nights and all of our activities. My plane ticket was also covered by the company but I purchased my husband's ticket separately,"" she said.
That blend of personal and business travel, or ""bleisure"" as it's known, was valued at $315 billion in 2022 by Allied Market Research. The advisory firm projects blended trips will reach $731 billion globally by 2032.
To tell or not to tell?
Bringing loved ones on business trips is common and generally accepted, said Frank Harrison, regional security director for the Americas at risk management company World Travel Protection.
However, that doesn't mean that employees are revealing their plans to their companies.
""I didn't keep [my] travel plans a secret, nor did I broadcast them to coworkers,"" Ombres said. ""Part of it was worrying it might come across as unprofessional.""
Deepak Shukla, CEO of the London-based marketing company Pearl Lemon, said he's turned three-day work trips into week-long adventures with his wife in New York City, Lisbon, Dubai and Tokyo.
""I don't hide it from my team,"" he said. ""If the work's done and costs aren't creeping into the company card, it's nobody's business.""
However, he said big corporations often view traveling with family as a ""policy grey zone.""
""The sticking points are expense claims, insurance coverage, and whether leisure days blur into workdays ... [which are] messy for tax and liability,"" he said. ""That's why some companies quietly allow it but expect employees to keep receipts and activities clearly split.""
Business first
Ombres said allowing family and friends to join business trips can boost morale and build loyalty among employees.
""I'm all for it,"" she said. ""As long as it doesn't interfere with the work.""
She said she sets clear expectations for work to be completed on trips, and as long as that's met, ""there's no reason to try to micromanage how people spend their personal time.""
Gabe Richman, CEO of Seattle-based biotech company Omic, agreed, saying he's combined work trips with family vacations in San Diego and Frankfurt, Germany.
He said he encourages employees to travel with loved ones as long as ""business objectives are met first."" He said employees should clearly separate personal and work expenses and ensure companies incur no additional costs. Travelers should also be transparent about their plans with their companies, he said.
Beyond that, travelers should make the most of the trip — for business and pleasure.
""Business takes me to places we'd never vacation to otherwise."" he said. ""Why waste the opportunity?""",e0057cb4b4604425e90d3c2905fad9e2,trafilatura,5436,0

It lands between May, when many investors ""sell in May and go away,"" and September, which has historically had a pattern of being the worst month of the year for stocks. But the market's common summer swoons -- which can largely be attributed to the behavioral biases of investors -- shouldn't matter to long-term investors.
After all, the S&P 500 has still delivered an average annualized return of about 10% since its inception in 1957. So if you don't mind a little near-term volatility, August can still be a great time to add to your portfolio, and ASML(NASDAQ: ASML), CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD), and ServiceNow(NYSE: NOW) are three great tech stocks worth buying today.
ASML
ASML is the world's top supplier of photolithography systems, which are used to optically etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. It's also the only producer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines -- the only ones capable of operating at a fine enough level of detail to make today's most advanced, densest, and most power-efficient chips.
ASML's monopoly in that crucial technology makes it a linchpin of the semiconductor sector. All of the world's top foundries -- including TSMC, Samsung, and Intel -- use its EUV systems to manufacture cutting-edge chips.
In 2024, ASML suffered a slowdown as it lapped the AI market's initial growth spurt, its non-AI markets grew at a slower rate, and it was barred from selling even its older lithography systems to customers in China. But from 2024 to 2027, analysts expect its revenue and EPS to grow at compound annual rates of 10% and 17%, respectively.
That growth should be driven by the memory chip market's cyclical recovery, the AI market's expansion, and the rollout of its latest high-NA EUV lithography systems for manufacturing even smaller and more sophisticated chips. That's an impressive projected growth trajectory for a stock that trades at just 25 times next year's expected earnings.
CrowdStrike
Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike only provides subscription-based services via the cloud. That approach, which is stickier and easier for customers to scale as they expand, sets it apart from older cybersecurity companies, which often install on-site appliances at their clients' locations that consume more power, take up space, and require regular maintenance.
CrowdStrike's first-mover advantage in the cloud-native cybersecurity space gives it an edge over its peers. In its latest reported quarter, 48% of its customers were using at least six of its Falcon platform's cloud-based modules. That was up from 44% a year earlier. As a cybersecurity leader, its business is also resistant to economic downturns because even when belt-tightening is necessary, most companies won't shut off their digital defenses just to save a few dollars.
From its fiscal 2025 (which ended this January) to its fiscal 2028, analysts expect CrowdStrike's revenue to grow at a compound annual rate of 22%. They also expect it to turn profitable again on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis in its fiscal 2027 and more than triple its net income in fiscal 2028. Its stock might seem a bit pricey at 18 times next year's expected sales, but its robust growth rates and cloud-based advantages justify that higher valuation.
ServiceNow
ServiceNow is a cloud-based company that helps large companies organize their unstructured work patterns into automated digital workflows. Its Now Assist AI platform further accelerates that process with generative AI chatbots and automation tools.
ServiceNow's business is naturally insulated from macroeconomic headwinds. As the economy expands, more companies will use its services to optimize their expansion efforts. But if the economy contracts, they'll use its platform to cut costs and automate more jobs with AI. During its latest conference call, CEO Bill McDermott proclaimed that ""AI is the new UI,"" and said that ServiceNow's platform was becoming the ""extensible AI operating system"" for agentic AI applications.
From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect ServiceNow's revenue and GAAP EPS to grow at compound annual rates of 19% and 28%, respectively. Its stock might also seem a bit pricey at 77 times next year's expected earnings, but it remains a great play on the secular growth of the cloud and AI markets.

",2025-08-14 20:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Great investing often comes down to asking simple questions at the right time. Today's biggest questions about Ethereum(CRYPTO: ETH) are whether it can surpass the $5,000 level and, more importantly, what drivers are in play to make such a move happen. It's currently priced in the mid-$4,000s, so getting the answers right means potentially capturing some significant upside.
Strong and persistent tailwinds are already blowing. The chain just locked in a major upgrade, its exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are gathering serious assets, its staking is delivering a meaningful yield, and corporate treasuries are showing up to buy and tighten the supply.
Here's how that stack could be enough to nudge this coin over $5,000 before 2026.
Durable catalysts are already in motion
Better-than-ever platform technology is underpinning Ethereum's bull run right now.
On May 7, Ethereum implemented Pectra, its latest upgrade, bundling a slate of improvements focused on usability, staking mechanics, and throughput. Pectra formalized account abstraction behavior for regular crypto wallets, which is a fancy way of saying everyday transactions are now safer and more flexible. It also raised the validator effective balance ceiling, letting larger operators consolidate and run fewer, fatter validators with less overhead, thereby effectively increasing their realized staking yield after expenses.
Another major upgrade called Fusaka is anticipated for late 2025 or early 2026. If delivered, it should further cut costs for Layer-2s (L2s) and support more activity. The takeaway here is that Ethereum is going to continue to work on scaling more efficiently to reduce congestion on the main network, hopefully cutting gas fees and transaction times even further in the process.
Capital is also showing up now, and big time. From July 2024 until the end of July of this year, U.S.-based spot Ether ETFs attracted roughly $8.7 billion of net inflows, with about half arriving in just the last two weeks of that period. There's no indication of these inflows slowing at the moment.
Staking is the quieter trend that's incentivizing the parking of capital on the chain. Headline staking yields for Ethereum sit in the low single digits, typically around 2% to 3% before fees. That's not about to make anyone rich, but for institutional investors looking to allocate capital, it's meaningful.
Finally, direct corporate ownership has arrived. A growing list of public companies now disclose holding Ether on their balance sheets. And unlike retail investor flows, corporate treasuries tend to be sticky once established.
This cocktail of bullish forces does not ensure that the coin's price will follow a straight line upwards. It does mean that Ethereum does not need perfection or any new major catalysts to add another 10% from here. It just needs the status quo to keep going, which looks to be happening without a hitch so far.
There aren't as many risks as before, but one important problem remains
Now, let's discuss the caveats that could stop this coin from reaching $5,000 in the near term.
Ethereum still faces fierce competition on speed and cost from faster chains, specifically Solana. Even if every upgrade closes that gap a bit, there's still a very long way for it to go before it's truly competitive. But that's more of a longer-term concern than something that would interrupt its ongoing uptrend.
Separately, ETF inflows can reverse if macro conditions become less favorable, risk appetite fades, or gas fees spike due to high network utilization and users once again decamp to cheaper venues.
For investors, the playbook here is pretty easy.
The investment thesis for buying and holding Ethereum remains that it is the settlement layer for a large slice of programmable finance via smart contracts. Pectra's delivery and the ETF bid both support that thesis rather than threatening it.
Accordingly, the coin is quite likely to reach $5,000 before 2026. Even if it doesn't, it's still more likely to be climbing than it is to be falling.
So if you believe the upgrade-plus-ETF-plus-staking loop will continue, dollar-cost averaging (DCAing) into Ether and holding it through the noise is a sensible approach. The chain's doldrums are done with for the time being, and there should be plenty of upside left in the tank here.

Historically, the S&P 500 has performed the worst during August and September.
Here's what Wall Street forecasters are predicting for the volatile stretch into early fall.
It's been a strong summer for stocks, but investors are about to enter what is historically the worst period of the year for the market.
The period from late July to mid-October is a tough stretch, with August and September often seeing the worst of the volatility.
The S&P 500 has dipped by an average 0.6% in August over the last 35 years, according to an analysis from the financial services firm StoneX.
That's only slightly better than September, in which the S&P 500 has shed nearly 1% on average since 1990.
""August has historically been a month where stock market volatility rises,"" the firm wrote in note, adding that the VIX, the stock market's fear gauge, has climbed by an average eight percentage points during the month since 1990.
Concerns of a looming pullback have been creeping into sentiment on Wall Street, with more forecasters warning of a stock market correction in recent weeks.
Here's what strategists think could be coming for the market, and how much they think stocks could drop in the coming months.
Evercore ISI: up to a 15% drop
Evercore ISI has one of the most bearish views among Wall Street firms. The investment bank's research arm thinks the S&P 500 could be headed for as much as a 15% correction in the coming months. That implies the benchmark index falling to around 5,400 from its current level.
In a recent note to clients, Julian Emanuel, the firm's chief equity strategist, pointed to lofty valuations in stocks. Investors, meanwhile, could be getting overconfident and too wrapped up in the fear of missing out, he said, adding that his year-end target for the S&P 500 was 5,600.
""FOMO has begun,"" Emanuel wrote. ""Stocks have overdiscounted the potential for continued good news.""
Stifel: Up to a 14% drop
Stifel said it saw the market dropping as much as 14% before the end of the year.
The firm said on Monday that valuations in the benchmark index look ""very extended,"" comparing the excitement for stocks to the euphoria at the peak of the dot-com bubble.
Stifel has also been warning of stagflation in the US economy, a dreaded scenario where inflation remains hot while growth slows. That situation is often thought of as even worse than a typical recession, as higher prices prevent the central bank from cutting interest rates to give the economy a lift.
""The lesson of history is that it is usually a sudden economic slowdown, which is what we forecast for 2H 2025. Slowdowns come in different forms and this one is stagflation, which is already noticeably slowing consumer spending,"" strategists wrote.
Morgan Stanley: Up to 10% drop
Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer, said he saw as much as a 10% correction coming for the benchmark index. That's largely because the impact of tariffs will continue to flow through the economy and affect corporate earnings, he said, which could spark a modest pullback in the S&P 500.
""As we've been saying, the third quarter is probably the quarter of risk, where you'll see some of this flow through to the cost of goods sold. I don't think this is a massive correction,"" Wilson told Bloomberg last month.
In a separate note in August, a team of strategists led by Wilson added that fears of hotter inflation in the US could cause the Fed to keep interest rates higher for longer, another factor that's expected to be bearish for stocks.
Still, the bank remains optimistic about the market over the long term. Wilson said Morgan Stanley planned to buy any pullback in the market, thanks to an overarching bullish backdrop for stocks.
""I think the pullbacks will be short and shallow. Maybe there'll be another surprise, another test of some kind that will be something more severe. But I really can't see more than a 5%-10% correction,"" he added.
Wells Fargo: Up to a 10% drop
The S&P 500 dropping as much as 10% would be reasonable, according to Scott Wren, the senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo.
Speaking to CNBC this week, Wren said he expected more volatility in the overall market, and pointed to several factors that could drive a decline in the benchmark index.
Uncertainty stemming from President Donald Trump's tariffs. Economists have said the full effect of tariffs has yet to be seen in the economic data. The deadline for the US-China trade deal has also been extended for another 90 days, meaning higher tariffs on China remain an unknown hanging over the market.

""This is not the environment to be a hero in,"" Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management, wrote this month in a newsletter.
In other words: Stick to your long-term investment plan, including an appropriate asset allocation and time frame to reach your goals, experts said. Avoid the temptation to funnel a big chunk of money into high-flying shiny objects like individual technology stocks or cryptocurrency, they said.
""You need to own a basket of quality assets and investments, hold your breath and let markets do their work,"" Cox said in an interview with CNBC.
To be sure, this is sound perennial advice typically offered by financial planners.
But some market-watchers caution that economic headwinds could serve up ample volatility in the coming months.
""I think there are a lot of reasons to be optimistic, but also cautious at the same time,"" said Winnie Sun, co-founder of Sun Group Wealth Partners, based in Irvine, California, and a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council.
Economic headwinds
The job market appears to have weakened considerably, for example.
Employers in the public and private sectors added 35,000 jobs, on average, over the past three months, according to federal data.
Job growth from May to July is happening at a ""pace you normally see around or in recessions,"" Cox wrote.
It's also down from average monthly growth of 123,000 jobs during the same three-month period of 2024, and from 111,000 in the first three months of 2025.
The size of the U.S. labor force has declined for three consecutive months, which hasn't happened since 2011, Cox wrote.
""The job market is in a precarious spot after months of slowing consumer spending,"" Cox wrote. ""The American consumer drives the economy, and the economy ultimately drives the direction of markets,"" she added.
Economists also worry about inflation reigniting as tariffs levied by the Trump administration work their way into higher prices for consumer goods and services.
There have been some signs of that in recent months, and many economists expect that inflationary pressure to bite harder in coming months.
'People are feeling like they'll be left behind'
Despite these headwinds, experts say the economy isn't in dire shape. The stock market has also continued to march to new highs, with the S&P 500 stock index up about 10% since the start of the year.
Many of Sun's clients have shown urgent interest in artificial intelligence and crypto amid lofty returns, versus more bread-and-butter long-term planning, she said.
Shares in tech giants like Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia are up about 34%, 24% and 36%, respectively, this year, for example. Bitcoin prices are also up over 25%.
It's a ""hurry-up-and-invest"" mindset, Sun said.
""A lot of people are feeling like they'll be left behind,"" she said. ""But we don't feel like we have the full picture yet on where the U.S. is economically.""
Tariff policy has whipsawed in recent months, leaving markets and investors grasping for answers as new import duties are announced, delayed or rescinded in a rapid-fire fashion, according to market-watchers.
""Right now, we feel it's best to stick with diversified and long-term plans,"" Sun said.
""A lot of the decisions being made right now are not financially driven,"" she said. ""I think it's much more emotions-driven.""
Diversification and rebalancing are 'key'
Sun advises investors to be well-diversified, and avoid the temptation to over-allocate their portfolio to growth-oriented sectors like technology. Having a well-diversified portfolio diversifies risks in the event lackluster economic data send markets tumbling, she said.
Exchange-traded funds or mutual funds, which are baskets of several different securities like stocks and bonds overseen by professional asset managers, can help the average investor stay diversified, she said.
ETFs often carry relatively low fees compared with mutual funds, and so can offer a cheap way to diversify.
Rebalancing more frequently in this environment is ""key,"" Cox said.
That entails ensuring your asset allocation hasn't been thrown out of whack if certain segments of your portfolio outperform or underperform for a period of time.
""You never want to hit a market selloff and be more exposed to it than you think,"" Cox said.
Jacob Manoukian, U.S. head of investment strategy, at J.P. Morgan Private Bank, cautions that taking too much risk off the table could also have adverse outcomes for investors.
Companies continue to have strong corporate earnings despite some relatively weak economic data — a dynamic that can persist for a while, he said.
""It's hard to give advice to reduce risk substantially when corporate earnings are as strong as they are,"" Manoukian said.
""When companies are surprising to the upside to that degree, we'd encourage investors and our clients to have the right amount of risk for their plan and not reduce risk unduly — that's a way to underperform,"" Manoukian said.",c33d94525ca7722dd71197eda9b9195a,trafilatura,5132,0

Gradual price increases in July gave investors more confidence around the Federal Reserve’s ability to cut interest rates in September, which could help insulate the economy from President Donald Trump’s tariff fight.
Yet a growing concern has been that tariff shocks still lurk on the horizon. Should that happen, higher prices could clamp down further on consumer spending — the economy’s biggest driver.
“I am losing sleep based on the unknowns around tariffs,” said Mike Petrakis, founder and chief executive at PowerPay, a fintech home-improvement lender that expects to do $5 billion to $6 billion in originations this year, which would be a record for the company.
While inflation has been hitting lower-income homeowners harder than wealthier clients, Petrakis said consumers replacing a roof or remodeling a bathroom still aren’t yet seeing tariffs resulting in higher prices for projects.
That’s because big national contractors on PowerPay’s platform have been able to absorb those costs for now, taking a modest hit to their margins, according to Petrakis.
However, he expects consumers to see prices on home-improvement projects to be reset next year, though he hopes instead that “tariff noise goes away” in six months.
PowerPay, which started lending in late 2019, has been in the unique position of benefiting from a boom in home improvements since the pandemic.
As home prices skyrocketed during the COVID crisis, owners with ultralow 30-year fixed mortgage rates started taping into the trillions of dollars in new home equity to fix up their homes. But like other businesses, those projects also hinge on the ability and willingness of consumers to keep spending.
“So far, many businesses have managed to soften the impact of rising costs by relying on pre-tariff inventories, utilizing trade zones and accepting slimmer profit margins,” said Lydia Boussour, a senior economist at EY-Parthenon, in a Tuesday client note.
The consumer-price index rose 0.3% in July, increasing less than expected. It was steady at 2.7% on a yearly basis.
Still, when tariff “buffers gradually fade, inflation will likely intensify in the coming months,” Boussour said, adding that her team expects yearly headline and core CPI inflation to near 3.2% by year’s end — “entirely a function of the administration’s tariff-centric trade agenda.”
What’s priced in?
Consumers getting hit with higher costs from tariffs could set up investors for trouble.
“If things get too quiet, even the tiniest little thing could cause volatility to spike or cause the equity market to get hurt,” said Joe Ferrara, an investment strategist at Gateway Investment Advisers, which manages low-volatility equity strategies.
While he thinks companies have grown more cautious, including by lowering their guidance in light of Trump’s tariffs, a reckoning for households looks likely.
“I still don’t think the consumer has fully felt the brunt of all the tariffs,” Ferrara said Tuesday. Paying a dollar more for bunch of bananas might be manageable, he said, but anyone needing to buy a big-ticket item, like a new washing machine or a car, could face paying hundreds of dollars more, due to tariffs, he said.
“That’s a big impact,” he said. “The next year or so could be really interesting for the consumer, if we still stay in this kind of inflation picture.”
The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA both added 1.1% on Tuesday, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP gained 1.4% and Wall Street’s Cboe Volatility Index, VIX or “fear gauge,” tumbled more than 9% to 14.73, its lowest close since Dec. 26, according to FactSet.
So who is spending?
A fresh look at spending patterns by U.S. income groups shows the highest earners have been driving growth in the wake of the pandemic, almost by themselves.
Researchers at the Federal Reserve, in a July paper, found that high-income households earning at least $100,000 a year continued to spend strongly since mid-2021, while spending by low- and middle-income households lagged through the end of 2024.
“We’ve just got this huge bifurcated economy right now,” said Byron Anderson, head of fixed income at Laffer Tengler Investments, noting that U.S. corporations may be doing well, but lower-income earners already looked tapped out when it comes to spending.
Anderson thinks corporations can handle “eating” tariffs for now, but that they eventually would lead to lower growth and lower earnings.
Rate cuts from the Fed could help, especially if another weak jobs report causes panic and results in a few jumbo-sized rate cuts. Still, Anderson worries it still might be too late to save the broader consumer.
Petrakis, the CEO at PowerPay, thinks Fed rate cuts could help, but that the 30-year fixed mortgage rate still would need to drop to around 5.5% to spur a fresh refinancing wave, a level last seen in 2022.",2278477360a941b83aac50c83651a140,trafilatura,5034,0

IonQ : Which is the Better Quantum Computing Stock ? ,2025-08-14 20:45:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Quantum computing stocks are absolutely sizzling right now. Over the last year, two companies that have emerged as frontrunners in the quantum computing revolution are IonQ(NYSE: IONQ) and D-Wave Quantum.
In just 12 months, shares of IonQ have gained 511% while D-Wave Quantum stock has skyrocketed by nearly 2,000% as of this writing (Aug. 12).
Let's take a look at how each of these companies is investing in quantum computing technology and determine which artificial intelligence (AI) newcomer is the better buy.
Taking a look at IonQ's business
IonQ is taking a rather interesting approach to developing quantum computing applications. Instead of allocating its financial horsepower toward traditional supercomputers, IonQ offers quantum computing as a service that is accessed through cloud infrastructure.
This quantum-as-a-service (QaaS) approach is both unique and flexible, as companies leveraging Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), or Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform (GCP) can access IonQ's quantum services directly through cloud-based integrations.
While IonQ's revenue has steadily risen over the last few years, the company's profitability has moved in the opposite direction. On the surface, investors might want to give IonQ some leniency here. Developing quantum computing requires hefty sums allocated toward research and development (R&D) and capital expenditures (capex).
At the end of the second quarter, IonQ boasted just $140 million on its balance sheet. When accounting for short-term investments in U.S. bonds, the company's cash and equivalents rises to $547 million. Furthermore, even after layering long-term bond investments on top of this sum, IonQ's total liquidity of $656 million is barely enough to cover another year's worth of operations under the current burn profile. With this position, the company may resort to further stock issuances to raise capital.
Given these dynamics, I think it's fair to question whether or not IonQ truly offers a viable solution that will yield improved unit economics in the long run.
How does D-Wave compare to the competition?
D-Wave's approach to quantum computing is through the development of annealing services -- tools that are oriented for niche problem solving at fast speeds.
The table below summarizes D-Wave's revenue and profitability over the last 12 months:
Data Source: D-Wave Investor Relations
There is a lot to unpack from the financial profile above. The first anomaly that sticks out is the lumpiness of D-Wave's revenue -- with roughly 68% of trailing-12-months sales occurring in just one quarter. To me, the inconsistency of D-Wave's revenue generation suggests that its annealing tools are not yet fetching robust demand.
In addition, the company's liquidity continues to rise despite having barely any sales coming through the door and losses mounting each quarter. How is that possible?
Just like IonQ is doing, D-Wave is tapping the capital markets to raise cash through multiple series of at-the-money (ATM) offerings.
IonQ vs. D-Wave Quantum: Which is the better stock?
If I had to choose a winner between IonQ and D-Wave Quantum, my preference would lean toward IonQ as the superior choice. With that said, I see both stocks as highly speculative opportunities.
Right now, both IonQ and D-Wave have limited business traction in the grand scheme of things. Nevertheless, each company trades at market capitalizations well into the billions and boasts valuation multiples that echo what investors witnessed during previous stock market bubbles. Management at both companies seem to recognize this frothiness -- continuing to raise capital at these inflated stock prices.
While this may be acceptable in the short-term, it is not a sustainable capital allocation strategy. It raises doubts about their ability to achieve critical scale, generate accelerating revenue, and transition to positive unit economics.
For that reason, I'd steer clear of both stocks unless you are prepared to assume outsized levels of risk and volatility.

With US equities at or near record highs, there is space for President Donald Trump to risk some unpopularity. One of the primary checks on his presidency is the stress his policies place on the capital markets. Market sell-offs are inevitably met with exercise of the “Trump put”. Markets are growing complacent to US trade escalations and de-escalations and are increasingly sanguine around the economic consequences (Figure 1).
Loosening the market straitjacket raises the risk of escalations in trade conflicts. Financial market volatility is near multi-year lows, suggesting markets no longer view the 15%-20% blanket duties floated recently by Trump as a penalty but as the new normal.
Figure 1: Investors in US equities take recent trade announcements, threats in their stride
S&P 500 Index, price
#2 – US economy resilient. Second quarter GDP rebounded 0.7% quarter-on-quarter and the normally dependable GDPNow suggests positive US growth in Q3. While Scope Ratings (Scope) has reduced its 2025 growth forecast on the US to 1.8%, this is higher than growth across most advanced economies. Scope has raised 2026 US growth to 2.1%. Although current tariffs are much higher than in recent decades, they are not high enough to impose effective embargoes on imports or cause severe economic losses. In addition, price rises from higher trade barriers have taken longer than anticipated to meaningfully lift inflation.
#3 – Rising customs revenues are helping to trim the US budget deficit. US Treasury data point to customs duties increasing to a record USD 66bn in Q2, with a further USD 28bn collected in July. This compares with monthly averages of less than USD 7bn last year. This revenue helps trim the burgeoning US general government deficit, which Scope estimates at an elevated 5.4% of GDP this year.
#4 – Trading partners’ responses have been limited and bilateral. Despite the many threats of reprisals, only China and Canada have significantly countered US tariffs. Many other governments including the UK and those in the EU have been wary of harming multilateral trading rules and global supply chains as well as the weaker growth and higher prices from any escalation. Trading partners have responded by pledging more than USD 1trn of investment in the US to appease Trump and de-escalate, while slashing duties on US imports and facilitating market access for US goods.
Reliance on US security guarantees – and Washington’s willingness to withhold them – has compelled many countries, including in the EU, to give some ground. Trump’s preference for bilateral rather than multilateral negotiations has limited any reprisal and encouraged competition within regional clusters for preferential trading terms with the US. As long as the responses of trading partners remain bilateral rather than multilateral, a trade war favours the US.
The widening gap between tariffs imposed by the US and those imposed by trading partners on the US as well as on one another has created a two-tier global trading system that may strengthen relative trading terms for the US in the longer run – helping to curtail annual trade deficits.
#5 –Conducive domestic politics currently favour escalation. Republican Party concerns about major losses in 2026 mid-term elections have eased as the president’s approval rating remains around 90% with his party’s voters. The passage of the “Big Beautiful Bill” has bolstered the president’s political capital.
Average Duties at Multi-decade Highs Cut Global Output
Average US customs duties have risen sharply to 18.6%, up from the 2.5% at the end of 2024 and 1.5% in 2016 ahead of Trump’s first administration. While current tariffs remain off the “Liberation Day” highs of nearly 30%, they are still at their annual highs since the 1930s (Figure 2). This includes 15% average duties on advanced-economy trading partners and 21.4% on emerging economies.
This has consequences for the global economy: Scope projects a cumulative medium-term reduction in global output of 0.7pps (Figure 3). The effects on the US economy are only slightly greater, at 0.9pps, as re-shoring gradually trims the cumulative costs. More modest consequences are estimated for the EU economy, at 0.4pps. Scope has reduced 2025 global growth by 0.4pps to 3.0%.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected the country's gross domestic product (GDP) to expand by a tepid 0.1% over the period, up from bumper growth of 0.7% in the first quarter.
Month-on-month, the economy grew 0.4% in June after a 0.1% contraction in May, failing to shake off the impact of U.S. tariffs and business uncertainty.
""The economy was weak across April and May, with some activity having been brought forward to February and March ahead of Stamp Duty and tariff changes, but then recovered strongly In June,"" Liz McKeown, director of Economic Statistics at the ONS, commented Thursday. Stamp duty refers to a tax on property purchases.
Across the broader second quarter, growth was led by services, with computer programming, health and vehicle leasing gaining momentum. Construction also increased, while production fell back slightly. Quarterly growth was also boosted by updated source data for April which, while still showing a contraction, was better than initially estimated, the ONS said.
""Services also drove growth in June with scientific R&D, engineering and car sales all having a strong month. Within production, which recovered, manufacture of electronics performed especially well,"" McKeown noted.
The British pound was flat against the dollar after the data release, at $1.3577.
Rebound unlikely to continue
U.K. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the latest data was positive but ""there is more to do to deliver an economy that works for working people.""
""I know that the British economy has the key ingredients for success but has felt stuck for too long,"" she said.
Sharon Graham, the general secretary of workers' trade union Unite, meanwhile said the chancellor's fiscal rules, constraining government borrowing, were ""shackling the economy.""
She added that ""workers can't wait forever for investment in our public services and industry"" in emailed comments.
Economists said it was unlikely that the positive momentum would continue into the third quarter.
After a strong start to the year, the U.K. economy ""took a breather"" in the second quarter, George Brown, senior economist at Schroders, said in emailed comments following the data release.
""Still, hopes of a sharp rebound are likely to be dashed. The labour market has softened, and capacity constraints mean even tepid growth is generating inflation pressures. With this in mind, we expect the Bank of England to keep rates on hold for the remainder of the year,"" he noted.
Ruth Gregory, deputy chief U.K. economist at Capital Economics, also questioned whether the economy will maintain this pace of growth.
""The weak global economy will remain a drag on U.K. GDP growth for a while yet. The full drag on business investment from April's tax rises has yet to be felt. And the ongoing speculation about further tax rises in the Autumn Budget will probably keep consumers in a cautious mood. However, today's release suggests the risks to our forecast of a 1.2% rise in GDP in 2025 are now to the upside,"" she said.
BOE cut
The latest growth data comes days after the Bank of England cut interest rates from 4.25% to 4%, with policy makers weighing sticky inflation — which rose to a hotter-than-expected 3.6% in June from 3.4% in May — against a cooling jobs market and lackluster growth.
In a statement last week, the BOE said its monetary policy committee ""remains focused on squeezing out any existing or emerging persistent inflationary pressures, to return inflation sustainably to its 2% target in the medium term.""
It also noted that underlying UK GDP growth ""has remained subdued, consistent with a continued, gradual loosening in the labour market.""
""A margin of slack is judged to have emerged in the economy. Downside domestic and geopolitical risks around economic activity remain, although trade policy uncertainty has diminished somewhat,"" the bank said, factoring in the U.K.'s trade deal with the U.S. and baseline 10% tariff on its exports to the States.
The MPC was initially split on reducing or holding interest rates with four members wanting to hold rates, four others voting to cut and one policymaker voting for a larger 50-basis-point cut. The committee then held a second round of voting to arrive at a majority decision to cut rates by 25 basis points.
The voting is a reflection of the ""finely balanced situation"" the MPC currently faces in terms of the factors driving monetary policy, according to BOE Governor Andrew Bailey.
""There's an upside risk to inflation, and particularly as to whether... this current increase could persist somewhat more than we expect it to. We don't expect it to actually, but could it?"" Bailey told CNBC's Ritika Gupta in an interview. ""But... that has to be set in the context of the labor market conditions, which appear to be softening.""",44395e318e001e2ba273412697c13eb7,trafilatura,4969,0

The 25-year-old says that she works 60 to 70 hours a week, balancing a full-time job at a big technology company and working on her side hustle as a social media influencer. Today, she has over 260,000 followers across her various social media platforms where she posts career and personal finance content.
Her social media side hustle alone brought in about $245,000 last year, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It. This income came from different sources such as sponsorships and user-generated content.
There is one popular financial concept that has helped her redefine how she thinks about hard work — compounding. Similar to how investments can grow over time through compound interest, being consistent in your actions can also lead to an outsized return in life, Zhang told CNBC Make It.
Having the discipline to work on her content every day on top of having a full-time job was key to her success in building a following and turning her side hustle into a six-figure business, she said.
""Consistent actions compound over time,"" said Zhang. That means doing something even if you don't want to because the constant repetition is more important than how you feel about it, she explained.
The Silicon Valley hustle
Zhang grew up in Silicon Valley as the only child to two immigrant parents.
""Living in [Silicon Valley] gives you a really warped perception of wealth,"" said Zhang. ""People think it's a very ... wealthy zip code, but my family didn't really necessarily fit that bill.""
As a kid, Zhang noticed that while many of her friends' parents owned multiple properties and nice cars, her family could only afford to live in apartments.
""Money was definitely something that my parents held a scarcity mindset about. They didn't really talk about it with me directly, but I would hear them argue about it, and I just remember it being a negative thing ... and that we could run out of it one day. That was the main fear,"" said Zhang.
""That really impacted me growing up, and so I knew that ... after graduation, I didn't want to live in that kind of financial anxiety anymore, and I wanted to ... give back to my parents,"" she added.
Motivated by this, Zhang earned her entrepreneurial chops early on. Along with balancing school and extracurricular activities, in middle school, she started her first business where she made plushies using her mom's sewing machine and sold them for a profit at school and online.
At age 12, she began posting videos of her plushies onto YouTube to market and sell them online. She also ran other e-commerce businesses where she would buy stuff off of AliExpress and resell them on YouTube. She estimates that she made about $15,000 from all of her business operations as a kid.
""I've always been very entrepreneurial ... it was second nature to me,"" she said.
Staying organized
Today, Zhang has carried this work ethic into adulthood.
In the past year, she has balanced a full-time job, running her social media pages and writing her first book ""The New Money Rules: The Gen Z Guide to Personal Finance,"" which is set to publish in November.
When asked about work-life balance, she said: ""I don't really think it exists, to be honest.""
To manage everything, she suggests batching tasks to save time. For example, instead of cooking every day, she likes to meal-prep multiple meals at one time. In addition, she will allocate similar tasks to one part of her day — such as responding to emails and life administration.
Staying organized and batching your tasks can ""really help with making more energy and room for your life,"" she said.
""You should have a greater goal or a vision of what you're working towards ... because there are going to be a lot of days when you're doing something and you're not going to see the immediate results of your actions [and] it might feel pointless in the moment,"" she said.

(PFE) stock is incredibly cheap following management's raise of its 2025 adjusted earnings per share guidance. It's at just over 8x this year's estimates and 7.8x next year. That's too cheap. Shorting out-of-the-money (OTM) put options works here.
PFE is at $24.59 today, up slightly from before its Aug. 5 earnings release. I discussed how statistically cheap PFE was in my July 29 Barchart article (""Pfizer Stock Is a Value Play Ahead of Earnings - Investors Can Short PFE Puts for Income"").
I set the price target at $34.41, +42% at the time, based on an average of its historical P/E multiples, dividend yield averages, and analysts' price targets. The updated price target is $33.58, providing at least a +36% potential upside in PFE stock.
Pfizer Raises Its Guidance and Analysts Up Their Targets
Pfizer's Q2 revenue came in +8.3% stronger than expected, according to Seeking Alpha, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were 21 cents higher than expected at $0.78.
Those surprises help push up PFE stock after earnings. It could have further to go based on management's earnings guidance.
Pfizer said it now expects adj. EPS to be 10 cents higher in 2025, between $2.90 and $3.10. As a result, analysts have now raised their 2025 estimates to $3.05 per share, up from $3.30 from prior (see my Barchart article last week). That means its 2025 forward price/earnings (P/E) multiple is just 8.06x.
And for 2026, they have raised their EPS estimates to $3.13 per share (up from $3.08 beforehand), putting PFE stock on a forward multiple of just 7.86x.
Target Prices
P/E Target Prices. But the average multiple for the past 5 years has been 10.75x, according to Seeking Alpha, and 10.12x, according to Morningstar, for an average of 10.435x:
$3.09 (average 2025 and 2025 EPS estimates) x 10.435 = $32.24 target price
Dividend Yield Target Prices. Moreover, using its historical dividend yield average of 4.68%, Pfizer's annual $1.72 dividend per share (SPS) makes PFE stock worth:
$1.72 DPS / 0.0468 = $36.75 target price
However, over the next 12 months, Pfizer will likely raise its DPS, as it has done over the past 14 years. Assuming the DPS rises 5% to $1.81, the target price over the next 12 months is:
$1.81 NTM DPS / 0.0468 = $38.68
Analyst Target Prices. Lastly, analysts have raised their prices. Yahoo! Finance now reports that the average of 24 analysts is $28.86, up from $28.67. Other surveys show $28.00 (Barchart), $29.75 (Stock Analysis), and $32.66 (AnaChart.com).
The average of these analyst surveys is $29.82, up from $29.65 last week.
As a result, the average of these three methods is $33.58. That represents a potential upside of +36.6% from today's price.
One way to play this, as I showed in the July 29 Barchart article, is to sell short out-of-the-money puts. That way, an investor can set a lower potential buy-in price and also get paid.
Shorting OTM PFE Puts for Income
I previously suggested selling short the $23.00 put strike price put option that expires on Aug. 29, i.e., 31 days to expiry (DTE). At the time, this strike price was just about 5% below the trading price and had a midpoint premium of 26 cents.
That provided the short seller a one-month DTE yield of 1.13% (i.e., $0.26/$23.00). Today, those puts are trading for just 6 cents at the midpoint, so most of the yield has been made, even though there are still 17 days left to expiry. In other words, the trade has been successful.
So, it makes sense to roll this play over to a later date. For example, the Sept. 19 PFE put option at the $24.00 strike price has a midpoint price of 36 cents.
That provides a new short-seller of these puts an immediate yield of 1.50% (i.e., $0.36/$24.00). That, however, has a very high chance of being assigned as the strike price is only 2.35% below the trading price (note the delta ratio is high at 35%).
Combining this trade with a $23.00 strike price short-put play provides an average yield of 1.085% with an average $23.50 strike price:
That also provides a lower break-even point of $23.50-$0.255, or $23.245, which is 5.1% below today's trading price.
The point is that this is a way to set a lower buy-in point for new investors in PFE and to get paid while waiting. For existing PFE shareholders, it also provides a way to make extra income and a potential lower dollar-average cost opportunity.
The bottom line is that PFE stock is very cheap here. Shorting OTM puts is a conservative way to play the stock.

Over nearly five years, the Denver-based company, whose co-founders include renowned venture capitalist Peter Thiel and current CEO Alex Karp, has surged more than 1,700%. At the same time, its valuation has broken new highs, dwarfing some of the world's technology behemoths with far greater revenues.
The artificial intelligence-powered software company continued its ascent last week after posting its first quarter with more than $1 billion in revenue, reaching new highs and soaring past a $430 billion market valuation.
Shares haven't been below $100 since April 2025. The stock last traded below $10 in May 2023, before beginning a steady climb higher.
Retail investors are a key part of the stock's strength.
Last month, retail poured $1.2 billion into Palantir stock, according to data from Goldman Sachs.
Here's a closer look at Palantir's growth over the past five years and how the company compares to megacap peers.
Government money
Government contracts have been one of Palantir's biggest growth areas since its inception.
Last quarter, the company's U.S. government revenue grew 53% to $426 million. Government accounted for 55% of the company's total revenue but commercial is showing promise. Those revenues in the U.S. grew 93% last quarter, Palantir said.
Still, one of the company's oldest customers is the U.S. Army.
Earlier this month, the company inked a contract worth up to $10 billion for data and software to streamline efficiencies and meet growing military needs. In May, the Department of Defense boosted its agreement with Palantir for artificial intelligence-powered battlefield capabilities by $795 million.
""We still believe America is the leader of the free world, that the West is superior,"" Karp said on an earnings call earlier this month. ""We have to fight for these values; we should give American corporations, and, most importantly, our government, an unfair advantage.""
Beyond the U.S.
The U.S. has been a key driver of Palantir's growth, especially as the company scoops up more contracts with the U.S. military.
Palantir said the U.S. currently accounts for about three-quarters of total revenues. Commercial international revenues declined 3% last quarter and analysts have raised concerns about that segment's growth trajectory.
Over the past five years, U.S. revenues have nearly quintupled from $156 million to about $733 million. Revenues outside the U.S. have doubled from about $133 million to $271 million.
Paying a premium
Palantir's market capitalization has rapidly ascended over the past year as investors bet on its AI tools, while its stock has soared nearly 500%.
The meteoric rise placed Palantir among the top 10 U.S. tech firms and top 20 most valuable U.S. companies. But Palantir makes a fraction of the revenue of the companies in those lists.
Last quarter, Palantir reported more than $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, and its forward price-to-earnings ratio has surged past 280 times.
By comparison, Apple and Microsoft posted revenue of $94 billion and $76 billion during the period, respectively, and carry a P/E ratio of nearly 30 times.
Forward P/E is a valuation metric that compares a company's future earnings to its current share price. The higher the P/E, the higher the growth expectations or the more overvalued the asset. A lower price-to-earnings ratio suggests slower growth or an undervalued asset.
Most of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, except for Nvidia and Tesla, have a forward P/E that hovers around the 20s and 30s. Nvidia trades at more than 40 times forward earnings, while Tesla's sits at about 198 times.
At these levels, investors are paying a jacked-up premium to own shares of one of the hottest AI stocks on Wall Street as its valuation has skyrocketed to astronomical heights.
""This is a once-in-a-generation, truly anomalous quarter, and we're very proud,"" Karp said on an earnings call following Palantir's second-quarter results. ""We're sorry that our haters are disappointed, but there are many more quarters to be disappointed.""

The Nasdaq Composite hit a record today, it is up 5.5% in a month, 14% in three months. The relative strength index crossed into what is known as ""overbought"" territory today. It doesn't mean it is due for a drop though, but it did cross the 70 line. Traders use the RSI as one indicator of when a stock is ""overbought"" (above 70) or ""oversold"" (below 30). The NYSE Composite is 0.4% from a new high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is 0.3% from a new high. The Russell 2000 is up 4.9% in three days, and is 5.6% from the high. The line of the day from Jim Cramer and the ""Mad Money"" team: ""I haven't seen anything like this in the '80s and '90s, when money roved Wall Street like a gang of thugs … always on the lookout for the next get rich thing. And that's where we are right now. It's a wonder to behold."" Relative Strength Only three stocks in the Dow 30 are above the 70 mark on RSI, which means some might consider them ""overbought."" Only nine stocks in the Nasdaq 100 would be considered ""overbought."" Alphabet and Apple are the only stocks in the ""Magnificent Seven"" earning that qualification tonight. Apple The stock is on a bit of an upswing. It is up 9% in a week and 12.4% in August. The stock is around 10% from its Christmas 2024 high. We'll follow one of America's favorite, and most widely held stocks, tomorrow. Cramer has been saying, ""own it, don't trade it."" He last bought Apple shares for his charitable trust in April 2014.

Stock futures ticked a bit lower this morning after the July wholesale inflation report came in much hotter than expected. The S & P 500 and Nasdaq are coming off back-to-back record highs. At noon ET today, I'll discuss what's next for the market during the Investing Club's August Monthly Meeting. 2. The producer price index for July rose 0.9% month over month, well above the Dow Jones consensus estimate of 0.2%. That translates to an annual rate of 3.3%. Core PPI, which backs out volatile food and energy prices, also rose 0.9% on a monthly basis. A relatively tame consumer price index report Tuesday had increased expectations for a Fed rate cut next month. 3. Club name Cisco reported a good quarter last night, just not a great quarter. It is the security business that seems to have held it back. AI infrastructure orders were strong, totaling $800 million in the period and over $2 billion in the fiscal year. Bank of America upped its to price target to $85 a share from $76. 4. AI data center play Coherent disappointed on earnings, sending shares down nearly 20% this morning. Its laser business came up short in the quarter, while its networking unit was better than expected. Still, in downgrading the name to neutral, BofA expressed concerns about decelerating growth in data centers. 5. Barclays downgraded Illinois ToolWorks to an underweight sell rating from equal weight and left its price target at $243, below where it closed yesterday. Analysts see limited upside for the maker of industrial components unless there's a big uptick in residential or consumer spending. I'd never put a sell on this great company. 6. Mizuho is the latest shop to hike its price target on Club stock Nvidia , going to $205 from $192 and keeping its outperform buy rating. As usual, the hype is building into earnings on Aug. 27. I'm not buying the chatter that Nvidia's next-generation Vera Rubin chip, due out in 2026, is delayed. 7. Citigroup opened a negative catalyst watch on Estee Lauder ahead of earnings. Analysts worry its guidance could disappoint given the stock has nearly doubled off its April lows. What else is new when you're levered to China and charge more than anyone else? I'd buy E.l.f. Beauty instead. 8. Sherwin-Williams landed an upgrade to neutral from underperform at BofA. The firm said the paint maker can outgrow its end markets once this down cycle ends. Club name Home Depot is another one that's been hurt by sluggish housing activity. I'll give my latest thoughts on it at today's Club meeting. 9. Shares of Coach and Kate Spade owner Tapestry are tumbling about 12% after its earnings outlook for the year came in below the Wall Street consensus, likely due to tariff costs. The company is factoring in a 60-cent-per-share hit. That will be a big deal. 10. Truist upped its price target on Cintas to $265 from $240 following a meeting with management, which bolstered analysts' conviction it can continue to deliver double-digit organic growth. As a uniform and First Aid provider to businesses, Cintas is a good barometer for the economy.

That's a critical mistake, says Becky Kennedy, a Columbia University-trained clinical psychologist and mom of three. Constantly swooping in to boost your child's mood during difficult moments hinders their resilience, making them less emotionally and mentally equipped to see their tough circumstances through, she says.
Instead, make it your job to give support or advice, and be a listening ear — not a superhero — when needed, Kennedy says.
""A parent's job is never to make their kid happy or to smooth every bump in the road,"" says Kennedy, the host of the ""Good Inside"" parenting podcast. ""Our job in those hard moments ... is to see a more capable version of our kid than they can access [themselves].""
Help us help you: Take our survey on work, money and life goals
Children learn by messing up, getting frustrated and not getting their way, Kennedy says. If you're constantly focused on making them happy, rather than helping them manage their full range of emotions and act on their feelings appropriately, you're doing your kids a disservice.
""Learning is very messy. Learning involves melting down. It involves saying, 'I'm so stupid,' and 'I can't do it,'"" says Kennedy. Stepping in ""deprives them of the ability to learn it themselves and to see themselves as a resilient learner.""
The next time your kid is struggling with math homework, for example, empower them to come up with solutions on their own, she says. They may cry, catch an attitude or beg you to do the problem for them. Kennedy recommends responding with something along the lines of:
""You're right. This math problem is really tricky. It feels hard because it is hard. And I can sit near you, I can check on you, I can take a breath with you — but I'm not going to do it for you, because I know you're going to be able to figure this out. I believe in you. We can get through this together.""
An empathetic-yet-firm approach validates their feelings, and builds resilience and inner efficacy — an individual's belief that they're capable of meeting their goals, developmental psychologist Aliza Pressman wrote for CNBC Make It in January 2024.
Both skills are essential for kids to become successful, emotionally intelligent adults, wrote Pressman: ""When kids understand that their failures aren't due to permanent limitations, there's an opening for future achievement.""
If you have a history of yielding to your child's whining, crying fits or their puppy dog eyes, following Kennedy's advice may be easier said than done.
But if you do, you'll notice more resilience — in your child and yourself — fairly quickly, Kennedy says. You'll find that you can tolerate their frustration more calmly, and that they're regulating their emotions more quickly, leaning less on your reassurance and more on their own, she says.
Your child's ""self-talk"" will also improve significantly, adds Kennedy: ""Our words to our kids become our kids' words to themselves. So when you say a couple of times, 'Yes, this is tricky. And you're a kid who can do tricky things,' there will be a moment where you hear your kids say it to themselves.""

This week, the beverage and snack heavyweight completed an upside rotation, pushing above its 200-day moving average for the first time since October. Today we'll dig into the dynamics of this impressive turnaround story, show how a much larger rotation could be taking place, and identify key levels to watch to confirm further bullish breakouts. After achieving a series of new 52-week lows in April and May, PEP stabilized around the $127 level with a series of lows into late June. An initial push higher was accelerated after their July earnings release, bringing a fresh test of the 200-day moving average. After a brief pullback to the 21-day exponential moving average, Pepsi finally pushed above the 200-day as well as a major trendline connecting the October 2024 and March 2025 price peaks. The rally in Q1 stalled out just below the 200-day moving average, confirming a lack of upside momentum as the RSI failed to get much above the 60 level. On this latest upswing, the RSI pushed well above 60 and has remained above 50 since the end of June. This improved momentum situation suggests plenty of fuel for continued gains above current levels. Applying a Fibonacci framework to the daily chart, we can see that the recent test of the 200-day moving average also represented a 61.8% retracement of the March to May downtrend phase (pink lines). The July swing high was also right around a 38.2% retracement of a much larger downtrend, from the summer 2024 highs to the May 2025 low (green lines). This week's rally has now pushed PepsiCo above both of these Fibonacci retracement levels, indicated with an orange shaded area on the chart. If the current uptrend phase continues in the coming weeks, we'd look for an upside objective in the $156-$158 range, represented by the blue shaded area. This price zone is derived from 61.8% retracement of the long-term Fibonacci framework, and would also mean a 100% retracement of the March to May downtrend. When trying to better understand the context of a particular price move, I was taught, ""When in doubt, zoom out."" With that mantra in mind, we're now looking at a monthly chart for PEP going back to 2005. The last time Pepsi saw a pullback of this magnitude was during the Great Financial Crisis. After the eventual low in 2009, a bullish crossover from the monthly PPO indicator confirmed a new uptrend phase that essentially lasted until the 2023 peak. While a similar bullish signal may not guarantee the same extended bullish run for Pepsi, the PPO indicator could confirm an ""all clear"" of sorts for this consumer staples heavyweight. All long-term uptrends begin with short-term breakouts, and the recent upswing above the 200-day moving average could be a sign of much greater gains in store for Pepsi.

Shares of Target and Ulta closed the day down about 1%.
In a news release, the companies said the partnership — which also added some of Ulta's merchandise to Target's website — will end in August 2026. Target had added more than 600 Ulta Beauty shops to its stores since 2021, according to a company spokesperson. That's nearly a third of Target's 1,981 U.S. stores.
Ulta Beauty at Target shops carried a smaller and rotating assortment of the merchandise at the beauty retailer's own stores. They were staffed by Target's employees.
The loss of the popular beauty retailer's products could be another blow to Target as it tries to woo back both shoppers and investors. Target's annual sales have been roughly flat for four years and it expects sales to decline this fiscal year. Shares of the company are worth less than half of what the were back in 2021, when they hit an all-time closing high of $266.39. It also has faced backlash over both its Pride collection and its rollback of key diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
Store traffic for Target has declined year over year nearly every week from the week of Jan. 27, days after the company's DEI announcement, through the week of Aug. 4, according to Placer.ai, an analytics firm that uses anonymized data from mobile devices to estimate overall visits to locations. Target traffic had been up weekly year over year in the four weeks before Jan. 27.
The only exceptions to that trend were the two weeks on either side of Easter, when traffic rose less than 1% year over year, the firm's data showed.
On earnings calls and in investor presentations, leaders of the Minneapolis-based company had touted Ulta's shops and its trendy beauty brands as a way to drive store traffic.
At a investor presentation in New York City in March, CEO Brian Cornell highlighted beauty as a growth category for Target and cited it as reason for confidence in Target's long-term business. He said the company had gained market share in beauty and its sales in the category rose by nearly 7% in the fiscal year that ended in early February.
Target's CEO Brian Cornell, 66, is expected to depart the company soon. The longtime Target leader renewed his contract for approximately three years in September 2022 after the board scrapped its retirement age of 65.
David Bellinger, an analyst for Mizuho Securities who covers retailers, said in an equity research note on Thursday that Target's ""messy in-store operations"" as well as issues with retail theft and insufficient staffing at stores likely contributed to the companies ending their partnership.
""Overall, we see losing the Ulta shop-in-shop relationship as a negative development and something else Target's next CEO will have to grapple with,"" he wrote.
In a statement on Thursday, Target Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez said the discounter is ""proud of our shared success with Ulta Beauty and the experience we've delivered together.""
""We look forward to what's ahead and remain committed to offering the beauty experience consumers have come to expect from Target – one centered on an exciting mix of beauty brands with continuous newness, all at an unbeatable value,"" he said.
In a statement, Ulta's Chief Retail Officer Amiee Bayer-Thomas described the Target deal as ""one of many unique ways we have brought the power of beauty to guests nationwide.""
""As we continue to execute our Ulta Beauty Unleashed plans, we're confident our wide-ranging assortment, expert services and inspiring in-store experiences will reinforce our leadership in beauty and define the next chapter of our brand,"" she said.",c081746ad700943c497855be4404ae2e,trafilatura,3754,0

1. September cut?
It's looking more and more likely that the Federal Reserve will soon start cutting rates, and investors are thrilled. After this week's cooler-than-expected consumer inflation report, Fed funds futures now forecast a nearly 100% chance that the central bank will decrease the borrowing cost at its next policy gathering in September, according to CME's Fed Watch tool. That's good news for traders, who have been waiting with bated breath for a cut since late last year. Small-cap stocks — which are seen as beneficiaries of a lower-rate environment — rallied in Wednesday's session as a result. The good vibes didn't stop there: The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also notched new all-time closing highs for a second day in a row. Investors will get more inflation data Thursday morning, with July's producer price index due in at 8:30 a.m. ET. Follow live market updates here.
2. Succession planning
Speaking of the Fed, CNBC's Steve Liesman on Wednesday reported that President Donald Trump is now considering 11 candidates to succeed Jerome Powell after the Fed chief's term expires next year. Those names, according to two administration officials, include outsiders David Zervos, chief market strategist at Jefferies, and Rick Rieder, chief investment officer for global fixed income at BlackRock. Fed Governors Michelle Bowman and Chris Waller, who advocated for rate cuts at the central bank's last meeting, are also in the running. Prediction markets warmed up to the idea of Zervos taking the role following CNBC's report, with his odds on Kalshi shooting higher Wednesday.
3. Breakup budget
While analysts aren't taking Perplexity AI's bid for Google's Chrome browser very seriously, the offer put a spotlight on Alphabet's sprawling assets as it waits to see if a judge will order a breakup of its businesses. After a federal judge ruled last year that Google has held a monopoly in search and text advertising, the Department of Justice indicated that it was considering a breakup of Google as a remedy. Ahead of the looming decision, CNBC broke down how some analysts value the tech giant's non-search assets, which include Chrome, YouTube and Waymo.
4. Davids vs. Goliath
Goldman Sachs is sticking by its economic analysis, despite taking heat from Trump. The president on Tuesday told the bank's CEO David Solomon to fire his chief economist over a tariff forecast, but Goldman economist David Mericle doubled down on the bank's analysis on Wednesday. Mericle told CNBC that Goldman is confident consumers will bear the brunt of cost hikes from Trump's tariffs. By the fall, he said, everyday Americans can expect to feel two-thirds of the impact of the president's levies. While Goldman Sachs may be the one receiving criticism from the president, it isn't alone in its forecast. Several other economists are also predicting that Trump's tariffs will push inflation higher.
5. Contrasting outlooks
Eastman Kodak is simultaneously juggling two vastly different truths. First, the camera company is benefiting from a revival of film, powered by Gen Z consumers who are looking for more unique and retro-looking photos than what their smartphones can capture. But despite that cultural tailwind, that the 133-year-old photography company is grappling with serious financial challenges tied in part to debt. As CNBC's Laya Neelakandan reports, that's left the business saying it is planning to make significant changes in the face of doubt about its ability to keep operations going.

Amazon announced Wednesday that Prime members in more than 1,000 cities and towns can now get free same-day delivery on fresh groceries for orders over $25. The e-commerce and cloud giant plans to more than double that reach by year-end, with further expansion slated for 2026. Cramer called it the ""Amazon factor"" — suggesting the company's new push into same-day delivery of produce, dairy, and frozen food alongside household items helps solidify it as the ultimate one-stop shop for consumers. ""You're going to get your food. You're going to get your drugs. It's going to come to your house,"" he said. ""It's a whole new world and Amazon's got it."" Wednesday's move, billed by Amazon as ""one of the most significant grocery expansions"" in its history, is seen by the market as a material escalation in the online grocery battle. Amazon stock advanced 1.4% on the announcement and was up another 1.9% on Thursday. Shares of Walmart and Target , which use their physical stores to service online orders of fresh groceries, were under pressure for a second straight session on Thursday. Delivery competitors fared much worse. Instacart and DoorDash were both down big again Thursday after sinking 11.5% and 3.8%, respectively, on Wednesday. Club stock Costco also faltered Wednesday but was steadier Thursday. Cramer said Wednesday Costco should never have been down on the Amazon news because the retailer is not in the same business. Costco is a ""price business, a volume business,"" he said. Amazon has been able to expand its grocery offering because it keeps making same-day delivery more efficient. It has ""reduced the average distance packages travel by 12% and lowered handling touches per unit by nearly 15%,"" said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy during the company's post-earnings conference call on July 31. Jassy cited strategic positioning of the company's fulfillment centers and the ability to send more items in each order, which resulted in fewer packages. ""These improvements are making the network faster and structurally more efficient,"" the CEO added. That delivery speed has been driving customers to buy everyday items like cleaning supplies, vitamins, and personal care products online instead of making the trip to the grocery store. Last quarter, Everyday Essentials' growth outpaced the rest of the business globally and represented one out of every three units sold. By leveraging its large and loyal Prime customer base and increasingly efficient delivery speeds, it wouldn't be surprising if Amazon takes market share from top grocery players. At the same time, though, the impact across the industry may take time to unfold. We continue to maintain our buy-equivalent 1 rating on Amazon shares and a $250 price target.

Don't mess with DJ D-Sol — Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon's stage name when he's rocking the clubs in his other life as a DJ.
U.S. President Donald Trump criticized Goldman on Tuesday for predicting that tariffs would push up inflation, and said Solomon ""should go out and get himself a new Economist or, maybe, he ought to just focus on being a DJ.""
In response, Goldman defended the results of its study, according to a CNBC interview with the bank's economist David Mericle.
""If the most recent tariffs, like the April tariff, follow the same pattern that we've seen with those earliest February tariffs, then eventually, by the fall, we estimate that consumers would bear about two-thirds of the cost,"" Mericle said.
Goldman, in fact, is not the only Wall Street bank putting forth this view.
UBS senior economist Brian Rose wrote that ""the downward trend in core inflation has been broken as tariffs start to feed through into retail prices,"" while Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase, said in a note that tariffs could ""add 1-1.5% to inflation, some of which has already occurred.""
Of course, a consensus view does not mean predictions will come true. Recall how economists were all but certain a U.S. recession would happen in 2023 — only for the economy to grow 2.5% that year.
In any case, if Goldman — and economists from other banks —is proven wrong on tariff-driven inflation, and Trump, in a hypothetical scenario, manages to somehow push Solomon out of his position, at least DJ D-Sol will still be out there spinning records.

What you need to know today
Trump is considering 11 candidates for Fed chair. Among the list of potential nominees are Federal Reserve officials, a Bush administration economic advisor, Jefferies Chief Market Strategist David Zervos and BlackRock's Rick Rieder.
Economists agree that higher tariff inflation is coming. Despite Trump on Tuesday slamming Goldman Sachs for predicting higher consumer prices, the bank is standing by its research. Other Wall Street economists agree with its call.
New records for U.S. stocks again. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite climbed Wednesday to close at fresh highs, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average also rising. Shares of Paramount Skydance popped 36.7%. The Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.54%.

How Big Tech is paying its way out of Trump's tariffs
Top tech executives are at the forefront of a recent swathe of unprecedented deals with U.S. President Donald Trump. In particular, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, as well as Apple, have struck agreements with the White House.
""The flurry of deal-making is an effort to secure lighter treatment from tariffs,"" Paolo Pescatore, technology analyst at PP Foresight, told CNBC by email. Big tech companies can ""ill afford to fork out on millions of dollars in additional fees that will further dent profits as underlined by recent quarterly earnings,"" Pescatore said.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.
Top 5 Upgrades:
-
Baird upgraded CVS Health (CVS) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $82, up from $71. The firm has growing confidence in a turnaround at the company's Health Care Benefits segment following the Q2 report.
-
BofA upgraded Sherwin-Williams (SHW) to Neutral from Underperform with a price target of $375, up from $296. Same-store sales growth has declined to 0.8%, while Q2 results and guidance fell short of expectations, but from here, BofA does not see anything that would make shares materially underperform.
-
BTIG upgraded Kratos Defense (KTOS) to Buy from Neutral with an $80 price target. With the company having been down selected for the Marine Corps' MUX TACAIR program, the firm has conviction that Kratos could see significant growth at Unmanned Systems in the coming year given funding currently earmarked for the program in FY26 and the broader, roughly $8.8B unmanned request, the firm tells investors.
-
BofA upgraded Dow Inc. (DOW) to Neutral from Underperform with an unchanged price target of $25. When the firm previously downgraded Dow in April it had been concerned about downside to earnings forecasts and risk to the dividend, but Street estimates have moved lower since then, Q2 results reflected the tougher market conditions and Dow has also cut its dividend to ""a more manageable level,"" the firm tells investors.
-
BofA upgraded RPM (RPM) to Neutral from Underperform with a price target of $128, up from $110, following a fiscal Q4 beat and ""strong"" sales and margin outlook. While the firm's prior Underperform thesis was predicated on fears of a slowing macro and a pullback of industrial capital investment on the back of new government tariffs, this ""did not present itself as an issue"" for the quarter ended May 31, the firm tells investors.
Top 5 Downgrades:
-
Argus downgraded eBay (EBAY) to Hold from Buy with no price target. The stock is up nearly 30% since the company reported 7% growth in net income and 6% increase in revenue in Q2 as it continues to roll out new and enhanced tech solutions, including those underpinned by new generative AI models, the firm tells investors in a research note.
-
Erste Group downgraded IBM (IBM) to Hold from Buy. Sales growth is ""well below"" the sector average, which is not expected to change this year, and the current valuation is ""high in view of the below-average growth prospects,"" the firm tells investors.
-
BofA downgraded Ibotta (IBTA) to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $24, down from $57. Ibotta reported ""significantly weaker-than-expected"" Q2 results and Q3 revenue guidance due to the decision by two clients testing the company's new performance marketing model to pause spend in the program as well as tough industry conditions constraining promotional supply, the firm tells investors. Goldman Sachs, Citizens JMP, Evercore ISI and Wells Fargo also downgraded the stock but to Neutral-equivalent ratings.
-
Erste Group downgraded Fortinet (FTNT) to Hold from Buy. Sales growth in the coming year will be lower than this year and the operating margin is below that of the peer group, which is not expected to change in the next two years, the firm tells investors.
-
BofA downgraded Coherent (COHR) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $105, up from $92, citing decelerating growth in its data center business as well as ""modest"" gross margin trends despite multiple restructuring actions.",fee366fc76248d952593be72b2f69ea8,trafilatura,3619,0

The Singapore consumer's reputation for financial prudence and high savings is showing signs of strain. Dealing with rising costs and a pursuit of experiences and self-care are taking precedence over long-term financial planning, experts observed.
Some 60% of workers in Singapore were living paycheck to paycheck in 2024 — notably higher than regional peers such as China, South Korea, Japan and Indonesia, and above the Asia-Pacific average of 48%, a 2025 research from the payroll company ADP found.

The producer price index, which measures final demand goods and services prices, jumped 0.9% on the month, compared with the Dow Jones estimate for a 0.2% gain. It was the biggest monthly increase since June 2022.
Excluding food and energy prices, core PPI rose 0.9% against the forecast for 0.3%. Excluding food, energy and trade services, the index was up 0.6%, the biggest gain since March 2022.
On an annual basis, headline PPI increased 3.3%, the biggest 12-month move since February and well above the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target.
Services inflation provided much of the push higher, rising 1.1% in July for the largest gain also since March 2022. Trade services margins climbed 2%, coming amid ongoing developments in President Donald Trump's tariff implementations.
In addition, 30% of the increase in services came from a 3.8% rise in machinery and equipment wholesaling. Also, portfolio management fees surged 5.4% and airline passenger services prices climbed 1%.
Stock market futures fell following the release, while shorter-duration Treasury yields moved higher.
Though PPI is followed less closely than the BLS' consumer price index, it provides important information on pipeline prices. Together, the measures feed into the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's primary inflation forecasting gauge, which will be updated later this month.
""The fact that PPI was stronger-than-expected and CPI has been relatively soft suggests that businesses are eating much of the tariff costs instead of passing them onto the consumer,"" said Clark Geranen, chief market strategist at CalBay Investments. ""Businesses may soon start to reverse course and start passing these costs to consumers.""
With CPI coming in right around expectations earlier this week, markets had been pricing a virtual certainty that the Fed will lower its key interest rate when it meets next in September. Following the release, market-implied odds of a September cut decreased but only slightly, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. Traders did substantially lower the probability for three cuts this year.
""The large spike in the Producer Price Index this morning shows inflation is coursing through the economy, even if it hasn't been felt by consumers yet,"" wrote Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management. ""Given how benign the CPI numbers were on Tuesday, this is a most unwelcome surprise to the upside and is likely to unwind some of the optimism of a 'guaranteed' rate cut next month.""
However, the White House said the details of the report showed that business were not passing through the costs of tariffs to consumers.
The reports come amid escalating questions over BLS data accuracy.
Trump earlier this month fired the former BLS commissioner and said he intends to nominate Heritage Foundation economist E.J. Antoni as the next head of the bureau. Antoni has been a critic of the BLS and even has floated the idea of suspending the monthly nonfarm payrolls report until data accuracy can be better ensured.
The BLS has been hamstrung by budget cuts and layoffs that have forced it to alter the way it collects data. July's PPI report was the first since the bureau eliminated some 350 categories from the exhaustive count of input costs.",3213ca9c8dd20269b2645c4f8a263871,trafilatura,3509,0

The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate purchased more than 5 million shares in the health-care firm for a stake worth about $1.6 billion at the end of June. The stake puts it as the 18th-biggest position in the Berkshire portfolio behind Amazon and Constellation Brands, according to VerityData.
Berkshire's equity portfolio is worth about $300 billion, so it is possible that Buffett's two investing lieutenants, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, were more responsible for this purchase rather than the ""Oracle of Omaha"" himself. Buffett said one of his investment managers was behind the Amazon investment in 2019.
The insurer's stock shot up 6% in extended trading following Berkshire's disclosure.
Shares of UnitedHealth were down nearly 50% for 2025 through Thursday's close before Buffett's filing. The largest private health insurer has become the face of public blowback in this country against the rising costs of health care. UnitedHealth is currently facing a Justice Department investigation into its Medicare billing practices.
In May, the company pulled its annual earnings outlook and CEO Andrew Witty stepped down. Last month, UnitedHealth gave a new 2025 outlook that was well short of Wall Street estimates, hitting the stock further.
Buffett, who's turning 95 this month, has been critical of the health-care system in the U.S., calling it a ""tapeworm"" on the economy due to its high costs. In 2018, he, along with Jeff Bezos and Jamie Dimon, launched a joint venture to improve health care for their employees and potentially for all Americans, but it was eventually shut down.
Other notable moves
UnitedHealth isn't the only stock Berkshire picked up recently. In fact, the conglomerate also took small stakes in steel manufacturer Nucor, outdoor advertising company Lamar Advertising and security firm Allegion. Berkshire also got back into homebuilders Lennar and DR Horton.
Shares of Nucor jumped nearly 8% in after-hours trading, while Lennar and DR Horton popped about 3% each.
Buffett also pared his positions in Bank of America and Apple. The Apple stake was cut by about 7%. Berkshire's largest positions as of the end of the second quarter were Apple, American Express, Bank of America, Coca-Cola and Chevron.
The legendary investor is stepping down as Berkshire CEO at the end of the year, handing over the reins to Greg Abel. Buffett will stay on as chairman of the board. It's still unclear who will be in charge of Berkshire's gigantic equity portfolio, though Buffett has alluded that Abel will be making all capital allocation decisions at the conglomerate.
UnitedHealth attracted other buyers last quarter, according to filings, including Michael Burry and Appaloosa Management's David Tepper. Shares of the insurer are trading at a price-earnings ratio of just under 12, near their lowest in more than a decade.
There was speculation regarding a mystery stock Buffett was buying as Berkshire had asked for permission to keep certain holdings secret last quarter. It turns out the secret stock was a combination of multiple positions and likely the stakes added in DR Horton, Nucor and Lennar ""A"" shares.",e11b8c3e34dd80b24db7851f40ffdb69,trafilatura,3398,0

Roth conversions transfer pretax or nondeductible individual retirement account funds to a Roth IRA, which starts future tax-free growth. The trade-off is paying regular income taxes on the converted balance.
Trump's new tax cuts could make Roth conversions more appealing for some investors, experts say. But incurring too much income could impact eligibility for certain tax breaks.

When weighing Roth conversions, you need to know the multi-year state and federal tax impact, said Judy Brown, a certified financial planner who works at SC&H Group in the Washington, D.C., and Baltimore area.
For example, if you're nearing Medicare age or already enrolled, boosting your earnings could increase income-related monthly adjustment amounts, or IRMAA, for Medicare Part B and Part D premiums.
The strategy is ""looking at a lot of different pieces, and figuring out the optimal place for each client,"" said Brown, who is also a certified public accountant.
'Fill up the lowest brackets'
Roth conversions have always been about ""tax bracket management,"" said CFP Patrick Huey, owner of Victory Independent Planning in Portland, Oregon.
When making Roth conversions, advisors typically incur enough regular income to ""fill up the lowest brackets,"" he said.
Your federal brackets are based on each part of your ""taxable income,"" which you calculate by subtracting the greater of the standard or itemized deductions from your adjusted gross income.
Trump's temporary tax breaks
Before Trump enacted the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, lower federal income tax brackets were scheduled to sunset after 2025, which would have made converted balances more expensive.
Trump's legislation made the lower tax rates permanent, but several new tax breaks — deductions for older Americans, tipped workers and consumers with overtime pay and car loan interest — are temporary with varying earnings limits.
These tax breaks, which are available from 2025 through 2028, could offer more room for Roth conversions before hitting the next tax bracket, experts say.
Once these cuts expire, you could be ""paying more for the exact same Roth conversion,"" said CFP Ashton Lawrence at Mariner Wealth Advisors in Greenville, South Carolina.
Comparing tax breaks
While Trump's new tax cuts could make more space in the lower tax brackets, higher income from Roth conversions can impact eligibility, experts say.
For example, the additional $6,000 deduction for older Americans starts to phase out, or get smaller, once modified adjusted gross income exceeds $75,000 for single filers or $150,000 for married couples filing jointly.
It probably still makes sense to convert funds at 22% or 24% tax rates now — and skip the $6,000 deduction — to avoid the 30% brackets for large pre-tax required withdrawals later, Brown said.
Most retirees must take required minimum distributions, or RMDs, from pretax retirement accounts starting at age 73 or face an IRS penalty.",1ba4ea517ed206a5155f1c10aee9c060,trafilatura,3276,0

""I don't want to get rid of a bunch of people right now,"" Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins told CNBC on Thursday after being asked by Jim Cramer about the potential savings offered by agentic AI. Even more so in the case of engineers, Robbins added, ""I just want our engineers that we have today to innovate faster and be more productive. That gives us a competitive advantage."" Agentic AI refers to digital systems that can bring human-like problem-solving to tasks that require little supervision, such as customer service, and increasingly more difficult tasks like writing software. Robbins' approach differs from other major tech firms that appear to be using AI technology as a gateway to reduce labor costs. Club names Microsoft and Amazon are just a couple of companies that have recently slashed employees by the thousands. In early July, Microsoft alone cut roughly 9,000 of its global workforce. ""Most of my peers would suggest that they do expect to be hiring fewer people if we get this right,"" said Robbins, who did not rule it out down the road. ""It's early."" Fortunately for the networking equipment provider, its latest quarterly earnings and revenue beats and slightly higher guidance indicate that management's direction is not hurting the company. ""Agentic is the destination"" for most of Cisco's webscale customers, Robbins said. The company more than doubled last year's original $1 billion AI infrastructure order target for fiscal year 2025, with in fiscal Q4 alone exceeding $800 million for the quarter. Webscale customers refer to the major tech household names such as Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Microsoft . Cisco is the Club's newest stock. We initiated a position in mid-July and have since made two more buys on the promise of how the company can help its customers with AI. Cisco is one of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average . ""Historically, the way you want to review Cisco is by following the orders because that's what leads to revenue,"" said Jeff Marks, director of portfolio analysis for the Club, during the August monthly meeting. Cisco did not release AI revenue guidance for its next fiscal year. But on Wednesday evening's post-earnings conference call, Robbins confirmed roughly $1 billion in AI revenue from webscale customers for fiscal year 2025. A blemish that did raise investor eyebrows, and contributed to Thursday's 1.5% stock decline, was its security segment. Cisco closed its $28 billion deal to buy the Splunk cybersecurity platform in March 2024, on the promise of driving financial growth and enhancing its security capabilities. Benefits from Splunk have been pushed out as the division saw some growth but missed on revenue. Cisco attributed the weakness to its U.S. federal government business, which has been affected by budget cuts. Excluding the federal business, the larger part of Cisco's security business grew by double digits. Marks said the Club would ""buy some"" more of Cisco shares if the stock were to dip further below its current trading levels of about $69 per share.

-
Deutsche Bank upgraded Palo Alto Network (PANW) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $220, up from $200. With the stock underperforming the broader cyber space by 15% year-to-date, investor concerns for Palo Alto are overblown, the firm tells investors in a research note.
-
BofA upgraded Lumentum (LITE) to Neutral from Underperform with a price target of $135, up from $78. Lumentum is refocusing back to its best-of-breed optical component roots while prudently managing its lower margin optical transceiver mix under its relatively new CEO, the firm tells investors.
-
JPMorgan upgraded Capri Holdings (CPRI) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $30, up from $24, after meeting with the company. Capri highlighted revenue improvement throughout fiscal 2026 and a growth inflection at Michael Kors in fiscal 2027, the firm tells investors in a research note.

-
Keefe Bruyette downgraded Opendoor Technologies (OPEN) to Underperform from Market Perform with a $1 price target after its Q2 earnings miss. High retail interest may continue to support valuation, but the firm is downgrading the shares on expectation of widening losses in the second half of the year, coupled with uncertainty from the strategy pivot to weigh on the shares, which trade near the high end of historical multiples.
-
Jefferies downgraded On Holding (ONON) to Underperform from Hold with a price target of $40, down from $50. The firm believes 2025 will represent the company’s peak sales growth rate.

Want an extra $1,300,000 when you retire? Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it
According to the USDA’s Land Values 2025 Summary report, the average U.S. farmland value climbed to a record $4,350 per acre this year — up 4.3% from 2024. That’s an 89.1% jump from 2011, when an acre cost just $2,300.
The gains span both cropland and pasture:
-
Cropland: up 95.6% since 2011 to $5,830 per acre.
-
Pasture: up 79.4% over the same period to $1,920 per acre.
Farmland rarely makes headlines — it’s not as flashy as AI stocks or cryptocurrencies — yet it has a timeless appeal: come what may, people always need to eat.
It’s no wonder some of America’s wealthiest individuals have staked big claims in this space. According to The Land Report, Jeff Bezos owns 462,000 acres of farmland, while Bill Gates holds 275,000 acres.
Warren Buffett: ‘I’ll write you a check’ for this timeless asset
Warren Buffett may be best known for his decades-long winning streak in the stock market, but he’s also a fan of farmland — highlighting it as a productive asset that can generate value year after year.
“If you said … for a 1% interest in all the farmland in the United States, pay our group $25 billion, I’ll write you a check this afternoon,” Buffett stated in 2022.
The good news? You don’t need $25 billion — or know how to grow crops — to get in on the opportunity.
FarmTogether is an all-in-one investment platform that lets qualified investors buy stakes in U.S. farmland. The platform identifies high-potential agricultural properties and then partners with experienced local operators to manage the land effectively.
Depending on the type of stake you want, you can get a cut from both the leasing fees and crop sales, providing you with cash income. Then, years down the line after the farm rises in value, you can benefit from the land appreciating and profit from its sale.

In fact, AI skills and background education were top of the list of factors taken into account as LinkedIn assembled its first-ever list of top colleges, which was released on August 12.
While the list also prioritizes other categories culled from its data—including hiring rates, job mobility, and alumni networks—the special breakout category that many will surely be most interested in is the one that shows the highest percentages of grads entering the workforce in AI-focused jobs.
Many grads are probably concerned about the ability of traditional four-year programs to equip them for this new job landscape, which is understandable as most professionals are currently unclear about how it will impact their companies’ futures.
According to LinkedIn, 81% of C-suite executives are favoring job candidates that are comfortable with AI tools.
Which schools are most AI focused?
The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) comes in at the top of two lists, including the highest percentage of recent graduates going into AI fields, and the highest percentage of new grads listing AI literary and engineering skills on their LinkedIn profiles.
LinkedIn also found that Caltech offers a range of AI-focused classes and overall programs, including AI4Science initiative, which the website describes as an initiative aimed at bringing “AI researchers with experts from other disciplines to push modern AI tools into every area of science and engineering.”
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) came in second in both categories, with University of California-Berkeley, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon University, Harvey Mudd, and University of California-San Diego also appearing on both lists.

The Singapore-based e-commerce company is now valued at $103 billion, compared with $113 billion for DBS, the regional banking giant based in the same city. Sea posted sales that topped estimates on Tuesday, as more of Southeast Asia’s consumers turn to online shopping for anything from iPhones to daily groceries.
The results assuage some worries about the prospects of e-commerce arm Shopee, Sea’s biggest unit. The region’s top online retail platform is battling deep-pocketed global challengers including ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok Shop and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s (BABA) Lazada. Emerging players like Shein and PDD Holdings Inc.’s (PDD) Temu are also looking to break into the emerging region of 675 million people where more and more shoppers are coming online.
The results “help dismiss earlier concerns on growing competition,” Citigroup (C) analysts led by Alicia Yap said in a note. Sea showed “encouraging improvement in user conversion, purchasing frequency, basket size, seller adoption to ads and thriving live streaming and short video content ecosystem.”
Revenue rose 38% to a record $5.26 billion in the three months through June, topping the $5 billion analysts estimated on average. Shares of Sea had their biggest gain in more than two years and closed at their highest level since early 2022.
To attract users, Sea has focused on improving customer experience by building its own in-house delivery network, called SPX Express. That effort helped boost e-commerce gross orders and gross merchandise value by almost 30% during the latest quarter. SPX now handles the majority of Shopee’s billions of parcels annually.
“We expect Sea’s strong competitive edges to continue supporting its earnings growth,” Jian Xiong Lim, an analyst at CFRA Research, said in a note. These include Sea’s “well-developed delivery network and logistics facilities.”
To boost its bottom line, Shopee has been steadily raising the commissions it charges merchants in various core markets by about a third since the start of last year. The hikes, which bring Shopee’s fees above its rivals, show that Sea is confident it can attract and retain merchants, helped by a broad user base and well-established delivery services. Shopee’s second-quarter revenue rose 34% to $3.8 billion, thanks in part to surging commissions and ad revenue.",121bd7322c92820cebb29072d233dccf,trafilatura,2976,0

The combination made for a jarring contrast; the disconnect between EchoStar’s long-term D2D sat-to-cell ambitions and the near-term realities confronting the company is vast.
It is impossible to divorce EchoStar’s constellation news from the hurdles in front of the company: Revenue remains on the decline, the mobile outfit’s operating loss swelled in Q2 2025, a looming debt cliff threatens to capsise its 5G network buildout efforts, ‘going concern’ worries have resurfaced, and the company’s ongoing skirmish with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chair Brendan Carr involves the very spectrum necessary for its proposed D2D LEO constellation.
Translation: The prognosis on EchoStar ever getting its D2D effort up and running isn’t good.
Taking EchoStar’s sat-to-cell pitch on its merits
Setting aside for one moment the laundry list of concerns circling EchoStar: Launching a D2D solution would seem a no-brainer for a company with EchoStar’s mix of terrestrial and non-terrestrial assets. Assuming the company stays right side up – an enormous ‘if,’ to be sure – EchoStar’s LEO constellation would leverage open radio access network (RAN) technology and enable talk, text, and data directly to 5G devices. The wholesale opportunity could prove substantial for EchoStar, complementing terrestrial networks just as every major mobile network operator is reckoning with how non-terrestrial network functionality could eradicate cellular dead zones.
During EchoStar’s Q2 2025 earnings presentation, CEO Hamid Akhavan pitched investors on the idea that its LEO will have limited competition, falling between the satellite fixed broadband space where Starlink dominates and the limited-bandwidth emergency messaging capabilities from AST SpaceMobile and device OEMs.
According to Akhavan, EchoStar’s “wideband” would represent “the natural use case of your mobile phone, the way you use it today.” From there, Akhavan noted that the market is “perhaps crowded in the broadband space” and “may be crowded at some point in the narrowband space,” before claiming nobody is doing what EchoStar calls “wideband” in the space between those opportunities.
However, Akhavan’s rhetoric leaves off one rather significant consideration: Starlink has spent the last few years launching a constellation targeting that very opportunity. Using Starlink’s T-Mobile US partnership as an example – while also noting that Starlink has D2D relationships with operators all over the globe – the functionality implied by the EchoStar execs dovetails with what is on the T-Satellite service roadmap. Starlink will be driving down this lane long before EchoStar arrives.",998fb2e2e74a183bbeed9b2104b55acd,trafilatura,2976,0

The sell-off, concentrated between 13:38 and 13:49, erased most hourly gains as the token fell to $2.634 on heavy volume exceeding 200,000 tokens per minute. Profit-taking at the $2.675–$2.680 resistance level—identified in prior sessions—capped the rally, while the $2.630–$2.635 zone once again provided firm support. NEAR closed the hour at $2.644 after a low-volume rebound attempt.
Over the prior 24 hours, NEAR rebounded strongly from $2.57 support to touch $2.73, a 6% range that showcased aggressive buying interest. The move followed an initial dip from $2.68 to $2.58 before buyers regained control, sending prices back to $2.68 with exceptional turnover of 8.01 million tokens. Resistance around $2.68–$2.73 remains intact, with $2.57–$2.59 proving a reliable floor during repeated tests.
Institutional demand underpinned the rally, with $572 million in global inflows into digital asset investment products last week, including $10.1 million directed toward NEAR. The momentum came as U.S. policy shifts allowed digital assets in 401(k) retirement plans, sparking $1.57 billion in late-week inflows and boosting confidence across blockchain markets. Analysts view this as a pivotal moment for mainstream adoption, potentially broadening NEAR’s investor base.
Technically, NEAR’s chart shows a resilient recovery pattern supported by high-volume surges at key levels. Strong buying near $2.57–$2.59 repeatedly sparked sharp reversals, while the upper $2.68–$2.73 band continues to draw heavy selling pressure. With institutional flows accelerating and regulatory developments favoring crypto adoption, NEAR’s price action may remain volatile but underpinned by strengthening long-term support.
Technical indicators
-
High-volume surge exceeding the 24-hour average of 2.73 million establishes formidable resistance around $2.68-$2.73.
-
The $2.57-$2.59 zone has proven remarkably robust as support through multiple successful examinations and volume-backed reversals.
-
The most significant bearish pressure materialized between 13:38 and 13:49, wherein NEAR plummeted from $2.67 to $2.63, effectively erasing virtually all hourly gains within an 11-minute timeframe accompanied by exceptionally elevated selling volume exceeding 200,000 tokens per minute.
-

Is This a Once-in-a-Lifetime Buying Opportunity Before the Stock Goes Parabolic?
Key Points
-
Lululemon stock has dropped over fears of slowing growth in North America.
-
The brand is doing better than the competition and growing quickly internationally.
-
Management is aggressively repurchasing stock.
Lululemon (NASDAQ: LULU) was once a market darling. It is now one of the worst-performing stocks of 2025. Shares are off close to 50% so far in 2025 on rising fears of competition and macroeconomic headwinds in its athleisure category, with shares down over 60% from all-time highs. After a bustling few years with casual athletic clothing on the rise during the early days of the pandemic, consumers are now flipping to new categories.
And yet, there are still a lot of things to like about Lululemon's business. With the stock trading at one of its cheapest levels ever, is Lululemon stock about to go parabolic for investors who buy today?
Slow North America growth
From the third quarter of 2020 to the fourth quarter of 2023, Lululemon's trailing-12-month revenue in North America more than doubled from $3.5 billion to $7.6 billion. Since then, its trailing-12-month revenue has barely budged, hitting $8 billion over the last 12 months. Investors are not liking this revenue growth slowdown in the core North American market. Last quarter, Americas revenue increased just 4% year-over-year in constant currency.
While a slowdown should never be celebrated, it is important to take everything within a proper context. The entire athleisure category that Lululemon serves has struggled in recent years, especially in the Americas. Competitor Nike saw revenue drop 11% year over year last quarter, while Athleta slipped 6% (geographical revenue was not disclosed, but the brand is mainly centered in North America). This puts Lululemon's slow 4% revenue growth in a better light.
Despite macroeconomic headwinds for the athleisure category, Lululemon has been able to grow market share and still expand in North America.
Room for international expansion
North America is the ugliest part of Lululemon's business, but international is firing on all cylinders. Total international revenue grew 20% year-over-year in constant currency terms last quarter, with China mainland revenue up 22% even with Chinese consumers facing a spending recession for the last few years after the country's housing bubble burst.
Lululemon is just beginning to tap the East Asian market, which is the largest spending region in the world on luxury and premium apparel. Now, it is beginning to expand in Europe. For example, it just opened a flagship 5,700-square-foot store in Milan's shopping district to showcase its products to European shoppers. Other regions outside of China and North America make up just a sliver of Lululemon's revenue, giving it a huge runway to expand in Europe.",f7c5401fdb5e9bc4c917e91104bc694d,trafilatura,2912,0

Total revenue for the company was $658 million, a 53% increase year over year. Circle reports its revenue as a combination of reserve income and other forms of revenue such as subscription and transaction fees. Reserve income went up by 50% to $634 million, and the remaining $24 million from other revenue reflected a 242% increase from the previous year.
Reserve income comes from the Circle Reserve Fund, an SEC-registered government money market fund holding a portfolio of short-dated U.S. Treasuries, overnight U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements and cash. The company attributed the quarter's reserve income increase to a 90% growth in circulation of USDC, the U.S. stablecoin the company issues.
""We make money in two ways,"" Circle's chief financial officer Jeremy Fox-Gein said on the company earnings call. ""We monetize the money stock on the network through reserve income, which we earn on the cash equivalent assets we hold to back our stablecoins. We are also starting to monetize certain transaction flows and elements of our network infrastructure. While these other revenues are small today, they are growing, are high margin and also have the potential to scale rapidly with network adoption and usage.""
Since Circle primarily relies on the interest from its backing assets to make money at this point, discussions of potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve could impact the stablecoin issuer's revenue in the immediate future. However, the company has previously said lower interest rates would also increase the amount of USDC in circulation.
""There's a question of 'will interest rates hold?'"" Robert Le, a crypto analyst for PitchBook, previously told American Banker when Circle was planning its IPO. ""If rates drop, that would materially impact Circle's revenue. And if something were to happen in the broader cryptocurrency market and a lot of USDC gets redeemed, that could be a problem.""
The GENIUS Act, signed into law on July 18, created a regulatory framework for issuing stablecoins as a form of digital currency in the United States and is expected to increase interest in stablecoins across the financial services industry.
""Circle's market and competitive strength is further cemented with the signing of the GENIUS Act,"" said Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire in the earnings call. ""We believe this law will accelerate stablecoin adoption by major financial institutions, mainstream enterprises, technology companies, and ultimately drive much broader use of stablecoins across retail and wholesale payments as well as broader usage in trad-fi capital markets. This is likely the catalytic moment for the mainstream scaling of stablecoins, and we are already seeing this in our business momentum.""",8d7f0f091aeddd0c69de00444ac914e4,trafilatura,2911,0

Cava Group is not having a good week. On Tuesday, August 12, the fast casual restaurant chain announced its second-quarter results and a decline in net income to $18.4 million from $19.7 million year-over-year (YOY).

The drop brought Cava’s earnings (NYSE: CAVA) to 16 cents per share. Notably, this was above Wall Street’s predicted 13 cents per share, but other figures missed the mark, according to consensus estimates cited by CNBC.
Take Cava’s revenue, which increased to $280.6 million from $233.5 million YOY. Despite the growth on paper, it fell short of the $285.6 million figure predicted. Then there’s the company’s same restaurant sales, which grew 2.1%, compared to a projected 6.1%.
This low single-digit increase represented a significant decline from 2024’s fourth-quarter jump of 21.2% and even quarter one’s 10.8%.
Protein sets a high bar
Cava attributes the 2.1% to “menu price and product mix,” while foot traffic was stagnant. Meanwhile, in a post-earnings report call, Cava CEO Brett Schulman attributed the slow growth YOY in part to 2024’s successful “launch of steak, our most significant protein launch in a number of years.”
Investors don’t seem to accept last year’s steak addition as a good enough excuse. But crucially, Cava also cut its sales outlook for the full year.
Cava’s stock plummeted over 24% after-hours and into premarket trading on Wednesday morning. It’s a significant turnaround from last November, when Cava led most of its competitors with an impressive 255% stock growth year-to-date for 2024.
Schulman also acknowledged an uncertain macroeconomic climate, which he described as a “fog,” noted Restaurant Business.
Still, the CEO had a full-speed-ahead attitude when discussing the second-quarter results.
He noted that Cava opened 16 new restaurants—with a total of 398—and that “long lines and warm welcomes” in new markets gave him confidence that Cava will have 1,000 restaurants by 2032. He also highlighted the successful testing of chicken shawarma in Dallas and Tampa.
Schulman further shared that Cava’s Project Soul prototype should be done this fall. The fast casual chain announced Project Soul in 2024, an initiative focused on warmer color palettes, comfier seating, greenery, and an overall more welcoming environment in its restaurants.
It’s expected to launch across new restaurants starting in 2026. Cava will have to wait until then to see if the redesign parlays into another boost in same restaurant sales.

Notably, CSCO has exceeded Street’s earnings expectations in the past four consecutive quarters, including a 1.25% beat in Q4.
While Cisco exceeded analysts’ expectations and is poised to benefit from artificial intelligence (AI)-driven demand for its next-generation networking solutions, investor enthusiasm was notably absent. CSCO shares showed little movement in pre-market trading on Aug. 14, a sign that the market may already have priced in much of the good news. The muted reaction points to the concerns over Cisco’s valuation, which appears stretched relative to its near-term growth prospects. Let’s take a closer look.

Cisco’s Growth Drivers Remain Intact
Cisco’s underlying business fundamentals appear strong, and AI-related tailwinds could continue to drive future growth. Its key growth catalysts showed solid momentum in Q4, setting the stage for sustained expansion.
In the fourth quarter, Cisco posted a 7% year-over-year increase in total product orders, with growth across all its markets. Enterprise product orders rose 5%, driven by a string of large deals with major corporations spanning various industries. Recurring revenue indicators also remained healthy, pointing to long-term growth and stability. Cisco’s total remaining performance obligations (RPO) reached $43.5 billion, up 6%, while product-related RPO climbed 8%. Short-term RPO stood at $21.7 billion, a 4% increase, and annualized recurring revenue hit $31.1 billion, growing 5% overall and 8% in products.
A significant growth catalyst for Cisco is the surge in demand from the AI infrastructure market. The company booked record AI infrastructure orders from large web-scale clients, totaling more than $800 million in the quarter. For fiscal 2025, these AI-related orders have already topped $2 billion, more than double the original $1 billion goal announced a year ago. This highlights the competitive edge of Cisco’s technology and its expanding relevance in powering critical AI-driven back-end systems.
Networking products remain another bright spot. Orders surged at a double-digit pace in Q4, marking the fourth straight quarter of such growth. The demand for its webscale infrastructure, enterprise routing, switching, industrial IoT, and servers remains strong, supporting future growth. Cisco’s customers are showing strong interest in its new Cat9k smart switches and its refreshed lineup of secure routers, ruggedized IoT devices, and wireless access points, all engineered for AI-ready campuses and branch environments.",3d46687a268877b49d2ef3fb375b629b,trafilatura,2846,0

The two men were also hit by the Securities and Exchange Commission with civil charges of violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws in connection the same scheme.
Ryan Wear, 49, of Everett, Washington, is accused of ""raising more than $200 million from investors by selling them water vending machines that, in many cases, did not exist, and paying promised returns through new investor money,"" the DOJ said in a press release.
Wear, who is the former owner and operator of a company called Water Station Management, is charged with securities and wire fraud. His company was forced into bankruptcy last August.
The indictment against him in U.S. District Court in Manhattan says that many of the people swindled in the scheme were retail investors and military veterans.
Former fund portfolio manager Jordan Chirico, a 41-year-old from Carmel, Indiana, is accused of purchasing more than $100 million in bonds issued by Water Station while ""concealing his personal financial stake in the company and, eventually, his knowledge of the fraud that had been perpetrated by Wear,"" the DOJ said.
Chirico is accused of a scheme to defraud 3|5|2 Capital ABS Master Fund LP, an investment fund
which was part of Jefferies Financial Group's Leucadia Asset Management.
Chirico, who was a manager for the fund, is charged with investment advisor fraud in a separate indictment in Manhattan federal court.
Both men face a maximum possible sentence of 20 years in prison if convicted.
""Ryan Wear raised hundreds of millions of dollars through false promises of a water vending machine business that became nothing more than a scam that victimized retail investors, including military veterans,"" said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton in a statement.
""Jordan Chirico made matters worse by putting his own financial interests before his professional duties, investing clients' money in Water Station — helping himself and hurting his investors — even after he knew it was a scam. One fraud does not excuse another. With the assistance of our dedicated law enforcement partners and our colleagues throughout the Department of Justice, this Office will continue to aggressively pursue financial frauds on Wall Street and Main Street.""
FBI Special Agent in Charge W. Mike Herrington, who is based in Seattle, Washington, said, ""The scale of this fraud, which resulted in at least $200 million in losses, is simply staggering.""
""And the deception and obfuscation these two men allegedly engaged in to siphon funds from retail investors, even U.S. military veterans, is absolutely unconscionable,"" Harrington said.",dce6bde82bb35a70ca27d29d20adad81,trafilatura,2845,0

In 2021, stocks like GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC) that no one cared about suddenly skyrocketed to all-time highs. This time, Opendoor (OPEN), Kohl’s (KSS), GoPro (GPRO) and Krispy Kreme (DNUT) have all jumped in price not because these companies are doing better, but due to a wave of online hype.

Check Out: Warren Buffett: 10 Things Poor People Waste Money On
While some people will make quick profits, many others could lose money just as fast. Before you jump into meme stocks, here are some red flags you should look out for.
Big Price Jumps Without Fundamentals
When a stock skyrockets by hundreds of percent in a few days, it’s easy to think you’re missing out on something big. But in many cases, the surge is driven by hype, not company fundamentals.
For example, in late July, Yahoo Finance reported that Opendoor stock rose by more than 300% over the previous month. As of Aug. 12, 2025, GoPro has soared by more than 56% over the past month.
When you see this pattern — stocks rising dramatically without any good news — it’s often a sign of speculative frenzy. When the excitement fades, those gains can disappear quickly. So don’t be the one jumping in late because you’ll likely lose money.

Heavy Short Interest
When a stock is heavily shorted, investors are betting it will drop, and it can lead to increased volatility. If the stock’s price goes up instead, those investors will rush to buy it back to limit losses, which can drive the stock price even higher. This sudden surge is known as a short squeeze.
In late July, Forbes reported that nearly half (49%) of Kohl’s outstanding shares were short positions, while Opendoor had approximately 21% of its shares sold short.
These jumps can be so tempting, but the real danger is that once those shorts are covered and buyers lose interest, prices can fall just as explosively as they rose.
AI and Social Media Hype
In 2025, meme stocks aren’t just riding the waves from Reddit forums. Artificial intelligence (AI) is turbocharging them. “Meme stocks in 2025 rely on AI-driven sentiment analysis and real-time short-interest data, replacing viral tweets and impulsive buying,” according to AInvest.
AI-powered stock-tracking tools can scan social media, forums and news headlines for spikes in specific stock mentions or unusual trading activity. When a stock suddenly trends, these tools could alert thousands of traders. This can create a loop where the same stock names keep getting pushed online, potentially becoming meme stocks. That’s one reason meme stocks can see wild gains in a matter of days and then plummet quickly once the loop moves on to the next big thing.",725b3caa6eec03cc1bdcfc86e2ce38d8,trafilatura,2834,0

Sea beat revenue expectations but missed on the bottom line.
-
Investors appeared to cheer the top-line beat, as the company's three businesses all continue to grow strongly in a profitable manner.
-
Management also called out several key milestones in each business, especially the new market of Brazil.
Shares of Southeast Asian super-app company Sea Limited (NYSE: SE) had rocketed 20.5% higher on Tuesday as of 12:30 p.m.
Sea reported earnings this morning that, while missing estimates on the bottom line, trounced estimates for revenue growth, with strength across all three of its businesses. As a high-growth stock, that top-line strength appears to be what investors care about most.
Sea fires on all cylinders
In the second quarter, Sea saw revenue rally 38.2% to $5.3 billion, while earnings per share of $0.65 missed expectations by $0.04. Still, Sea was profitable across its three businesses encompassing mobile games, e-commerce, and digital finance.
In e-commerce, revenue was up 33.7% on gross market value (GMV) growth of 28.2%, while segment EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) flipped from a $9.2 million loss a year ago to a $227.7 million profit. In digital financial services, revenue grew a whopping 70%, while adjusted EBITDA rallied 55% to $255.5 million. And in digital entertainment, which consists of mobile game publishing and Sea's self-produced hit Free Fire, bookings grew 23.2% year over year, with adjusted EBITDA up 21.6% to $368.2 million.
The combined growth resulted in whopping 364% growth in EPS, showing Sea's profitability beginning to take off from a near-breakeven level a year ago.
Sea also highlighted a few big milestones. These included the eighth anniversary of Free Fire, showing off the ""evergreen"" nature of this game, which incredibly managed to grow bookings double-digits relative to last year. Management also said it now expects 30% bookings growth in the digital entertainment business this year, which is a massive improvement after a long hangover following the early days of the COVID pandemic.
In Shopee e-commerce, Sea also marked its fifth anniversary in Brazil, its only market outside of Southeast Asia. The company claimed in its press release that after just five years it's become the e-commerce leader in the country by order volume, which I'm sure is catching the attention of MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) investors today.
Meanwhile, Sea's digital finance arm is beginning to see more adoption outside the Shopee platform, with Malaysia seeing 40% quarter-over-quarter growth in off-Shopee SPayLater loans, now making up more than 20% of the SPayLater portfolio in the country. More penetration outside of Shopee means SeaMoney could be on its way to becoming a major economywide financial institution.",4a868737069bffc8f46f7c8133437fbf,trafilatura,2823,0

Narrowing the focus, NXPI’s underperformance is also apparent compared to the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD). The exchange-traded fund has gained 25.7% over the past year. Moreover, the ETF’s 8.4% returns on a YTD basis outshine the stock’s losses over the same time frame.
On Jul. 21, NXPI shares closed up more than 1% after reporting its Q2 results. Its adjusted EPS of $2.72 surpassed Wall Street's expectations of $2.66. The company’s revenue was $2.93 billion, beating Wall Street forecasts of $2.90 billion. For Q3, NXPI expects its adjusted EPS to range from $2.89 to $3.30, and expects revenue in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion.
For the current fiscal year, ending in December, analysts expect NXPI’s EPS to decline 11.9% to $10.17 on a diluted basis. The company’s earnings surprise history is mixed. It beat or matched the consensus estimate in three of the last four quarters while missing the forecast on another occasion.
Among the 29 analysts covering NXPI stock, the consensus is a “Strong Buy.” That’s based on 22 “Strong Buy” ratings, two “Moderate Buys,” and five “Holds.”
This configuration is more bullish than a month ago, with 20 analysts suggesting a “Strong Buy.”
On Jul. 23, Argus analyst Jim Kelleher kept a “Buy” rating on NXPI and raised the price target to $270, implying a potential upside of 31.6% from current levels.
The mean price target of $257.69 represents a 25.6% premium to NXPI’s current price levels. The Street-high price target of $289 suggests an ambitious upside potential of 40.9%.

Here's how Foxconn did in the second quarter of 2025 compared with LSEG SmartEstimates, which are weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate:
- Revenue: 1.79 trillion New Taiwan dollars ($59.73 billion) vs. NT$1.79 trillion
- Operating profit: NT$56.596 billion vs. NT$49.767 billion
Second quarter revenue grew 16% from last year, coming in line with LSEG's SmartEstimates. The company's net profit for the second quarter came in at NT$44.36 billion, beating expectations of NT$38.81 billion.
Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry, is the world's largest manufacturer of Apple's iPhones, and has been looking to replicate its success in consumer electronics in the world of AI.
The firm manufactures server racks designed for AI workloads and has become a key partner to American AI chip darling Nvidia.
Sales of Foxconn's server products made up the lion's share of revenues in the second quarter at 41%, surpassing its smart consumer electronic products for the first time, which accounted for 35%.
In an earnings report, the company forecasted that its AI server business would continue to drive growth into the current quarter, with revenue expected to increase by over 170% year over year.
Foxconn said earlier this month that it expected overall revenue to grow further in the third quarter, but noted that the impact of ""evolving global political and economic conditions"" would be closely monitored.
At the end of July, Foxconn announced that it was taking a stake in industrial motor maker TECO Electric & Machinery in a strategic partnership to build more AI data centers.
The company has also shown its willingness to expand into new areas, including the assembly of electric vehicles and the manufacturing of semiconductors.
However, U.S. President Donald Trump's global tariffs could impact Foxconn's outlook this year. In response to Trump's tariff threats, the company has already moved most of its final production of made-for-the-U.S. iPhones to India.
Taiwan has been hit with a 20% ""temporary tariff"" from the U.S., with trade negotiations said to be ongoing.
Last week, Trump also said he would impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips, but not on companies that are ""building in the United States.""
While the details of these tariffs remain unclear, Foxconn Technology Co, a metal casing supplier owned by Hon Hai Precision Industry, announced plans to invest $1 billion in the U.S. over the next ten years as part of its North American expansion strategy, according to local media reports.",4db1d244d721c79bbb461346127ac1bc,trafilatura,2798,0

Arista Networks’ Q2 Results
Arista Networks specializes in networking solutions for data centers and other enterprise clients. The company is known for its high-performance switching platforms, advanced automation, analytics, and security capabilities.
Arista Networks reported a record-breaking Q2 2025, with revenue jumping 30.4% year-over-year to $2.2 billion, beating analyst estimates of $2.11 billion. Non-GAAP EPS reached $0.73, exceeding the expected $0.65, while non-GAAP net income surged 37.3% to $923.5 million.
Non-GAAP operating margin improved to 47%, and operating income surpassed $ 1 billion for the first time, underscoring exceptional efficiency and scale. Growth was broad-based, with AI networking revenue on track to exceed $1.5 billion in 2025, including $750 million from backend Ethernet for hyperscale customers like Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT). Gross margins were robust, with non-GAAP gross margin at 65.6% and GAAP gross margin at 65.2%, both up from last year.
Looking ahead, Arista raised its annual growth target to 25%, aiming for $8.75 billion in 2025 revenue, up from prior guidance of 17%. Management expects the third quarter to deliver $2.25 billion in revenue, a non-GAAP gross margin around 64%, and operating margins near 47%. The company’s leadership highlighted growing enterprise adoption, rapid hyperscale deployments, and a unique “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to accelerate revenue momentum.
Arista is now targeting $10 billion in revenue in 2026, two years ahead of schedule, powered by AI, cloud, and campus networking tailwinds.
Analyst Takes on ANET
Analysts responded enthusiastically to Arista’s results and revised guidance. The consensus view is overwhelmingly positive, with major investment banks such as Barclays and Bank of America raising both ratings and price targets, applauding Arista’s execution, innovation, and market expansion. The increase in deferred revenue and scale of AI customer growth led JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley to reinforce their bullish outlooks. Technical ratings have been upgraded as the company challenges all-time highs, with analysts forecasting further upside given sustained margin growth, robust TAM expansion, and ongoing hyperscaler capex cycles.",5dd375aebbd52d2cedd39eea74a25464,trafilatura,2791,0

The Labor Department reported Thursday that its producer price index — which measures inflation before it hits consumers— rose 0.9% last month from June, biggest jump in more than three years. Compared with a year earlier, wholesale prices rose 3.3%.
The numbers were much higher than economists had expected.
Prices rose faster for producers than consumers last month, suggesting that U.S. importers may, for now, be eating the cost of Trump's tariffs rather than passing them on to customers.
That may not last.
“It will only be a matter of time before producers pass their higher tariff-related costs onto the backs of inflation-weary consumers,” wrote Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at fwdbonds, a financial markets research firm.
Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core producer prices rose 0.9% from June, biggest month-over-month jump since March 2022. Compared with a year ago, core wholesale prices rose 3.7% after posting a 2.6% year-over-year jump in June.
Wholesale food prices rose 1.4% from June, led by a 38.9% surge in vegetable prices. The price of home electronic equipment gained 5% from June. Both are heavily imported in the U.S.
But some aspects of Thursday's producer price report were puzzling, including a big jump in profit margins at retailers and wholesalers. Economist Stephen Brown at Capital Economics found the increase ""to put it lightly, counterintuitive given the anecdotal evidence that firms are absorbing the lion’s share of tariffs increases in margins.''
Trump's tariffs have generated considerable uncertainty about the U.S. economy, the world's largest, which could explain some seemingly contradictory trends. Trump has negotiated trade agreements with several major U.S. trading partners, including the European Union and Japan. But the details have not been published, leaving businesses uncertain about where tariff rates will end up and therefore whether and how they should adjust their own prices.
The fallout from the tariffs has also been delayed because many importers stockpiled products before the taxes took effect. Those inventories are diminishing, however.

-
Bull momentum: BTC/ETH near ATHs; altcoins show broad-based strength.
-
Mid-caps soar; DAAs +15%, TVL +4.8%, DEX volume +12%.
It’s safe to say the bull market has now begun.
Both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are inches from their all-time highs, the CMC Crypto Fear and Greed Index is barely above neutral territory, and altcoins are exploding left, right, and center.
With that in mind, let’s see how the BNB Chain landscape has shaped up over the last week.
BNB Chain Market Recap
The BNB Chain ecosystem is exploding.
The sector reached a new peak market capitalization (mcap) of $242.8 billion after gaining 16.3% since our last update.
Much of this growth was attributed to the stellar performance of the top three assets:
-
BNB (BNB): +11.7% (hitting a new all-time high)
-
Chainlink (LINK): +46.4%
-
Shiba Inu (SHIB): +15.2%
The vast majority of prominent BEP-20 tokens are in the green this week, with several among the mid-caps doing awe-inspiring numbers:
-
Codatta (XNY): +291.6% (surge tied to Binance-linked 12-week Booster Campaign)
-
Bio Protocol (BIO): +107% (launch of BIO and BioDAO staking)
-
Cyber (CYBER): +81% (Upbit listing)
-
Tagger (TAG): +67.5% (two-week data-labeling event)
-
siren (SIREN): +63.2% (unclear catalyst)
As always, there are still a few stragglers in the top 100 BNB Chain ecosystem tokens by mcap.This week’s worst performers include:
-
Mythos (MYTH): -24.3%
-
Spark (SPK): -23.8%
-
Subsquid (SQD): -18.9%
Overall, the sector is demonstrating extraordinary strength, but the underperformance of some tokens reaffirms the need to adapt when tokens no longer fit the narrative.
Compared to other L1s, BNB Chain continued to show signs of relative growth.
Over the last week, the platform saw a 15% uptick in daily active addresses (DAAs), a 4.8% gain in total value locked (TVL), and a 12% increase in DEX trading volume.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Oil prices climbed about 2% to a one-week high on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump warned of ""severe consequences"" if his talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Ukraine fail, and on optimism that a likely U.S. interest rate cut next month could spur oil demand.
Central banks, like the U.S. Federal Reserve, use interest rates to control inflation. Lower rates reduce consumer borrowing costs and can boost economic growth and demand for oil.
Brent crude futures rose $1.21, or 1.8%, to settle at $66.84 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose $1.31, or 2.1%, to settle at $63.96.
Those price gains pushed both crude benchmarks out of technically oversold territory for the first time in three days, and led Brent to its highest close since August 6.
On Tuesday, Brent closed at its lowest price since June 5 and WTI closed at its lowest price since June 2 due in part to bearish inventory and supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the International Energy Agency. [EIA/S]
Trump said on Thursday he thought Putin was ready to make a deal on ending his war in Ukraine after the Russian president floated the prospect of a nuclear arms agreement on the eve of their summit in Alaska.
But on Wednesday, Trump threatened ""severe consequences"" if Putin does not agree to peace in Ukraine, without elaborating. Trump has warned of economic sanctions if the meeting on Friday proves fruitless.
Russia was the second-biggest producer of crude in 2024 behind the U.S., so any agreement that could ease sanctions on Moscow would likely boost the amount of Russian oil available for export to global markets.
Trump has threatened to enact secondary tariffs on buyers of Russian crude, primarily China and India, if Russia continues its war in Ukraine.
""The uncertainty of U.S.-Russia peace talks continues to add a bullish risk premium given Russian oil buyers could face more economic pressure,"" Rystad Energy said in a client note.
Some analysts, however, remained skeptical that Trump would take action that could significantly disrupt oil supplies.
FED RATE CUT
Expectations that the Fed will cut rates in September also propped up oil prices. Traders mostly believe a cut will happen next month after U.S. consumer prices increased at a moderate pace in July.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he thought an aggressive half-percentage-point cut was possible given recent weak employment numbers.
But a jump in wholesale prices is likely to bolster concerns among Fed policymakers that rising inflation remains a risk, intensifying debate over the rationale for an rate cut next month and leaving the tension between the U.S. central bank and the White House unresolved.",44e4e9eb8dc9760c5b4e3babec1d20c1,trafilatura,2776,0

The bullish momentum persisted in the final hour of trading, peaking at $4.85 before consolidating to $4.83, with significant volume confirmation reinforcing the breakout above the $4.78 resistance. Strong support has been established at $4.65, setting the stage for a possible move toward the $4.90–$5.00 range.
During the last hour, ATOM rose from $4.82 to $4.85—a 0.62% gain—before easing slightly to $4.83, a 0.21% dip from the session high. Notably, the $4.85 level was tested and validated by a 24,467-unit volume spike at 10:20, followed by profit-taking that led to a measured pullback. Subsequent volume spikes of 47,638 units at 10:44 and 59,892 units at 10:48 during recovery attempts underscored continued institutional engagement, even in consolidation phases.
The closing minutes saw minimal activity, indicating a brief pause in trading momentum. However, the combination of sustained buying interest, rising support levels, and decisive resistance breaches suggests ATOM is well-positioned for continued upside. With volume dynamics confirming bullish intent, the asset remains on track for a potential challenge of the $4.90–$5.00 price target in the near term.
The move comes as bitcoin dominance dipped below 60% for the first time since January, demonstrating relative strength in the altcoin sector. However, if bitcoin can break above a $124,000 and form a new record high, altcoins may slip as capital rotates back to BTC.

Alex Keith, largely credited with architecting the division’s success over the last decade, will retire as CEO for P&G’s beauty division effective Feb. 20. Freddy Bharucha, currently president, global personal care, will be appointed CEO, P&G Beauty, effective Dec. 1.
In this role, Bharucha will lead P&G’s $15 billion global beauty portfolio and will be based in Geneva, Switzerland, where P&G’s Europe headquarter offices are based.
During her tenure, Keith, a chemical engineer by training, harnessed her instinct for human chemistry to crack a code no one else has been able to solve for the last decade: how to create a winning formula for Procter & Gamble’s beauty business.
Keith spent more than 20 years working in the beauty industry, including the last eight as CEO, transforming the business into the fourth largest beauty company in the world, according to the 2024 Beauty Inc Top 100, WWD’s annual ranking of the world’s largest beauty companies by sales.
Her key accomplishments include transforming Olay into a mass skin care behemoth, as well as rejuvenating hair care brands such as Pantene and Herbal Essences. More recently, she took the company into new territory, creating P&G’s Specialty Beauty division and acquiring buzzy brands like Native, Ouai and Mielle.
“The ability to guide and grow a global business at this scale — powered by a tremendous organization and inspired by consumers who love beauty as much as I do — has been an absolute privilege,” Keith said in a statement. “I’m proud of the momentum this business continues to realize each subsequent year and I take much joy in seeing how our brands and our people have grown — and will continue to do so. As part of that, I’m grateful to have had the opportunity to work closely with Freddy these many years and help him develop into the leader he is today. I know he will thrive as P&G Beauty’s next CEO and will help our business thrive, too.”
Bharucha comes to the role with leadership experience working in nearly every region P&G operates in and with more than 20 years working in the beauty industry. This includes leading skin care and personal care businesses in China as well as hair care businesses in North America and Asia.",58fbe670752e66810336e7475bb8d4b8,trafilatura,2768,0

Trump's order, among other things, directs the U.S. transportation secretary to eliminate or expedite environmental reviews for launch licenses administered by the Federal Aviation Administration, the White House said in a statement.
The declaration also calls on the secretary to do away with ""outdated, redundant or overly restrictive rules for launch and reentry vehicles.""
""Inefficient permitting processes discourage investment and innovation, limiting the ability of U.S. companies to lead in global space markets,"" the executive order states.
While Musk and Trump had a high-profile falling out months ago, the billionaire entrepreneur's SpaceX rocket and satellite venture potentially stands to be the single biggest immediate beneficiary of Trump's order on Wednesday.
SpaceX, though not mentioned by name in Trump's order, easily leads all U.S. space industry entities, including NASA, in the sheer number of launches it routinely conducts for its own satellite network, the U.S. space agency, the Pentagon, and other enterprises.
Jeff Bezos' private rocket company Blue Origin and its space tourism business could also gain from a more relaxed regulatory regime.
Musk has repeatedly complained that environmental impact studies, post-flight mishap investigations and licensing reviews required by the FAA have needlessly slowed testing of SpaceX's Starship rocket, under development at the company's South Texas launch facility.
Starship is the centerpiece of Musk's long-term SpaceX business model, as well as a core component of NASA's ambitions for returning astronauts to the moon's surface, establishing a permanent human lunar presence and ultimately sending crewed missions to Mars.
Musk has viewed FAA oversight as a hindrance to his company's engineering culture, considered more risk-tolerant than many of the aerospace industry's more established players. SpaceX's flight-test strategy is known for pushing spacecraft prototypes to the point of failure, then fine-tuning improvements through frequent repetition.
This has appeared to run afoul at times with the FAA's mission of safeguarding the public and the environment as it exercises its regulatory jurisdiction over commercial spaceflight.
Earlier this year, the FAA grounded Starship test flights for nearly two months after back-to-back post-launch explosions rained debris over Caribbean islands and forced dozens of airliners to change course. The FAA ended up expanding the aircraft hazard zone along Starship's launch trajectories before licensing future flights.",9f41d7399a5f53f83a4de93de1803fa3,trafilatura,2764,0

On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) granted “in-principle” approval to Paytm’s Payment Services unit to operate as an online payment aggregator, parent company One97 Communications said in its filing (PDF) to Indian stock exchanges. The approval comes more than two years after the Noida-based fintech was initially denied the license in November 2022 due to noncompliance with India’s rules on receiving investments from countries that share a land border.
Without the license, Paytm was barred from onboarding new online merchants. At the time, the company said the restriction had “no material impact” on its business or revenues. However, at its annual general meeting last September, One97 Communications founder and CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma stated his intention to reapply for the payment aggregator license.
The approval also comes over a year after the RBI banned Paytm Payments Bank from accepting fresh deposits and enabling credit transactions. Paytm weathered that impact by quickly shifting gears and partnering with Axis, HDFC, State Bank of India, and Yes Bank to make them serve as payment system providers for its consumers and merchants involved in online transactions and autopay mandates.
With the new license, Paytm can operate as a service provider for online merchants, enabling them to accept a range of payment methods, including cards, net banking, and the Indian government-backed Unified Payments Interface (UPI). The approval also lifts the online merchant onboarding restrictions imposed by the central bank in 2022.
The approval comes just a week after China’s Ant Group exited Paytm by selling its remaining 5.8% direct stake in One97 Communications for $454 million through block deals. This follows an earlier exit in 2023, when Ant Financial sold a 10.3% stake — worth $628 million — to Sharma in a no-cash deal.
Paytm is required to undertake a “system audit,” including a cybersecurity review, and submit its report to the Reserve Bank of India within six months. If it fails to do so, the approval will lapse, per the RBI letter enclosed with the company’s stock exchange filing. The license is also limited to online payment services and does not extend beyond that scope.
The latest development will help Paytm control most of its value chain, from its offline sound boxes to the online payment gateway, and reduce its reliance on other bank partners, fintech investor Osborne Saldanha told TechCrunch.",0bc65480392ce8e7da07d78afd0ea028,trafilatura,2755,0

Producer prices in July rose faster than forecast across the board, giving investors and the Federal Reserve an inflation surprise just over a week out from Fed Chair Jay Powell's crucial Jackson Hole speech.
The Producer Price Index (PPI) for July showed inflation for businesses rose 0.9% over the prior month, well ahead of the 0.2% increase that was forecast, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed Thursday. On an annual basis, prices rose 3.3%, the most since February.
""Core"" producer prices, which exclude food, energy, and trade services, rose 0.6% last month, the most since March 2022 and an uptick after prices were unchanged in June. On an annual basis, core producer prices rose 3.3%, which was also the most since February.
Stocks slipped following the release of Thursday's data.
Thursday's data comes two days after the July Consumer Price Index showed inflation pressures were broadly in line with forecasts, while ""core"" inflation last month reached a six-month high. On an annual basis, consumer prices rose 3.1% in July, an increase from 2.9% the prior month and still well ahead of the Fed's 2% inflation target.

Producer prices measure price changes from the perspective of businesses offering or selling goods and services in the economy; consumer prices measure changes from the perspective of those paying for those goods and services.
Thursday's data suggests, then, that companies will not absorb all costs incurred from tariffs but will pass some of these costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices.
""While businesses have assumed the majority of tariff cost increases so far, margins are being increasingly squeezed by higher costs for imported goods,"" said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide. ""We expect a stronger pass-through of levies into consumer prices in [the] coming months.""
Stephen Brown, an economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a client note Thursday that the surge in core PPI ""was due to a head-scratching increase in margins for wholesalers and retailers.""
Brown added that this data still implies inflation running ahead of the Fed's target, but a chunk of last month's rise in services inflation is due to higher costs for portfolio management, a function of the stock market's rally since reaching its April lows and something that ""won't concern the FOMC,"" in Brown's view.

(Reuters) -Commonwealth Bank of Australia reported its best full-year cash earnings of A$10.25 billion ($6.69 billion) and a record dividend payout on Wednesday, but investors dumped shares in the bank considered one of the most expensive in the world.
Shares in CBA, Australia's largest lender, fell about 5% to the lowest level since May but the stock was still up about 10% for this year.
""We would sell here - CBA trades at a significant premium to our valuations and to its key peers,"" said Matthew Davison, Portfolio Manager at Martin Currie Australia, which is a CBA investor.
The bank trades on a price-to-book ratio more than triple the industry median, and at about 30 times earnings, or about double its Australian peers and much larger American banks like JPMorgan, according to LSEG data, making it one of the costliest in the world.
""This premium is disconnected from the return on equity and growth trends we see in these results and has been disproportionately driven by passive flows,"" Davison said.
CBA makes up about 12% of the Australian share market meaning some fund managers have to buy the stock to meet their mandates.
The bank's profit came in slightly higher than a Visible Alpha consensus of A$10.24 billion and climbed from last year's A$9.84 billion.
""We think the valuation is so high that people need the bank to actually beat expectations for it to maintain the very high price-to-earnings ratio,"" said Joseph Koh, portfolio manager at Blackwattle Investment Partners, adding there was nothing in the result that would otherwise drive the shares down as much as 5%.
CBA declared a final dividend of A$2.60 per share, compared with A$2.50 apiece last year. Its full-year dividend payout of A$4.85 apiece is the highest ever and topped analysts' estimates.
Its cash earnings rose on lending growth, especially in business banking, while underlying margins were stable.
Interest rate cuts by the central bank lowered the bank's total loan impairment expenses as economic conditions improved. The Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday cut the official cash rate to 3.6% in its third interest rate reduction this year.
CBA warned the broader environment remained characterised by ""a rise in global macroeconomic uncertainty, increased geopolitical risk and continued domestic competitive intensity"", but said it maintained ""prudent balance sheet settings over the long term"".
The bank said 85% of its customers were ahead on their mortgage repayments. However, despite the improving economic conditions, it said home loan payments delayed for more than 90 days jumped 5 basis points to 0.70%, the highest since at least 2018. Some customers continued to be impacted by cost-of-living pressures, it said.",945f5d1fbf026607c4162eca34f22920,trafilatura,2747,0

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Multifamily Dive newsletter.
In three key metrics — same-store revenue, expenses and net operating income growth — UDR beat expectations in the second quarter of 2025.
The Highlands Ranch, Colorado-based REIT posted increases of 2.5%, 1.7%, and 2.9% in revenue, expenses and NOI, respectively.
“UDR reported 2Q25 results that we would characterize as being a little better than expected for the quarter, and it delivered an expected guidance raise for the year, helped by solid cost containment,” said Anthony Paolone, executive director at JPMorgan, in a research note shared with Multifamily Dive.
UDR’s blended lease growth of 2.8% came in just below JPMorgan’s estimate of 3%, while occupancy, at 96.9%, was stronger than the expected 96.6% projection.
Buoyed by Q2 growth, UDR improved its same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth outlook to 2.5%, 3% and 2.25%, respectively. Previously, the REIT had expected increases of 2.25%, 3.5% and 1.75% in those categories.
“The wind has been at our back in 2025, with employment and income growth exceeding consensus expectations, relative affordability squarely in the favor of apartments and new supply pressures waning,” UDR CEO Tom Toomey said on the Q2 call last month.
Here is more from UDR’s Q2 earnings report and call with analysts.
Absorption mitigates supply pressures
UDR set the stage for its Q2 results late last year. “Our strategic decision to build occupancy during the seasonally slower leasing period of the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025 put us in a position of strength to drive revenue and NOI outperformance to start the year,” said Chief Operating Officer Mike Lacy on the call.
What Toomey referred to as “record-high absorption” and strong retention helped the REIT in the first half of 2025. Its occupancy was 30 basis points higher than its historical Q2 average.
UDR’s annualized resident turnover was 420 basis points below the prior-year period and more than 1,100 basis points better than its Q2 average over the last 10 years. “This enabled us to accelerate renewal rate growth, which led to more favorable blended lease rate growth,” Lacy said.
UDR achieved 5% growth in renewal leases in Q2. With a 30-basis-point improvement in new lease growth, the firm’s blended rates improved 2.8%.
“Our blends accelerated 190 basis points compared to the first quarter, which is 70 basis points higher than our historical sequential acceleration between the first quarter and second quarter,” Lacy said. “As a result, our first half blended lease rate growth of 2% was 20 basis points above the high end of our guidance range.”",51d082762d7b1cf65d0cab42d9b8c525,trafilatura,2744,0

The notes will carry a semi-annual interest rate of 4.25%.
Denison plans to allocate the net proceeds towards the evaluation and development of initiatives such as the Wheeler River uranium project, and for general corporate purposes.
The Wheeler River project is located on the eastern side of the Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan, Canada.
The initial conversion rate for the notes has been set at 342.9355 shares per $1,000 principal amount, equating to an initial conversion price of approximately $2.92 per share. This rate is at a 35% premium over the closing sale price of the shares on 12 August 2025 and may be adjusted under certain conditions.
Denison retains the right to redeem the notes in specific scenarios, while holders have the right to demand repurchase upon certain events.
The offering is expected to close around 15 August 2025, subject to standard closing conditions.
The company also intends to fund capped call transactions with a portion of the proceeds or existing cash reserves.
In connection with the notes' pricing, Denison has entered into capped call transactions with initial purchasers and financial institutions. These transactions aim to minimise potential dilution from the conversion of the notes and offset any excess cash payments required upon conversion, up to a set limit.
The capped call counterparties have disclosed plans to engage in derivative transactions related to the company's shares alongside or shortly after the notes' pricing. These actions could influence the market price of Denison's shares or the notes.
Additionally, the counterparties may adjust their hedge positions through various derivatives or secondary market transactions, which could also impact the market price and affect noteholders' conversion outcomes.
The offering is contingent upon receiving all necessary approvals, including from the Toronto Stock Exchange and the NYSE American.

A Wednesday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission said a Texas jury found Landstar Ranger acted as a broker, not a motor carrier in a 2021 “tragic vehicular accident.” The verdict assigned 15% of the $22.8 million in total monetary damages to Landstar. The remaining 85% of the damages were attributed to truckload carrier MyUniverse, the motor carrier hauling the brokered load.
Landstar (NASDAQ: LSTR) previously disclosed the accident in its second-quarter report at the end of July. The company noted the shipment was conducted under “a non-exclusive truck brokerage contractual arrangement,” and didn’t involve one of its business capacity owners, who haul almost exclusively for Landstar.
The company said it had already included an “immaterial accrual” for the accident on its balance sheet in the second quarter and that there is “no anticipated change to the previously recorded immaterial accrual.”
Landstar said all parties are expected to file post-trial motions and that a potential appeals process looms.
“No assurances can be provided as to the probability of success with respect to any potential post-trial motions or appeals relating to the Verdict or the ultimate outcome of any such appeals,” the filing stated.
The company also said the decision is unlikely to impact a $12 million “no claims bonus” program it has in place with third-party insurers. It received the remaining $3 million of the bonus allotment at the beginning of the third quarter “due to favorable loss experience.”
Landstar also disclosed on Wednesday other charges that will be incurred in the third quarter following an annual strategic review.
It plans to sell or otherwise dispose of its Mexican subsidiary, Landstar Metro, as the unit “has not been able to meet the Company’s strategic or operational goals and expectations.” It formed the unit in 2017 in conjunction with the acquisition of Fletes Avella. An initial investment of $8.5 million, along with additional investments, pushed the unit’s carrying value to approximately $26 million at the close of the 2025 second quarter.
Landstar expects to record a noncash impairment charge of $13 million to $17 million, or 28 cents to 37 cents per share, in the third quarter. However, it said the disposition won’t adversely affect its cross-border offering.
Landstar will also see a $9 million noncash impairment charge (20 cents per share) as it unwinds its Blue TMS platform. The company has decided to conduct TL brokerage services exclusively through its Landstar TMS.",cf555dab2ac0ff4c34b624aad5b51a2f,trafilatura,2744,0

Narrowing the focus, ONEOK has also lagged behind the First Trust Nasdaq Oil & Gas ETF’s (FTXN) 9.9% downtick over the past 52 weeks and 5% drop on a YTD basis.
ONEOK released its Q2 results on Aug. 4, and its shares plunged 5.2% in the following trading session. Due to the positive impact of the EnLink and Medallion acquisitions across the company’s system, its adjusted EBITDA improved 22% from the year-ago quarter, reaching $2 billion. Moreover, its net income per share of $1.34 grew marginally year-over-year, meeting the consensus estimates. However, a higher inventory of unfractionated natural gas liquids (NGLs) due to unplanned outages and lower realized NGL prices, net of hedging, might have weighed on investor sentiments.
For the current fiscal year, ending in December, analysts expect OKE’s EPS to grow 5.8% year over year to $5.47. The company’s earnings surprise history is mixed. It met or surpassed the consensus estimates in two of the last four quarters, while missing on two other occasions.
Among the 17 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a ""Moderate Buy” which is based on 11 “Strong Buy,” one ""Moderate Buy,"" and five “Hold” ratings.
The configuration is less bullish than two months ago, with an overall “Strong Buy” rating.
On Aug. 8, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) analyst Jeremy Tonet maintained a ""Buy"" rating on OKE and set a price target of $93, implying a 25.6% potential upside from the current levels.
The mean price target of $100.59 represents a 35.8% premium from OKE’s current price levels, while the Street-high price target of $147 suggests an ambitious upside potential of 98.5%.

Elon Musk urged companies to leave Delaware after clashing with its Court of Chancery in 2024.
-
Delaware says its position as the country's most corporate-friendly state remains unthreatened.
-
Over 2.1 million businesses have been incorporated in Delaware as of 2024.
Elon Musk has a Rolodex of feuds: US President Donald Trump, ""212"" rapper Azealia Banks, and even a British diver who helped save a Thai soccer team stuck in a flooded cave.
In 2024, he set his sights on Delaware.
Although Delaware is generally considered a business-friendly state with a robust corporate legal system, Musk tried to shatter that reputation after a judge at Delaware's Court of Chancery denied his multi-billion-dollar pay package, which was approved by Tesla's board. In typical Musk fashion, he used his X account as a megaphone to blast the court and urged others to incorporate their business elsewhere.
""Companies should get the hell out of Delaware,"" Musk wrote last August. Musk moved SpaceX and Tesla from Delaware to Texas in 2024.
Some prominent companies have since followed Musk out of the state.
VC firm Andreessen Horowitz is the most recent high-profile company to exit Delaware because, the company said in a blog post, recent rulings by the Court of Chancery had undermined its ""reputation for unbiased expertise.""
Companies like Roblox, Dropbox, and Trump Media have also left the state.
Texas, Nevada, Florida, and Wyoming have become preferred destinations for some business leaders in a shift that some have dubbed ""Dexit,"" a reference to the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, known as Brexit.
The state's historical dominance as a destination for companies to incorporate is rooted in the Delaware General Corporation Law, a business-friendly statute that acts as the bedrock of its corporate law. Companies leaving Delaware might do so for various reasons, including privacy or tax preferences, but for Musk, it's about finding greener legal pastures.
For its part, Delaware isn't overly worried.
Dexit? Not according to Delaware.
Attorneys and state officials still consider Delaware the premier destination for corporations, despite Musk's criticism.
""Yes, there has been some political rhetoric about leaving Delaware,"" Delaware Secretary of State Charuni Patibanda-Sanchez told Business Insider. ""What our data is showing is that Delaware is still the preeminent place to incorporate your business.""
Patibanda-Sanchez's office oversees the Division of Corporations, which says the state was home to over 2.1 million corporations and two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies in 2024. Still, the number of business entities formed in Delaware has slowed slightly, falling from about 313,000 in 2022 to about 289,000 in 2024.",dd4ce02ffeb66a4afd3a47b765e7185b,trafilatura,2740,0

Adjusted operating profit of $298 million, higher than $248 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted operating margin expanded to 7.9%, compared with 7.3% in the year-ago period.

“Through our iconic and diversified brand portfolio, our Packaged Meats segment is delivering on consumers’ needs for quality protein at a great value,” said Smithfield President and CEO Shane Smith.
The CEO highlighted that the firm’s Fresh Pork segment is “adeptly navigating a dynamic tariff environment”, with the Hog Production segment growing profitability.
As of June 29, 2025, the company had $3.225 billion of available liquidity consisting of $928 million in cash and equivalents.
On July 31, the firm announced a dividend of 25 cents per share to be paid to shareholders on August 28.
Outlook
For fiscal year 2025, the company has updated its financial outlook, showing increased optimism in some areas while maintaining a steady course in others.
It is reaffirming its expectation for total company sales to grow by a low-to-mid-single-digit percentage compared to fiscal year 2024. This projection specifically excludes the sales impact from the Hog Production segment’s transactions with Murphy Family Farms and VisionAg.
The company is also holding firm on its previous forecasts for the Packaged Meats segment, with an anticipated adjusted operating profit of between $1,050 million and $1,150 million, and for the Fresh Pork segment, which is still expected to generate an adjusted operating profit of between $150 million and $250 million.
However, the company is raising its guidance for the Hog Production segment’s adjusted operating profit, now forecasting it to be in the range of $0 million to $100 million. This positive adjustment has led to an overall increase in the total company’s adjusted operating profit outlook, which is now expected to fall between $1,150 million and $1,350 million.
The company’s plans for capital expenditures remain unchanged, with a budget of $400 million to $500 million dedicated to profit improvement, maintenance, and repair projects. Finally, the effective tax rate is also being reaffirmed at a range of 23.0% to 25.0%.",5dbfc2648150188c308e25a754953480,trafilatura,2738,0

BitMine Immersion has been a millionaire-maker in recent months. Compared to their price in the final week of June, BMNR shares are up more than 1,200% at the time of writing.
Is There Still Time to Build a Position in BMNR Stock?
BitMine Immersion stock remains attractive as a long-term holding despite its explosive rally since Ethereum is not demonstrating any signs of letting up yet.
In fact, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has secured more than $1.5 billion in inflows into its exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this week, sharply higher than just $244 million for Bitcoin (BTCUSD).
Moreover, now that President Donald Trump has signed the “GENIUS Act”, landmark legislation aimed at integrating stablecoins into mainstream finance, demand for Ethereum’s blockchain infrastructure is broadly expected to surge.
This regulatory breakthrough could act as a powerful catalyst for ETH, unlocking new institutional use cases and accelerating adoption across traditional financial channels, setting the stage for further increases in BMNR stock.
Ether’s Continued Surge Could Benefit BitMine Immersion
BMNR stock could rip higher from here also because experts are increasingly predicting continued momentum in Ether prices in the second half of 2025.
Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick, for example, now sees ETH rallying further to $7,500 by the end of this year, indicating potential upside of another 55% from current levels.
In his latest research report, he dubbed the passage of the GENIUS Act a “pivotal change,” adding it should “indirectly boost activity on Ethereum as increased stablecoin liquidity leads to increased decentralized finance activity, where ETH dominates.”
In a recent CNBC interview, Tom Lee – the new chairman of BitMine Immersion – even made the case for Ether prices hitting $30,000 over the next few years.

So if you’ve been coasting since filing your 2024 return, now’s the time to check in and get proactive. Here are six tax moves to make before the year slips away.
Update Your W-4 Withholdings
Most people fill out a W-4 when they start a job and never look at it again. But a lot can change after getting that new job, including having a baby, getting a side hustle, or buying a home. All of these can affect how much tax you should (or shouldn’t) have withheld from your paycheck.
If you owed a big chunk or got a huge refund last year, that’s another sign your W-4 might need adjusting. Here’s how to know if it’s time for a refresh:
-
You had a child or added dependents. You might qualify for the Child Tax Credit (up to $2,000 per child), or the nonrefundable $500 Credit for Other Dependents.
-
You picked up extra income. A second job or side hustle usually means no tax is withheld unless you do it yourself. You might want to increase withholding at your main job to make up the difference.
-
You plan to itemize this year. If you’re claiming deductions beyond the standard, you can reflect that on your W-4 to reduce how much is taken out now.
You can use the IRS’s Tax Withholding Estimator to run the numbers. Then just submit a new W-4 to your human resources (HR) department.
Consider This: 7 Tax Loopholes the Rich Use To Pay Less and Build More Wealth
Harvest Tax Losses
If you have some losing investments in your portfolio, you might be able to use those losses to offset gains and shrink your tax bill.
This is known as tax-loss harvesting, which is when you sell underperforming investments to lock in the loss. You can then use that loss to offset gains from other investments or deduct up to $3,000 of ordinary income.
Just watch out for the wash-sale rule: If you repurchase a “substantially identical” investment within 30 days before or after selling it, the IRS won’t let you claim the loss.
Get Organized if You Plan to Itemize
The standard deduction for 2024 is $15,000 for singles and $30,000 for married couples. But if you had big expenses this year, you might want to itemize instead.
If that’s the case, start tracking and organizing receipts now. Fidelity also recommends bunching multiple years’ worth of charitable donations into one year so you can itemize this year and take the standard deduction next.",8321f09bcf6b38ad36938cdbba7b8785,trafilatura,2732,0

The Wall Street strategist and new chairman of BitMine, a little-known Bitcoin miner recently turned Ethereum treasury, is raising a staggering $20 billion more to keep gobbling up more of the cryptocurrency.
That figure stunned analysts.
“It certainly caught me by surprise,” Luke Nolan, senior Ethereum research associate at CoinShares, told DL News. “It’s quite a big move and does signal their intention on vastly increasing their treasury size at quite a rapid pace.”
BitMine already holds about 1.2 million in Ether, worth roughly $5 billion. Since late July, when it kicked off its new corporate treasury scheme, shares are up fifteenfold.
‘True scarcity’
For Lee, the aggressive nature with which his — and potentially other — companies will add Ether to their balance sheet, is what many investors are overlooking.
“There’s true scarcity in Ethereum right now,” Lee previously told DL News.
But it’s not just the asset, “it’s the velocity at which we’re accumulating it,” he said.
Corporate crypto treasuries are in vogue. Michael Saylor kicked it off in August 2020, since then spurring an entire cast of copycats within the Bitcoin ecosystem. In the past months, firms are exploring further down the risk curve, adding alternative cryptocurrencies to their balance sheets.
It’s an “alarming” trend, some say.
‘Pretty bad development’
At the end of July, BitMine irked the cryptocurrency community when it announced a $1 billion stock buy back plan.
Instead of accumulating Ether, the company would buy back its shares, potentially stalling the momentum for both BitMine’s share price as well as the price of the cryptocurrency.
Critics said it was a “pretty bad development.”
Ethereum has since rallied, now trading at about $4,500 — just 10% shy from its November 2021 all-time high.
‘Counterintuitively aligned’
Nolan reckons the buyback plan and the $20 billion raise are part of a single, counterintuitive, playbook.
“This goes well with their recently announced $1b buyback plan,” Nolan told DL News.
“While counterintuitive: when the NAV premium is very high, issue shares to buy Ethereum. When the NAV premium is low, or even negative, use cash to buy shares.”
NAV stands for net asset value, and reflects the difference between a company’s value and the value of its underlying cryptocurrency holdings.
But NAV can cut both ways.
When demand for a company’s shares shrivels up, the price can drop below the value of the asset it holds. This is known as a discount to NAV.
It has happened before. For instance, with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which at one point traded at a 50% discount. Grayscale managed to bounce back by transforming itself into a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.",fed18060e027d8ebf4586426279f9440,trafilatura,2730,0

Dive Brief:
-
A 2024 U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission discrimination charge constituted an overly broad and vague “fishing expedition” that should be blocked by a federal judge, the board of education for New Mexico’s Gallup-McKinley County Public Schools district alleged in a lawsuit filed Aug. 8.
-
Per the complaint, then-Commissioner Andrea Lucas submitted a charge alleging that the district discriminated on the basis of race in its hiring practices. The district claimed that EEOC refused a request for information about the charge’s basis, violating its due process rights. It further claimed that EEOC’s request for information was so overbroad as to exceed its investigative authority.
-
The plaintiffs also alleged procedural errors on EEOC’s part, claiming the agency failed to allow sufficient time for a local fair employment practice agency with jurisdiction over the case the opportunity to process the charge instead of EEOC. The commission did not respond to a request for comment.
Dive Insight:
The board of education claimed that EEOC violated Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Administrative Procedure Act and the Fifth Amendment guarantee of due process. A portion of the complaint alleged that EEOC’s request that the district produce five years’ worth of confidential employee and applicant information did not properly consider the privacy interests of affected parties.
Noting that the vast majority of the district's students and employees are Native American, the complaint said Lucas had asserted ""broad and vague claims without any factual support of systemic discrimination toward Native Americans.""
“If the EEOC’s investigation is allowed to proceed, sensitive personal information of employees and applicants may be disclosed to the government despite the government’s complete lack of authority to obtain it,” the plaintiffs wrote. “Each of these individuals and entities will be irreparably harmed.”
The complaint also noted that EEOC currently lacks a quorum, and the plaintiffs alleged that “all actions by the EEOC, thus far, are contrary to law and outside of Defendants’ authority and outside a quorum of the Commission.”
EEOC requests for information have been of particular concern this year due to the agency’s public commitment to cracking down on diversity, equity and inclusion programs. One attorney previously told HR Dive that employers may want to consider taking a number of steps before responding to an EEOC letter or information request, such as negotiating the scope of such requests and providing a position statement.",412961d732a32aaac63bb15c26cf8e02,trafilatura,2729,0

Elon Musk’s long-standing battle with OpenAI has a new participant: Apple.
On Tuesday, Apple found itself the latest target of Elon Musk’s legal threats when the xAI CEO accused the tech giant of using unfair means to promote OpenAI’s ChatGPT over his company’s rival Grok chatbot in the App Store. Musk called it an “unequivocal antitrust violation” and threatened to take legal action. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who is part of an ongoing feud with the billionaire, quickly weighed in on the dispute, calling Musk’s accusation a “remarkable claim.” He, in turn, accused Musk of manipulating his own platform, X, “to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn’t like.”
Apple has denied Musk’s claims, saying in a statement that the App Store “is designed to be fair and free of bias.”
“We feature thousands of apps through charts, algorithmic recommendations, and curated lists selected by experts using objective criteria,” a spokesperson said in a statement shared with news outlets. “Our goal is to offer safe discovery for users and valuable opportunities for developers, collaborating with many to increase app visibility in rapidly evolving categories.”
X users, and Musk’s own Grok chatbot, were quick to point out that Musk’s claim was undermined by apps like DeepSeek and Perplexity having previously taken the top slot on Apple’s App Store.
The issue may have more to do with Apple’s standing deal with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Under a mid-2024 deal, ChatGPT is built into Siri and system-wide writing tools on an opt-in basis. Siri asks for permission before sending queries; no OpenAI account is required; and Apple has said it plans to support additional AI providers over time.
Even so, the integration gives ChatGPT a prominent, first-party placement on hundreds of millions of Apple devices, potentially making it harder for rivals like Musk’s xAI to win users’ attention. With Google weaving its Gemini AI into Android, the mobile AI market could increasingly be shaped by default integrations, which could make it much harder for rivals like xAI to compete.
The OpenAI and Apple deal appeared to get under the billionaire’s skin when it was announced, with Musk taking to X to complain: “It’s patently absurd that Apple isn’t smart enough to make their own AI, yet is somehow capable of ensuring that OpenAI will protect your security & privacy!”
Musk went on to threaten to bar all Apple devices from his companies if OpenAI technology was integrated into iOS operating systems.

The heavy machinery maker reported earnings per share of $4.75, beating the consensus of $4.67. It reported a 9% decline in quarterly sales to $12.02 billion, beating the consensus of $10.31 billion.
Production and precision agriculture sales decreased 16% for the quarter to $4.27 billion as a result of lower shipment volumes and unfavorable price realization. Operating profit slumped 50% to $580 million primarily due to lower shipment volumes / sales mix.
Small agriculture and turf sales decreased 1% to $3.03 billion due to lower shipment volumes, partially offset by favorable currency translation and price realization.
Operating profit decreased 2% to $485 million due to higher tariffs, partially offset by reductions in warranty expenses and lower production costs. The decreased production costs were primarily the result of lower material costs.
Construction and forestry sales decreased 5% to $3.06 billion due to unfavorable price realization. Operating profit decreased 47% to $237 million primarily due to unfavorable price realization and higher production costs caused by higher tariffs, partially offset by a favorable product mix.
“By proactively managing inventory, we’ve matched production to retail demand, enabling our company and dealers to respond swiftly to market shifts and customer needs,” said John May, chairman and CEO of John Deere.
“By continuing to address the high levels of used equipment in the industry, we’re building a healthier market for everyone, our customers, our dealers, and our business, even in these challenging times,” May added.
Deere’s financial services reported a net income increasing 34% to $205 million, driven by a lower provision for credit losses.
Outlook
Deere narrowed its fiscal 2025 net income guidance to between $4.75 billion and $5.25 billion, compared to its previous forecast of $4.75 billion to $5.50 billion, citing that customers remain cautious amid ongoing uncertainty.
“We remain committed to delivering solutions that address our customers’ current needs while also laying the groundwork for future growth. For example, the increasing utilization and proven in-field effectiveness of advanced technologies, such as See & Spray and Harvest Settings Automation, are empowering customers to improve their productivity and better navigate industry challenges,” May noted. “The positive outcomes we’re enabling reinforce our confidence in Deere’s future despite near-term uncertainty.”",cdee2530266b69c038104a6f2d719b85,trafilatura,2723,0

Hon Hai, which assembles Nvidia Corp. servers and Apple Inc. gadgets, posted a better-than-projected 27% rise in net income in the June quarter. It predicted a 170% rise in revenue from servers made for artificial intelligence tasks during the current three-month period. But executives warned the smart consumer electronics business, which faces potential US tariffs, should shrink this year.
Hon Hai is navigating abrupt geopolitical shifts while it tries to diversify its manufacturing footprint. It already cut its full-year revenue guidance in May, citing potential fallout from the US-China trade war. President Donald Trump has since declared plans for a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports, though he’s promised to exempt companies that move production to the US.
“Major cloud service providers are raising their spending, and governments around the world are rolling out sovereign AI projects. This shows overall AI demand still outstrips supplies,” Hon Hai rotating Chief Executive Officer Kathy Yang told analysts on a post-earnings call on Thursday. “Our group is aggressively expanding our capacity to meet the swiftly growing demand.”
On Thursday, the company reported net income of NT$44.36 billion ($1.5 billion) for the period, beating an average analyst projection for NT$36.14 billion. The company, also known as Foxconn, earlier reported a 16% sales increase for the period.
Foxconn is expanding capacity in the US — heeding Trump’s call to avoid tariffs by shifting production to America. It will add more AI server production in Wisconsin and Texas, where the company operates existing campuses, Yang said.
SoftBank Group Corp. is taking ownership of Foxconn’s electric vehicle plant in Ohio, kick-starting the Japanese company’s $500 billion Stargate data center project with OpenAI and Oracle Corp. The Taipei-based company would operate the plant and use the site for its own AI server manufacturing business, Bloomberg News reported.
Apart from tariffs, Foxconn’s appreciating home currency is also disrupting business. The decline in smartphone revenue stems from the Taiwan dollar’s recent gains against the greenback, Hon Hai executives said.",9aeae44505259d24de09215573c17627,trafilatura,2716,0

LONDON (Reuters) -Gigantic robot arms controlled by artificial intelligence glide around a vast factory in Oxfordshire, England, making building frames from timber, one of the world's oldest construction materials.
With the British government committed to building 300,000 new homes a year, some housebuilders say that the combination of technology and green materials could help them to overcome challenges from skills shortages to environmental targets.
England lags many similar economies in terms of the share of housing accounted for by timber-framed homes. Britain as a whole, meanwhile, is among the slowest adopters of robotics, especially in construction, according to the National Robotarium research institute at Heriot-Watt University.
""We're seeing more major housebuilders and small and medium-sized builders embracing timber as a way to ... overcome the skills and carbon challenge,"" said Alex Goodfellow, CEO of Donaldson Timber Systems (DTS).
His business makes timber-frame structures for homes and commercial buildings, including walls, floors and roofs, then sends them to housebuilders for assembly.
Its automated production makes for less labour-intensive housebuilding and provides a faster, cheaper and more sustainable alternative to bricks, stone or concrete blocks, the company says.
A study by construction surveyors and consultancy Rider Levett Bucknall showed that building with timber is 2.8% cheaper than with masonry.
FASTER CONSTRUCTION
The DTS factory in Witney, near Oxford in southeast England, makes timber panelling for about 100 homes a week with designs entered digitally using artificial intelligence, reducing the need for paper drawings.
DTS says its robotics and lasers enable it to produce pre-assembled sections builders can put together quickly on site. The technology reduces the time needed to build a home by about 10 weeks compared with traditional materials, Goodfellow says.
Yet barriers remain to any significant increase in timber homes in England.
Amit Patel at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said the material is not commonly used in England because of difficulties in securing warranties for timber buildings owing to durability concerns.
Barratt Homes tried to revive timber usage in the 1980s, but sales were undermined by potential rot and fire vulnerabilities.
Andrew Orriss of the Structural Timber Association says that such concerns have been addressed by current building regulation and the STA's fire safety guide.
He says that the off-site timber construction sector could help to deliver about a third of the government's target of 300,000 new homes per year - a level not achieved in England since the 1970s.",172fa9599377740848165f6e94424b3f,trafilatura,2710,0

One source of relief for consumers? Prices at the pump. The latest CPI report shows July prices were down 2.2% from June and 9.5% from the year prior. The national average for a gallon of regular unleaded as of Aug. 12 was $3.14, according to AAA, down from $3.44 a year ago.
Prices could continue to slip in the months ahead as the weather cools and oil production ramps up.
""Gas prices are lower than they were a year ago. That has really persisted this year and given some confidence to the consumer to feel a little bit more wealthy at a time when there’s inflation everywhere else,"" said Matt Smith, an oil analyst with commodity data firm Kpler. ""They're definitely providing, and should provide, a bit of a respite going forward.""
Gas prices 'steady' in 2025
The best way to describe gas prices so far this year? ""Steady,"" especially when compared to recent years with dramatic swings like 2022, according to AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz.
""It's certainly good news for drivers,"" Diaz said.
Increased output from oil producers has helped keep prices stable, with Brent crude – the world benchmark for oil prices – largely trading between roughly $60 and $70 per barrel in recent months.
The group of oil-producing countries known as OPEC+ has hiked production to regain market share, according to Smith, and shows no signs of slowing after announcing plans to boost production again in September. Meanwhile, U.S. crude oil production hit record highs this year at more than 13 billion barrels per day, and smaller oil producers like Brazil and Guyana have also increased output.
""We’re seeing a lot of supply come to market to outpace demand, so that should weigh on gasoline prices,"" Smith said.

How low will gas prices go?
Gas prices could continue to fall in the months ahead if oil production remains elevated. The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects Brent crude oil prices to fall from an average $71 per barrel in July to $58 per barrel in the last three months of the year, then down to $50 per barrel in early 2026.
Prices at the pump could also see relief as the weather cools and refineries switch from summer blends to cheaper winter blends.
""I fully expect we’ll see this drop from $3.15, where they’re at now, to below the $3 per gallon mark,"" Smith said. ""Probably into October. That’s where we could really start to see a charge toward $2.50.""",5bcb329e1c8d9bbd26f80cc33d4c972a,trafilatura,2704,0

According to Arcuri, one of SiTime's biggest growth opportunities should come from its partnership with Apple. Apple this year made SiTime its exclusive supplier of microelectromechanical systems, or MEMS, oscillators for its in-house modem as the iPhone maker replaced traditional quartz crystal oscillators. Unlike quartz crystal oscillators, MEMS are smaller, more energy-efficient and precise oscillators that can be integrated onto a chip. It's ""an opportunity so big that we believe it alone could account for nearly all of the Street's incremental revenue through 2026,"" he said, referring to the Apple partnership. ""SiTime has become the only one-stop shop MEMS timing supplier across the industry capable of addressing system-level clocking applications and is unique in its ability to bring together MEMS/analog/subsystems expertise to build timing systems that do not exist today."" SiTime's stock rallied earlier this year on the inclusion of its oscillators in Apple's iPhone 16e. The company's oscillators are also in other Apple products, such as the Apple Pencil Pro. Moreover, Arcuri sees SiTime as a standout artificial intelligence play with room to grow. ""In addition to a strong and growing AAPL position, it is also unique among peers in its market cap range given its very high leverage to AI, which we estimate could be pushing 35% of revenue by 2027. We see this year's 40% revenue growth continuing at least through 2026 and likely beyond as it grows into a large served market relative to its current size,"" the analyst said. SiTime isn't widely covered, but most who do are bullish. LSEG data shows that five of the seven analysts covering the stock rate it a buy or strong buy.",f326f6b549692892b38a294627f0f8b7,trafilatura,2702,0

Narrowing the focus, UPS has also lagged behind the iShares Transportation Average ETF’s (IYT) 10.2% surge over the past 52 weeks and its 4.5% rise this year.
On Jul. 29, UPS announced its fiscal second-quarter earnings. The company generated $21.2 billion in revenue, down 2.8% year-over-year, but slightly above estimates. Meanwhile, adjusted EPS of $1.55 missed forecasts. U.S. Domestic revenue dipped 0.8% on lower volumes and margin pressure. International revenue rose 2.6% but was hurt by a steep drop in China–U.S. shipments, and Supply Chain Solutions revenue plunged 18.3% after divesting Coyote Logistics.
Citing weak consumer sentiment, tariff impacts, and soft demand, UPS withheld full-year guidance and announced $3.5 billion in 2025 cost cuts, including 20,000 layoffs, moves that, along with the earnings miss, triggered a 10.6% drop in its stock.
For the current year ending in December, analysts expect UPS’ EPS to decline 15.4% year over year to $6.53. Moreover, the company has surpassed analysts’ consensus estimates in three of the past four quarters, while only missing on one occasion.
Among the 29 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on 15 “Strong Buy” ratings, one “Moderate Buy,” 11 “Holds,” and two “Strong Sells.”
On July 31, Citigroup Inc. (C) analyst Ariel Rosa maintained a “Buy” rating on UPS but cut the price target by 10.24%, from $127 to $114.
UPS’ mean price target of $106.24 indicates a premium of 20.5% from the current market prices. Its Street-high target of $155 suggests a robust 75.8% upside potential from current price levels.

Dive Brief:
-
Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose at a 3.1% annual rate last month after a 2.9% gain in June, with a resurgence in the cost of services including transportation and medical care fueling much of the gain, according to Labor Department data released Tuesday.
-
Broader headline inflation was less misaligned with the Federal Reserve’s 2% long-term inflation target, rising at a 2.7% annual rate – the same pace as in June. A 3.7% annual gain in shelter prices was the primary force behind the increase, the Labor Department said.
-
“July CPI was not so good, after a couple of better months in May and June,” Fitch Ratings Chief Economist Brian Coulton said in an email. Yet with economic growth slowing, consumer spending softening and hiring cooling during the past three months, “the chances of a September rate cut have increased,” Coulton said, referring to a scheduled meeting of Fed policymakers Sept. 16-17.
Dive Insight:
Despite the higher-than-forecast price pressure data, traders in interest rate futures on Tuesday held to their bet that the central bank will trim the federal funds rate next month from the current range between 4.25% and 4.5%.
Responding to the inflation news, traders raised the odds of a quarter-point rate cut in September to 94% from 86% yesterday, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.
Weakness in the labor market compelled two Fed governors to dissent from a central bank decision last month to hold the federal funds rate steady for the fifth straight meeting. They called for a quarter-point cut.
Other Fed officials, while not yet supporting a reduction in borrowing costs, have recently voiced concern about the cooling labor market and signs of faltering consumer spending, which drives nearly 70% of economic growth.
“Real consumer spending has all but stalled in recent months,” Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin said Tuesday in a speech. “Consumers, exhausted from four years of above-target inflation and tired of high prices, are trading down.”
Meanwhile, gross domestic product growth slowed from 2.5% in 2024 to a 1.2% annual rate during the first half of this year, and the job market has faltered this summer, with the average in payroll gains during the most recent three months slumping to 35,000 from 127,000 during the February through April period, Barkin noted.
In addition, “companies are set to raise prices further in the context of increased tariffs,” Barkin said, while noting that consumers “are more willing to defer purchases if prices go up.”",41fa0a9962a560826c68c6dd07c84fee,trafilatura,2689,0

This development is part of a larger commitment by the company to invest more than $10bn in US capital for innovation and critical manufacturing capacity enhancement.
The process of API manufacturing involves creating the active components that are essential for the therapeutic effects of medications.
AbbVie aims to enhance its chemical synthesis capabilities in the country with this new facility, which will support current and future neuroscience, immunology and oncology medicines' domestic production.
AbbVie chairman CEO Robert Michael stated: ""Over the next decade, AbbVie will expand production of API, drug product, peptides and medical devices in the US to support future medical breakthroughs.
""This is an important step to maintain US leadership in pharmaceutical innovation and deliver next-generation medicines that make a remarkable impact on patients' lives.""
The construction on the new API facility in North Chicago is set to commence in autumn 2025, with the site fully operational by 2027.
This development will enlarge AbbVie's current manufacturing presence in the US. The company creates more than 6,000 jobs across 11 sites and supports many more through its supplier networks.
Illinois Governor JB Pritzker stated: “AbbVie's decision to expand its manufacturing footprint in Illinois is a testament to our state's world-class workforce, infrastructure, cutting-edge research institutions and location that keeps businesses connected to the nation and the world.
“As a global leader in pharmaceuticals, AbbVie's investment in Illinois bolsters our world-class biomanufacturing ecosystem and creates jobs while it innovates next-generation medicines.”

LinkedIn’s expanding access to its AI-generated job summaries option for recruiters, which helps prospective employers ensure that the relevant key terms and skills are noted in your job ads, better aligning them with LinkedIn’s recommendation systems.
The option has been available in some regions for a while, while LinkedIn has also been developing its listings within its Recruiter platform to improve their accuracy.
And now, more LinkedIn Company Page managers in more regions will be able to use its AI assistance for their job listings.
As explained by LinkedIn, its AI-generated job summaries are currently available “for a subset of LinkedIn members using LinkedIn job posts in the U.S., India, U.K., Canada, and Australia.”
Originally, the option was only available in the U.S. and Canada, but now, more regions are gaining access, providing expanded AI assistance in the job listing process.
And the expansion into India is significant, because India is now LinkedIn’s third-biggest user market, behind the U.S. and Europe.
The platform has seen rapid growth in India, and as such, it’s now becoming a bigger focus for the platform, as it builds new tools and innovations.
Which, for LinkedIn, at least for the moment, means more and more AI-powered options.
“AI-assisted job descriptions make it easier for hiring managers to create high-quality job descriptions quickly. Using this feature helps you spend less time creating your job description from scratch and more time on other aspects of hiring.”
LinkedIn says that the process leverages data and skills insights from across the platform to draft more resonant job descriptions.
“The inputs used are job title, job location, company, workplace type, and job type that are provided to us when you start your job post.”
LinkedIn says that these AI-generated summaries will help employers come up with better outlines for the position that they’re hiring for, though they won’t necessarily be better than human-created overviews.
“Using AI-assisted job descriptions does not mean the draft job description will be better for your role than if you write your own. We hope to help hiring managers save time writing and editing their job descriptions and use a skills-based approach to help draft a job description for you. While we try to ensure quality, mistakes can sometimes happen and job descriptions will not contain all required information. You’ll still need to review the job description to make sure it is right for your role and make any edits before posting.”",07dedad3fd5cbded7a237056114d4741,trafilatura,2689,0

(NASDAQ:MU) is one of the best large-cap tech stocks to buy now. While the overall performance of the stock has been strong with YTD gains of over 41%, the rally so far has been volatile. From trading at $95-$100 levels throughout the first quarter of the year, the stock plunged to $65 in April, staged an impressive surge to $127 by June, and has since settled closer to an average of $116. But this volatility has not dampened bullish sentiment. In fact, for some, it has made the story more compelling.
One such optimist is Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh, who on July 18 reiterated his Outperform rating and $150 price target, calling the recent pullback a buying opportunity. He expects the company to deliver a strong performance in the second half of 2025, with high-bandwidth memory (HBM) playing a key role. Larger deal sizes in HBM are projected to lift selling prices by 15%–20%, supporting revenue growth.
Manczurov/Shutterstock.com
Rakesh favours semiconductor names showing both sales momentum and margin improvement, and he believes Micron fits that profile. He also sees the company increasing its market share in HBM by 2026, which would further strengthen its competitive position.
That thesis got a boost on Monday, August 11, when Micron raised its Q4 FY 2025 (FY ends in August) revenue and earnings guidance, driven by better execution and improved pricing, especially in DRAM. Management now expects sales for the quarter to be in the range of $11.1 billion to $11.3 billion, up from $10.4 billion to $11 billion earlier. It also raised adjusted gross margins guidance for the quarter to 44% to 45%, compared with an earlier guide of 41% to 43%. As a result, EPS is now expected at $2.78 to $2.92, versus $2.35 to $2.65 earlier.
Such upward revisions underscore both the demand strength and the pricing power Micron is enjoying in its core markets.
Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) designs, develops, manufactures, and markets memory and storage products, including dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), flash memory (NAND), solid-state drives (SSDs), and High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) globally.

10 stocks we like better than Tencent Music Entertainment Group ›
Investors were happy to crank Tencent Music (NYSE: TME) on Tuesday. Following the release of encouraging quarterly results by the China-based company, they sent its U.S.-traded American Depositary Shares nearly 12% higher in price on the day. That rate crushed the S&P 500 index's otherwise heartening 1.1% rise.
Music to the market's ears
In its second quarter, Tencent Music collected 8.44 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) in revenue, a strong (18%) year-over-year improvement for the company. The main driver of this growth was the take from online music services; this rose by 26% to 6.85 billion yuan ($953 million) for the period. Average revenue per user (ARPU) also headed north, rising to 11.7 yuan ($1.63) from 10.7 yuan ($1.49).
Tencent Music's net income also saw a notable increase in volume. It climbed nearly 38% higher to just under 2.5 billion yuan ($348 million), for a per-ADS figure of 1.55 yuan ($0.22).
Both headline numbers beat the average analyst estimates. Pundits tracking the company's stock were anticipating it would earn 7.97 billion yuan ($1.1 billion) for revenue and a per-ADS net profit of 1.42 yuan ($0.20).
A one-stop shop for tunes, and fortunes
In its earnings release, Tencent Music quoted executive chairman Cuisson Pang: ""As we continue to scale our platform, we are focused on building a vibrant, one-stop music service destination that empowers content creators and reshapes connections with music lovers in meaningful ways.""
The company did not offer any guidance in its earnings release.

The U.S. tax code has grown significantly over the past 40 years. According to Intuit, it now exceeds 6,000 pages when including statutes, regulations, and IRS guidance.
It’s no surprise, then, that a Tax Foundation survey found 66% of Americans view the tax code as overly complicated.
Without guidance from an experienced financial professional, you may be missing valuable strategies that could lower your tax liability and boost your savings.
This is particularly important for retirees whose income is derived from a mix of sources, such as Social Security, dividends, interest, and capital gains.
With that in mind, here are the top three tax mistakes many older Americans frequently make — and how to avoid them.

Neglecting tax gains harvesting
Long-term capital gains and qualified dividends are taxed more favorably than ordinary income. As of 2025, the 0% capital gains rate applies to individuals with taxable income up to $48,350, and married couples filing jointly up to $96,700.
These generous brackets allow you to realize gains — such as by selling appreciated assets in a taxable brokerage account — without increasing your tax bill.
Overlooking this opportunity could prove costly, especially if much of your wealth is in traditional IRAs that will be subject to Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) starting at age 73.
Social Security torpedo
Social Security benefits aren’t taxed like other income. To determine how much is taxable, the IRS uses your provisional income — which includes half of your Social Security benefits, in addition to other income sources like wages, dividends, and tax-free interest.
Up to 85% of your benefits may be taxed if your provisional income exceeds $34,000 as a single filer or $44,000 as a married couple filing jointly. At lower income levels, a smaller portion — 50% or none — may be taxed.
This means even a small increase in income can trigger a higher taxation of your benefits, creating a steep marginal tax rate. This sudden spike is known as the “tax torpedo.” and it’s one of the most common mistakes older Americans make.",8dfdd2afd846ece9b9e874686c5c4739,trafilatura,2674,0

The investment is set to accelerate the platform from factories to restaurants, enhancing production and deployment throughout the US.
The Automated Makeline platform reduces waiting times and assists staff members so they can focus more on customer service.
As part of its expansion strategy, Hyphen is collaborating with US-based Re:Build Manufacturing.
Hyphen has chosen Ricoh USA as its field service partner to support the nationwide installation.
This partnership leverages the network of more than 15,000 certified technicians, ensuring reliable field service support across the country.

Hyphen CEO and co‑founder Stephen Klein stated: ""This new funding is a testament to the impact Hyphen's team and technology are having on restaurant operations.
""We are galvanised by this investment to scale our manufacturing, support our growing customer base and continue innovating as we build the future of foodservice.""
In 2023, Chipotle Mexican Grill joined forces with Hyphen to test the automated digital makeline for the preparation of bowls and salads.
In a separate announcement, CAVA Group has reported a revenue increase of 20.3% to $278.2m for the fiscal second quarter (Q2) ended 13 July 2025, compared to $231.4m in the same quarter of the previous year.
This growth is attributed to the opening of 75 new CAVA restaurants that have surpassed performance expectations, and a 2.1% rise in same-restaurant sales, driven mainly by menu pricing and product mix.
A slight dip in restaurant-level profit margin was observed from 26.5% to 26.3%, due to input costs and wage investments.
CAVA Group posted a net income of $18.4m, or 6.5% of revenue, in comparison to the $19.7m registered in Q2 fiscal 2024.

Alternative investments were defined to include private market investments, real estate, commodities, infrastructure projects, lifetime income strategies — and notably, ""holdings in actively managed investment vehicles that are investing in digital assets."" (Curiously, crypto was the only asset class where ""actively managed"" was specified versus the ""direct or indirect"" language used for everything else — a regulatory breadcrumb worth exploring.)
The crypto industry — at least its asset management segment — cheered this latest presidential order granting crypto managers access to a $12 trillion pool of very sticky U.S. investment money. CoinDesk's coverage included industry reactions like this from Bitwise's Matt Hougan: ""This order isn't about the government saying 'crypto belongs in 401(k)s.' It's about the government getting out of the way and letting people make their own decisions.""
Herein lies the problem: most people who participate in 401k plans don't make their own decisions, or do so hastily. In fact, there is a law in place to make sure participants don't have to decide at all.
The Pension Protection Act of 2006 solved a thorny problem for employers: what to do when 401k participants don't choose their own investments. Previously, employers faced potential liability for any default investment that performed poorly. The act gives employers safe harbor protection if they make default elections a ""Qualified Default Investment Alternative"" (QDIA) — usually a target-date or balanced fund. HR departments no longer had to worry about being sued for picking the ""wrong"" default option.
While this solved the employer liability problem, it created an opportunity for folks to neglect one of the most important investment decisions of their lives. Participants typically join their 401k during the chaos of starting a new job — dealing with health insurance, taxes, onboarding and actually learning the job. Faced with investment choices they don't understand, many simply go with the flow and accept whatever default option their employer has selected, often a target-date fund with a retirement date that roughly matches their age. The glidepath concept — automatically shifting from stocks to bonds as retirement approaches — creates a false sense of security. Participants assume they're ""all set"" simply by not opting out, and never revisit the decision. Years or decades may pass.",4de2e0ca490d706c1c22335e1df01496,trafilatura,2670,0

Due to growth in both its U.S. and International healthcare solutions segments, the company’s overall revenue improved 8.7% year-over-year to $80.7 billion, surpassing consensus estimates by a slight margin. Moreover, its adjusted EPS of $4 advanced 19.8% from the prior-year quarter and came in 5.8% above analyst expectations. Additionally, COR raised its fiscal 2025 adjusted EPS guidance, and now expects it to be between $15.85 and $16. Yet, its shares tumbled 2.9% after the earnings release.
For the current fiscal year, ending in September, analysts expect COR’s EPS to grow 15.9% year over year to $15.95. The company’s earnings surprise history is promising. It surpassed the consensus estimates in each of the last four quarters.
Among the 14 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a ""Strong Buy” which is based on 11 “Strong Buy,” and three “Hold” ratings.
This configuration is slightly more bullish than three months ago, with 10 analysts suggesting a “Strong Buy” rating.
On Aug. 11, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) analyst Richard Choe maintained a ""Buy"" rating on COR and set a price target of $344, implying a 19% potential upside from the current levels.
The mean price target of $335 represents a 15.9% premium from COR’s current price levels, while the Street-high price target of $355 suggests an ambitious upside potential of 22.8%.

One Overemployment Veteran Says There's One Mistake That Can End It All
For some workers, one full-time job isn't enough. They're quietly taking on two, three or even more high-paying roles at the same time, a practice known as overemployment.
But with bigger paychecks comes bigger risks, and one veteran says there's one slip-up that can ruin everything.
Double-Booked Meetings Are The No. 1 Danger
In a viral post on Reddit's r/overemployed forum, one contributor recently shared 20 rules from five years of working multiple jobs. They've been caught once before, and it was for the same mistake that takes down most people.

""Avoid double meetings at ALL costs. It's the No. 1 way people get caught, including me. Use a sick day if needed,"" the poster wrote.
The survival guide covers everything from using separate devices for each job to avoiding shared human resources systems. The poster recommends completely separate laptops, webcams, keyboards and phones for each role, instead of juggling accounts on a single machine. They also change notification sounds, block off calendar time to separate each job's hours, label devices to avoid mix-ups, and use preferred names so coworkers can't link profiles across companies.
They caution against letting a company install device management on a personal phone, using a real headshot in Slack or Teams, which are popular workplace communication platforms, or sharing payroll logins between jobs. ""If they want to manage your device, they should provide a separate phone,"" the post said.

LinkedIn And Legal Risks
When it comes to LinkedIn, the advice is to create a burner account with no photo and strict privacy settings. Others in the thread disagreed, saying they've simply hibernated their main account without issue. One commenter noted, ""You raise more red flags by having different LinkedIn accounts, with different versions of your name.""
The post also stresses that if an employer catches on, you should never admit to overemployment. ""That lets them fire you immediately with no severance,"" it said. Instead, it suggests mentioning ""tortious interference"" and possibly contacting legal counsel.",28eb4fe6985efb93ec54a7292227771b,trafilatura,2664,0

The deal aims to expand the Specialty Alliance, the distributor's multi-speciality management services organisation (MSO) platform, in which Cardinal will gain a stake of around 75%.
The acquisition will also create the Urology Alliance, comprising a collaborative network of urology providers within Cardinal’s Specialty Alliance MSO, as well as resonate with plans to expand the delivery of urological patient care.
Cardinal’s Solaris buyout complements its recent acquisitions of Urology America, Potomac Urology, and Academic Urology & Urogynaecology, signalling its urologic strategy.
The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of this year, pending customary closing conditions.
Cardinal Health CEO Jason Hollar stated that growing the Speciality Alliance is a “top priority” for the company, with the latest urology purchase leaving it “well-positioned to meet the comprehensive needs of community urologists through the robust combined capabilities of the Specialty Alliance, Specialty Networks and Cardinal Health”.
Research indicates there is a shortage of urologists in the US, with 62% of US counties lacking a practising urologist and just one new urologist entering the field for every ten retiring. The figures lead to challenges in the broader field, including delayed diagnoses, increased rates of advanced-stage conditions, and significant health disparities, with these particularly pronounced in rural communities.
GlobalData’s senior medical analyst Selena Yu foresees Cardinal’s acquisition as reflecting a shift from drug distribution with a “lower profit margin, towards higher margin speciality care in urology”.
Yu said: “MSOs help streamline backend work like billing and staffing to allow for physicians to focus on care.
“Additionally, with a large network of specialists, patients can receive care in the same region by different care specialists, which will reduce wait times and improve care continuity. Additionally, the Cardinal Health Alliance has other specialities like oncology specialists, which makes referrals more streamlined.”
Cardinal’s acquisition coincided with the release of its Q4 2025 financials. The company’s profits per share came in at $2.08, beating the forecasted $2.03, yet profits for the quarter came in at $60.2bn, below the $60.92bn forecast, prompting a pre-market stock drop of more than 11% on 12 August. Cardinal’s share price has since recovered to a drop of around 6% to $147.05 per share, down from $157.66 per share at market close on 11 August.",b36ccf04d62e5e7f9f20d462b857f14f,trafilatura,2664,0

While the internal details of the PPI report were noisy and not entirely indicative of a tariff-driven inflation reacceleration, Treasury yields rebounded sharply and the sectors of the market that had been celebrating easier Fed policy since Tuesday's mild CPI reading have disgorged gains: Russell 2000 down more than 1.5%, consumer cyclicals shedding more than 1%, homebuilders off 2%. Still, these declines in each case account for less than half of their weekly gains and the broader reaction by the equity market has been to rotate rather than beat an outright retreat. The Nasdaq-100 was flattish with the quality/defensive mega-caps again acting as a shock absorber, even with three-quarters of NYSE volume in declining stocks and almost as many new 52-week lows as highs on the Nasdaq. For a second day, the S & P 500 found traction exactly at the level where it closed Tuesday after the CPI-release/rate-cut-hope rally, with tactical traders trying to hold that line. For as resilient and hard-to-rattle as the market has been, it's tough to deny that the four-month rally since the April lows has priced in benign outcomes across several fronts: moderate/diffuse tariff impact, sustainability of AI capex, ability of growth stocks to hold their valuations (Nasdaq-100 almost back to post-pandemic peak of 28 forward P/E) and a Fed resuming rate cuts for ""good news"" reasons. From one angle it's odd that there is such a drumbeat for the Fed to cut rates when the S & P 500 just made its 17th record high of the year, Bitcoin is zooming, credit spreads are near historically tight levels, speculative retail-trader activity is manic and the Federal fiscal impulse remains undiminished. There's a case for looking through tariff-driven goods-price bumps, and the July payroll report was a warning on the labor market for sure. But the stakes around the September Fed decision seem lower than the pitch of the debate around it would suggest. Has volatility bottomed for now ? VIX traded near 14, a six-month low, while ""realized vol"" – the actual experienced annualized volatility of the S & P 500, just perked up from rock-bottom readings near 6 to 10 or so. Larry McMillan of market-strategy service McMillan Analysis says this is a potential short-term sell signal for stocks.

Dynasty Financial Partners has entered into an equity swap agreement with Abacus Global Management, a publicly traded alternative asset originator and manager that specializes in life insurance products.
As part of the equity swap, Abacus, which became a Dynasty partner firm in 2023 with the launch of its wealth management division, ABL Wealth, has acquired a minority stake in Dynasty and vice versa.
“Our investment in Abacus illustrates our confidence in their business model, the strength of their balance sheet, and the commitment of [Abacus CEO Jay Jackson] and the team to continue building out their wealth business,” said Dynasty founder and CEO Shirl Penney, in a statement.
Dynasty launched its equity swap program about six or seven years ago and has entered into agreements with a significant number of its large clients as a way to align interests between them. The firm does not take any controlling interest in the firms it acquires. The deal with Abacus was structured in the same way as others.
Abacus launched its wealth division in 2023 with Dynasty support and a plan to seed that offering by acquiring and rolling up RIAs under the ABL Wealth brand. It will provide those advisors with leads from both the inquiries the company receives and cash payouts from its life settlements business.
Last year, Abacus signed an agreement to acquire Carlisle Management Company SCA, a Luxembourg-based alternative asset manager with about $2 billion in assets under management, for $200 million. Dynasty Investment Bank advised Abacus on the deal. That was followed by Abacus’s acquisition of FCF Advisors, a New York-based asset manager with about $600 million in assets under management.
Both firms have become part of ABL Wealth and will provide investment strategies to advisors who eventually join the platform. Abacus has not made any RIA acquisitions thus far, but Jackson has been vocal about his intention to do so and the firm’s commitment to the wealth business.
Abacus receives some 10,000 inquiries a month from individuals who may not qualify to sell their policy but have other financial services needs. These leads are, on average, over age 55 and have $1 million of net worth, and serve as a differentiator to the company as it looks to attract RIAs.
Abacus went public in July 2023 via a Special Purpose Acquisition Company, merging with East Resources Acquisition Company. It now trades on the NASDAQ under the symbols “ABL” and “ABLLW.” The company purchases life insurance policies from consumers for cash.",1935f73a48cc59bd5bfbb3cea799309b,trafilatura,2650,0

LONDON (Reuters) - What matters in U.S. and global markets today
By Mike Dolan, Editor-At-Large, Finance and Markets
Spurred on by the U.S. President and Treasury Secretary, expectations for interest rate cuts are reaching a fever pitch, with markets now starting to price in a small chance of a half point cut as soon as next month as they await today's producer price report.
On Wednesday, Scott Bessent said downward revisions to the U.S. payrolls meant the Federal Reserve needed to play catch-up. He said there was a ""very good chance"" of a 50 basis point reduction in September and that rates should ""probably"" be 150-175 bps lower.
* Wall Street zoomed to new records on Wednesday, but stock futures stepped back a touch ahead of the PPI report but two-year Treasury yields continued to stalk three-month lows. Even though many Fed officials are still cautious about the prospects for a half point cut, Wall Street banks are starting to forecast as many as three cuts this year, arguing softer jobs growth, a lack of ""pass-through"" from tariffs to consumer prices, and a new appointee to the Fed board will tip the balance.
* Thursday's producer price update for July will be important as details feed into the Fed's favored PCE inflation gauge. Annual headline and core PPI inflation are expected to pick up to 2.5% and 2.7%, respectively. Meantime, President Donald Trump said his pick for the next Fed Chair would be named ""a little bit earlier"" and he'd narrowed it down three or four names, despite indications earlier on Wednesday that as many as a dozen names had been considered.
* Elsewhere, the inflation picture softened further given this week's slide in crude oil prices to two-month lows ahead of the critical U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska tomorrow. Japan's yen jumped to three-week highs, knocking the Nikkei stock index back sharply from record highs, as Bessent also said the Bank of Japan was ""behind the curve"" in tackling inflation there. Sterling hit six-week highs on the euro after the release of above forecast UK GDP data. Finally, riffing off the week's heady surge in risk appetite and rate cut bets, Bitcoin jumped to a new record high at $124,481.

Ether (ETH) has climbed 5% in the past 24 hours to $4,470, its highest price since December 2021.
Helping the bullish action in crypto in general was Tuesday morning's Consumer Price Index report. While the data was mixed and inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, market participants lifted bets on the U.S. central bank trimming interest rates at its next meeting in September.
Boosting ether in particular was a new massive leg higher in the growing corporate treasury strategy movement. Already the owner of roughly $5 billion in ETH, Tom Lee's Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) disclosed plans to raise up to $20 billion in capital for further purchases.
The move extends a months-long rally for the Ethereum network’s native token, which also continues to outperform bitcoin after years of severe relative weakeness. The ETH/BTC ratio rose above 0.37 on Tuesday, now higher by nearly 50% over the past month, though still lower by 15% year-over-year.
A key driver in recent weeks has been surging inflows into U.S. spot ether exchange-traded funds. On Monday, ether ETFs saw a record $1 billion in daily inflows, again surpassing their bitcoin equivalents.
“Ethereum’s outperformance today, with a gain of over 4% against Bitcoin’s muted move, reflects the market’s focus on its own set of powerful catalysts,” said Axel Rudolph, senior technical analyst at IG. “Institutional inflows into US spot ETH ETFs following the US's CPI print, coupled with growing confidence in the network’s recent upgrades, are proving far more compelling for investors than the broader macro-driven momentum underpinning bitcoin.”
Supporters have increasingly dubbed Ethereum “the blockchain of Wall Street,” pointing to its central role in tokenizing assets, hosting decentralized finance platforms and powering settlement systems that resemble traditional market infrastructure.
""We’re seeing a wave of renewed interest from institutional and sophisticated investors who view ETH as more than just a ‘second-place’ crypto,"" said David Siemer, co-founder and CEO of Wave Digital Assets. ""They see it as the backbone of DeFi, tokenization, and the largest smart contract ecosystem.""
""Given the backdrop of greater regulatory clarity out of the U.S. and the passing of the GENIUS Act, combined with ETH-focused digital asset treasuries such as Sharplink buying significant amounts of the token, and a resurgence in DeFi activity across ETH-focused protocols, it’s clear there is broader institutional interest in the ecosystem,"" he said.",b8c78873860380bfc5ee45a573111018,trafilatura,2649,0

Apartment giant Greystar and its affiliated companies have reached a proposed settlement with the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division to resolve antitrust claims related to Greystar’s use of RealPage’s revenue management software.
In its complaint against the Charleston, South Carolina-based operator, the DOJ alleged that Greystar and other landlords shared competitively sensitive data with Richardson, Texas-based RealPage’s revenue management program in order to align pricing, and also discussed sensitive information with each other directly.
“Competitors cannot share competitively sensitive information or align prices to the detriment of American consumers,” Assistant Attorney General Abigail Slater said in the release.
Greystar is the No. 1 apartment owner and manager in the country, with over 120,000 units owned and almost 950,000 under management, according to the 2025 National Multifamily Housing Council Top 50 lists. It is also the leading apartment developer, with 8,247 units started in 2024, and the No. 2 apartment builder, with 6,640 construction starts.
If approved the settlement would require Greystar to:
-
Refrain from using any program that generates rent price recommendations using nonpublic and/or sensitive data from competitors or that incorporates certain anticompetitive features.
-
Refrain from sharing sensitive information with competitors.
-
Accept a court-appointed monitor for any use of uncertified third-party pricing algorithms.
-
Not attend meetings of competing landlords hosted by RealPage, or else report all details of the meeting to United States authorities.
-
Cooperate with the United States’ monopolization claims against RealPage.
These restrictions will take effect on April 1, 2026, or 180 days after the entry of the final judgment, whichever is earlier.
Greystar, in its own announcement, stated its belief that the company’s use of RealPage’s revenue management software is in compliance with all applicable laws. The company intends for this settlement to provide the multifamily industry with guidance around the government’s interpretation of the law regarding the technology.
“The industry continues to face litigation and unclear regulatory guidance around the use of revenue management tools,” the statement reads. “The settlements provide clarity for Greystar and the industry at large. They acknowledge the shifting regulatory landscape while reinforcing our ability to deliver bespoke advice and leverage technology.”",51cd5a8cc58b8c05467687665ff1b8c6,trafilatura,2644,0

Lucid is upgrading its cars to boost sales and bagged a big robotaxi deal.
-
The EV maker also wants to make its stock more attractive with one move.
Investors in Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) had a lot to chew on in July, including a massive robotaxi deal that stunned the markets. Lucid stock rallied 16.6% during the month, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, even surging 48% at one point in trading.
Shares, however, seem to be under pressure and have lost around 7% of their value in August so far, as of this writing. Was Lucid's July rally then a dead cat bounce, or is this an opportunity to buy a promising yet beaten-down electric vehicle (EV) stock?
Investor interest in Lucid stock is rising
Lucid sells Air sedans and Gravity SUVs. From July 31, the EV maker equipped all its Air sedans, regardless of model and year of make, with adapters that can work on Tesla's supercharger network. Gravity SUVs already had access to Tesla's superchargers.
Meanwhile, denser battery cells have boosted the EPA range estimate for Lucid's 2026 Air Touring model by over 6%, to 431 miles.
Lucid expects high EPA ratings, access to Tesla's extensive public charging network, and other recent enhancements such as advanced driver assistance systems to make its EVs more appealing in an intensely competitive market. In a bid to add to its brand appeal, Lucid also hired actor Timothée Chalamet as its first-ever global brand ambassador in July.
Lucid's robotaxi partnership with Uber Technologies (NYSE: UBER), however, sent the stock into a tizzy. Uber will buy over 20,000 Lucid Gravity SUVs equipped with Nuro's Level 4 autonomy software and deploy them over six years, with an expected launch in late 2026. As part of the deal, Uber also plans to invest millions of dollars in Lucid.
Lucid stock could jump 10x if this happens
In July, Lucid proposed a 1-for-10 reverse stock split. A reverse stock split, if it happens, will 10x Lucid's stock price.
There are no real benefits for investors, though, as their investment value in Lucid shares, as well as the company's market capitalization, will remain unchanged. However, a reverse stock split can benefit Lucid in two ways: prevent delisting from the Nasdaq stock exchange, and make its stock more attractive to institutional investors who typically avoid penny stocks.
Lucid needs real catalysts to maintain stock momentum, though. While the Uber partnership will infuse millions in cash and marks Lucid's foray into the autonomous vehicles market, which is expected to hit trillions of dollars by 2030, Lucid's production woes are far from over yet.",9d79fa7e44896aa7274b746d963b79e9,trafilatura,2641,0

A recent episode of “The Ramsey Show” featured a call from Ava in Charleston, South Carolina, who is facing a financial crisis she says stems from her husband’s day trading.
‘Worst Magic Trick Ever’
Ava told financial personality Dave Ramsey and co-host George Kamel that her husband refinanced his house before they got married, pulling out $200,000. Kamel asked, “So, he mortgaged the house in order to gamble?” Ava replied, “Yes.”
She explained that they now have a $4,000 monthly mortgage on a 15-year term and that her husband continues to trade, believing he can win it back. Ramsey pushed back, saying that day trading has a 97% failure rate and that “there’s no Ramsey technique for continuing to lose $200K regularly and turning that into a wealth plan. He turned $200,000 into zero.” Kamel followed with, “Worst magic trick ever.”

Ava said she has recently stopped working as a cardiac nurse to care for their second baby and does not fully understand how bills are being paid. “We have less coming in than what’s going out,” she admitted. When Ramsey asked about their income, Ava couldn't give a clear figure, highlighting that she has little to no visibility into their household finances.
The couple is also in the process of selling their current house and buying another. Ramsey firmly told her, “No, you’re not. You’re broke. Your husband doesn’t have an income.”
Ramsey and Kamel compared her husband’s day trading to a dangerous addiction. “There’s only one way your family survives; if this man stops doing this,” Ramsey said.
He urged Ava to take control of the finances and have an immediate, honest conversation: “Honey, we’re not buying a new house. We’re broke. I’m scared. What you’re doing is terrifying me. I have a new baby and we have got to have a different system where I understand what’s going on with all the money and you have stopped day trading.”
Ramsey warned that without immediate action, Ava risks foreclosure and the collapse of her financial security. “You're going to call me up as a single mom in eight months,” he said, predicting repossessions and the loss of both houses if the situation continues.
“He's got to care more about his family than his gambling addiction,” Kamel concluded.",67b8558ce8e1e5d6dc217642e1ab64b2,trafilatura,2639,0

The July US CPI report of +0.2% m/m was roughly in line with market expectations.

Despite the neutral CPI report, the 10-year T-note yield rose +0.4 bp to 4.289% on concern about a new attack by President Trump on Fed Chair Powell. Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post Tuesday morning that he is considering allowing a lawsuit against Mr. Powell related to construction work at Fed buildings. The markets are concerned about the inflation risks involved with the attempt by the Trump administration to push Mr. Powell out of the Fed as a means to artificially push interest rates lower.
In recent tariff news, President Trump extended the tariff truce with China, which was to expire on Tuesday, for another 90 days. Last Wednesday, President Trump announced that he will impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. Still, companies would be eligible for exemptions if they demonstrate a commitment to building their products in the US. However, the US will levy a separate tax on imports of electronic products that employ semiconductors. Also, President Trump announced last Wednesday that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil. Last Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced ""within the next week or so."" According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.",2715984b120dd1080ee7b54a02241990,trafilatura,2632,0

Peter Thiel-Backed Bullish Is About to IPO. Should You Buy BLSH Stock?
Focusing more closely, Best Buy stock has underperformed the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLY) 29.3% return over the past 52 weeks.
Despite posting a better-than-expected Q1 2026 adjusted EPS of $1.15, Best Buy shares tumbled 7.3% on May 29 due to a significant cut in its full-year comparable sales and adjusted EPS guidance to $6.15 - $6.30. Investor sentiment was further dampened by concerns over rising U.S. tariffs, which could increase costs on imported goods, roughly 30% - 35% of Best Buy's inventory, pressuring margins and consumer demand for high-ticket items.
For the fiscal year ending in January 2026, analysts expect BBY’s adjusted EPS to decline 2.4% year-over-year to $6.22. The company's earnings surprise history is mixed. It beat the consensus estimates in three of the last four quarters while missing on another occasion.
Among the 22 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on eight “Strong Buy” ratings, 13 “Holds,” and one “Moderate Sell.”
This configuration is slightly less bullish than three months ago, with nine “Strong Buy” ratings on the stock.
On May 30, DA Davidson lowered its price target on Best Buy to $90 while maintaining a “Buy” rating.
As of writing, the stock is trading below the mean price target of $78.42. The Street-high price target of $95 implies a potential upside of 33.5% from the current price levels.

According to the Indian spirits major, its board has approved a capital investment of Rs250m ($2.9m) to expand the distillery. Including license fees an interest payments, the total expense amounts to Rs590m.
Tilaknagar currently bottles Mansion House Brandy and Mansion House Flavoured Brandy at the site, the business told Just Drinks.
The planned expansion will increase Prag’s existing bottling capacity from 600,000 cases to 3.6m cases per year, the business said in a statement alongside an announcement on its first quarter results for its fiscal 2026.
The project is expected to be completed in 12 months, the Blue Lagoon Gin maker told this publication.
Chairman and managing director of Tilaknagar Industries, Amit Dahanukar added in the statement: “The upcoming expansion marks a significant step in our journey to strengthen our manufacturing capabilities and meet the growing demand of our globally acclaimed brands such as Mansion House Brandy and Courrier Napoleon Brandy in the state.”
The company also told Just Drinks that, due to the increased capacity and its other growth plans for Andhra Pradesh, it will bottle more brands at the unit. ""In essence, Prag will act as our backbone for bottling in the state,"" it said.
When asked how the distillery would be expanded, Tilaknagar said the upcoming project ""will involve a mix of new installations for augmenting capacity as well as adding space for warehousing. All possible technology interventions will be considered during the expansion.""
The investment was announced alongside Tilaknagar's first quarter results for the period ended 30 June, in which it reported net revenue of Rs4m, up 30.6% on the year prior. Adjusted for subsidy income, this figure rose 20.5%.
Profit after tax excluding exceptional items was up 120.8% at Rs8.9m, adjusted for subsidy, this figure was up 44.5%.
EBITDA also increased 88% to Rs945m. Adjusted for subsidy income, this income measure grew 25% year on year to Rs55.8m.
Tilaknagar told Just Drinks it expected the expansion ""to generate significant value to our growth going ahead. Not only in terms of positive financial impact but also to safeguard supply in one of the fastest growing Indian-made foreign liquor markets in India.""
The company added that it expects to generate a “good amount of job opportunities at the unit"" following the construction.

SINGAPORE/HOUSTON/LONDON (Reuters) -Premiums for prompt benchmark oil prices globally are falling compared with those in future months on rising output from the Middle East, Latin America and Europe, just as peak summer demand ends, traders and analysts said on Thursday.
Easing concerns that the U.S. could impose more sanctions on Russia and further disrupt oil supplies are also weighing on oil prices, they said.
The six-month time spreads for Brent futures (BZ=F), U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures (CL=F) and Middle East marker Dubai have narrowed by more than $1 a barrel in backwardation since the start of the month.
Backwardation refers to a market structure where prompt prices are higher than those in future months, indicating tight supply. A narrowing of the structure indicates a market view that supplies are expected to rise.
""Brent and Dubai time spreads are softening mainly on expectations of incremental OPEC+ supply from September and easing fears of Russian disruption after recent steady flows via both Baltic and Black Sea,"" said Shohruh Zukhritdinov, a Dubai-based oil trader.
""U.S. crude supply remains stable, but refinery runs will gradually decline into the shoulder season, easing prompt tightness,"" he said.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet in Alaska on Friday to strike a ceasefire deal in Ukraine.
Citi analysts said Brent could land in the low-$60s per barrel area, if there is progress towards a U.S.-Russia deal.
Rising supply, End of summer
Traders are bracing for more supplies after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, known as OPEC+, agreed to increase September output, just as non-OPEC producers such as Guyana, Brazil and Norway launched new production.
Peak oil demand during the Northern Hemisphere summer is also ending, cooling red-hot diesel margins in Europe and reducing the burning of crude for power in Saudi Arabia, the sources said.
""We saw a lot of selling in the window, with expectation around crude demand revised down as refinery margins weaken as gasoil/diesel cracks unravel,"" said Harry Tchilinguirian, group head of research at Onyx Capital Group, referring to physical trade in the North Sea market.
""Now that seasonal demand is going to unwind, and we cannot be sure that China will keep up elevated imports (for stockpiling), so where does the extra Saudi barrels go?""
Meanwhile, spot premiums for Middle East benchmarks Dubai and Oman hovered at their lowest in more than a month for October-loading supply. [CRU/M]",25e7483d329629ec5ad0a6a0ee25d302,trafilatura,2618,0

Dive Brief:
-
Dollar General is partnering with Uber Eats to offer the delivery service to its customers through 14,000 Dollar General and Popshelf stores, according to a company news release.
-
The partnership kicked off Friday and is expanding throughout the month. Customers can use the Uber Eats app to order food, beverages and other essentials like personal care products, over-the-counter medications, paper products, cleaning supplies, lawn and garden, back-to-school supplies and more, per the company.
-
Through Sept. 30, Uber Eats is offering a one-time promotional discount of 40% off on Dollar General and Popshelf orders of $20 or more with a maximum discount of $10. Uber One members get free delivery on eligible orders and other savings.
Dive Insight:
Dollar General’s partnership with Uber Eats builds out the retailer’s delivery network.
The retailer earlier this year partnered with DoorDash for similar services through 16,000 of its store locations. Dollar General also started a pilot program to offer same-day home delivery in 400 of its stores with a goal of expanding to 10,000 stores by the end of this year.
“Our customers will enjoy even greater convenience through our Uber Eats partnership, accessing everything from food to essential household items, saving them valuable time and money,” Tony Rogers, Dollar General’s chief marketing officer, said in a statement. “Providing communities with affordable, fresh, and accessible food options delivered right to their front door is aligned with our mission of Serving Others.”
While thought by the retailer to be an efficient way to maximize preferences and expand a customer base, the delivery service initiatives may also be reflective of its competition.
“Amazon is expanding its fast delivery services into more rural areas, which is where Dollar General has a heavy presence,” Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in an email. “Rather than be undermined by this, Dollar General wants to push its own delivery options — which it is doing by partnering with third parties. The service will never be as comprehensive or as well-executed as Amazon, but it’s better than doing nothing.”
Dollar General has been rolling out a number of operational changes, including cutting 1,000 SKUs last year with plans to eliminate even more this year, according to the retailer’s CEO Todd Vasos. The company has also been working to build out its footprint, opening its 20,000th store last year.",8b80cf0655e830e2c139d0f645aed72d,trafilatura,2618,0

The company plans to pay off some of its debt and preferred stock using money it expects to get back from its pension plan. The company is hoping to change the terms, push out due dates or refinance its remaining debt and preferred stock obligations, which are payments promised to holders of special shares that usually get paid before regular shareholders.
Kodak Lands $765M Us Loan Under Defense Production Act To Boost Drug Production
Still, since these plans depend on things outside Kodak’s control, they aren't considered reliable under U.S. accounting rules. Because of this, there's serious concern about whether the company can stay in business, as of the date it released its second-quarter financial results, according to the filing.
A Kodak spokesperson told FOX Business that the ""going concern"" language in the filing was a ""required disclosure because Kodak’s debt comes due within 12 months of the filing"" and that the company is confident it will pay off a significant portion of its term loan well before its due. It is also confident that it will amend, extend or refinance its remaining debt and/or preferred stock obligations, the spokesperson added.
To fund the repayment, the company said it plans to draw on the approximately $300 million in cash it expects to receive from the reversion and settlement of its U.S. pension fund, known as the Kodak Retirement Income Plan, or ""KRIP,"" in December. But given that the reversion is not solely within Kodak’s control, it is not deemed ""probable"" under U.S. GAAP accounting rules, which is what triggered the ""going concern"" language.
""Once the KRIP reversion is completed Kodak will be virtually net debt free and will have a stronger balance sheet than we have had in years,"" the spokesperson said.
Kodak pioneered film photography and dominated the market for much of the 20th century. It became a household name, known for products like disposable cameras, and at its peak, controlled over 80% of the U.S. film market.
Kodak invented the first digital camera in 1975, but failed to embrace the technology, fearing it would cannibalize its film business.

While it eventually tried to jump into the digital photography game, it struggled to keep up with emerging competitors like Canon, Sony and Nikon, all of which embraced it early on.",446c038c7e350959f4c47d1b00d1a949,trafilatura,2608,0

The chief market strategist at Jefferies told CNBC that central bankers shouldn't be daunted by the July producer price index showing pipeline inflation pressures hotter than expected.
Instead, he advocated the Fed move aggressively now to ease as a way to forestall a labor market slowdown and in fact help create a million more jobs. For the past three Fed meetings, Zervos has advocated a half percentage point cut in the federal funds rate, and he repeated that position during an interview.
""I'm still absolutely there. I think there is a reasonable storyline, a very cogent storyline, that suggests monetary policy is restrictive,"" he said. ""Generally speaking, I don't see any reason why this [PPI] number changes that view.""
A process that had included just three or four names to succeed Fed Chair Jerome Powell when his term expires next year has expanded in recent days to nearly a dozen.
Zervos joins a list that includes current and past Fed officials, at least one Trump administration advisor and multiple other noted Wall Street economists. Of the group, Zervos and BlackRock bond strategist Rick Rieder are the only ones whose background is more concentrated on markets than economics.
""I think it would be an incredible benefit to have more market-savvy, more market-competent people involved in the monetary policy decision,"" Zervos said.
Earlier in the day, economist Marc Sumerlin, also on the list of finalists, backed a half-point cut as well and said the Fed has been too conservative in fighting the inflation battle.
President Donald Trump has pushed hard for the Fed to cut, lashing out repeatedly at Powell and suggesting that the Federal Open Market Committee should slash as much as 3 percentage points, or 300 basis points, off the funds rate, which is currently around 4.33%.
""I don't know that I could get all the way to 300, but I certainly could get to 200 and I could be convinced on lower than that if you really push the AI story and the technology story and the idea that we have disinflationary pressures building from a supply-side narrative,"" Zervos said.
Zervos added that he is not deterred by the types of criticism Trump has leveled at the Fed.
""You go into that job fully understanding that you're involved in the political process,"" he said. ""The goal is to have the debate be driven by facts and be driven by what is best for achieving the mandates that Congress sets out.""",ee5a089f6f4fa6b3ea75c57828f396c1,trafilatura,2607,0

Russia said on Wednesday that it had started restricting some WhatsApp, owned by Meta Platforms, and Telegram calls, accusing the foreign-owned platforms of failing to share information with law enforcement in fraud and terrorism cases.
Text messaging services and voice notes are currently unaffected.
A simmering dispute with foreign tech providers intensified after Moscow's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, with Russia blocking Meta's Facebook and Instagram, slowing the speed of Alphabet's YouTube and issuing hundreds of fines to platforms that failed to comply with Russian rules on online content and data storage.
""WhatsApp is private, end-to-end encrypted, and defies government attempts to violate people's right to secure communication, which is why Russia is trying to block it from over 100 million Russian people,"" WhatsApp said late on Wednesday, vowing to continue trying to keep encrypted services available in Russia.
Telegram said it actively combats the harmful use of its platform, including calls for sabotage or violence and fraud, and that moderators use AI tools to remove millions of malicious messages every day.
In July 2025, WhatsApp's monthly reach in Russia was 97.3 million people, compared to 90.8 million for Telegram, according to Mediascope data. Third-placed VK Messenger, an offering from state-controlled tech company VK, reached 17.9 million people.
Russia has a population of more than 140 million people.
Online monitoring services Downdetector and Sboy reported surges in internet users complaining about poor WhatsApp functionality. In Krasnodar, a region in southern Russia, local media also reported a drop off in mobile connectivity.
A public Telegram group of Krasnodar taxi drivers was inundated on Thursday with complaints about poor mobile connectivity, with many drivers unable to use online maps to navigate around.
""What should I do, there's no map,"" a driver named Sergei asked the 3,700 others in the forum.
""Download offline maps,"" Alexei, another driver, suggested. ""For the future.""

This brought the total number of rental homes to around 10,600, with a high occupancy rate of 94.4% in Q2.

Overall rental and related charges for the second quarter came in at $55.9 million, up 8.5% from $51.5 million the year before.

Since UMH invested $66.6 million in these communities, their value has gone up by about $96.9 million, or 146%, which shows the properties have appreciated a lot.
The company also sold around 1.8 million shares of common stock through its At-the-Market program. These shares sold at an average price of $17.60, raising about $31.0 million in total.
President and CEO of UMH Properties, Samuel A. Landy, commented:
“Our communities continue to experience strong demand which we are converting into occupied sites through our rental home and sales programs. We are proud to announce that our second quarter sales set a new quarterly sales record.”
UMH Properties, Inc. (NYSE:UMH) is a real estate investment trust that was founded in 1968. It owns and operates manufactured home communities across 12 states, with around 26,000+ homesites, including rental homes and self-storage units.
While we acknowledge the potential of UMH as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Peter Thiel-Backed Bullish Is About to IPO. Should You Buy BLSH Stock?
Narrowing the focus, SHW has outperformed the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLB) 2.2% rise over the past 52 weeks and its 8.1% rally this year.
On Jul. 22, Sherwin-Williams shares dipped marginally after releasing its second-quarter earnings. It posted sales growth of 0.7% to $6.31 billion, but profits fell sharply, with adjusted EPS down 8.6% to $3.38, missing estimates. The quarter also saw $59 million in restructuring charges and $40 million in building-related costs, prompting the company to lower its full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $11.20–$11.50 and forecast flat to low-single-digit sales change.
For the current year ending in December, analysts predict SHW’s EPS to fall marginally year over year to $11.28. Moreover, the company has surpassed analysts’ consensus estimates in two of the past four quarters, while missing on two occasions.
Among the 28 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on 15 “Strong Buy” ratings, two “Moderate Buys,” ten “Holds,” and one “Moderate Sell.”
The configuration is slightly less bullish than three months ago, when 14 analysts gave the stock a “Strong Buy.”
On Jul. 24, UBS Group AG (UBS) analyst Joshua Spector maintained a “Buy” rating on Sherwin-Williams but reduced the price target from $410 to $395.
SHW’s mean price target of $379.69 indicates a premium of 2.9% from the current market prices. Its Street-high target of $420 suggests a robust 13.9% upside potential from current price levels.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -An index of global equity markets rose to a record high for the second straight session on Wednesday, partly underpinned by bullish sentiment on Wall Street as investors positioned for a likely interest rate cut from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The MSCI All Country World Index rose as high as 954.21, breaking another record a day after reaching a new peak. It was last up 0.60% at 952.83.
The benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite Index scored record highs for the second straight session, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished stronger. Among the S&P 500's 11 sectors, materials, healthcare and consumer discretionary stocks led gains while communication services, consumer staples and technology shares lost ground.
The Dow gained 1%, the S&P 500 rose 0.32% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.14%.
European stocks advanced 0.54%, almost reaching two-week highs, while Japan's Nikkei rose for the sixth straight day, breaking the 43,000 level for the first time and hitting a fresh high. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.54%.
""It's largely just a continuation from what we saw yesterday, with inflation obviously being the driver of the rally,"" said Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions in Boston.
U.S. inflation readings, which on Tuesday showed the consumer price index rising slightly less than forecast in the year through July, indicated President Donald Trump's import tariffs had yet to filter down to consumer prices.
That helped Wall Street scale new heights, supported by the increasing likelihood that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month.
""It's hard to really glean any sort of trends from that report other than maybe just some noise. I think on the whole, it's better than feared and that was enough to kind of spur expectations that the Fed has kind of the green light to go in September,"" Melson added.
Traders are pricing in a nearly 94% chance of a Fed cut in September, up from about 57% a month ago, according to the CME FedWatch tool.
Also boosting market optimism was Trump's signing of an executive order pausing triple-digit levies on Chinese imports for another 90 days.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he thought an aggressive half-point cut was possible given recent Bureau of Labor Statistics revisions showing job growth had slowed to a crawl in May, June and July, though initial estimates had shown stronger employment growth that Fed officials used to argue that the labor market remained in good shape.",c46aac5a3b77ed836102ac6e3ebc50b9,trafilatura,2584,0

Focusing more closely, the industrial tools maker stock has also lagged behind the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLI) 20.7% return over the past 52 weeks.
Shares of AMETEK jumped 4.6% on Jul. 31 after the company posted stronger-than-expected Q2 2025 results, with adjusted EPS of $1.78 and revenue of $1.8 billion. Growth was driven by a 6% year-over-year sales increase in the Electromechanical Group (EMG) to $618.5 million, supported by strong organic demand, record operating income, robust margin expansion, and contributions from the recent FARO Technologies acquisition. The company also raised its 2025 adjusted EPS forecast to $7.06 - $7.20 and now expects annual sales growth in the mid-single digits versus its prior low-single-digit outlook.
For the fiscal year ending in December 2025, analysts expect AMETEK’s adjusted EPS to grow 4.5% year-over-year to $7.14. The company's earnings surprise history is promising. It topped the consensus estimates in the last four quarters.
Among the 17 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on 11 “Strong Buy” ratings, one “Moderate Buy,” four “Holds,” and one “Strong Sell.”
On Aug. 1, Mizuho raised Ametek’s price target to $225 and maintained an “Outperform” rating.

Dive Brief:
-
Ford Motor Co. has recalled 312,000 pickup and SUV models for a loss of electronic power brake assist that can extend stopping distances and increase the risk of a crash, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
-
The recalled vehicles include the 2025 F-150, Ranger, Expedition, Bronco and Lincoln Navigator models built between November 2023 and June 2025. An estimated 1% of the recalled vehicles are suspected of having the defect.
-
Ford is issuing an over-the-air software update to address the problem, but customers will have the option to schedule a service appointment at a dealer to have it performed, free of charge. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed on Aug. 25.
Dive Insight:
Ford discovered the problem on May 14 after its Expedition/Navigator Rapid Response Team identified a vehicle that exhibited a loss of power brake assist and stored a diagnostic trouble code (DTC). The incident occurred on a management lease program vehicle, which offers lease deals to Ford employees.
From May through June, Ford used its connected vehicle database to identify other models with the stored DTC believed to be related to the brake issue. Investigators also reviewed vehicle data logs and met with drivers that experienced a sudden loss of power brake assist, excessive pedal travel or longer stopping distances in order to determine the scope of the problem.
Ford investigators concluded that the electronic brake booster (EBB) module may malfunction while driving or when the driver is using an advanced driver assist system feature. The majority of the recalled vehicles (218,000) are F-150 models.
An EBB replaces a vehicle’s traditional vacuum-operated brake booster with an electric motor to provide braking assist. These systems offer more precise stopping control and are also used in electric vehicles without a vacuum source.
According to the recall report, the EBB module is susceptible to changes in voltage that can lead to a momentary current spike exceeding the unit’s over-current monitoring threshold. The problem leads to the EBB motor shutting down and a loss of power brake assist. The units were sourced from Tier 1 supplier Bosch.
As of July 11, 2025, Ford is aware of 37 warranty claims related to a loss of brake assist received between March 13 and June 26, including one alleged low-speed crash. However, the automaker is not aware of any injuries.",c281350403c5adff4e9e885fe164af7c,trafilatura,2584,0

That’s the demand of an emergency proposal on the Stargate governance forum. It’s asking the crypto collective to stop negotiations over the sale of the crypto bridge until it has solicited counter offers and established new processes to ensure neutrality.
It comes after the LayerZero Foundation, a nonprofit that supports the LayerZero cross-chain messaging protocol, offered to buy the Stargate protocol on August 10 for around $138 million. The unsolicited bid would dissolve the DAO and convert Stargate’s STG token to LayerZero’s ZRO token.
In an emergency proposal on Tuesday, Stargatefan, a pseudonymous Stargate governance participant, said that the DAO should appoint a representative for the potential sale of the protocol that has no connection to either the Stargate Team or LayerZero to ensure fairness.
The proposal also recommends the DAO retain an independent investment bank and legal counsel, as well as solicit counter bids from Binance, Solana, Circle, Tether, and 10 largest crypto venture capital funds, and other bridging providers to ensure LayerZero’s acquisition offer is competitive.
“None of the above should be objectionable to LayerZero or the Stargate team,” Stargatefan said in the proposal. “This process will ensure the community does not feel cheated and can join the LayerZero community knowing the result was fair and no better bids existed.”
Governance participants in decentralised autonomous organisations, or DAOs, often choose to remain pseudonymous to avoid bias and prevent bribes and governance attacks.
Stargatefan isn’t the only one to suggest soliciting other bids.
Exahash, a pseudonymous governance participant, also suggested Stargate DAO reach out to US crypto exchange Coinbase, fintech app Robinhood and stablecoin issuer Circle for bids.
The LayerZero Foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Conflict of interest
The pushback comes as the relationship between Stargate and LayerZero raises concerns over a potential conflict of interest.
Both projects were founded by the same firm, LayerZero Labs. Additionally, many members of the LayerZero Foundation and LayerZero Labs own significant amounts of Stargate’s STG token.
“One team. One focus. Millions in fundraising and token allocations. One massive self-dealing conflict of interest,” Robo, a pseudonymous Stargate governance participant, said in response to the acquisition proposal.
In response, the LayerZero Foundation said it has expressly forbidden Foundation and Labs’ members from voting on the Stargate acquisition proposal.",e49a0f39d8e1c79b1fae9a21fe582d92,trafilatura,2583,0

(NYSE:TPR) stock tumbled in premarket trading Thursday despite topping Wall Street forecasts for the fourth quarter, fueled by double-digit revenue growth at its flagship Coach brand.
The parent of Coach and Kate Spade posted adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share, ahead of the $1.02 consensus, on revenue of $1.72 billion, up 8% year-over-year and above expectations.
Coach saw strong handbag revenue growth, driven by a mid-teens AUR gain for the quarter and a low-double-digit gain for the year. This reflects compelling innovation and broad-based traction across its leather goods offerings.

Tapestry’s overall revenue growth was led by a 14% (+13% constant currency) gain at the Coach Brand with $1.425 billion in revenues. Kate Spade revenues fell 13% to $252.6 million.
Gross profit rose to $1.32 billion from $1.19 billion a year ago. Gross margin increased to 76.3% from 74.9%, driven by about 200 basis points of operational improvements, partly offset by a currency headwind of over 50 basis points.
Cash, equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $1.12 billion, while total borrowings stood at $2.39 billion. This resulted in net debt of $1.27 billion.
Inventory was $861 million, as expected, which excluded $92 million of Stuart Weitzman inventory classified as Assets held for sale.
Dividend
The firm approved a 14% increase to the company’s dividend, with a quarterly cash dividend of 40 cents per common share payable on September 22 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 5.
“We achieved bold targets we set three years ago in a dynamic landscape, delivering over $5 in adjusted earnings per share and returning more than $3 billion cumulatively to shareholders,” said CEO Joanne Crevoiserat.
Outlook
For fiscal 2026, Tapestry expects revenue to approach $7.2 billion compared to the $6.96 billion estimate, reflecting low-single-digit growth from last year.
Excluding the planned divestiture of Stuart Weitzman, pro-forma sales are projected to rise at a mid-single-digit pace on both a nominal and constant-currency basis, with foreign exchange providing an 80-basis-point boost.
Operating margin is forecast to improve by more than 250 basis points, though this will be largely offset by an estimated 230-basis-point drag from incremental tariffs and duties, a $160 million impact tied to policy changes, sell-through timing, and mitigation efforts. The company aims to fully offset these costs over time.",852cf6eff1bbe3ffd8973930e6e2da91,trafilatura,2577,0

Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev enforces a different RTO policy depending on employees' rank.

Executives come in five times a week, and individual contributers come in three times.
-
""You have to be willing to do yourself, to an even higher degree, what you ask of everyone else,"" Tenev said.
It always helps knowing someone else has it worse.
Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said the company's principle is that change has to start at the top, which also applies to its return-to-office policy.
""If you're a senior leader, an executive, you're five days; if you're a manager, four days; if you're an IC, three days,"" Tenev said in an episode of the ""Cheeky Pint"" podcast published on Wednesday. ""It's good because if you're an individual contributor and you're doing work, it's very nice to know that your manager is going through more pain than you.""
Tenev, who cofounded the stock trading platform in 2013, said this lead-by-example approach has been helpful for motivating employees.
""It has to start at the top,"" he said. ""You have to be willing to do yourself, to an even higher degree, what you ask of everyone else.""
In 2022, Robinhood declared itself a remote-first company and said it would be ""staying primarily remote."" Tenev said he regretted his 2022 decision to be remote ""pretty much immediately,"" and a year later, the company told staff to expect to return to the office at least four days a week on average.
In a 2024 interview, Tenev said that coming out strongly for being remote-first made it ""much, much harder"" to reverse the decision.
On Wednesday's podcast, the CEO said he learned that you can reverse your decisions if they are the wrong calls.
""I think there's a natural sort of reluctance to not feel like a flip-flopper,"" he said.
""In our case, we emphasize the in-person experience. We found that makes a big difference,"" he added of the company's culture.
Robinhood is part of a wider push among tech and finance companies to bring people back into offices despite the pushback RTO mandates often receive.
In the last two years, tech giants like Meta, Google, Amazon, and TikTok have cracked down on a US tech culture known for pandemic-era remote work, unlimited office benefits, top-line pay, and job security.
Across the industry, perks like free massages have been replaced with memos from CEOs filled with words such as ""efficiency"" and ""scrappiness and frugality.""

The U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase has one. The online brokerage Robinhood announced its plans to launch its own blockchain in June, and its competitor eToro is considering its own. And now, the fintech giant Stripe and the stablecoin issuer Circle are getting in on the action.
Stripe is developing what it calls Tempo, a payments-focused blockchain, according to a since-deleted job posting and sources familiar with the matter. And Circle said Tuesday morning that it’s building what it calls Arc, a blockchain designed for stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar.
There’s suddenly a flood of corporate chains, which prompts the question: Why is seemingly every big finance company—especially Stripe and Circle—becoming a blockchain developer?
‘Own the full stack’
The answer for Stripe is simple, according to two stablecoin executives and one investor: vertical integration.
Through its $1.1 billion acquisition of the stablecoin startup Bridge, Stripe bought its own stablecoin and payments network. And after its June acquisition of the crypto wallet company Privy, it can give users accounts to store stablecoins. For, Stripe—which has made its name off of more traditional payment offerings like online checkout—adding a blockchain would amount to the creation of a full-blown stablecoin ecosystem.
“There’s an incentive for these large companies to own the full stack,” Rob Hadick, general partner at the crypto venture firm Dragonfly who regularly invests in stablecoin startups, told Fortune.
Stripe is making a big bet that stablecoins may be the future of payments. If much of its $1.4 trillion volume passes through stablecoins, it’s missing out on potentially millions in revenue.
Blockchains, or decentralized networks like Ethereum or Solana, are akin to the Google Cloud or AWS of the crypto tech stack. A decentralized fleet of servers process many of the transactions on a crypto app, and in return for lending their computing power, the owners of these servers receive fees.
Coinbase’s own blockchain, Base, for example, has generated more than $130 million in fees since it launched in early 2023, according to data from DefiLlama.
“You want to control the economics,” Luca Prosperi, cofounder and CEO of stablecoin infrastructure company M0, told Fortune.
It remains to be seen, however, whether the multiplication of stablecoins and associated blockchains will result in countless coins and chains that normal consumers would have trouble navigating.",1616850fe5b43e8704d2672dfcb57f9f,trafilatura,2567,0

Shares of the country's largest standalone winemaker jumped over 5% in early trade to A$8.06, its highest level in more than two weeks. It was among the top gainers in the ASX 200 benchmark index, which traded down 0.7% at 0150 GMT.
Treasury Wine reported full-year 2025 underlying net profit after tax of A$470.6 million ($307.2 million), higher than the A$407.5 million reported last year, though it missed Visible Alpha's estimate of A$472.1 million by a whisker.
Operating earnings for its flagship Penfolds brand rose 13% for the year, fuelled by strong demand in China for the iconic label following the easing of steep import tariffs that had kept it off shelves for more than three years.
However, the winemaker flagged a shift in alcohol consumption behaviour in China as large-scale banqueting gives way to smaller-scale occasions, resulting in slower depletion of its Penfolds stock in the key market.
On a call with analysts and media, Treasury's managing director of the Penfolds division, Tom King, said a tightening in alcohol policies for government activities in recent months was impacting the market, although it was too early to assess the extent.
""Those occasions are important to us but it's very hard for us to quantify the extent,"" he said.
""China is a very dynamic market and things can change very quickly. We've got levers that we can pull.""
Citi analysts said in a research note that the company's China commentary had ""led us to become more cautious on Neutral-rated Treasury’s ability to deliver its Penfolds guidance in FY26 and FY27"".
The company's ""incrementally more cautious tone on this region could lead to some of the China bulls on the stock to moderate their growth expectations,"" Citi added.
Treasury Wine forecasts Penfolds operating earnings to grow by low to mid double-digit in fiscal 2026 and is targeting 15% growth in 2027.
Treasury Wine also announced an on-market share buy-back of up to A$200 million this fiscal year.
Annual sales revenue climbed more than 7% to A$2.94 billion. It announced a final dividend of 20 Australian cents per share, higher than the 19 Australian cents apiece it paid last year.

US shale companies are reducing their drilling and production plans due to low crude oil prices. The number of active US oil rigs recently fell to a 3.75-year low of 410 rigs.
Crude has support after President Trump recently said that he would impose new tariffs on countries buying Russian energy unless Russia reaches a ceasefire with Ukraine. Last Wednesday, President Trump doubled tariffs on Indian exports to 50% from 25% because of India's purchases of Russian crude. JPMorgan Chase warned that if enforced, oil markets would be unable to ignore the impact of triple-digit tariffs on Russian oil, given the significant scale of Russian exports and limited OPEC spare capacity, which could potentially lead to a supply shock.
Concerns about a global oil supply glut are weighing on crude prices after OPEC+ on August 2 endorsed an additional 547,000 bpd increase in its crude production for September 1. OPEC+ is boosting output to reverse the 2-year-long production cut, gradually restoring a total of 2.2 million bpd of production by September 2026. OPEC+ has 1.66 million bpd of supplies that are currently due to remain offline until late 2026. The International Energy Agency has said the global crude oil market faces a surplus by Q4-2025 equivalent to 1.5% of global crude consumption. OPEC July crude production fell -20,000 bpd to 28.31 million bpd.",11d8f6c53da72fa23807ead47edc8171,trafilatura,2562,0

Dive Brief:
-
After initiating a “formal evaluation of strategic alternatives” earlier this year, Elme Communities took the first step to liquidating the company by selling a 19-asset portfolio to Atlanta-based investor, developer and manager Cortland Partners for $1.6 billion in cash, according to a news release. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025.
-
In conjunction with the sale, the Bethesda, Maryland-based REIT’s board of trustees has approved a plan of sale and liquidation under which the company would market its remaining nine multifamily assets, as well as Watergate 600 — an office asset — with the goal of a sale in the next 12 months. The REIT’s shareholders still need to approve the plan.
-
Elme has received a debt commitment of $520 million from Goldman Sachs Bank USA to provide debt financing secured by the REIT’s assets not included in the Cortland sale. The availability of the loan is contingent upon closing on all 19 properties.
Dive Insight:
Over the past several years, Elme, formerly known as WashREIT until 2022, has expanded its presence outside the Washington, D.C., metro area by acquiring properties in Atlanta, an effort to diversify its portfolio. Still, its stock continued to trade at a discount to values in the private market, forcing the REIT to explore alternatives.
“Elme has made deliberate strategic decisions to advance and refine our portfolio with the goal of maximizing shareholder value,” said Paul McDermott, president and CEO of Elme, in the news release. “Following a thorough board-led process, and despite our successful transformation into a focused multifamily platform with strong operating capabilities, market conditions have not allowed us to lower our cost of capital in a way that supports accretive growth.”
During the review process, Elme’s board consulted with more than 80 counterparties before determining that property sales were the most effective approach.
“Our evaluation process was robust, underpinning the board’s unanimous determination that the combination of the sale of assets to Cortland and subsequent sale of the remaining assets is most likely to result in the greatest value for shareholders as compared to the company’s other strategic alternatives, including continuing to operate the business as an independent going concern,” Benjamin Butcher, lead independent trustee at Elme, said in the release.",ffc059cd31e2ba6b0320ecabcac5da3a,trafilatura,2562,0

The producer price index for final demand jumped 0.9% last month after being unchanged in June, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI rising 0.2%.
Services prices soared 1.1%, the largest gain since March 2022, amid strong increases in machinery and equipment wholesaling, costs of portfolio management, hotels and motels, and road transportation of freight. Good prices vaulted 0.7%, the biggest gain since in January. There were strong increases in the prices of vegetables, meat and eggs.
With the July report, the BLS ended the calculation and publication of approximately 350 indexes, including data from the PPI Final Demand-Intermediate Demand, special index, industry and commodity classifications.
The agency has suffered years of underfunding under both Republican and Democratic administrations, a situation worsened by an unprecedented campaign by President Donald Trump's White House to remake the federal government through deep spending cuts and mass layoffs of public workers.
The resource constraints have impacted the closely watched employment report and also resulted in the suspension of data collection for portions of the CPI basket in some areas across the country. This has raised concerns about the quality of the government-produced economic data, long viewed as the gold standard. The nomination of Heritage Foundation economist E.J. Antoni, a critic of the BLS, to head the statistics agency, is also adding another layer of worry over data quality.
In the 12 months through July, the PPI increased 3.3% after advancing 2.4% in June. The pass-through from Trump's sweeping tariffs has so far been limited, but the PPI report supported economists' expectations for the import duties to drive up inflation in the coming months.
The government on Tuesday reported a mild increase in consumer prices in July, though rising costs for services like dental care and airline tickets caused a measure of underlying inflation to post its largest gain in six months.
While financial markets have priced in an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month, rising services inflation and the expectation tariffs could still significantly boost goods prices left some economists doubtful of a resumption in policy easing in the absence of labor market deterioration.",5958b4bc7fc2b9ef0395ecd39764b9b8,trafilatura,2560,0

-
July reversed a decline in month-to-month retail spending, with sales rising 1.5%, according to the National Retail Federation.
-
The trade group and analysts from Bank of America said the number may be benefitting from temporary factors, such as back-to-school spending and Prime Day.
-
Investors will get fresh insight on Friday, when the federal government is slated to release its retail data.
Retail spending was solid in July, according to new data. But will it be enough to quell concerns about tariffs and inflation?
Retail sales, exclusive of car and gas spending, rose 1.5% from June to July, reversing a 0.3% decrease from May to June, the National Retail Federation said this week ahead of government retail data due Friday. Retail spending is a closely watched measure of consumer financial health; economists expect Friday's report to show July sales up 0.5% from June, according to a Wall Street Journal survey.
Sales for the month rose 5.9% year-over-year, but the trade group said it was difficult to determine what drove up spending. Retail sales were relatively weak in June, NRF said, while back-to-school spending and a longer Prime Day may have inflated July’s numbers, Bank of America said.
Executives at a range of companies have hinted at cautious consumers during the second-quarter earnings season. Wall Street analysts have suggested that shoppers have continued to spend, but sought opportunities to trade down to cheaper versions of desired items.
“It is possible some of the increase in spending was due to retailers passing through current or prospective tariff increases onto customers,” Bank of America wrote in an analysis of credit and debit card spending in July that pointed toward a smaller increase in the number of card transactions per household than in dollars spent.
Annual inflation in July was on par with the 2.7% rate reported in June, coming in just below what economists expected. Economists generally believe tariffs will lead to price increases, and potentially, spikes in inflation, though some think that companies have yet to pass along as much of the effect of tariffs to consumers as they may in the second half of the year.
Cautious consumer spending has come up on a number of retailers' recent conference calls, including the outdoor gear company Yeti Holdings (YETI), the athletic apparel brand Under Armour (UA) and burger chains Jack in the Box (JACK) and McDonald's (MCD). Lower-priced store-brand products have seen more take-up lately, some grocers and food companies have said.",4bc46a14cf242b87c13fcf56dbd58223,trafilatura,2560,0

At the IPO price, Bullish would have a market value of $5.4 billion based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Bullish on Monday had increased the number of shares it planned to offer to 30 million and raised the price range, a filing showed. The IPO was more than 20 times oversubscribed, people familiar with the matter have said.
BlackRock Inc. and ARK Investment Management were separately interested in buying as much as $200 million of shares in aggregate at the IPO price, according to the filing.
The company announced in 2021 that it planned to go public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, in a deal that would have valued the combined firm at about $9 billion. The merger was scrapped in 2022.
Bullish, which counts former New York Stock Exchange president Tom Farley as its chief executive officer, offers crypto spot trading, margin trading and derivatives trading, with a focus on institutional investors, the filing showed.
Bullish’s biggest investors include its co-founder, Block.one CEO Brendan Blumer, who is expected to own 30.1% of the shares following the offering. Bullish board member Kokuei Yuan is set to have 26.7% of the shares, according to the filing.
The offering is being led by JPMorgan Chase & Co., Jefferies Financial Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. The company plans to make its debut Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BLSH.

Accountants deploying generative artificial intelligence can upgrade the level of detail of financial reports by 12%, shift 8.5% of their time from routine, back-office processing to higher value tasks, and cut 7.5 days off the time needed to complete a monthly close, researchers said.
-
By using generative AI, accountants can devote more time toward analytical work, quality assurance and communicating with clients, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management and Stanford University Business School said in a study.
-
“On average, AI-using accountants support 55% more clients per week compared to non-users, enabling them to broaden their client service scope,” the researchers said. “These accountants also log more billable hours, indicating that AI helps convert previously non-productive time into client-facing work.”
Dive Insight:
Advancements in AI this decade have improved accounting efficiency and accuracy, with machine learning sharpening fraud detection, predictions of earnings, forecasts of market trends and risk management, according to research in recent years.
At the same time, many companies use robotic process automation to streamline workaday tasks such as data entry and reconciliation, reducing errors and upgrading efficiency.
Going beyond prior findings, the MIT/Stanford study “uniquely captures a complete perspective of how generative AI fundamentally transforms financial reporting and professional accounting practices,” researchers Jung Ho Choi and Chloe Xie said.
The researchers teamed up with a provider of AI software focused on accounting and analyzed hundreds of thousands of transactions from 79 small- and medium-sized companies.
Choi and Xie also surveyed 277 accountants, exploring how they adopted AI and viewed the benefits and hazards of the technology.
When used by accountants as a collaborative tool, AI especially complemented the professional judgment of the most seasoned accountants, Choi and Xie said.
“We find that more experienced accountants tend to leverage the AI system more strategically and reap larger performance gains from it,” the researchers said.
Veteran accountants are skilled in interpreting metrics from AI measuring the reliability of its recommendations and, when the scores are low, tend to intervene more frequently than their less experienced colleagues, the researchers said.",b9b8ba0225a56f2271368415e7a5d681,trafilatura,2548,0

It was a busy day for the company, which unveiled a fresh set of quarterly results and announced a pricey acquisition.
-
It should soon own around three-quarters of Solaris Health.
Sprawling healthcare company Cardinal Health (NYSE: CAH) reported its latest quarterly results and announced a sizable new acquisition Tuesday morning. The market didn't take these news items well, however, and in late-session trading, it was pushing the company's share price down by nearly 7%. The S&P 500 index, meanwhile, was bouncing higher with a more than 1% gain.
A nearly $2 billion move
Of the two pieces of news, that of the acquisition was clearly the more impactful. Cardinal Health announced that its The Specialty Alliance multiservices organization (MSO) platform has signed an agreement to acquire Solaris Health. The latter company was described by its acquirer as ""the country's leading urology MSO.""
Cardinal Health will pay roughly $1.9 billion in cash to Solaris' owners (comprising a firm known as Lee Equity Partners and the company's physician partners) to acquire around a 75% stake in the business. In the press release trumpeting the deal, Cardinal Health said that it would bolster the scale of urology within The Specialty Alliance.
The company said it would finance the acquisition with cash on hand plus new debt. It expects the deal to close by the end of this calendar year.
Separately, Cardinal Health reported its fiscal fourth quarter of 2025 results. Revenue was basically flat year over year at just under $60.2 billion. Non-GAAP (adjusted) net income, on the other hand, rose by 11% to hit $501 million, or $2.08 per share.
On average, analysts tracking the stock were modeling $60.9 billion on the top line yet only $2.03 per share for adjusted net income.
Flying higher with guidance
Cardinal Health also raised its profitability guidance for the entirety of fiscal 2026. The company is now forecasting that adjusted earnings per share will come in at $9.30 to $9.50; its previous estimate was $9.10 to $9.30. That $9.30 at the low end of the new range is 13% higher than the actual fiscal 2025 result.
The company did not provide revenue guidance.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar slipped for a second straight session on Wednesday, a day after a U.S. inflation reading increased expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut next month and renewed pressure from President Donald Trump for lower rates added to the sell-off.
The dollar index, measuring the currency against a basket of peers, fell 0.2% to 97.856, its lowest since July 28, extending its 0.5% drop on Tuesday.
U.S. consumer prices increased marginally in July, data showed on Tuesday, in line with forecasts and as the pass-through from Trump's sweeping tariffs to goods prices has so far been limited.
Investors priced in near certainty the central bank would ease rates next month, according to LSEG data.
On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called for a ""series of rate cuts,"" and said the Fed could kick off the policy rate easing with a 50 basis point cut.
The day before, U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticised Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not easing rates sooner, had added to the pressure on the Fed.
White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said that the president was considering a lawsuit against Powell in relation to his management of renovations at the central bank's Washington headquarters.
""I think there is quite significant pressure on the Fed from the political side of Washington to get moving on interest rates,"" Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank, said.
Michael Pfister, FX analyst at Commerzbank, said these political developments carried echoes of autocratic countries, where heads of statistics agencies or central banks are replaced and critical data series often discontinued or manipulated.
""I'm not saying that this will necessarily happen here. But the developments of the last few days and weeks do not exactly fill me with optimism about the future, or the U.S. dollar,"" Pfister said.
Trump also hit out at Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, saying the bank had been wrong to predict U.S. tariffs would hurt the economy. Trump questioned whether Solomon should lead the Wall Street institution.
RATE CUT RUMINATIONS
Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic on Wednesday said nearly full U.S. employment offers the central bank the ""luxury"" of not rushing to make any policy adjustments.
Meanwhile, Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbeeon Wednesday said the U.S. central bank is grappling with understanding whether tariffs will push up inflation just temporarily or more persistently.",46e05e123122b5b84a4d4dfcac9dbb4b,trafilatura,2535,0

On Jul. 31, Chlorox announced its fiscal fourth-quarter results, and its shares dipped 2% in the next trading session. Its adjusted EPS of $2.87 and revenue of $1.99 billion surpassed Wall Street expectations. Gross margin held steady at 46.5%, buoyed by higher volume and cost-saving measures, despite pressure from rising manufacturing, logistics, and trade promotion costs.
For the current fiscal year, ending in June 2026, analysts expect CLX’s adjusted EPS to fall 21.6% year over year to $6.05. The company has a mixed earnings surprise history. While it surpassed the Street’s bottom-line estimates thrice over the past four quarters, it missed the projections on one other occasion.
Meanwhile, CLX has a consensus “Hold” rating overall. Of the 18 analysts covering the stock, opinions include one “Strong Buy,” 13 “Holds,” and four “Strong Sells.”
This configuration has remained mostly stable in recent months.
On Aug. 2, Morgan Stanley’s (MS) Dara Mohsenian maintained an “Equal-Weight” rating on Clorox but cut the price target from $150 to $137.
CLX's mean price target of $133.31 implies a modest 8.5% premium to current price levels, while the Street-high target of $157 suggests a notable 27.8% upside potential.

A post-coronavirus pandemic rally has petered out, leaving the oil giant down some 15% from its highs.
-
The stock's dividend yield is above the industry norm, suggesting it is an attractive income choice.
-
Plus, some company-specific headwinds that had been holding the shares down are abating.
An inflation spike coming out of the coronavirus pandemic helped to boost the profits of energy companies. But after hitting a peak, oil and natural gas prices have come back down. That has taken the wind out of the sector's sails, but one of the industry's largest competitors -- Chevron's (NYSE: CVX) -- performed even worse than its closest competitor and is still down over 15% from its highs.
There's still a chance to buy the stock while it has a well above average yield. Here's what you need to know.
What goes up always goes down
Oil and natural gas are commodities prone to large and often rapid price swings. So the ups and downs around the pandemic aren't really that unusual. Still, investors react to the price swings in fairly predictable fashion. When energy prices rise, Wall Street tends to boost the shares of oil and gas producers. The reverse happens when energy prices fall.
That's the big picture for Chevron's price decline since the oil price rally turned into an oil price decline. However, there are some other factors at play with this energy industry giant. Notably, a large acquisition (Hess) got stuck in court because of complaints about the deal from Chevron's competitors. And Chevron's investment in Venezuela is an off again/on again political headache. Both issues were negatives not too long ago, helping to keep Chevron's shares depressed. Even more so than its closest peer, ExxonMobil.
The end result is that, even now, Chevron is offering an attractive investment opportunity. Notably, the stock's dividend yield is 4.4%. Exxon's yield is 3.7%. The average energy stock's yield is 3.2%. And the S&P 500 index's yield is a scant 1.2%. This is an opening you won't want to miss if you are looking to invest in the energy sector.
Chevron is built to survive the energy cycle
For starters, Chevron's company-specific headwinds are abating. Its deal to buy Hess has been approved and completed. And while Venezuela will always be a sore point, the headwinds have evened out around this investment for the time being. Thus, the overhang from these issues is largely gone, which helps to explain Chevron's recent stock price rally, which has been stronger than the rally of Exxon's shares.",77d877ba9f3202814ba463d14e7a7c9d,trafilatura,2534,0

Airline fares jumped 4% from June, while gasoline prices dropped 1.9% over the month and are now 9% lower than a year ago.
The dual move means carriers can charge more while paying less for one of their biggest operating costs, a setup that sent airline shares sharply higher.

The CPI report showed mixed news for U.S. consumers. While gasoline provided relief at the pump, several everyday expenses moved higher.
A notable price jump was recorded in transportation services, which climbed 0.8% for the month and remain 3.5% higher than a year ago.
Medical care services also accelerated, rising 0.8% in July and 4.3% year-over-year, with dental services and hospital care driving much of the increase.
Used car prices rose 0.5% in the month and 4.8% from last year. Transportation services increased 0.8% month-over-month and are up 3.5% compared to the same period last year.
Gasoline prices fell by 1.9%, or 9% on an annual basis, helping to contain headline inflation. Meanwhile, energy services posted a 0.3% monthly decline, though their annual gain remains steep at 7.2%, led by utility gas service's 13.8% jump from July 2024.
Grocery prices, classified as ""food at home,” were flat in July but still 2.9% higher than last year, while dining out — ""food away from home"" — rose 0.3% in the month and is up 3.9% over the past year.

“Reported revenue growth was 12%. On a constant currency basis, we grew revenue by 16%, with double-digit growth in all regions. Underlying demand remains strong and we are on track to meet our target of constant currency growth at the high end of the 15-17% range we provided at the beginning of the year,” said CEO Oliver Reichert.
In Euros, revenue totaled 635 million euros, an increase of 12% on a reported basis and 16% in constant currency.
Revenue grew double digits across all segments, rising 10% in the Americas, 13% in EMEA, and 21% in APAC on a reported basis. In constant currency, growth was 16% in the Americas, 13% in EMEA, and 24% in APAC.
Gross profit margin was 60.5%, up 100 basis points from 59.5% a year ago. The increase was driven by price adjustments and improved manufacturing capacity absorption, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation and channel mix.

The company exited the quarter with cash and equivalents worth 261.834 million euros.
During the company's conference call, Birkenstock CEO reportedly said the July 1 price increases in the U.S. were met with no pushback or order cancellations from retailers, signaling strong retailer acceptance despite higher prices.
Outlook
Birkenstock Holding reaffirmed its fiscal year 2025 sales guidance at $2.254 billion.
In fiscal year 2025, the company expects an adjusted EBITDA margin of 31.3% to 31.8%, despite a significantly weaker US dollar.

Looking closer, Caterpillar has also lagged behind the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLI) 22% surge over the past year and 15.7% gains in 2025.
On Aug. 5, Caterpillar released its Q2 2025 results, and its shares dipped 1.5% in the next trading session. Its sales slipped 1% year-over-year to $16.6 billion, as weaker pricing and higher tariffs outweighed modest volume gains, and adjusted EPS rose to $4.72 from $5.99. Adjusted operating profit margin was 17.6% for the second quarter of 2025, compared with 22.4% for the second quarter of 2024.
For the current fiscal year 2025, ending in December, analysts expect CAT's adjusted EPS to decline nearly 16.7% year-over-year to $18.24. The company has a mixed earnings surprise history. It missed the Street's bottom-line estimates in three of the past four quarters, while beating on one occasion.
Among the 21 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on 11 “Strong Buy,” nine “Holds,” and one “Strong Sell.”
This configuration is slightly more bullish than it was two months ago, with ten “Strong Buy” recommendations for the stock.
On Aug. 6, Truist Securities analyst Jamie Cook reiterated a “Buy” rating on Caterpillar and raised the price target from $414 to $507.
Caterpillar’s mean price target of $435.80 indicates a premium of 5.3% from the current market prices. The Street-high target of $520 suggests a notable 25.7% upswing potential.

Still, its shares sank as much as 5.4% in Hong Kong after the results, as investors worried about losses from its fast-growing cloud division. Chinese tech companies are also grappling with concerns stemming from a prolonged US-China trade and technology war.

The impact from US tariffs is “very limited” for Lenovo, Chairman Yang Yuanqing said.
“We have built more than 30 factories in more than 10 countries that give us a lot of flexibility and resilience,” Yang told Bloomberg News. He added that he expected the global PC volume to grow by a mid- to high-single-digit percentage in the fiscal year through next March, and that Lenovo will outperform the market.
The world’s top PC maker said net income for the June quarter rose 108% to $505 million, beating the average of analysts’ estimates by a wide margin. That’s partly due to fair value gains from warrants issued earlier this year. Revenue climbed 22% to $18.8 billion versus an expected $17.6 billion.
Beijing-based Lenovo grew quarterly PC shipments 15%, outperforming competitors HP Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc., according to Counterpoint Research. The overall market grew 8.4%, its fastest pace since 2022, driven by a replacement cycle as support for Windows 10 ends later this year and customers front-load purchases. Like its rivals, Lenovo has touted so-called AI PCs equipped with more powerful hardware to perform workloads from real-time transcription to image generation.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Lenovo’s strong sales in fiscal 1Q — rising 22% and beating consensus by 7% — suggest the cloud segment, which expanded 36%, could play a bigger role in its growth, given robust AI server demand and fading front-loaded demand for PCs. Still, widening losses of the division indicate more investment might be needed to meet customer demand and frequent system upgrades, which could narrow the company’s margins.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Pressure is mounting within the Bank of Japan to ditch a vaguely defined gauge of inflation as worries about second-round price effects prompt some board members to call for a more hawkish communication of policy and a clearer path to future rate hikes.
BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has justified going slow on rate hikes by explaining that ""underlying inflation,"" which focuses on the strength of domestic demand and wages, remains short of the central bank's 2% target.
The trouble is that there is no single indicator that gauges ""underlying inflation"", making it a target for critics who say the BOJ is overly reliant on an obscure reading to guide monetary policy despite both headline inflation and core measures exceeding its target for years.
Now, even some members of the BOJ board - worried that second-round price effects were becoming embedded in pricing behaviour and public perceptions of future inflation - are calling for a change to the bank's communication to a more hawkish one that focuses on headline inflation, which hit 3.3% in June.
""We're at a phase where we should shift the core of our communication away from underlying inflation to actual price moves and their outlook, as well as the output gap and inflation expectations,"" one member said, according to a summary of opinions at the bank's July policy meeting.
Another member said the BOJ must put more emphasis on upside risks to prices, and consider tweaking its communication to one that is based on the view Japan will hit 2% inflation.
Some members of the government's top economic council also warned this month the BOJ might be too complacent of mounting price pressure, a clear nudge to the central bank to steer a more hawkish policy path in the wake of growing public alarm over persistent inflation.
""I'm worried that monetary policy is already behind the curve,"" one panel member was quoted as saying at a meeting last week, adding that prolonged price rises were already affecting people's livelihood and their inflation expectations.
OCTOBER POLICY TILT?
The BOJ exited a decade-long, radical stimulus programme last year and raised short-term interest rates to 0.5% in January on the view that Japan was on the cusp of sustainably hitting its 2% inflation target.
While the central bank has signalled its readiness to raise rates further, the economic impact of higher U.S. tariffs forced it to cut its growth forecasts in May and complicated decisions around the timing of the next rate increase.",02641dd432f393f776473974241fa003,trafilatura,2520,0

Rigetti Computing Earnings Might Be Make or Break for RGTI Stock, Unless You Use This Options Trade
However, AFTER the report, while a trader might miss some giant up moves, they have a chance to pick through the wreckage. The aftermath of earnings is, to me, a much more opportunistic time to trade. That goes hand-in-hand with being a risk manager, which I certainly am.
When it comes to the trio discussed in this article, the earnings are out, the charts are clearer, and the market has passed judgement.
So let’s look forward, where we find that 2 of these 3 popular stocks are in danger of fading, while the other might just have a shot to appreciate strongly in the months ahead.
Here are the 3, side by side, using Barchart’s neat stock comparison feature. OKLO and ACHR tanked on earnings, joining a long list of blood-letting at the hands of disappointed traders and speculators. PLUG fared better, which makes sense in a 2025 sort of way.
This year, stocks tend to revert to the mean more than I’ve witnessed in the past. That is, if they rise sharply for a while, as OKLO did, they are priced for perfection, and the slightest bit of “not great” news produces selling pressure. Lots of it. Like the 17% 1-week loss suffered recently.
Other stocks tend to be given more leniency when they are down, such as PLUG, following its nearly 30% drop earlier this year. None of this is new to trading. Buy low, sell high, right? But the volatility is different. It is much higher.
OKLO and ARCH Are Slippery Slopes
This pair has a familiar look of stocks post-earnings. They are at different stages of fading from recent highs. OKLO is hanging in better, though the combination of its 20-day moving average turning down, along with its PPO (bottom of chart below) is concerning. The stock was a “4-bagger,” rising from $20 to the $80 range since last quarter’s earnings. So it appears to likely be ahead of even the rosiest outlook.",14a25296c3d37ecb069e561d76afaae0,trafilatura,2517,0

-
Hanes Releases Its Urban Outfitters-exclusive Capsule Collection
Including debt, the transaction gives HanesBrands an enterprise value of $4.4 billion, or 8.9 times the company’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the last year.
The deal would be “immediately accretive” to Gildan’s adjusted earnings and produce $200 million in annual cost synergies within three years of the closing.
BOTTOM LINE: Gildan’s $2.2B Deal for HanesBrands Signals Major Changes in Fashion
HanesBrands stockholders will receive 0.102 shares of Gildan and 80 cents cash for each share they own, a premium of about 24 percent based on the company’s closing price of $6 on Monday. Following completion of the deal, HanesBrands investors will own about 19.9 percent of the combined company.
The deal closes a chapter for HanesBrands, which has been in flux for some time, recently selling the struggling Champion business to brand licensing giant Authentic Brands Group. And the business could trim down some more as Gildan plans to consider a sale of HanesBrands Australia once the transaction is completed later this year or in early 2026.
While many fashion dealmakers thought the M&A market would slow given the uncertainty around tariffs in U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war, it seems to have had the opposite effect for some players, who are looking to position for the future.
Glenn J. Chamandy, president and chief executive officer of Gildan, described the coming together as “a historic moment in Gildan’s journey” in a statement.
“With this transaction, our revenues will double and we achieve a scale that distinctly sets us apart,” Chamandy said. “The combination with HanesBrands strengthens our positioning with an opportunity to expand the heritage ‘Hanes’ brand presence in activewear across channels, while enhancing Gildan’s retail reach for its portfolio of brands. Further, our state-of-the-art, low-cost vertically integrated platform will be utilized to enhance efficiencies and drive additional innovation. We are excited for the next stage of growth and remain focused on supporting our customers and continuing to drive long-term shareholder value.”",c7d038d949d6b418b4de27023d2fccb4,trafilatura,2517,0

Here why",2025-08-14 23:15:00+00:00,gdelt_cnbc_com,cnbc.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"CNBC's Jim Cramer on Thursday said that although the market may be frothy, investors shouldn't quit because there are enough positive stock stories to overwhelm the froth with rationality.
Cramer used the dotcom bubble burst as an example. During that time in the late 1990s, he said froth involved the market's continuous roar based on, at best, hype. Stocks rallied for no real reason, markets lost their rational side and companies ended up with no revenue or business plan.
Cramer said today's market is vastly different because the rational outweighs the irrational.
On the irrational front, Cramer pointed to recent IPOs such as Circle, Figma and Bullish, that each saw explosive gains after their debuts. Bullish, a crypto exchange, most recently gained more than 83% during Wednesday's trading hours. While it pulled back from its highs, it still rallied another 10% on Thursday.
Cramer cited Oklo Inc. as another example. The company wants to build a small nuclear reactor that runs on nuclear waste. That stock is up 247% year-to-date.
""Flying cars, supercharged crypto ETFs, secretive companies that consult in magical ways ... all irrational. I could go on and on,"" Cramer said. ""Is the widespread irrationality a reason to sell down your positions in perfectly rational stocks? Absolutely not.""
On the other side, Cramer said Amazon and Eli Lilly are two examples of rationality.
Amazon on Thursday gained 3% after the company on Wednesday launched same-day delivery of fresh foods to more than 1,000 U.S. cities and towns.
Cramer called Amazon's announcement ""an incredibly disruptive initiative"" and said it could spell trouble for Instacart, Doordash and Uber. Instacart stock dropped 11% on the news on Wednesday.
Eli Lilly also saw a sign of confidence on Wednesday, Cramer noted, when an influential group from the drugmaker's management and board of directors bought up stock in the open market.
""Sure, there's froth, but there are also perfectly legitimate moves in the stocks of great companies,"" Cramer said. ""I am calling this the year of magical thinking, but the truth is you can't get the runs in the good ones without the runs in the bad ones.""

Nat-Gas Prices Plunge on Cooler US Forecasts and EIA Production Forecast Increase
Narrowing the focus, the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE) has recorded a more subdued performance with a decline of 1.2% YTD and 5.8% over the past year, suggesting energy-sector investors remain cautious.
The modest outperformance of PSX relative to XLE this year points to company-specific strengths, namely elevated refining efficiency rates, helping to buoy the stock amid a broadly underperforming sector.
Meanwhile, PSX lagging behind the broader market likely reflects persistent pressure on energy valuations, driven by structural shifts toward tech and renewables, tariff-related input cost concerns, and continued capital rotation away from traditional oil & gas, factors that may dampen sentiment toward energy exposures overall.
For the current fiscal year, ending in December 2025, analysts expect Phillips 66's EPS to decline by 23.6% year-over-year to $4.70, on a diluted basis. The company’s record of beating earnings is a mixed bag, surpassing EPS forecasts in three of the last four quarters, while missing on one other occasion.
Out of the 20 analysts covering PSX stock, the consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on nine analysts recommending a “Strong Buy,” one advising a “Moderate Buy,” and the remaining 10 staying cautious with a “Hold” rating.
The current configuration has remained largely consistent over the past few months.

Fluor's second-quarter report arrived at the beginning of this month with big sales and earnings misses.
-
While macroeconomic uncertainty weighs on the company's momentum, the business still has a big sales backlog.
-
Fluor could continue to see volatile trading, but the company's backlog and exposure to AI infrastructure power trends suggest the stock could have big upside.
Fluor (NYSE: FLR) published its second-quarter results at the beginning of August, and performance for the period came in significantly below the average Wall Street analyst estimate. The engineering and construction specialist posted non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $0.43 on revenue of $3.98 billion in the period, falling short of the consensus target's call for per-share earnings of $0.56 on sales of roughly $4.7 billion. Revenue unexpectedly fell 6% year over year in the period.
Fluor stock saw a big sell-off in conjunction with the weaker-than-expected Q2 print, and its share price is down roughly 23.5% across August's trading as of this writing. While Fluor has seen a huge valuation pullback this month, there's also a positive sign for the company.
There's one big green flag for Fluor stock at current pricing levels
Fluor's Q2 report arrived with some disappointing results, but some dynamics suggest that the stock could rebound well above current levels following the big pullback. Fluor notched $1.8 billion in new bookings in the second quarter, with 72% of those bookings being reimbursable.
Meanwhile, the company's total bookings backlog stood at $28.2 billion, with 80% of that figure being reimbursable. Even though total bookings saw a drawdown from the $28.7 billion level at the end of the previous quarter, there are still clear indications that large, previously contracted deals are being converted into sales.
Macroeconomic uncertainty has presented a significant performance headwind for Fluor, but the business's sizable backlog suggests that the business is attractively valued with a market capitalization of roughly $7 billion. Fluor's majority ownership position in NuScale Power gives it significant exposure to the rise of nuclear power being used to power artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, and the relatively high degree of visibility on the company's forward sales outlook suggests that the stock could have a favorable risk-reward dynamic at current levels.

See on the daily bar chart for December soybean meal futures that prices are starting to trend higher and have just hit a six-week high. See, too, at the bottom of the chart that the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator is also in a bullish posture, as the red MACD line is above the blue trigger line and both lines are trending higher. The meal bulls have gained the overall near-term technical advantage.
More News from Barchart
Fundamentally, this week’s bullish USDA supply and demand report has energized the soybean (ZSX25) and meal market bulls. Also, it appears spreaders are unwinding long soybean oil (ZLZ25), short soybean meal spreads, to further support the meal market.
A move in December meal futures above chart resistance at this week’s high of $300.10 would give the meal bulls more power and it would also become a buying opportunity. The upside price objective would be $335.00, or above. Technical support, for which to place a protective sell stop just below, is located at $288.00.

Trading commodity futures and options is not for everyone. IT IS A VOLATILE, COMPLEX AND RISKY BUSINESS. Before you invest any money in futures or options contracts, you should consider your financial experience, goals and financial resources, and know how much you can afford to lose above and beyond your initial payment to a broker. You should understand commodity futures and options contracts and your obligations in entering into those contracts. You should understand your exposure to risk and other aspects of trading by thoroughly reviewing the risk disclosure documents your broker is required to give you.

Narrowing the focus, LII’s underperformance is also apparent compared to the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI). The exchange-traded fund has gained about 22.9% over the past year. Moreover, the ETF’s 15.3% gains on a YTD basis outshine LII’s single-digit dip over the same time frame.
On Jul. 23, LII shares closed up by 6.6% after reporting its Q2 results. Its revenue stood at $1.5 billion, up 3.4% year over year. The company’s adjusted EPS increased 14.5% from the year-ago quarter to $7.82.
For the current fiscal year, ending in December, analysts expect LII’s EPS to grow 6.4% to $24.02 on a diluted basis. The company’s earnings surprise history is impressive. It beat the consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters.
Among the 17 analysts covering LII stock, the consensus is a “Hold.” That’s based on six “Strong Buy” ratings, six “Holds,” one “Moderate Sell,” and four “Strong Sells.”
The configuration has been consistent over the past three months.
On Aug. 1, Joe O’Dea from Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) maintained a “Sell” rating on LII with a price target of $675, implying a potential upside of 14.3% from current levels.
The mean price target of $670.93 represents a 13.6% premium to LII’s current price levels. The Street-high price target of $754 suggests an ambitious upside potential of 27.7%.

Looking closer, CME stock has also outpaced the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLF) 24.1% return over the past 52 weeks.
CME Group shares recovered marginally on Jul. 23 as investors reacted to its Q2 2025 results, with adjusted EPS of $2.96 and revenue rising 10.4% to a record $1.7 billion, topping Wall Street’s estimates. The quarter saw record average daily volumes of 30.2 million contracts, up 16% year-over-year, driven by heightened market volatility, record participation from retail traders (+57% new accounts), and strong demand for interest-rate products.
For the fiscal year ending in December 2025, analysts expect CME’s adjusted EPS to grow 8.6% year-over-year to $11.14. The company’s earnings surprise history is promising. It beat the consensus estimates in the last four quarters.
Among the 19 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a “Hold.” That’s based on five “Strong Buy” ratings, two “Moderate Buys,” nine “Holds,” one “Moderate Sell,” and two “Strong Sells.”

Etoro's second-quarter report came with sales and earnings that beat Wall Street's targets.
-
The fintech company's share price still saw big sell-offs today despite seemingly strong Q2 results.
-
Some investors may have been looking for stronger funded accounts growth, but overall performance was still pretty strong in Q2.
Etoro (NASDAQ: ETOR) stock sank in Tuesday's trading. The company's share price ended the daily session down 8.3% and had been off as much as 9.6% earlier in the session. The sell-offs came despite the S&P 500 index rising 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite climbing 1.3% on the day.
Major indexes notched record highs in Tuesday's session as the latest round of inflation data supported the case for significant interest rate cuts later this year, but Etoro stock still saw big sell-offs following the company's recent quarterly report. The fintech company actually posted second-quarter earnings that came in significantly ahead of the market's expectations, but the stock still got hit with a big sell-off in today's session.
Etoro stock got hit hard after earnings
Etoro reported non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $0.56 in the second quarter, beating the average Wall Street analyst estimate's call for adjusted per-share earnings of $0.51 in the period. Meanwhile, the company notched a net contribution of $210 million in the period -- beating the consensus estimate's call for a net contribution of $194.7 million in the period. Etoro's net contribution figure was up 26% year over year, and adjusted net income was up roughly 23% year over year.
The company closed out the period with $17.5 billion in assets under its administration, up from 11.3% in the prior-year quarter. Despite some strong momentum in the period, investors were seemingly looking for stronger results -- and the company's share price has tumbled following the quarterly update.
What's next for Etoro?
While Etoro stock saw a big pullback following the company's Q2 release, the numbers in the report were generally quite strong. The company saw total funded accounts on its platform rise 14% year over year to reach 3.63 million. While some investors seemingly hoped that the company would post strong user growth, overall momentum was still pretty solid. On the heels of today's post-earnings pullback, the stock could be worth a look for risk-tolerant investors.

-
Cellebrite continued to see solid growth in the second quarter of 2025, led by a big jump in free cash flow.
-
The company named interim CEO Tom Hogan to take on the role permanently and also announced a new chief financial officer.
-
Cellebrite is cautiously optimistic about recent acquisition activity and the prospect for further business.
Here's our initial take on Cellebrite DI's (NASDAQ: CLBT) financial report.
Key Metrics
Cellebrite Moves Forward on Multiple Fronts
Cellebrite has enjoyed high demand for its digital investigative software, with both government entities and private-sector corporate clients adopting Cellebrite's platform extensively. Revenue for the second quarter was up 18% year over year, and annualized recurring revenue from the software-as-a-service platform climbed at a faster 21% rate. Earnings per share came in a penny better than expected as Cellebrite celebrated rising margins from its effectiveness in controlling costs and making the most of sales growth. A dollar-based net retention rate of 120% signaled that existing clients are making greater use of Cellebrite's services.
CEO Tom Hogan pointed to Cellebrite's plans to acquire virtualization technology specialist Corellium and its collaboration with the U.S. Department of Justice as important factors that could expand the scope of its business. The Corellium deal hasn't yet gotten final approval, though, so Cellebrite hasn't incorporated its potential impact into guidance.
As for Hogan, the once-interim CEO has formally been named to fill the role permanently. Cellebrite's board chair had kind words to say about Hogan's experience and leadership. Joining Hogan will be David Barter, who will take over the CFO role from the retiring Dana Gerner.
Immediate Market Reaction
Investors were generally pleased with Cellebrite's news. The stock moved higher by almost 5% in premarket trading during the first 45 minutes after the release of its financial report. Both sales and earnings were higher than most of those following Cellebrite had anticipated, which was likely the biggest contributor to the upward move.
Even so, it's important to put the modest move into context. Cellebrite's stock soared during late 2024 and into the beginning of 2025, but since their February peak, the shares had lost roughly half their value at their worst levels. Signs of a rebound are encouraging, though, and Cellebrite hopes that future results will validate investors' confidence.",1a3ba2c846997c37d0bacdac339620d2,trafilatura,2489,0

The company’s own description of these outcomes as “completely unacceptable” set the tone for the turmoil that followed.
On Aug. 11, shares of AI stock tumbled nearly 26%, a clear signal that investors were not buying into the explanations provided. CEO Tom Siebel candidly attributed the shortfall to personal health challenges that distracted him from fully steering the business, alongside a disruptive internal reorganization that unsettled operations.

Despite the setback, Siebel remains steadfast, highlighting strong products, an expansive market opportunity, and high customer satisfaction as pillars for a potential comeback. Yet, the mood on Wall Street is far from optimistic. Analysts have not minced words, with some labeling the quarter as “brutal” and even “catastrophic.”
The road ahead appears steep, as the full first-quarter fiscal 2026 results, due Sept. 3, will be scrutinized for signs of a genuine turnaround.
About C3.ai Stock
Headquartered in Redwood City, California, C3.ai specializes in enterprise artificial intelligence software applications. The company delivers solutions that enable businesses to swiftly develop, deploy, and manage AI-driven applications across diverse sectors. With a market capitalization hovering around $2.5 billion currently, the firm offers an integrated suite encompassing the C3 AI Platform, C3 AI Applications, and the newer C3 Generative AI.
Over the past 52 weeks, AI stock has taken a significant hit, declining by 28%. More recently, in the last month alone, shares have plunged 32%, indicating the intensity of concern following the preliminary results.
Valued at approximately 5.8 times sales, AI stock trades at a premium compared to its industry peers. The premium may expose the stock to greater volatility, especially as operational challenges emerge.
C3.ai Surpasses Q4 Earnings
On May 28, C3.ai unveiled its Q4 fiscal 2025 results, beating Wall Street's estimates. Revenue rose 26% year-over-year (YOY) to $108.7 million, narrowly surpassing the consensus figure of $108.53 million.

Intel is the only U.S. company with the capability to manufacture the fastest chips on U.S. shores, although rivals including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung also have U.S. factories. President Donald Trump has called for more chips and high technology to be manufactured in the U.S.
The government's stake would help fund factories that Intel is currently building in Ohio, according to the report.
Earlier this week, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan visited Trump in the White House, a meeting that took place after the president had called for Tan's resignation based on allegations he has ties to China.
Intel said at the time that Tan is ""deeply committed to advancing U.S. national and economic security interests."" An Intel representative declined to comment about reports that the government is considering taking a stake in the company.
""We look forward to continuing our work with the Trump Administration to advance these shared priorities, but we are not going to comment on rumors or speculation,"" the spokesperson said.
Tan took over Intel earlier this year after the chipmaker failed to gain significant share in artificial intelligence chips, while it was spending heavily to build its foundry business, which manufactures chips for other companies.
Intel's foundry business has yet to secure a major customer, which would be a critical step in moving towards expansion and giving other potential customers the confidence to turn to Intel for manufacturing.
In July, Tan said that Intel was canceling plans for manufacturing sites in Germany and Poland and would slow down development in Ohio, adding that spending at the chipmaker would be closely scrutinized.
Under Trump, the U.S. government has increasingly moved to put itself at the center of deals in major industries. Last week, it said it would take 15% of certain Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices chip sales to China. The Pentagon bought a $400 million equity stake in rare-earth miner MP Materials. It also took a ""golden share"" in U.S. Steel as part of a deal to allow Nippon Steel to buy the U.S. industrial giant.
Intel shares are now up 19% this year after losing 60% of their value in 2024, the worst year on record for the chipmaker.

Spirit's bumpy ride
Spirit Aviation Holdings emerged from Spirit Airlines' financial restructuring on March 12 and has faced a difficult time ever since.
The bankruptcy was brought on following a failed takeover by JetBlue Airlines, with both carriers citing regulatory issues standing in the way of the merger both desired. This followed Spirit's rejected overtures from budget operator Frontier earlier in the year, after Frontier rejected Spirit's counteroffer.
Spirit's reorganization resulted in taking on $795 million in debt, bringing in $350 million in new equity, and setting up a $275 million credit line.
Spirit is in a bind because the minimum liquidity requirements of its debt obligations and collateral required by its credit card processing agreements require the company's operations to improve faster than it anticipated.

Fiserv recently nosedived after cutting its forecast for annual revenue growth, bringing the stock's six-month loss to 42%. Baupost also added a $51 million bet on packaging firm Amcor Plc and a $24 million stake in Brazilian payments company PagSeguro Digital in the second quarter.

Embattled lender Evolve Bank & Trust has named Bob Hartheimer CEO, effective immediately, following former CEO Scott Stafford’s retirement earlier this year.
Hartheimer joins Evolve from financial regulatory consulting firm Klaros Group. He previously co-founded and served as chief regulatory and compliance officer at Jasper, a credit card originator; and served as a bank and fintech regulatory consultant on his own and at Promontory Financial Group from 2002 until 2008.
Earlier in his career, he created and ran the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s Division of Resolutions, where he led a small team overseeing the sale of more than 200 banks with roughly $50 billion in assets and 10 large failing banks with $39 billion in assets, according to his LinkedIn profile.
Former Deputy Treasury Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin, who spent five years as Hartheimer’s colleague at Promontory, said she expects Evolve to “see improvement under his tenure” given his experience turning around and selling failing banks.
“Bob was selected for his unmatched corporate experience in strategically navigating challenges at financial institutions and enabling banks to move past their regulatory challenges,” Evolve’s board chair, Steve Valentine, said in a prepared statement.
“He has the full backing of the Board to take decisive action, restore thoughtful innovation, and lead Evolve into a future defined by transparency and sustainable growth. This is a structural change, demonstrating our continued commitment to doing the hard work to earn back the trust of our customers, employees, regulators, and investors,” Valentine said.
Evolve has had a rocky couple of years. After it gained prominence as a fintech-friendly bank, several fintechs it partnered with – most notably Yotta, but also Juno and Casper – became unable to connect users to funds deposited in Evolve and a small handful of other banks.
Synapse, the middleware firm sitting between Evolve and the fintechs, had filed for bankruptcy. Millions of dollars in user funds were unaccounted for. Many users remain unable to access their funds more than a year later.
Two months after Synapse filed for bankruptcy in April 2024, the Federal Reserve hit Evolve with an enforcement action related to its third-party partnerships, which Hartheimer said it’s still working to address.",ac7f6d2dc598b36c8643955ac5862532,trafilatura,2479,0

Match Group has agreed to pay $14 million to the FTC. The payment will settle charges of deceptive advertising practices. Match will change some business practices as part of the settlement. The company recently laid off 13% of its staff.
Match Group, the parent company of Match.com, Tinder, Hinge, OkCupid, and PlentyOfFish, has agreed to pay $14 million to settle a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission about deceptive advertising practices.
The FTC sued the dating-site company in 2019, accusing it of using misleading ads to drive subscriptions, which were then difficult for people to cancel. Customers who tried to dispute billing charges also complained about being locked out of their accounts.
Match, the FTC alleged, had told customers they could get a free six-month subscription if they didn’t “meet someone special,” but failed to disclose the customers would need to meet numerous requirements before that guarantee would be honored. As part of the agreement, Match has agreed to clearly disclose those terms moving forward.
In addition, the company will make it easier to cancel subscriptions and refrain from retaliating against customers who file disputes.
“Match Group admits no liability as part of this resolution and was fully prepared to take the case to trial, but opted to resolve the case to put the matter behind it,” the company said in a statement. “The FTC’s outdated claims are entirely moot, as the alleged practices at issue ended years ago or are based on mischaracterizations that do not reflect our business today.”
The settlement is just the latest in a string of bad news for Match. In May, it announced plans to lay off 13% of its workforce, cutting approximately 325 jobs. In addition, an investigation earlier this year claimed that it had failed to act on reports of sexual assault.
Match Group has seen its stock price tumble nearly 70% over the past five years (though it is 13% higher year to date in 2025). Bank of America analysts said in a Feb. 5 note that Spencer Rascoff’s appointment as CEO could be a positive for the company, but noted “the online dating industry faces continued headwinds to user growth.”
Rascoff, in March, posted an open letter on LinkedIn, where he said the company’s dating apps were falling short and don’t feel like places “to build real connections.” He has called on Match employees to offer feedback on how to best improve the services.

On grew revenue by 32% in the second quarter, with particular strength in direct-to-consumer sales.
-
Foreign currency fluctuations tanked the bottom line, but gross margin and operating profit both improved.
-
The company raised its full-year revenue outlook to reflect its increasing confidence despite a tough economic backdrop.
Here's our initial take on On Holding's (NYSE: ONON) fiscal 2025 second-quarter financial report.
Key Metrics
Powering Through a Tough Environment
You wouldn't know there was intense global economic uncertainty based on On Holding's Q2 results. Revenue for the Switzerland-based premium footwear, apparel, and accessories manufacturer soared by 32% year over year, or by 38.2% adjusting for currency, while direct-to-consumer sales rocketed 47.2% higher. The wholesale channel was strong as well with 23.1% revenue growth.
Geographically, On reported solid growth across the board. Revenue was up 42.9% in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, up 16.8% in the Americas, and up 101.3% in the Asia-Pacific region. Revenue from shoes soared 29.9% to 704.9 million Swiss francs, accounting for most of On's sales, while revenue from apparel jumped 67.5% to 36.7 million Swiss francs.
On seemingly missed analyst expectations for adjusted earnings per share, but currency fluctuations were to blame. Gross margin improved to 61.5%, up 1.6 percentage points year over year, while operating income nearly doubled. The issue was a 139.9 million Swiss franc foreign exchange loss, which led On to report an adjusted net loss of 0.09 Swiss francs per share.
With a strong second quarter in the books, On raised its outlook for full-year sales. The company now expects to produce at least 31% constant-currency revenue growth, up from previous guidance calling for 28% growth. Gross margin is now expected between 60.5% and 61%, a half-point bump, and adjusted EBITDA margin is expected between 17% and 17.5%.
Immediate Market Reaction
The share price of On was up around 15% in premarket trading with 90 minutes to go before the market opened. While On fell well short of earnings expectations, the miss was due to currency fluctuations.
What to Watch
The strength of On's sales against the backdrop of tariffs and global economic uncertainty speaks volumes about the company's brand. That said, the Americas was the slowest-growing region for On in the second quarter, and the situation could deteriorate as the year goes on.",5c7b316bf1f0ea4a455b91dcc183ff58,trafilatura,2456,0

Willdan Group (WLDN) shows strong technical momentum, hitting a new high on Aug. 13.
-
Shares have gained more than 232% over the past year.
-
Technical indicators are overwhelmingly bullish, including a 100% Barchart “Buy” opinion and Trend Seeker “Buy” signal.
-
Despite positive momentum, WLDN is volatile and speculative. Strict risk management and stop-loss strategies are essential for investors.
Today’s Featured Stock
Valued at $1.74 billion, Willdan Group (WLDN) provides technical and consulting services to utilities and various government agencies. Nationwide, they enable their clients to realize cost and energy savings by providing a wide range of specialized services. These include energy efficiency and sustainability; engineering and planning; economic and financial consulting; and national preparedness and interoperability.
What I’m Watching
I found today’s Chart of the Day by using Barchart’s powerful screening functions to sort for stocks with the highest technical buy signals; superior current momentum in both strength and direction; and a Trend Seeker “buy” signal. I then used Barchart’s Flipcharts feature to review the charts for consistent price appreciation. WLDN checks those boxes. Since the Trend Seeker signaled a buy on May 9, the stock gained 179.08%.

Cathie Wood, co-founder, CEO, and chief investment officer of ARK Invest, has a long history of buying disruptive growth stocks she believes are capable of shaping the future.
She's not afraid to double down on high-growth tech names during periods of extreme volatility. It's a core part of ARK's investment strategy, targeting companies she believes have strong long-term potential, even as short-term price swings spook other investors.
For Wood, sharp pullbacks offer discounted entry points into companies that operate in transformative industries such as artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, blockchain, and programmatic advertising.
Still, Wood raised eyebrows across Wall Street this week by adding more than 725,000 shares of Trade Desk (TTD) across her firm's actively managed ETFs.
More on stocks:
The timing was no coincidence; Trade Desk stock fell 38.6% on Friday after the ad-tech specialist's latest earnings report disappointed investors.
Wood's move, however, indicates continued confidence in the California-based digital advertising platform despite a weaker-than-expected outlook, earnings miss, and a surprise C-suite change.
ARK Innovation ETF leads Trade Desk buying spree
According to ARK Invest's daily trading disclosures, Wood's flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) bought 535,292 shares of Trade Desk on Friday. The ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) added another 203,075 shares.
This marks ARK's first Trade Desk purchase since mid-February, when Wood's team bought shares following another post-earnings drop of 33%.
Following these trades, Trade Desk is now ARKK's 27th-largest holding, with 1.57 million shares valued at roughly $85 million. In ARKW, it's now the 29th-largest position, with 523,000 shares worth around $28 million.
What triggered Trade Desk's stock crash?
Trade Desk's nearly 40% drop this time came as its second-quarter results and forward outlook disappointed investors.
Revenue climbed 19% year over year to $694 million, ahead of the company's forecast and beating consensus estimates for $682 million. That translated to adjusted earnings of $0.41 per share, up 5% year over year but a penny per share below Wall Street's models.
The company's forward outlook proved more disappointing, with management calling for Q3 revenue to climb just 14% year over year to $717 million.",4910f8aaca4a2f5f5f47c11f7afd79ae,trafilatura,2429,0

Coherent reported impressive fiscal fourth-quarter results, with revenue increasing 16.4% year-over-year to $1.53 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $1.00. By comparison, Wall Street’s estimates called for revenue of $1.51 billion on EPS of $0.92.
However, the Q4 beat has been overshadowed by light revenue guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026. Management projected revenue in the range of $1.46-$1.60 billion, falling short of the consensus $1.55 billion at the midpoint. Coherent guided for Q1 EPS of $0.93-$1.13, on an adjusted basis, which matched estimates.

Chart Levels to Watch for COHR Stock
COHR has collapsed more than 19% in premarket trading, putting the stock on pace to open below both its 20-day and 50-day moving averages. Potential round-number support at the $90 level could come into play if selling intensifies. The gamma flip point is $88.47, which means a drop below here could trigger additional selling.
If today’s decline holds, it will be Coherent’s worst daily price drop since April 3, when the shares fell by 20.1% in a single session on tariff anxieties. Notably, the options market was pricing in just an 8.77% move for Coherent stock after earnings.
What’s Behind the Weak Forecast?
Alongside earnings, Coherent announced the sale of its Aerospace and Defense business to Advent for $400 million, with proceeds earmarked for debt reduction and EPS improvement. The company's debt reduction strategy through the A&D business sale proceeds aims to strengthen its financial position, supporting long-term value creation for stakeholders.
As a result, the Q1 guide excludes about $20 million A&D revenue, which accounts for the miss on Coherent’s revenue forecast.
Inside Coherent’s Q4 Earnings Report
The photonics company’s networking segment emerged as a primary growth driver during Q4, experiencing a remarkable 39% year-over-year surge and contributing approximately 62% of total revenue. Non-GAAP gross margins also showed improvement, reaching 37.9%, reflecting successful operational execution.",b3c5569b2d2aa587cc16ed0b3b8a5c36,trafilatura,2426,0

FedEx appointed Vishal Talwar as its new EVP and chief digital and information officer, according to a Tuesday announcement. Talwar will report to FedEx CEO and President Raj Subramaniam, the company said in an email.
-
Talwar joins the shipping giant after a decade-long stint at Accenture, where he most recently served as chief growth officer and senior managing director. Prior, he held a variety of roles at Wipro, Dell and IBM. The executive had been ""heavily engaged"" with FedEx’s ongoing digital transformation for nearly two years as part of his work with Accenture, the company said.
-
“His institutional knowledge and industry expertise will be instrumental as we continue to advance our long-term strategy and harness the full potential of FedEx intelligence to deliver even greater value to our customers and stockholders,” Subramaniam said in the announcement.
Dive Insight:
Talway replaces Sriram Krishnasamy, who left the role suddenly in July after a year in the role.
Krishnasamy will remain with the company as executive advisor role until the Fall and will receive a $3.27 million cash payout per the terms of his separation agreement, according to a Tuesday securities filing. The executive led a $4 billion structural cost reduction effort at the end of the 2025 year, FedEx said in the filing.
Under Talwar's leadership, the company plans to continue its digital transformation efforts, with a focus on data, AI, infrastructure and cybersecurity initiatives. Senior leaders of the Data and Technology and Dataworks organizations will report directly to Talwar.
“I am honored to join FedEx during such a transformative period as the company leverages the power of technology, data, and AI to make supply chains smarter for everyone,” said Talwar in the announcement. “I’ve had the privilege of working closely with FedEx in an advisory capacity, and that experience has given me a deep understanding of the business, the team, and the strategic direction.""
The shipping giant has been executing a multiyear revamp of its shipping operations as part of an effort called Network 2.0. The company closed 100 shipping centers as of May 31, and more closures are expected ahead amid the ongoing merger of its Ground and Express networks.

&Partners, a St. Louis-based hybrid broker/dealer launched by David Kowach, the former president and CEO of Wells Fargo Advisors, has recruited another advisor team from Commonwealth Financial Network, in the wake of LPL Financial closing its deal to acquire the broker/dealer.
Lumitas Wealth Strategies, a Woodbury, Minn.-based team with $520 million in pre-transition assets under management, has joined &Partners this week, the firm confirmed. Lumitas is led by co-founders and advisors Dana Schwinck and Justin Mishacoff, who left Commonwealth after three years with the b/d. Prior to that, the team was with Wells Fargo.
They’re joined by Joyce Murphy, client experience specialist, Jennifer Rath, wealth management associate, and Mary Bolling, a client service associate.
Lumitas represents the latest example of &Partners' recruiting success, particularly with female advisors. Of the 87 teams that have joined the firm, 30% were founded by a woman, and nearly 40% include at least one female advisor. As of July 31, &Partners oversaw $35.7 billion in AUM.
This follows news last week that the b/d added Kevin Braddock, an Estill, S.C.-based wealth advisor with nearly $84 billion in pre-transition AUM, from Commonwealth. In recent months, Kowach has had much success luring advisors from his former firm, Wells Fargo Advisors, including Four Corners Wealth, a Russellville, Ark., team with a pre-transition AUM of $769 million, and Tuckaway Capital, a Richmond, Va. team.
Kowach and co-founders Kristi Mitchem and John Alexander have aggressive growth plans for the next three years, with a target of 150 teams, $120 billion in assets, and $800 million in revenue.
LPL Financial recently closed on its planned acquisition of Commonwealth, the Waltham, Mass.-based IBD, which has 3,000 advisors and $305 billion in assets. LPL said it met its retention target of 90% of Commonwealth advisors and that it was pushing out its final integration timing to the fourth quarter of 2026.
In the wake of the acquisition, Commonwealth has lost many advisors to rival broker/dealers or the RIA channel. LPL CEO Rich Steinmeier said that despite noise in many of the trade publications about Commonwealth advisors looking to change firms rather than join the much larger LPL, he felt good about advisor retention.",d359798550c9bf59a71bb822cab5e7ad,trafilatura,2419,0

Narrowing our focus to the company’s sector, we see that the stock has also outperformed The Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU), which has gained 16.6% over the past 52 weeks and 14.2% YTD.
A favorable macroeconomic environment, characterized by higher infrastructure spending and rising electricity prices, has most likely benefited the company. After reporting better-than-expected second-quarter financial results on July 30, the stock ended three consecutive trading sessions in the green and reached a 52-week high of $111.90 on Aug.5.
WEC Energy’s topline increased 13.4% year-over-year to $2.01 billion. According to CEO Scott Lauber, the strong quarter was driven by a warm start to the summer season, effective capital plan execution, and operational efficiency gains. Its EPS increased 13.4% YOY to $0.76, surpassing the $0.71 figure expected by Wall Street analysts.
For the current year, ending in December 2025, Wall Street analysts expect a 7.2% YOY growth in its EPS to $5.23 on a diluted basis. The company has a mixed history of surpassing consensus estimates, topping them in three of the trailing four quarters and missing them on one occasion.
Among the 15 Wall Street analysts covering WEC Energy’s stock, the consensus is a “Hold.” That’s based on four “Strong Buy” ratings, 10 “Hold” ratings, and one “Strong Sell” rating.
The configuration of the ratings is more bearish than it was two months ago, with the addition of a “Strong Sell” rating, and the overall rating has shifted from a “Moderate Buy” to a “Hold.”",759feb893b00fcd1173e501b22ebbd1a,trafilatura,2412,0

UK-based financial advisory and restructuring company Interpath's Will Wright and Chris Pole have been appointed as joint administrators.
The administration follows Claire's Holdings’ voluntary Chapter 11 proceedings in the US, announced in early August 2025.
Claire’s CEO Chris Cramer blamed the decision on “increased competition, consumer spending trends and the ongoing shift away from bricks-and-mortar retail” and the company's “debt obligations, and macroeconomic factors”.
The joint administrators plan to continue trading while exploring a potential sale. All UK stores will remain open, and the administrators will prioritise informing the workforce in the UK and Ireland about the situation.
The company, headquartered in Birmingham, operates 306 stores across the UK and Ireland and employs 2,150 people.
Interpath UK CEO Will Wright stated: ""Claire’s has long been a popular brand across the UK, known not only for its trend-led accessories but also as the go-to destination for ear piercing.
“Over the coming weeks, we will endeavour to continue to operate all stores as a going concern for as long as we can, while we assess options for the company. This includes exploring the possibility of a sale which would secure a future for this well-loved brand.""
While all physical stores remain open, the Claire's UK and Ireland website will no longer accept orders.
Previously placed online orders that have been dispatched will be delivered, but undelivered orders will not be charged.
Refunds for items bought before the administrators' appointment will not be provided by the administrators, but customers may seek purchase protection from their payment providers.

(NASDAQ:OPEN) shares remained choppy Tuesday, extending a volatile stretch fueled by earnings results and intensifying public criticism of CEO Carrie Wheeler.
The company has a 52-week high of $4.97 and a 52-week low of $0.51. Year-to-date, the stock is up roughly 45% and trades about 83.6% above its 50-day simple moving average.
Opendoor reported $1.6 billion in second-quarter revenue and its first quarter of adjusted EBITDA profitability since 2022, even as Wheeler acknowledged that housing market conditions “continued to deteriorate.”
Revenue rose 4% from a year earlier and 36% from the prior quarter, with 4,299 homes sold. Gross profit was $128 million, slightly lower than $129 million last year but above $99 million in the first quarter. Net loss narrowed to $29 million from $92 million a year ago.
The company ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in inventory, representing 4,538 homes, down 32% year over year. Home purchases fell 63% to 1,757, and homes under contract for purchase dropped 78% to 393. On a non-GAAP basis, contribution profit was $69 million, adjusted net loss was $9 million, and adjusted EBITDA came in at $23 million, compared with a $5 million loss last year.
For the third quarter, Opendoor expects revenue of $800 million to $875 million, contribution profit of $22 million to $29 million, and adjusted EBITDA between a $28 million and $21 million loss.
Ahead of the earnings release, investor Eric Jackson publicly rebuked the company’s CEO, Carrie Wheeler, over remarks made in a Bloomberg interview, accusing her of being dismissive toward retail investors.
Jackson called for her replacement, arguing that retail support had pulled Opendoor “back from the brink” by helping it regain Nasdaq compliance and cancel a planned 50-to-1 reverse stock split.
Co-founder Keith Rabois echoed the criticism, calling Wheeler “utterly incompetent” and a “mediocre CFO”, before adding that tech companies “should never be led by CFOs.”
Shares dropped 24.6% to $1.90 last Wednesday after the earnings report and backlash, before edging up 0.01% after hours. Analysts and investors remain focused on whether Opendoor can navigate the “very challenging” housing market and execute its pivot toward a more capital-light, agent-led platform.
Price Action: OPEN shares are trading higher by 2.65% at 2.371 at Tuesday’s last check.

The flagship cryptocurrency rose as high as $124,496, surpassing its July record of 123,193.63, according to Coin Metrics. Ether rose to $4,791.19 overnight, edging closer to its 2021 record of $4,866.01.
Both coins took a hit Thursday, however, after July's wholesale inflation data came in much hotter than expected. Bitcoin was lower by 3.7% at $118,045.99 while ether fell 4.1% to $4,532.27.
The initial gains were sparked by Tuesday's cooler-than-expected July inflation report, which had lifted investor optimism for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve at the end of its September policy meeting. The coins rallied with the stock market for two days. On Wednesday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also scaled new records.
Adding to the choppy moves Thursday were comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said late afternoon in a social media post that bitcoin forfeited to the federal government would be used to form the strategic bitcoin reserve President Donald Trump established back in March.
Bessent added that the U.S. Treasury will explore ""budget-neutral pathways to acquire more Bitcoin to expand the reserve.""
For the week, bitcoin is on pace for a 1% gain, while ether has rallied 12%. Ether flipped bitcoin as the crypto market leader in June, gaining 85% since then thanks to heavy institutional buying, tightening supply and adoption from corporate accumulators – all under the backdrop of a friendlier regulatory environment for the crypto industry. Jake Kennis, analyst at Nansen, said the rally likely has more room to run given the flows remain strong.
""Bitcoin hitting a fresh all time high and ETH being on the verge of doing so means we've moved from speculative mania to a phase where institutional adoption, real-world integration, and global liquidity are driving price discovery,"" said Ben Kurland, CEO at crypto research and trading platform DYOR.
""The fact that both assets are on the verge of breaking records in tandem signals broad market conviction, not just a single-asset rally,"" he added. ""Momentum this strong rarely burns out instantly, but it also tends to draw in latecomers who can fuel volatility. Right now the story is less about euphoria and more about validation. Crypto is graduating from 'alternative' to 'essential' in the global portfolio mix.""",a26a0a36e2f1ef22bb314ba056071fd2,trafilatura,2391,0

A decade ago, Druker and OHSU took on a challenge to raise $500 million for cancer research, and the Knights signed on to match the raise dollar-for-dollar.
""We are grateful for the opportunity to invest in the next stage of the Druker-led revolutionary vision of cancer research, diagnosis, treatment, care, and some day, eradication,"" Phil and Penny Knight said in a statement. ""We couldn't be more excited about the transformational potential of this work for humanity.""
Knight's fortune stems from his success with the swoosh, the company he founded in 1964.
Originally called Blue Ribbon Sports, the business began humbly, with Knight selling sneakers out of the trunk of his car, as he recounted in his 2016 memoir, ""Shoe Dog.""
Nike went public in December 1980 and quickly became the most dominant sneaker brand, partnered with some of the top athletes across sport.
During Knight's tenure at the public company, from its IPO to his June 2016 retirement, Nike shares soared almost 30,500%.
Although Nike stock has had a painful few years, down more than 50% from its peak in late 2021, it remains the most valuable public company in athletic footwear, valued at more than $110 billion.
The Knights are regularly found on lists of top philanthropists. In May, Time Magazine estimated their lifetime giving at $3.6 billion, including $370 million gifted in 2024 alone.
According to the Knight Foundation's latest tax documents the foundation held more than $5 billion in assets at the end of 2023.
""I wanted to build something that was my own, something I could point to and say: I made that. It was the only way I saw to make life meaningful,"" Knight said in his 2016 memoir.
Correction: The headline on this story has been updated to correct that Phil Knight is donating to Oregon Health and Science University's Knight Cancer Institute. A previous version misstated the institution.",1ad490b2dad416ad485a093360e786c3,trafilatura,2376,0

Narrowing the focus, YUM’s underperformance is also apparent compared to the AdvisorShares Restaurant ETF (EATZ). The exchange-traded fund has gained about 16.6% over the past year. However, YUM’s gains on a YTD basis outshine the ETF’s 1.5% returns over the same time frame.
On Aug. 5, YUM shares closed down more than 5% after reporting its Q2 results. Its adjusted EPS of $1.44 did not meet Wall Street expectations of $1.45. The company’s revenue was $1.9 billion, matching Wall Street forecasts.
For the current fiscal year, ending in December, analysts expect YUM’s EPS to grow 9.3% to $5.99 on a diluted basis. The company’s earnings surprise history is mixed. It beat the consensus estimate in two of the last four quarters while missing the forecast on two other occasions.
Among the 27 analysts covering YUM stock, the consensus is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on nine “Strong Buy” ratings, and 18 “Holds.”
This configuration is more bullish than two months ago, with eight analysts suggesting a “Strong Buy.”
On Aug. 6, Gregory Francfort from Guggenheim reiterated a “Buy” rating on YUM with a price target of $167, implying a potential upside of 17.5% from current levels.
The mean price target of $160.65 represents a 13.1% premium to YUM’s current price levels. The Street-high price target of $185 suggests an ambitious upside potential of 30.2%.

(Reuters) -Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com is going all out to build its instant-delivery business to diversify revenue, but breaking into the competitive industry is proving difficult.
The company has poured billions into JD Takeaway, the food-delivery unit it launched in February, to cut reliance on a core retail business hit by a weak economy and tough competition.
Its results on Thursday showed the service has lifted its user base, traffic and revenue, with both quarterly active customer growth and shopping frequency up more than 40%.
But it is struggling to take market share from long-established incumbents Meituan, the industry leader, and Alibaba's Ele.me.
Daily active users in JD's delivery business have fallen steadily since peaking in mid-June, slipping more than 13% week-on-week by July 27 versus a 6% drop and a 1% gain in the previous two weeks, M Science data showed.
The data signals ""a significant loss of momentum for JD.com, and likely market share loss"", M Science analyst Vinci Zhang said.
""Meituan and Alibaba already have considerable domain expertise in food delivery, and I don't think JD has expertise in that area yet. It will be very challenging,"" Zhang said.
JD.com's food delivery investments have also squeezed profitability. Its adjusted operating margin shrank to 0.3% in the June quarter from 4% a year ago.
Meituan's daily orders across food and retail goods reached an all-time high of 120 million. The company holds nearly 70% of the delivery market, Morningstar analysts said in May.
Alibaba's Taobao instant commerce business combined with Ele.me reached 80 million daily orders early in July, with daily active users crossing 200 million.
Company executives have warned of fierce competition, with the three companies together pledging nearly 200 billion yuan ($27.87 billion) in recent months to subsidize instant delivery, sparking an ""instant retail"" price war that has drawn regulatory scrutiny.
""The competition started to intensify since July,"" JD.com CEO Sandy Xu said on Thursday, adding the company was focused on improving its platform to attract more users, merchants and riders.
Meituan and Alibaba are yet to report quarterly results.

With the integration of iwoca's lending service, users can now submit loan applications directly through Teya's app and web portal.
The loan amounts range from £1,000 to £1m, with repayment terms spanning from one day to up to 60 months.
According to the company press release, the application process for these loans is entirely paperless, and customers will not be charged for repaying their loans ahead of the agreed schedule.
The alliance is said to be significant, as projections from the SME Expert Index suggest an upward trend in the demand for financial services by SMEs, with 76% of finance brokers anticipating an increase in the coming period.
Teya product director Siddhartha Ram said: “This partnership is another step in our journey to build truly useful financial services for small businesses.
“Whether it’s payments, accounts or funding - our aim is to give business owners the tools they need to thrive, with none of the complexity.”
iwoca chief commercial officer Colin Goldstein stated: “Teya shares our belief that small businesses should have quick and uncomplicated access to the finance they need to grow. Working together, we can reach even more business owners and ensure that capital is available when and where it’s needed most.”
This announcement follows the recent research conducted by iwoca, which indicated a growing inclination among finance brokers to recommend non-traditional lenders over conventional banks.
A key factor influencing this trend is the desire for more rapid decision-making in the loan approval process, as cited by 73% of brokers.

The company said its long-running collaboration with SOMPO Holdings is expanding under a new multi-year agreement via Palantir Technologies Japan KK.
The companies will deepen use of Palantir’s Foundry platform across multiple SOMPO subsidiaries, where thousands of staff already rely on the software daily.
The partners detailed broader adoption in Japan spanning elder care, insurance claims and underwriting workflows.
Since 2020, SOMPO has deployed Foundry in care facilities to coordinate services for seniors, streamline required reporting to authorities and surface urgent patient needs more quickly.
The insurer is now pushing the platform deeper into its core operations, rebuilding the claims process end-to-end, from fraud screening and triage to continuous monitoring, to lift efficiency and accuracy.
SOMPO is also leaning on Palantir-enabled AI agents to evaluate risk and generate recommendations for underwriters.
The company expects these tools to improve annual financial results by about $10 million through better decision support and faster cycle times.
“Our partnership with Palantir has brought the best-in-class artificial intelligence software to our subsidiaries across Japan,” said Mikio Okumura, Group CEO of SOMPO Holdings.
“Palantir Foundry continues to grow in importance across all sectors of our business. This software continues to increase our efficiency and profitability and will play a major role in the future of our business.”
The latest arrangement marks the second expansion of the relationship, following a $50 million add-on signed in 2023.
Palantir said the joint venture in Japan will continue to serve as the hub for future deployments across SOMPO’s businesses.
Earlier this month, Palantir reported second-quarter revenue of $1.004 billion, beating analyst estimates of $939.71 million. The company reported second-quarter adjusted earnings of 16 cents per share, beating analyst estimates of 14 cents per share.

Bond yields and the dollar advanced after the data print, sending bullion as much as 0.8% lower. Swap traders now are pricing in about an 85% chance the US central bank will reduce rates in September after fully pricing in the move a day earlier.
Bullion typically benefits in a lower-rate environment as it pays no interest.
Gold has climbed 27% this year, with the bulk of those gains occurring in the first four months. It has been supported by heightened geopolitical and trade tensions that have spurred haven demand, while central bank purchases have also underpinned its strength.
Spot gold was 0.5% lower at $3,338.34 an ounce at 2 p.m. in New York. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.4%. Silver fell, while palladium and platinum gained.

The report, commissioned by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, reveals how the expansion of digital services and the data centres that support them impacts energy consumption in the UK.
The research introduces a comparative approach that evaluates energy consumption across the entire delivery chain for both digital and physical services.
This includes the energy used by data centres, transmission networks, and end-user devices for digital services, as well as manufacturing, transportation, retail operations, office-based service delivery, and end-user devices for physical alternatives.
The study moves beyond traditional analyses that often isolate individual system components or focus solely on carbon emissions.
Three specific use cases examined in the report include video streaming versus Blu-ray discs, eBook reading versus printed books, and AI-powered translation versus human translation.
For each scenario, energy consumption was calculated under low, medium, and high assumptions. The findings indicate that for all three use cases, the digital options are either on par with or significantly less energy-intensive than the physical alternatives.
The methodology employed by the study is designed to isolate the energy use attributable to the service itself, disregarding any increase in activity that might result from digitalisation, such as cost reductions or labour redeployment.
This approach aims to compare energy use in a hypothetical scenario where digitalisation does not contribute to economic growth.

The agreement is expected to provide “benefits” to the Kakarra Part B Native Title Group while allowing Global Lithium to proceed with the development and operations of the project.
These include various work streams and necessary approvals related to the definitive feasibility study and the mining lease application, which are expected to reach significant milestones by the end of the calendar year.

Chen acknowledged the efforts of the legal and commercial teams from both sides for their collaboration throughout the negotiation process.
The Manna lithium project is recognised as the third-largest lithium resource in the Eastern Goldfields region, with a mineral resource estimate of 51.6 million tonnes at a grade of 1% lithium oxide.

In the most recent quarter, the rising coffee chain posted 6.1% same-store sales growth, an acceleration from the first quarter, as it opened 31 stores in 13 states.
""We're in a great place from a value proposition standpoint ... the size of our drinks, the prices of our drinks, customers are feeling really good about what they're getting from Dutch Bros,"" CEO Christine Barone told Yahoo Finance.
""We are in growth mode,"" Barone said. ""In the next couple of years, you can expect a lot of growth out of us.""
The company has plans to open 2,029 stores by 2029, and currently operates more than 1,000 stores in 18 states. Dutch Bros stock has gained over 30% in 2025.
""Dutch Bros’ robust second quarter should dispel the narrative that a stabilizing competitor in Starbucks would eat into Dutch’s momentum,"" William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia wrote in a note to clients.
Broader competition has also been heating up across the fast food space, with Yum Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell opening more of its Live Más Café concept stores and McDonald's (MCD) expanding its beverage menu.
""We've been around since 1992, we grew up in the Pacific Northwest ... we are certainly no stranger to lots of competition,"" Barone said, adding, ""There will always be new competitors coming into the market.""
Growth in the second quarter at Dutch Bros compares to six straight quarters of US same-store sales declines at Starbucks, which reported US sales fell another 2% in its latest quarter.
""When you look at the same-store sales, plus the store growth, it's clear that Dutch Bros is gaining share from Starbucks,"" TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said.
Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol, who was named CEO on Aug. 13, 2024, told Yahoo Finance last month that the company has ""made progress"" on its value proposition over the last three quarters, but needs to continue those efforts.
On Tuesday, Baird analyst David Tarantino upgraded Starbucks to Outperform from Neutral as he expects ""visibility"" of its turnaround plan to ""become increasingly clear over the next several quarters.""

""Municipal bonds have struggled year to date on a price basis,"" Mahn said about the price action due to elevated issuance. ""What we see over the remainder of the year is less issuance.

Narrowing the focus, WM has also underperformed the VanEck Environmental Services ETF’s (EVX) 16.2% uptick over the past 52 weeks and 15.6% YTD return.
On Jul. 28, WM delivered better-than-expected Q2 results, which led to a 3.4% rise in its share price on the following day. The company’s operating revenue improved 19% year-over-year to $6.4 billion, exceeding consensus estimates by 1.4%. Moreover, due to organic revenue growth, continued cost discipline, and an optimized business mix, its adjusted EBITDA grew 18.9% from the year-ago quarter to $1.9 billion, while its adjusted EPS of $1.92 advanced 5.5% annually, topping analyst expectations by 1.6%.
For the current fiscal year, ending in December, analysts expect WM’s EPS to grow 4.3% year over year to $7.54. The company’s earnings surprise history is mixed. It surpassed the consensus estimates in three of the last four quarters, while missing on another occasion.
Among the 22 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a ""Moderate Buy” which is based on 12 “Strong Buy,” one ""Moderate Buy,"" and nine “Hold” ratings.
This configuration is more bullish than three months ago, with 10 analysts suggesting a “Strong Buy” rating.
On Jul. 30, Sabahat Khan from RBC Capital maintained a ""Hold"" rating on WM with a price target of $234, implying a marginal potential upside from the current levels.",077fac6915a5e53ef9f808404c229197,trafilatura,2282,0

Financial terms of the transaction remain undisclosed.

Its Coral platform is known for its role in managing marine war insurance risk, aiding insurers and brokers in the assessment and mitigation of risks within international shipping lanes.
Pole Star Global will integrate Clearwater Dynamics' real-time vessel risk monitoring as well as marine insurance capabilities into its existing portfolio.
The Coral platform's real-time risk assessment tools are set to complement Pole Star Global's maritime intelligence services, according to a press release from Pole Star Global.

Pole Star Global CEO Bob Skea said: “This acquisition is a natural extension of our vision.
“Clearwater Dynamics brings the same real-time intelligence to vessel operators and marine underwriters and brokers, creating a seamless, data-rich ecosystem that spans the operational, regulatory and insurance layers of maritime risk.”

Following the results, Goldman Sachs analyst Kate McShane reiterated the Sell rating on the company, with a price forecast of $43.
McShane said they expect a positive market reaction to the stronger-than-expected second-quarter results but noted that the larger-than-anticipated reduction in fiscal year 2025 earnings per share guidance, due to higher interest expense, could offset that optimism.
The analyst said they will monitor quarter-to-date trends and the company's outlook for the remainder of fiscal year 2025.
They will also look for updates on the turnaround plan, tariff impacts, supply chain consolidation, inventory levels, pricing conditions, and the health of the DIY consumer, including any signs of demand deferral or trading down.
In addition, the analyst will assess expectations for same-SKU inflation, margin performance, and the free cash flow outlook.
Upside risks include stronger-than-expected same-store sales growth, supported by DIFM share gains and a rebound in DIY sales. Faster-than-anticipated expense reductions could also lift margins above expectations.
This would improve visibility toward a more sustainable margin recovery.

The cryptocurrency mining company aims to raise a total of $24.5 billion of its common stock. The announcement marks a dramatic expansion of its common stock sale, for which the company had already made $4.5 billion worth of its shares available to investors.
Under the sale, Bitmine Immersion's common stock shares will go for $0.0001 each.
It is unclear what percentage of Bitmine's stock sale proceeds will go toward purchasing ETH.
A company representative did not immediately reply to Decrypt's request for comment on the matter.
Bitmine Immersion's expansion of its common stock sale comes as a growing number of publicly traded firms establish Ethereum treasuries, fueling a resurgence in the cryptocurrency's price.
Sharplink Gaming, BitMine and EtherMachine and Bit Digital largely began pivoting to accumulating massive amounts of Ethereum as a corporate strategy to lift shares of their stocks, adapting the playbook of Michael Saylor's software firm Strategy, which is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. The companies’ holdings could soon account for 10% of all Ethereum in circulation, according to one Standard Chartered analyst.
And as publicly traded companies snap up greater amounts of Ethereum, the layer-1 token's price has skyrocketed.

This upgrade is designed to offer efficient offshore well stimulation services, incorporating Halliburton's Octiv digital fracturing services to optimise equipment performance and operational efficiency.

Honeywell International’s stock prices plummeted 6.2% in a single trading session following the release of its mixed Q2 results on Jul. 24.

This was primarily supported by double-digit growth in defense & space and UOP organic sales. Overall, its net sales increased 8.1% year-over-year to $10.4 billion, surpassing Street expectations by 3.3%. Meanwhile, its adjusted EPS grew 10.4% year-over-year to $2.75, exceeding the consensus estimates by 4.2%.
However, these positives were overshadowed by an 8.6% decline in free cash flows to $1 billion. Also, Honeywell’s operating margins contracted by 30 bps to 20.4%, making investors jittery.
For the full fiscal 2025, ending in December, analysts expect HON to deliver an adjusted EPS of $10.57, up 6.9% year-over-year. Further, the company has a robust earnings surprise history. It has surpassed the Street’s bottom-line projections in each of the past four quarters.

Sources also suggested the deal could be valued at around €1bn ($1.2bn), although they caution that discussions are ongoing and may not necessarily materialise into a deal.
The potential acquisition is part of Mercedes-Benz's review of its business operations.
Both BNP Paribas and Mercedes-Benz have refrained from commenting on the matter.
Earlier this year, the company had previously reached out to prospective buyers to assess interest in Athlon, a division it acquired in 2016 from Rabobank for around €1.1bn.
Through its subsidiary Arval, BNP Paribas is already engaged in the vehicle leasing market.
Bloomberg News noted that Mercedes-Benz has faced challenges in maintaining profitability amid a cooling demand for its vehicles, particularly in China, and slower growth in Europe.
The report added that these issues have been compounded by tariffs introduced by the US on European auto imports, prompting the company to adjust its profit outlook.
Last month, Arval extended its partnership with CaixaBank Payments & Consumer, a subsidiary of Spain's CaixaBank, until 2030.
This partnership is focused on the development of mobility solutions with an emphasis on sustainability and financial product innovation.

Kwon, 33, dubbed by some as “the cryptocurrency king,” entered the plea in Manhattan federal court.
According to a plea agreement signed by Kwon and prosecutors, the government said it will not seek a prison term of more than 12 years as long as Kwon complies with the deal's terms, even though federal sentencing guidelines would have recommended a prison term of about 25 years. Sentencing is set for Dec. 11.
Authorities said investors worldwide lost money in the Singapore crypto firm Terraform Labs’ $40 billion cryptocurrency crash. Kwon co-founded the company in 2018.
The May 2022 collapse came after the company claimed that TerraUSD was a reliable “stablecoin.”
TerraUSD was designed as a “stablecoin,” a currency that is pegged to stable assets such as the dollar to prevent drastic fluctuations in prices. However, around $40 billion in market value was erased for the holders of TerraUSD and its floating sister currency, Luna, after the stablecoin plunged far below its $1 peg.
Kwon was extradited to the United States on Dec. 31 from Montenegro after his March 23, 2023, arrest while traveling on a false passport in Europe.
As part of his plea to one count of conspiring to commit commodities fraud, securities fraud and wire fraud and a second count of wire fraud, Kwon also agreed to forfeit over $19 million, an amount that authorities said reflected ill-gotten proceeds. He'll also lose his interest in Terraform and its cryptocurrencies.
His lawyer, Sean Hecker, said the plea meant that Kwon had accepted responsibility for making false and misleading statements to investors.
In a statement, the lawyer said his client ""takes responsibility for misleading the Terra community.”
In a news release, U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said Kwon “used the technological promise and investment euphoria around cryptocurrency to commit one of the largest frauds in history.”
He said investors around the world suffered billions of dollars in losses.",a77322c578ddec6356aca9d64685a41c,trafilatura,2180,0

Ethereum (ETH) is trading in the $4,300–$4,400 range. This is very close to its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878 reached in November 2021.
A number of analysts have commented that the market conditions are right for a potential retest of the level as soon as today, with strong technical momentum and increased institutional buying.
Institutional activity is adding to the bullish outlook.
Top crypto market commentator VirtualBacon pointed out that on August 8, about $460 million flowed into ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs), compared to a lower liquidity Bitcoin flow of $400 million.
He also noted that ETF and treasury-owned ETH have increased from $24 billion in July to $33 billion, reducing available supply on exchanges to its lowest level since 2016.
On August 12, BlackRock bought over $12 billion worth of ETH. Moreover, Bitmine Immersion is soliciting $20 billion to acquire additional ETH, as per an SEC filing.
The recent rally for Ethereum above the $4,000 benchmark is a turning point given that the asset has struggled to break out of this price point historically, said crypto analyst AlejandroBTC.
Join the discussion with CryptoWendyO on Roundtable here.
Meanwhile, analyst Benjamin Cowen argues that while ETH could run to the prior all-time highs, a September pullback is in the charts.
As per TradingView, ETH's price has been in a steady uptrend through August, with ETH's Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) — a commonly used momentum indicator — showing a strong bullish crossover.
When an upward price momentum is occurring, the MACD is said to have a bullish crossover when the blue ""MACD line"" crosses above the orange ""signal line,"" while the histogram bars go positive.
As of press time, ETH is trading around $4,501.43, up 5.4% in the past 24 hours, with daily trading volume at $51.53 billion. However, the asset is still shy of its previous all-time high of $4,891.70 by nearly 8%.

Analyst Nick Lai downgraded the Chinese electric vehicle company to neutral from overweight and lowered his price target by $5 to $28. His new target suggests the stock — which is up 3.8% year to date — still has 12.4% potential upside from Wednesday's close. ""We revise down Li's 2025/26 volume and earnings estimates by ~10-20%, largely to reflect intensifying competitive dynamics facing Li's BEV business,"" Lai said, adding that the stock is ""fairly valued at current levels"" in his view. Behind Lai's downgrade is his belief that Li Auto will see more conservative volume in the second half of the year and beyond as competition rises in the company's target battery electric vehicle, or BEV, market. LI 1Y mountain Li Auto stock performance over the past year. ""We upgraded Li to OW in Feb-25 as we expected the company's attempt to re-enter the BEV market would be successful, driving both volume and share price upside in 2H25-2026 (after the failure of ""Mega"" MPV in 2Q24),"" Lai said. ""At the same time, we note competing models — especially NIO's ONVO L90 SUV — have attracted meaningful traffic and orders compared with i8, based on our recent visits to both Li Auto and NIO stores in Shanghai and Shenzhen, which we didn't anticipate,"" he continued. Li Auto recently introduced the i8, its six-seater SUV starting at around RMB 349,000. While its price and specs met expectations, the company swiftly cut the price of the vehicle one week after its initial launch in response to customer feedback. In September, Lai expects the company to launch its i6 five-seater all-electric SUV, which is expected to start between RMB 240,000 and RMB 250,000. Both the i8 and i6 will compete with rivals offering similar-priced SUVs, the analyst said. He pointed to potential competition from BYD's SUV in the Dynasty Tang series expected to launch by the end of the year, as well as Nio's Onvo L80 slated to launch by the fourth quarter of this year or early 2026 among other expected releases from Chinese brands.

The S&P 500 closed above 6,400 for the first time ever amid a broad stock market rally on Tuesday as Wall Street digested fresh inflation data.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose about 1.1% or nearly 500 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped nearly 1.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) also added around 1.4%. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite closed at record levels.
The small-cap Russell 200 Index (^RUT) also soared amid rate-cut optimism, rising nearly 3% on the day.
The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that ""core"" inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose 3.1% over the past year in July, ahead of June's 2.9% increase. The reading indicated that rising goods inflation is no longer being offset by easing services inflation.
But on a headline basis, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.7% year over year, matching June and coming in softer than economists' expectations of a 2.8% rise.
After the inflation report's release, bets jumped on a Fed rate cut in September. Around 94% of traders expect that outcome, according to the CME Group.
The report was the first major piece of economic data to be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics after Trump fired Erika McEntarfer as commissioner earlier this month, following the release of the July jobs report. Late Monday, Trump announced that he nominated E.J. Antoni, chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, to lead the agency.
Investors will get two more pulse checks on the state of the economy later this week, with the release of the Producer Price Index on Thursday and retail sales data on Friday.
In corporate news, Intel (INTC) stock gained over 5% after CEO Lip-Bu Tan met with Trump, who had called for Tan's resignation just last week.
After the meeting, Trump posted to Truth Social calling the meeting ""a very interesting one"" and hailing the CEO's ""success and rise"" as ""an amazing story.""

West Texas Intermediate dropped near $63 a barrel in muted summer trading, near last week’s two-month low. Trump extended for another 90 days a truce that was set to expire Tuesday. US inflation data, meanwhile, bolstered speculation the Federal Reserve will soon be able to cut interest rates.

Absent any major drivers, traders are looking to the summit between Trump and Putin later this week for signs sanctions on the major oil producer will be eased, although the US president on Monday downplayed expectations for a deal to end the war in Ukraine.
The aggregate trading volume of global benchmark Brent is well below its daily average — suggesting traders are exercising caution as they seek further insight into the oil market’s outlook. Prices are down by more than 8% this month after trade and geopolitical tensions eased, while many analysts anticipate a supply glut later this year.
Meanwhile, the US government now expects domestic oil production to fall next year, reversing years of output growth. The EIA also estimated the supply glut would increase to 1.7 million barrels a day in 2026. Looking ahead, the International Energy Agency will release its report on Wednesday.

XRP gains 2.81% in the 24-hour period ending August 13 14:00, moving from $3.20 to $3.29 within a $0.13 range (3.89% volatility). The advance peaks at $3.33 at 13:00 on 193.90M volume — more than double the daily average of 81.50M — marking heavy institutional participation.
The late-session window from 13:07–14:06 sees aggressive two-way trade: price rallies from $3.27 to $3.32 on 11.30M volume before dropping to $3.26 on 14.00M as large holders take profits. Price closes the session at $3.28, holding above $3.20 support.
News Background
Ripple’s settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has removed a multi-year compliance overhang, unlocking greater corporate treasury flexibility. The ruling has triggered short-term positioning from existing stakeholders, though on-chain data shows limited new wallet growth despite price strength.
Price Action Summary
• XRP gains 3% from $3.20 to $3.29 in August 12 15:00–August 13 14:00 window
• Session high of $3.33 on 193.90M volume confirms institutional flow
• Support holds at $3.20; resistance locked at $3.32-$3.33
• Profit-taking drop from $3.32 to $3.26 highlights supply zone selling
Market Analysis and Economic Factors
The rally reflects ongoing large-holder accumulation after the regulatory resolution, with flows concentrated between $3.20-$3.30. However, resistance at $3.33 has capped advances, prompting quick reversals on heavy volume as profit targets are hit. Market sentiment remains constructive while price holds above $3.20.
Technical Indicators Analysis
• Support: $3.20 (volume-backed buying)
• Resistance: $3.32-$3.33 (institutional profit-taking zone)
• Intraday range: $0.13 (3.89% volatility)
• Volume spikes above 193.90M show peak institutional participation
• Sharp reversal patterns signal tactical rebalancing by large holders
What Traders Are Watching
• Breakout attempts above $3.33 toward $3.40
• Durability of $3.20 support in next profit-taking cycle
• Impact of sustained corporate treasury flows post-settlement
• On-chain signs of fresh institutional entry",af13e9baf4701728f8225812cdf0a359,trafilatura,2096,0

The 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.58% through Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac data, down from 6.63% a week earlier. Meanwhile, the average 15-year fixed mortgage rate was 5.71%, from 5.75% a week earlier.
Rates continued to move lower after fresh inflation data furthered Wall Street’s conviction that the Federal Reserve will cut benchmark interest rates in September. Mortgage rates aren’t directly controlled by the Fed, but they do move in response to expectations about future interest rate policy.
After spending much of 2025 stuck in a narrow range between 6.6% and 6.8%, mortgage rates are falling now after hiring data released in early August showed weak job growth in recent months. In response to the job weakness and data showing inflation in July was still sticky, but below economists’ expectations, traders see a 91% chance of the Fed dropping interest rates by 25 basis points next month.
Read more: When will mortgage rates go down?
While lower rates provide some relief to prospective homebuyers, they might not move much lower from here, Chen Zhao, head of economics research at Redfin, said in a statement.
“The mortgage rates that buyers can lock in today have already priced in the likelihood that the Fed will cut rates on Sept. 17,” Zhao said. “That means that mortgage rates are unlikely to drop any further when the Fed actually makes the expected cut. And the window to snag a mortgage rate in the mid-6s may be limited: Increased rate volatility is expected in the coming weeks as new economic data is released.”
So far, recent rate drops have done little to bring homebuyers off the sidelines, though refinancing activity did tick up. Refinancing applications jumped 23% through Friday from a week earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Purchase activity, meanwhile, saw just a 1% increase week over week.

(Reuters) -A growing number of U.S. companies are seeking more flexible covenants in their credit agreements to increase their debt loads while avoiding approvals from all their existing lenders, according to a new report by ratings agency Moody's Ratings.
Moody's said in a report released on Thursday that U.S. corporate borrowers with weaker credit profiles were leaning harder on their lenders to get more flexibility in agreements to take out more debt without full consent from existing lenders, as they struggled to issue new debt in public markets.
Deals with covenant changes that ensured a boost to a company's capacity to raise more debt - whether for opportunistic purposes or to avoid liquidity crunches - amounted to as much as 40% to 300% of their EBITDA, according to Moody's.
Such dramatic debt load increases present a major credit risk to existing lenders, especially when borrowers' private equity sponsors use the added debt for dividend recaps, add-ons and acquisitions, the ratings agency noted.
Borrowers on several recent deals have sought more flexible covenants to allow this greater debt capacity, it said, adding that 10%, or nine of 89 credit agreements, have done so between the start of 2024 and May 2025.
All of the 10% involved PE-backed borrowers, the report noted. They included the initial proposed term sheets for debt that was funding PE firm Turn/River Capital's leveraged buyout of IT systems provider SolarWinds in March, and KKR's leveraged buyout in May of derivatives market software provider OSTTRA.
These recent deals point to a growing trend of borrowers' ""unfettered access"" to debt, even those in financial distress, Moody's highlighted, as lenders in the public debt market face ever fiercer competition from lenders in the expanding private credit market.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) -U.S.-based beef-packers will continue to reel from low cattle availability for about three or four quarters, with gradual improvements of the U.S. cattle herd happening gradually from late 2027, JBS managers said on Thursday.
In remarks made after releasing second quarter results, the world's largest meat company said other factors affecting its U.S. beef operation, which accounts for about a third of its net sales, include the U.S. closure of its border with Mexico in May due to a flesh-eating parasite.
""The Mexican situation is obviously relevant,"" said Wesley Batista Jr, who leads JBS' U.S. operations.
The Mexican and the U.S. governments are in talks for potentially reopening the border, he said, estimating around 1.1 million head of feeder cattle cannot go through at this point.
Other operating challenges in the U.S. for the company include the pork business, which has been heavily hit since U.S. President Donald Trump started a trade war with Beijing.
Restrictions on Brazilian chicken exports from China and the European Union, enforced since May after a bird flu outbreak in the world's largest poultry exporter, are also weighing on JBS, which in June created a dual U.S.-Brazil listing.
CEO Gilberto Tomazoni estimated that if sanitary trade barriers are not removed, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of its Brazil Seara prepared foods division may be impacted by around 1.5%.
Seara's margins, however, remained in the double digits despite bird flu-related disruptions in the second quarter.
Bolstered also by strong results from JBS' poultry processor Pilgrims Pride, the firm, now listed in New York, posted record overall net sales of $21 billion while net profit rose nearly 61% to $528.1 million in the second quarter.

MUNICH (Reuters) -Financial investor General Atlantic has tendered its 2.4% stake in German media group ProSiebenSat.1 to Czech investment company PPF, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.
By taking PPF's cash offer of 7 euros ($8.17) per share for ProSieben, General Atlantic is going against the endorsement of ProSieben's management for a higher rival offer by MFE-MediaForEurope , which would be partly paid in MFE shares, indicating that MFE faces some difficulties in its bid for control over ProSieben.
General Atlantic, PPF, MFE and ProSieben all declined to comment.
ProSieben last week recommended that shareholders accept MFE's latest public takeover offer, abandoning its resistance to the Italian group, which is controlled by the Berlusconi family.
ProSieben said at the time that MFE's sweetened offer, which values the company at more about 1.8 billion euros, showed a continued commitment from the Italians and could deliver 150 million euros in annual savings.
PPF previously said it would not raise its offer in response to MFE's sweetened bid.
MFE's pursuit of ProSieben is part of plans to create a European television company to challenge U.S. streaming giants such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.
MFE's per-share bid is comprised of 4.48 euros in cash and 1.3 of its own shares, giving an implied value of around 8 euros per ProSieben share, based on Tuesday's close.
PPF, the second-biggest investor in ProSieben, has stated it aims to double its ProSieben stake to 29.99% with its all-cash bid.
The acceptance periods for both PPF's and MFE's offer end on Wednesday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management ended the first quarter more bullish on companies across different sectors and geographies, a securities filing showed on Thursday, after betting against Chinese companies previously as the Trump administration considered imposing tariffs.
Burry, known as the ""Big Short"" investor for his prescient calls ahead of the 2008 U.S. housing market crash, placed bets that benefit from a rise in share prices. The call options convey the right to buy shares at a set price in the future.
The investor bought call options on Chinese companies Alibaba and JD.com, Dutch semiconductor supplier ASML Holding and on some U.S. names, such as cosmetics company Estee Lauder, Lululemon Athletica, Meta Platforms, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, UnitedHealth Group, and VF Corp.
Scion's portfolio also included long-only positions in Bruker Corp, Estee Lauder, Lululemon, Regeneron, and UnitedHealth.
Burry's second-quarter portfolio contrasts with bets against Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com and PDD Holdings in the first quarter, ahead of Trump's announcement of high levies on goods imported from China.
The securities filing does not indicate Burry's current holdings.
After the S&P 500 dipped to its lowest point in almost a year on April 8 following Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement, U.S. stocks recovered.

The 2-year Treasury yield climbed 4 basis points to 3.73%. The benchmark 10-year note yield added nearly 5 basis points to 4.285%.
One basis point is equal to 0.01%, and yields and prices move in opposite directions.
The producer price index, a measure of wholesale U.S. inflation, climbed 0.9% in July on a month-over-month basis. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected PPI to increase 0.2% month over month.
That report throws cold water on another inflation report that came out earlier in the week indicating some softening in consumer prices. The July consumer price index eased concerns that tariffs may be causing prices to increase rapidly.
Despite the higher inflation number, fed funds futures were still pricing in about 93% odds of a rate cut in September, according to the CME's FedWatch Tool. This was only slightly lower from the day prior. The futures, however, did remove any chance of a half-point cut.
Those inflation readings come ahead of the Fed's annual gathering of the world's central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, from Aug. 21-23, sponsored by the Kansas City Fed, which will influence future monetary policy decisions.
""Next week the Kansas City Fed are hosting their annual economic policy symposium in Jackson Hole in Wyoming, which has historically often been used for the Fed to signal policy shifts,"" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note.
""It was last year that Chair Powell said that the 'time has come for policy to adjust,' just weeks before they cut rates for the first time since the pandemic.

Another impressive top-line beat by Aurora Cannabis Inc. (Nasdaq: ACB) should have investors fired up.
The company reported a 17% revenue increase in its first fiscal quarter, mostly driven by a strong performance in the Global Medical Cannabis Market. ACB continues to outperform in key European markets with higher sales in Germany, Poland, and the UK.
Poland, after facing some regulatory headwinds in the past, is now back on track and can’t get enough of the ACB high-potency medical products.
While gross margins improved for medical cannabis and consumer cannabis segments, elevated SG&A costs led to a decrease in net income. Many of these expenses look temporary and related to the integration of recently-acquired MedReleaf Australia.
Management has also reiterated that EBITDA is expected to grow in the near-term with increasing operational efficiencies and a higher-margin sales mix. Of course, some variable costs will rise with increased sales, but we expect profitability to improve in coming quarters.
ACB is differentiated in the industry by free cash flow generation and an strong balance sheet. Notably, all cannabis operations are run completely debt-free and ACB maintains C$186 million in cash and cash equivalents.
And the last puff: ACB still trades at a discount compared to peers on an EV/EBITDA multiple and its own 3-year mean price/sales multiple.

MUMBAI (Reuters) -A Reserve Bank of India committee has recommended a framework for developing AI capabilities for the country's financial sector, while safeguarding it against associated risks, according to a report released on Wednesday.
The committee has recommended setting up a digital infrastructure to help build indigenous AI models and a multi-stakeholder standing committee to evaluate risks and opportunities.
It also suggested building a fund to incentivise the development of homegrown AI models tailored for the needs of India's financial services sector.
""The report envisions a financial ecosystem where encouraging innovation is in harmony, and not at odds, with mitigation of risk,"" the RBI said in a statement.
The report contains 26 recommendations under six categories including infrastructure, capacity, policy, governance, protection and assurance.
Other key recommendations by the eight-member committee headed by Pushpak Bhattacharyya, a computer scientist at IIT Bombay, include issuing of an enabling framework to integrate AI with existing digital public platforms such as instant payment system UPI, and designing audit frameworks.
The central bank had set up the committee in December to develop a Framework for Responsible and Ethical Enablement of Artificial Intelligence (FREEAI) for the finance sector.
""The challenge with regulating AI is in striking the right balance, making sure that society stands to gain from what this technology has to offer, while mitigating its risks,"" according to the report.

Apple said the redesigned feature is coming to some Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 users on Thursday. The update was possible because of a recent U.S. Customs ruling, the company said.
In 2023, the International Trade Commission found that Apple's blood oxygen sensors infringed on intellectual property from Masimo, a medical technology company. Apple paused the sale of some of its watches and began selling modified versions of the wearables without the blood oxygen feature.
""Apple's teams work tirelessly to create products and services that empower users with industry-leading health, wellness, and safety features that are grounded in science and have privacy at the core,"" the company said in a release announcing the feature rollout.
CNBC has reached out to Masimo for comment.
Users who do not currently have the feature will be able to access it by updating their iPhone to iOS 18.6.1 and their Apple Watch to watchOS 11.6.1, Apple said. Users will be able to see their results in the Respiratory section of the Health app.
Apple has been pushing deeper into health care in recent years.

The initiative will be managed by Coinbase Asset Management and begins with deployments on Aave, Morpho, Kamino and Jupiter, according to a blog post.
The exchange first launched the program in 2019 to help protocols seed early trading pools for USDC stablecoin. That effort supported early platforms like Uniswap (UNI), Compound (COMP) and dYdX (DYDX) and helped spearhead USDC in the DeFi ecosystem, which is still the most widely used stablecoin in the sector.
In its new iteration, the initiative will allocate capital across both established and emerging protocols, aiming to ensure users can access stable yields and efficient markets.
While Coinbase has not disclosed the size of the fund or specific amounts for each deployment, a company spokesperson told CoinDesk it will test placements across multiple networks before scaling further. Currently, the fund provides capital in USDC and EURC, Circle's euro-pegged stablecoin, the company added.
Coinbase's move comes as the DeFi sector's growth is accelerating amid red-hot crypto markets and easing regulatory headwinds in the U.S. There are almost $200 billion of assets held across DeFi protocols collectively, nearly doubling since April but still below its 2021 peak, DefiLlama data shows.

The news offset better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, driven by demand for Coach bags.
Tapestry (TPR) shares slumped 15% Thursday after owner of fashion brands gave a weaker-than-expected outlook as it warned it would take a significant hit from new tariffs.
The parent of the Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman brands expects fiscal 2026 earnings per share (EPS) of $5.30 to $5.45, which includes the ""negative impact of incremental tariffs and duties of over $0.60."" The midpoint of the range was below the $5.42 consensus projection of analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha.
The company added that gains in operating margin would be ""offset by a negative tariff and duty impact of approximately 230 basis points,"" or $160 million.
The news came as Tapestry reported it set a fourth-quarter revenue record of $1.72 billion, and posted adjusted EPS of $1.04. Both exceeded estimates.
The gains were driven by sales of Coach, which jumped 14% year-over-year to $1.43 billion. Kate Spade sales dropped 13% to $252.6 million, and sales at Stuart Weitzman fell 10% to $45.5 million.
Shares of Tapestry closed at an all-time high yesterday, and even with today's selloff they're up nearly 50% year-to-date.

The July U.S. Consumer Price Index rose 0.2%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economist forecasts had been for 0.2% and June's pace was 0.3%.
On a year-over-year basis, CPI was higher by 2.7% against 2.8% expected and 2.7% previously.
Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.3% from the prior month, compared with forecasts for 0.3% and June’s 0.2% gain. On a yearly basis, core CPI increased 3.1%, versus expectations of 3% and June’s 2.9%.
The data likely isn't far enough off from forecasts to lower expectations for a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut as soon as September, with market-implied odds at 84% before the release, according to CME FedWatch. Fifteen minutes following the mixed numbers, those odds had risen to 90%.
Ahead of the report, bitcoin (BTC) was trading near $118,500, as traders hedged downside risks with short-dated put options. In the minutes after the release, BTC rose very modestly to just under $119,000.
A check of traditional markets finds U.S. stock index futures on the rise following the CPI, with the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 each ahead about 0.6%. The dollar has softened a bit and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield dipped three basis points to 4.26%.

Valentino reached a mutual agreement with Venturini to terminate his employment and board roles effective Wednesday as he ""has decided to take a break for personal reasons"", the brand said in an announcement seen by Reuters.
Venturini, previously executive vice president of merchandising at Gucci, became CEO at Valentino in June 2020. Valentino had said in June that he was on sick leave, after media reports of his imminent departure from the business which reported declining revenue and profit last year.
Valentino, founded in Rome in 1960 by Valentino Garavani and Giancarlo Giammetti, is part-owned by French luxury conglomerate Kering, which bought a 30% stake in the label from Qatari fund Mayhoola for 1.7 billion euros in 2023, with a commitment to buy the rest by 2028.
Mayhoola and Kering did not reply to Reuters requests for comment about Venturini's departure.
Last month, Mayhoola denied a newspaper report that the two shareholders were considering selling Valentino. Kering declined to comment at the time.

The Consumer Price Index rose 0.2% last month, easing from a 0.3% gain in June and broadly in line with economists' expectations, while annual inflation came in slightly below forecasts, according to data released on Tuesday.
The brokerage expects two more 25-bp reductions, in December 2025 and March next year, but said a 50-bp cut next month is unlikely as ""The labor market is slowing, but there are few signs of stress, and broader financial conditions remain easy.""
The brokerage also lowered its core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) estimate to 0.243% for July, from 0.325%, citing softness in segments such as prescription drugs and software.
Traders, on average, are pricing in 60.4 bps of Fed rate cuts by the end of the year, with a 94.2% probability of a 25-bp reduction in September, according to data from LSEG and the CME Group's FedWatch tool.
Other top brokerages, including J.P.Morgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo retained their stance, for a September rate cut.

The discount, previously limited to fresh produce and general merchandise such as apparel, now extends to almost all food categories — including milk, meat, dry grocery, and seafood — in stores and online, effective immediately.
Walmart, the largest private employer in the United States, had previously extended its grocery discount during the holidays, but the perk will now be available year-round, the company said.
""We've heard your feedback that these savings make a real difference for you and your families,"" Donna Morris, Walmart’s chief people officer, wrote in the letter.
Morris said the extension of the discount card program, first introduced more than 50 years ago, was among the company’s most requested benefits.
The company has also raised wages for U.S. hourly workers and launched a bonus program for about 700,000 front-line staff over the last couple of years to help retain workers.
The Wall Street Journal first reported on the extension of the discount program.

The request comes after at least two unsolicited bids were recently submitted by groups including affiliates of hedge fund Elliott Investment Management and commodities house Vitol, even after the court officer had recommended a different bid by a unit of miner Gold Reserve.
The court-organized auction of the seventh largest U.S. refiner to pay creditors for past debt defaults and expropriations in Venezuela has suffered delays amid parallel legal cases by creditors in pursue of the same assets, procedure complications and disagreements.
The adjournment requested by court officer Robert Pincus is supported by some bidders and creditors in the auction, while Gold Reserves is opposed to it, according to the filing.
Pincus plans to submit this week an updated proposal on how to proceed with the sale hearing, he told the court.

An ancillary piece of equipment of the refinery's fluid catalytic cracking unit caught fire and led to the production outage, the sources said. The cause of the fire was not immediately clear.
The refinery is expected to resolve the issue over the coming days and return to full production, one of the sources said.
Phillips 66 declined to comment on refinery operations.
Bayway produces around 155,000 bpd of gasoline and is one of the largest suppliers of fuel on the U.S. East Coast.
The Bayway refinery was partially shut last month after rainstorms caused a power outage at the plant, resulting in a brief spike in prices for refined products at the New York Harbor as Phillips 66 made up for the outages by buying fuel on the open market.
