Each of those visas allows for a maximum stay of six months, though some extensions are permitted in certain cases.\nThe Trump administration said the program's purpose is to reduce visa overstays in the U.S. and is a direct response to President Donald Trump's January executive order \"Protecting The American People Against Invasion.\"\n\"The Pilot Program is a tool of diplomacy, intended to encourage foreign governments to take immediate action to reduce the overstay rates of their nationals when traveling to the United States for temporary visits, and to encourage countries to improve screening and vetting and the security of travel and civil documents, including in the granting of citizenship,\" the rule said.\nVisa applicants will be required to provide a bond of $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000 as a condition of it being issued, and the amount will be determined by consular officers based on each person's circumstances. This can include, the administration said, \"any information provided by the visa applicant on the visa application or in the visa interview regarding the alien's purpose of travel, current employment, income, skills, and education.\"\nRead more from NBC News:\nThese requirements will only apply to countries that the State Department identifies as having records of high visa overstay rates, based on data collected by the Department of Homeland Security.

Trump told CNBC that he will announce his tariff plan for semiconductors \"within the next week or so.\" Additionally, he will impose \"a small tariff\" on pharmaceutical imports before ratcheting it up to 250% within a year and a half.\nThe U.S. president doesn't look like he's backing down from his feud with the central bank, either. Days after the Fed chose to hold interest rates, Trump discussed his potential candidates to replace Jerome Powell as Fed chair. Among those contenders are former Governor Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett, the National Economic Council director. \"Both Kevins are very good,\" Trump said.\nWhichever Kevin — or \"other people that are very good, too,\" in Trump's words — assumes the role when Powell's term ends in May 2026 (or is truncated earlier, depending on Trump's moves), they would have to help prop up an economy that seems to be slowing, as indicated by July's startling jobs report and ISM Services index.\nWhat you need to know today\nSemiconductor tariffs in the works. In an interview with CNBC, Trump said he will announce new tariffs on semiconductors as soon as next week. He also said he'd impose a \"small tariff\" on pharmaceuticals before raising it to as high as 250%.\nTrump has four candidates for Fed chair. While the president didn't reveal their identities, he said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has taken himself out of consideration.\nMajor U.S. stock indexes pull back. Stocks retreated Tuesday on ISM data that indicated the services sector nearly shrank in July. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index added 0.15%, but European semiconductor stocks fell on Trump's tariff comment.\nAMD's earnings fall short of expectations. That's despite the chipmaker reporting second-quarter revenue that beat Wall Street estimates. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices lost more than 6% in extended trading.\n[PRO] Topping expectations might not be enough. Even though the S&P 500 is on track for second-quarter earnings growth of almost double digits, compared with a year earlier, investors are giving a muted response, according to Goldman Sachs.\nAnd finally...\nRussia's economy 'stinks,' Trump says, and lower oil prices will stop its war machine\nThe rift between Moscow and Washington looks set to deepen. \"Putin will stop killing people if you get energy down another $10 a barrel. He's going to have no choice because his economy stinks,\" Trump, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday.\nThe comments come after relations between Moscow and Washington, which remained cordial at the start of Trump's second term in office despite the ongoing war, soured in recent weeks.\n— Holly Ellyatt", "content_hash": "8da4472a0b9f95a6d8a78e8583a98a61", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The H100 is among the U.S. chipmaker's most cutting-edge chips used in artificial intelligence applications.\nThe Department of Commerce has placed such chips under export controls since 2022 as part of broader efforts by the U.S. to restrict China's access to the most advanced semiconductor technology.\nThis case demonstrates that smuggling is a \"nonstarter,\" Nvidia told CNBC. \"We primarily sell our products to well-known partners, including OEMs, who help us ensure that all sales comply with U.S. export control rules.\"\n\"Even relatively small exporters and shipments are subject to thorough review and scrutiny, and any diverted products would have no service, support, or updates,\" the chipmaker added.\nGeng and Yang's California-based company, ALX Solutions, had been founded shortly after the U.S. chip controls first came into place.\nAccording to the DOJ, law enforcement searched ALX Solutions' office and seized phones belonging to Geng and Yang, which revealed incriminating communications between the defendants, including those about evading U.S. export laws by shipping sensitive chips to China through Malaysia.\nThe review also showed that in December 2024, ALX Solutions made over 20 shipments from the U.S. to shipping and freight-forwarding companies in Singapore and Malaysia, which the DOJ said are commonly used as transshipment points to conceal illicit shipments to China.\nMeanwhile, the department said that ALX Solutions was not paid by entities they purportedly exported goods to, instead receiving numerous payments from companies based in Hong Kong and China.\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security and the FBI are continuing to investigate the matter.\nGeng and Yang have been charged with violating the Export Control Reform Act, a felony that carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in federal prison. Yang was also found to be residing in the U.S. illegally after overstaying her visa.\nThe smuggling of advanced microchips has become a growing concern in Washington. According to a report from the Financial Times last month, at least $1 billion worth of Nvidia's chips entered China after Donald Trump tightened chip export controls earlier this year.\nIn response to the report, Nvidia had said that data centers built with smuggled chips were a \"losing proposition\" and that it does not support unauthorized products.\nIn response to pressure from the U.S., Malaysia said last month that it would begin requiring trade permits for advanced AI chips sourced from the U.S.", "content_hash": "1536f7923cbef073cad3e77d82649f50", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Good luck Syria,\" Trump said.\nLess than three months later, the Trump administration hit Syria with the highest tariff rate of any country in the world: 41%.\nSyria has very little trade with the U.S. because of long-held sanctions, but some trade between the two does exist. In 2023, Syria exported $11.3 million worth of goods to the U.S., according to the Observatory for Economic Complexity, and imported $1.29 million worth of American goods, technically giving the U.S. a trade deficit with the impoverished Middle Eastern country.\nTrump says the levies his administration imposes — which were based on a widely criticized calculation applied to each country in April using trade deficit figures — are meant to address trade imbalances. He has not commented specifically on the case of Syria.\nBut as it faces the specter of rebuilding its devastated state after 13 years of war under a new government with a very shaky hold on power, the country needs all the help it can get, regional analysts say — not further punishment.\n\"After years of devastating civil war, the country is in urgent need of substantial foreign direct investment to begin the long and difficult process of reconstruction and development,\" Giorgio Cafiero, CEO of risk consulting firm Gulf State Analytics, told CNBC.\n\"While the recent lifting of many U.S., U.K., and EU sanctions was a welcome development for Damascus' economic ambitions, Washington's imposition of steep tariffs now threatens to restrict any potential for meaningful trade with the United States.\"\nA collapsed state\nSyria had been designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. government since 1979. U.S. sanctions were imposed on the country in 2004 and again in 2011, after the regime of then-President Bashar Assad launched a brutal crackdown on anti-government uprisings.\nIn the roughly 14 years since, the country has been devastated by civil war, sectarian violence and brutal terrorist attacks, with the Islamic State taking over parts of the country in 2014 and a subsequent Western-led bombing campaign to eradicate the extremist group.\nThe toppling of the Assad regime during a shock offensive by anti-Assad militia groups in December 2024 stunned the global community and brought about the prospect of a new beginning for the devastated country. Syria's new President Ahmed al-Sharaa — a former al-Qaeda member who describes himself as reformed — currently leads the country's transitional government.\nSyria remained under myriad international sanctions, but those imposed by the U.S. were the most severe, as they applied to third parties as well, deterring other countries and groups from transacting with the country.\nMost recently, since Trump's official lifting of sanctions in June, Syria has hosted delegations from several countries including the U.S. and wealthy Gulf states pledging support and investment for reconstruction. At the same time, it's been beset by outbursts of sectarian violence in different parts of the country and volleys of Israeli bombings.\nMore than two-thirds of Syria's electricity grid is non-functional, according to aid organizations, with major cities like Aleppo and Damascus facing blackouts for more than 20 hours a day. In many rural and conflict-ridden areas, there is no power at all.\n\"This isn't an economy that is struggling as much as it's an economy that seems to be almost constantly over the last few months, on the verge of collapse, unless very active steps are taken in order to buttress it and give it a chance to recover,\" said H.A. Hellyer, a senior fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London.\n\"So any step that deviates from that, I think, is very dangerous.\"\nQatar recently announced a project by which its development fund will purchase gas and provide it to Syria — transported via Azerbaijan and Turkey — to support more than 5 million people, with the expectation of improving daily power supply by as much as 40%.\nFahad Al-Sulaiti, the director general of Qatar Fund for Development, described how Damascus will need to lean heavily on aid from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Nations — particularly now that tariffs will harm the possibility of developing beneficial trade ties with the U.S. He also said Qatar was in close contact with the U.S. government to enable support for Syria.\n\"We work very closely with our partners in the United States. That's why from day one ... we work very close with the Treasury Department ... we're taking with them to create a good economic system,\" Al-Sulaiti told CNBC.\nA 'leash' on Syria's new government?\nEconomic observers note that the 41% tariff itself will have little actual impact on Syria's devastated economy, since bilateral trade between the two countries is so negligible.\n\"But the symbolism behind this decision carries far greater weight than the trade figures suggest,\" Cafiero said.\n\"The fact that Syria was singled out for the highest tariffs — even after the easing of most sanctions — sends a clear and calculated message from the Trump administration: Washington is willing to loosen its economic grip on a post-regime change Syria, but only under conditions defined by the White House.\"\nOne interpretation, Cafiero suggested, is that the tariffs could be a way to pressure Damascus into normalizing relations with Israel, which has been attacking and occupying parts of Syria.\n\"In this sense,\" he said, \"the economic policy resembles a kind of 'leash,' designed to be adjusted in response to the political behavior of the al-Sharaa government and broader developments on the ground.\"\nSecurity analysts warn that instability in parts of the country could tip it back into outright war and far greater humanitarian crisis if it does not get the support — economic, humanitarian and diplomatic — that it needs.\nU.S. envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, has expressed his and Washington's full support for Syria and the Al Sharaa government, and recently announced U.S. and Qatari-backed investment initiatives into the country.\nIt is not clear whether he supports his administration's imposition of tariffs on the country; the State Department and White House did not respond to CNBC requests for comment.\nUltimately, the tariffs themselves may have limited immediate economic consequences, but \"their psychological and diplomatic impact should not be underestimated,\" Cafiero cautioned. \"My read is that they reflect Washington's intent to retain leverage over Syria's future.\"", "content_hash": "b20b4229cd8f163d3fc8ed5d9b711c4a", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

As such, the RBI would switch its stance to \"neutral\" from \"accommodative.\"\nThis means that the Monetary Policy Committee, which is the RBI's key decision-making body, will carefully assess the \"incoming data and the evolving outlook to chart out the future course of monetary policy,\" Malhotra said.\nAnalysts at Bank of America said in a July 28 note that the RBI \"took away the punchbowl from the markets\" by delivering an early, aggressive cut. They expect the central bank to pause for now, and further policy support will only be deployed if there is a major shift in the macroeconomic outlook.\nHowever, the BofA analysts left the door open for a possible rate cut later this year — likely in the fourth quarter of 2025 — once the GDP growth outlook becomes clearer.\nThe RBI also maintained its GDP growth forecast for its financial year ending March 2026 at 6.5%, but cut its inflation forecast to 3.1%, down from its previous projection of 3.7%.\nIndia's latest inflation reading still looks supportive for a rate cut, with the headline inflation rate in June hitting a fresh six-year low of 2.1%.\nThe RBI's Monetary Policy Committee also said on Wednesday that the near-term inflation outlook has \"become more benign than anticipated earlier,\" while inflation in 2025 is expected to remain significantly below the central bank's target of 4%.\nMeanwhile, India's economy expanded at a faster-than-expected annual rate of 7.4% in the quarter ended March, sharply higher than the 6.7% growth forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.\nThat quarter marked the end of India's 2024-25 fiscal year, which registered an overall economic growth of 6.5%, in line with the government's estimate.", "content_hash": "f4b0187fe048372d39761d313bbf2127", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

We now really have a solid foundation.\"\nThe growth in streaming has recently started to help to supplant the losses of the cash cow traditional TV business, which has been bleeding customers for years now.\nDisney shares were down 2% in premarketing trading Wednesday.\nHere is what Disney reported for the quarter ended June 28 compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG:\n- Earnings per share: $1.61 adjusted vs. $1.47 expected\n- Revenue: $23.65 billion vs. $23.73 billion expected\nNet income for the quarter was $5.26 billion, or $2.92 per share, more than double the $2.62 billion, or $1.43 a share, that the company reported for the same period last year. Adjusting for one-time items, primarily related to tax benefits associated with Disney's purchase of Comcast's Hulu stake, Disney reported earnings per share of $1.61.\nDisney's overall revenue rose 2% to $23.65 billion, missing analyst expectations for the first time since May 2024.\nThe company reported continued growth in its streaming business despite headwinds in the traditional TV bundle, which has suffered from declining customers.\nDisney upped its fiscal 2025 guidance on Wednesday and now expects adjusted EPS of $5.85 – an increase of 18% from fiscal 2024. In May, Disney issued guidance for expected full-year adjusted EPS of $5.75.\nStreaming, parks, ESPN results\nRevenue for Disney's experiences segment, which includes theme parks, resorts and cruises as well as consumer products, increased 8% to $9.09 billion. Domestic theme parks revenue was up 10% to $6.4 billion, in particular as there was an increase in spending at theme parks and higher volumes in passenger cruise days and resort stays.\nJohnston told \"Squawk Box\" on Wednesday that Walt Disney World had its \"biggest\" third quarter ever, adding that traffic at the Orlando, Florida, park was solid.\n\"I know there's a lot of concern about the consumer in the U.S. right now. We don't see it. Our consumer is doing very, very well,\" he said.\nInternational parks and experiences revenue was up 6% to about $1.7 billion. In May, Disney announced it reached a deal to bring a theme park and resort to Abu Dhabi. The expansion into the United Arab Emirates is not part of the earlier Disney pledge to spend $60 billion on theme parks over the next decade.\nMeanwhile, revenue for Disney's entertainment segment, which includes traditional TV networks, direct-to-consumer streaming and films, was up 1% to $10.7 billion.\nWhile revenue for the direct-to-consumer streaming business rose 6% to $6.18 billion, the entertainment segment as a whole was weighed down by the traditional TV business, which saw revenue dip 15% to $2.27 billion.\nThe direct-to-consumer streaming business was lifted, however, by the company's flagship service, Disney+, which added 1.8 million subscribers, bringing its total to nearly 128 million. Total Hulu subscribers grew 1% to 55.5 million.\nThe company said it expects a modest increase in Disney+ subscribers in its fiscal fourth quarter compared with its fiscal third quarter. Total Disney+ and Hulu subscriptions are expected to increase more than 10 million during the current period.\nDisney also raised its operating income expectation for direct-to-consumer streaming to $1.3 billion for fiscal year 2025.\nDomestic revenue for ESPN increased 1% to $3.93 billion, while its domestic operating income dropped 7% to $1.01 billion. Those results were impacted by higher programming and production costs, particularly due to NBA and college sports rights.\nESPN on Tuesday announced a deal with the NFL in which the pro football league will take a 10% stake in the company.\nAnd separately on Wednesday, ESPN announced that its forthcoming full-service streaming app will launch on Aug. 21 and that WWE live events are coming to the app and in some cases to the linear ESPN network.\nJohnston said he expects the new streaming service to be \"accretive to overall earnings growth.\"\nThe traditional TV business once again dragged down the entertainment unit. Total operating income for the linear networks – which includes broadcaster ABC as well as pay TV channels like FX – fell 28% to $697 million, impacted by a decline in advertising revenue due to lower viewership and rates.\nDisney's theatrical unit, comprised of content sales and licensing, suffered from tough comparisons to the year-earlier period, which saw the release of \"Inside Out 2.\" The Pixar movie was the highest-grossing animated movie ever, surpassing Disney's \"Frozen II.\"\nThe division reported an operating loss of $21 million for the most recent period, compared with operating income of $254 million in the same period last year.\nRevenue for the unit was up 7% to $2.26 billion during the quarter, as Disney released \"Elio,\" \"Thunderbolts*\" and \"Lilo & Stitch.\" The original animated film \"Elio\" set a record low for the Pixar animation studio, notching just $21 million in ticket sales during its first three days in theaters.\n– CNBC's Robert Hum contributed to this report.\nDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of CNBC.\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct that Disney raised its operating income expectation for direct-to-consumer streaming to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2025.

Like what you see? You can subscribe here.\nHello, I am Anniek Bao, a Singapore-based reporter writing about China's economy and business, filling in for Evelyn this week. Welcome to another edition of The China Connection.\nThis week, I look at how businesses eyeing China's $644 billion baby-care market are meeting a new generation of parents — shaped by modern parenting values and spending habits.\nThe big story\nFrom makers of baby strollers to coding apps, Chinese companies are facing a new kind of customer: the Gen Z parent, with different ideas about raising children and spending on them.\nChina's young parents are digital-natives, have a global outlook and prefer experiential learning. That mindset is shaping how — and where — they spend.\n\"When you have younger, more digital, international and cosmopolitan parents, their spending patterns are very different [from those of older generations],\" said Joe Ngai, chairman of Greater China at McKinsey & Company. Many now prioritize children's experiences, such as golf lessons and ski trips, he added.\n\"We are seeing more spending on the per-kid level, [creating] a more premium market,\" said Ngai. Businesses catering to enrichment programs, extracurricular activities and family-centered travel are set to benefit the most, he said.\nFor businesses selling baby formula, cribs, or maternity wear, lower fertility rates have been a drag on growth, still China in 2024 saw nearly three times as many newborns as the U.S. — a scale that makes its baby-care sector a prize too big to ignore.\nThe baby-care and maternity market was estimated to reach 4.63 trillion yuan (about $645 billion) in 2025, representing around 7% annual growth rate, according to an industry report by iResearch in February.\nThe initial boost from Beijing's stimulus will likely be seen in baby-care and maternity products, before expanding into areas such as pediatric healthcare, early childhood education, insurance products tailored to minors, and technology services designed to support family life.\n\"Think strollers and formula today, but pre-K, private tutoring and family travel tomorrow — all the way to digital learning tools [such as coding apps] and smart parenting apps,\" said Han Shen Lin, Shanghai-based China Country Director at business consultancy The Asia Group.\nDemanding and selective\nParents are also becoming more selective and demanding when it comes to what they buy.\nBefore committing to a product, the younger Chinese parents tend to spend more time comparing options, scrutinizing details and seeking out peer reviews online, said Andy Li, principal at Oliver Wyman in Shanghai. \"New parents have become more discerning.\"\nThat has raised the bar for brands as it's no longer enough to offer quality, companies must also explain why their products stand out.\n\"How to differentiate your proposition, your products against other players in the market has been a major challenge,\" Li said, noting that giving parents more transparency into what they are buying, especially when it comes to nutrition ingredients, will drive first purchase, ensure retention and brand loyalty.\nThat heightened awareness plays into long-standing concerns over product safety in China — an issue still resonating with Chinese parents nearly two decades after an infant formula scandal in 2008.\n\"For middle-class families still haunted by the 2008 infant formula scandal, many continue to choose foreign brands,\" said Yaling Jiang, a China-focused independent consumer analyst.\nIn a sign of how quickly public sentiment can shift, driven by the tech-savvy parents, some domestic baby-care brands raised prices days after Beijing rolled out new family subsidies, drawing a swift backlash on social media.\nThe price of one brand of baby wipes jumped from 39 yuan on July 31 to 119 yuan on Aug. 1, according to Manmanmai, an e-commerce price tracker, while a local formula powder's price leapt more than 50% in days.\nYoung parents accused companies of \"ripping off the subsidies\" before the money had even arrived, with some calling for boycotts. Several brands have since apologized, describing the increases as periodic adjustments.\nBut that backlash highlights a generational shift: Gen-Z parents are value-driven, social media-savvy and quick to call out brands they believe cross the line.\nBeijing's push\nIn a first for the country, China last month launched a nationwide child-rearing subsidy program, handing out 3,600 yuan ($503) a year for every child under three. It was the first time Beijing extended such subsidy for the firstborn child, with past measures targeting couples with second or third child.\nThe government is betting on the subsidy to reduce the financial strain of parenting and ease what it calls the \"fertility anxieties\" of young couples.\nSeparately, Beijing on Tuesday announced tuition fees waiver for children in their final year at public preschools and some private kindergartens, starting as soon as the upcoming fall semester.\nThe measures supplement China's efforts to reduce childcare costs at a time when the country is staring at a demographic crisis, fueled by a slide in birth rates.\nChina has seen three consecutive years of population decline, and seven consecutive years of birth rate declines, with a modest rebound in 2024. Muted birth rates also stem from an alarming drop in marriage rates, which fell to the lowest level in almost half a century last year with just 6.1 million new couples.\nBirths dropped to 9.7 million last year — a little over half from the 18.8 million in 2016 — when China scrapped its one-child policy that had restricted the size of families, according to Economist Intelligence Unit's estimates based on official data, while the fertility rate is just above 1.0.\nFertility rate refers to the average number of children a woman would have in her lifetime.\nIn recent years, China has raised its birth quota to three per couple, introduced tax breaks for childcare and moved to curb after-school tutoring costs. Local officials have tested even bolder incentives, from 10,000 yuan first-baby bonuses in Inner Mongolia to monthly stipends for larger families in Shenyang.\nBut experts say financial incentives alone aren't enough to change minds, particularly among educated women in urban cities, who have continued to face tough choices between career progression, high childcare cost and the burden of eldercare.\nMillennials and Gen Zs are also part of the so-called \"sandwich generation,\" balancing care for both aging parents and young children. \"When you've still got elderly parents to support because there's not a particularly supportive pension system, then a lot of your incomes going up there, rather than, starting your own family,\" said Harry Murphy Cruise, head of economic research at Oxford Economics.\nThe cost of raising a child until they are 18 relative to per capita GDP is around 6.3 times in China versus 4.11 times in the U.S., according to a population research think tank.\nHiring help in tier-1 cities like Shanghai has also been priced out of reach for most dual-income households, said Asia Group's Lin.\n\"For highly-educated, single millennial and Gen Z women who haven't had children, there's a growing awareness of the mental and physical burdens that come with marriage and childbirth,\" said Jiang.\nThe 3,600 yuan subsidy only covers the cost of about 10 cans (800 to 900 grams each) of infant formula, she pointed out.\nFor now, Beijing's bet is that a little extra cash in parents' pocket — and the spending it triggers — might at least give the country's birth rates a short-term boost, even if it doesn't produce a baby boom.\nTop TV picks on CNBC\nGeorge Chen, partner and co-chair of digital practice at The Asia Group, said that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is following Apple CEO Tim Cook's playbook in navigating U.S.-China tensions.\nNeil Thomas from Asia Society unpacked what matters most to China's President Xi Jinping and why he's seemingly absent on a global stage.\nWinnie Wu, chief China equity strategist of BofA Securities, explained why she thinks investors shouldn't chase the recent rally in the China markets.\nNeed to know\nChina's BYD posted its first decline in monthly deliveries. In July, the leading Chinese EV maker shipped 341,030 units, around 10% lower than 377,628 in June. Domestic competitors Li Auto and Nio also recorded a drop in deliveries.\nNvidia denies China's accusation that its chips have a 'kill switch.' The Cyberspace Administration of China said last week that it needed Nvidia to provide documents on what it called vulnerabilities in the firm's H20 AI chip, which is targeted at the Chinese market.\nChinese text-to-video AI models are topping scoreboards. TikTok parent ByteDance hold the first and third spots in research firm Artificial Analysis' top-ranked text-to-video generative AI models, while Beijing-based Kuaishou's Kling AI ranks fifth.\n— Yeo Boon Ping\nIn the markets\nMainland China and Hong Kong stocks inched higher amid mixed trading in the region as investors digested fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump.\nMainland China's CSI 300 is up 0.18%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index — which includes major Chinese companies — had gained 0.17% as of 12:19 p.m. local time (12:19 a.m. ET).

Cotton asked what measures were taken to address those concerns.\nHe also asked whether Intel's board required Tan to divest from chip firms in China linked to the Chinese military or Communist Party, and if Tan adequately disclosed other ties to Chinese companies due to Intel's involvement in the Secure Enclave program, an initiative designed under the Biden administration to ensure a secure supply of microelectronics for defense.\nBecause of Intel getting federal funding under the initiative, Cotton questioned Yeary in the letter about Tan's disclosures related to investment, professional roles or other ties to Chinese companies.\n\"Intel is required to be a responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars and to comply with applicable security regulations,\" Cotton wrote. \"Mr. Tan's associations raise questions about Intel's ability to fulfill these obligations.\"\nIn a statement, an Intel spokesperson said, \"Intel and Mr. Tan are deeply committed to the national security of the United States and the integrity of our role in the U.S. defense ecosystem.\" The company said it would address the matters in the letter with the Senator.\nIn April, Reuters reported Tan — himself or through venture funds he has founded or operates — has invested in hundreds of Chinese companies, some of which are linked to the Chinese military. The Intel CEO invested at least $200 million in hundreds of Chinese advanced manufacturing and chip firms between March 2012 and December 2024, Reuters found.\nA source familiar with the matter had at the time told Reuters that Tan had divested from his positions in entities in China, without providing further details. Chinese databases reviewed by Reuters at the time had listed many of his investments as current, and Reuters was at the time unable to establish the extent of his divestitures.\nCotton's letter mentioned the Reuters story as a source.\nCadence reaches settlements\nIt is not illegal for U.S. citizens to hold stakes in Chinese companies, even those with ties to the Chinese military, unless those companies have been added to the U.S. Treasury's Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies List, which explicitly bans such investments. Reuters in April had found no evidence that Tan at the time was invested directly in any company on the U.S. Treasury's list.\nSeparately, last week Cadence Design agreed to plead guilty and pay more than $140 million to resolve charges for selling its chip design products to a Chinese military university, Reuters reported. The institution was believed to be involved in simulating nuclear blasts.\nIn a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Cadence said it was \"pleased\" to reach settlements with the Justice and Commerce departments.\nTan ran Cadence as CEO from 2008 through 2021 and was executive chairman until May 2023. The sales to Chinese entities occurred under his leadership at Cadence, which makes design software and other tools used to create chips.", "content_hash": "95ce508f25c4abd0c217db076c0b4b11", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Blue-chip earnings\nAs earnings season continues, investors homed in on reports from two Dow Jones Industrial Average members Wednesday morning. Disney beat Wall Street's expectations for earnings per share in its fiscal third quarter, but came up slightly short on revenue. McDonald's, meanwhile, exceeded forecasts for both lines and said its same-store sales saw their biggest increase in almost two years. Stock futures are modestly higher in Wednesday's premarket as investors reacted to the latest releases. Follow live market updates here.\n2. Trump on CNBC\nIn case you missed it, President Donald Trump had a more than half-hour-long interview with CNBC on Tuesday morning. As you'd expect, it was quite newsy. He said pharma tariffs could rise as high as 250% and that his plan for semiconductor duties could come as early as next week. The president told CNBC that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent does not want to become Federal Reserve Chair, but that four other people are in the running for the job. Trump also said that JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America declined to take him on as a customer. Watch the full interview here.\n3. Nvidia's geopolitical tightrope\nAs geopolitical tensions flare up around Nvidia, the company pushed back on a key accusation from China, insisting that its chips do not include \"kill switches.\" For the non-technical, CNBC's Kif Leswing explains that a kill switch refers to a hardware function that can remotely deactivate a chip. China last week asked Nvidia for documents about what it called security vulnerabilities in the company's H20 chip. The back-and-forth comes as Nvidia navigates a tough political backdrop despite countries and businesses around the world wanting its artificial intelligence chips. For China specifically, the U.S. has slapped export controls of some of Nvidia's chips over concerns that the Asian country could gain an edge on the AI or military fronts.\n4. Meet the 'Kevins'\nPrediction markets see two men leading the pack to be Fed Chair Jerome Powell's successor — and they're both named Kevin. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh are among the names that have been floated to take on the central bank job. The pair also got a positive shout-out from Trump during his Tuesday interview with CNBC. \"I'd say Kevin and Kevin, both Kevins are very good,\" the president said. Hassett and Warsh have become the clear frontrunners on betting platform Kalshi in recent days, CNBC's Yun Li reports.\n5. A supreme CEO training ground\nWondering who will be in the next class of CEOs? Look no further than the C-suites of fast-food brands Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC, which are all owned by parent company Yum Brands. The restaurant conglomerate has for decades been considered an incubator for future industry leaders, CNBC's Amelia Lucas reports. Take current Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol, for example: Before leading the coffee chain, he had stints at both Taco Bell and Pizza Hut.\n— CNBC's Lillian Rizzo, Amelia Lucas, Annika Kim Constantino, Jeff Cox, Hugh Son, Kif Leswing and Yun Li contributed to this report.", "content_hash": "60f9fa5d455f8608d6954c109eb1e551", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

But Energy Star, a public-private partnership administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, is a lot more than that. Now it is reportedly on the chopping block as part of massive budget cuts proposed by the Trump administration.\nRoughly 2,500 builders, developers and manufactured housing firms participate in the Energy Star Residential New Construction program, which sets strict energy-efficiency guidelines required to earn its designation. Last year, more than 8,800 commercial buildings earned the Energy Star, saving more than $2.2 billion and preventing more than 5.7 million metric tons of emissions, according to the Energy Star website.\nEven more critical to property owners, Energy Star also includes a software platform that is the fundamental infrastructure for energy tracking across commercial real estate. The EPA's Energy Star Portfolio Manager tool connects utilities to landlords and then to dozens of state and municipal governments who rely on it to uphold their energy and climate policies, many of which include tax breaks and financial subsidies for energy savings.\nThe EPA announced massive job cuts and restructuring in early May, and while it didn't specifically mention Energy Star, numerous reports, citing EPA documents, say it is part of the plan.\nAn EPA spokesperson said in a statement, \"EPA is continuing to work to implement the reorganization plans that were announced on May 2, 2025. EPA will provide updates on these plans as they become available.\"\nThe agency declined to comment further.\nLandlords rely on Portfolio Manager data to maintain compliance with state and municipal regulation and to gauge energy performance of buildings in their portfolios and decide which ones need upgrades. Such upgrades could include new HVAC and lighting.\nThe tool was used by more than 330,000 buildings last year, comprising nearly 25% of all commercial building floorspace in the U.S., according to the EPA's website. Seven states, 48 local governments and two Canadian provinces currently rely on the program and its software for their energy benchmarking and transparency policies, according to the agency.\n\"There is a potential that they would defund the entire software platform. And so if the system disappears, the data disappears with it, and what this means is that that hub, that connected tissue around how utility landlord and state and municipal governments share energy data across them, that would all go away,\" said Leia de Guzman, co-founder of Cambio, a real estate operations platform.\nAt the very highest level, Energy Star Portfolio Manager supports $14 billion in energy cost savings per year, according to Guzman.\n\"If you don't have the data, you then don't have any means to understand how to deploy retrofit initiatives across your building,\" she said.\nCambio, which ingests building data in order to automate real estate operations, can tap into Energy Star data from the past and is offering building owners and managers the option to back up data that already exists. It could not, however, get future data if the EPA takes its system down.\nIndustry organizations including the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), National Apartment Association (NAA) and National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC) are fighting for the program's existence. The concern is that if Energy Star, including the Portfolio Manager, were to lose federal backing and then be managed by a private entity, costs would go up.\n\"It's a $32 million program for the government, but it provides, in terms of return on investment — it's huge,\" said Nicole Upano, director of public policy for the NAA. \"It provides hundreds of billions of dollars of savings for consumers and businesses in its current form, and if it were to be managed by an external company, that might result in a fee-based system that would increase the cost to use this program.\"\nIf Portfolio Manager were no longer a government program, Upano said, the likely result would be a complicated patchwork of compliance.\n\"As a government managed program, they don't pick a horse.They're very much focused on energy efficiency and reducing waste overall. But if, say, an external company were to manage it, they might focus on electrification over gas, or pick some sort of energy delivery system that they favor, and we would not like to see that,\" she said.", "content_hash": "93bb9affe6addf246e1324ee0ec43506", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Wall Street was heading for a higher open this morning as earnings from two Dow stocks, Disney and McDonalds , went in opposite directions. Weaker economic data as well as pharma and semiconductor tariff comments from President Donald Trump on CNBC yesterday knocked the market down Monday. 2. Disney shares dropped 1% after the entertainment giant reported a mixed fiscal third quarter. Earnings per share beat but revenue missed. Streaming grew and consumers spent more at parks. Club name Disney also announced the EPSN direct-to-consumer launch date , Aug. 21, and confirmed the ESPN-NFL deal. 3. McDonald's shares jumped 3.5% after the fast-food giant beat on second-quarter EPS and revenue. Promotions helped drive a U.S. restaurants sales rebound following two straight quarters of declines. McDonald's had a \"Minecraft\" movie tie-in and launched of the McCrispy Chicken Strips. 4. Uber matched estimates with earnings and beat on revenue. The ride and delivery company announced a $20 billion stock buyback. Pushing into self-driving and AI are big focuses for Uber, which launched its robotaxi service in partnership with Alphabet's Waymo in Austin in March. Uber stock rose 1%. 5. Snap shares sank nearly 20% after the Snapchat parent reported a revenue miss and fewer-than-expected global daily active users. Ad revenue growth of 4% is bad, well behind the quarterly growth rates of Club name Meta at 21.5%, Google at 10.4% — and especially, Reddit at 84%. 6. The 5% pullback in AMD shares is just profit-taking. Don't obsess on the impact of China restriction's on its data center growth. Melius is right to raise its price target to $205 a share from $175. Deutsche Bank keeps its hold, but raises its PT to $150. Still below where the stock is, for heaven's sake. 7. Super Micro shares dropped 17% after the high-performance servers provider missed on quarterly EPS and revenue. How much of this miss is competition from Dell ? Super Micro also issued weak current quarter guidance. CEO Charles Liang said on the post-earnings conference call that tariff mitigation efforts will bear fruit. 8. Analysts at both Morgan Stanley and Citi raised their price targets on Club name Eaton to $425. They both kept their buy-equivalent ratings as well. Both shops indicated the sell-off and the margin headwinds will abate. We upgraded the stock to our 1 rating buy after yesterday's beat and raise. 9. Arista Networks hit a home run with its quarter and the stock jumped more than 12%. The cloud networking company's current quarter guidance also exceeded expectations. Melius Research raised its price target to $160 from $137. It was the best quarter of the night. Arista just crushed it. 10. Citizens JMP raised its MNTN price target to $33 from $30 and kept its outperform buy rating. The ad tech company, which has actor Ryan Reynolds as chief creative officer, reported its first quarter as a public company last night. Adjusted EBITDA and revenue beat and so did guidance.

And discrepancies linger over the specific investment commitments.\nThe White House, however, is warning that countries whose investment commitments do not come through could face retaliation from Washington.\n\"That is what our trading partners have agreed to, and the president reserves the right to adjust tariff rates if any party reneges on their commitments,\" said a White House official who was granted anonymity in order to discuss still-evolving deals.\nEuropean Union\nIn a sign of the disconnect between the two trade partners, a fact sheet released by the White House after Trump announced a trade deal with the EU said that the bloc \"will purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and make new investments of $600 billion in the United States, all by 2028.\"\nBut a parallel sheet released by the European Commission, the executive body of the EU, notes only an \"interest\" from European companies in \"investing at least $600 billion\" in the United States. It also mentions an intent to \"procure US liquified natural gas, oil, and nuclear energy products with an expected offtake valued at $750 billion (ca. €700 billion) over the next three years.\"\nMoreover, the EU signaled last week that it does not have the authority to enforce the investments since they would come from the private sector, an area outside the European Commission's purview.\n\"The European Union and her Member States have very limited capabilities to direct private actors to make these purchases and investments,\" David Kleimann, a trade expert and senior research associate at ODI Europe, told CNBC.\n\"That's why these commitments are - and can only be - merely aspirational.\"\nJapan\nTokyo similarly described its trade deal with Washington in different terms than those Trump used.\nAs part of the deal, the White House says that Japan \"will invest $550 billion directed by the United States to rebuild and expand core American industries.\"\nJapan, on the other hand, says the deal involves a mix of investments and loan guarantees totaling a maximum of up to $550 billion, Bloomberg reports.\n\"Some people are saying Japan is simply handing over $550 billion,\" Tokyo's top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, said after the trade deal was announced. \"But such claims are completely off the mark.\"\nSouth Korea\nIn a further sign of Trump's focus on investments as a central piece of negotiations, the president suggested last week that Seoul had made Washington an offer to \"buy down\" its proposed 25% tariff rate.\nTrump said South Korea had agreed to invest $350 billion in the U.S., and as a result, it would face a 15% tariff on products, down from 25%.\nNonetheless, questions hang over the investment promise.\n\"There are still gaps between Seoul and Washington in how to structure the $350 billion joint investment fund,\" said Choi Seok-young, former ambassador to the South Korean Permanent Mission in Geneva, according to the Korea JoongAng Daily.\n\"The Korean government needs to respond with clear principles and standard,\" Choi said.\nFor South Korea, as for Japan and the EU, the investment commitments it made in a framework U.S. trade agreement are not done deals; they're just another piece of an ongoing negotiation.", "content_hash": "f73a97b3fbd33c69a2400da0c8945f49", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Through my platform, Modern Husbands, I also help couples build the systems they need to manage money and domestic responsibilities as a team.\nCouples in the most successful relationships, including my wife and I, do six things for each other without question. If you do them all, you'll be happier than most.\n1. They divide tasks by skills, not gender\nMen today face mixed signals: Be the breadwinner, but also do half the housework (and don't expect any recognition). That confusion leads to imbalance at home.\nIn our household, we assign responsibilities based on skills, passions, and goals — not gender. I manage our finances because it's my professional background. I also cook because I love it.\nWhat matters is creating a system that reflects your family's goals, not outdated roles.\n2. They complement each other's career goals\nThroughout our marriage, we have taken turns assuming the roles of \"gardener\" and \"rose.\"\nThe gardener nourishes the environment at home so the rose can blossom in their career. The gardener is the domestic safety net who handles unplanned problems. That might look like being the \"parent on call\" for doctor appointments and emergencies.\nDeliberately and thoughtfully sharing supportive roles in each other's career dreams can prevent the silent resentment that arises when one partner repeatedly makes small, unplanned sacrifices for the sake of the other's career and the household.\n3. They have regular family 'business meetings'\nJust like a weekly business meeting, having regular check-ins with your partner can change everything.\nFind a quiet time, when emotions are low and focus is high. Walk together, grab coffee, or sit down for 15 minutes to align on schedules, financial goals, and responsibilities.\nIf you want to take it further, plan annual retreats to reflect, set goals, and recommit to working as a team.\n4. They establish systems and environments that make success easier\nSuccess in a relationship shouldn't rely on constant effort. Set up systems that make good decisions the default.\nA few examples: Set joint savings goals, then automate transfers to a high-yield account at a different bank; delete spending apps from your phone; and turn off auto-fill on social media to reduce impulse buys.\nI often recommend utilizing household management systems like Fair Play to assign clear roles, promote an equitable and efficient distribution of the mental load, and prevent miscommunication. The Fair Play system consists of three key elements:\n- Conception: Generating the idea or identifying the need for a task in the household or family system.\n- Planning: Mapping out the steps, resources, and timeline needed to complete the task effectively.\n- Execution: Carrying out the task from start to finish with full ownership and follow-through.\n5. They talk about everyday life\nWe have financial and domestic labor systems for our home to give ourselves more time to spend with each other, to talk about everyday life. When we talk about our day, we put our phones away and we stick to the rule of not speaking about the business of our home.\nThe approach we like to use on our evening walks after dinner is the rose, thorn, and bud prompt. We each share the highlight of our day (rose), any issues or frustrations (thorn), and the time we spent investing in our future (bud).\n6. They keep their promises\nIt takes trust to work together to manage money and the home. Take, for instance, a spending limit that is not honored or picking up a prescription from the grocery store. Failing to follow through can have real consequences.\nContinually breaking the promise that comes with a family budget or doing chores can lead to resentment and even contempt.\nThe most important thing to remember is that great relationships aren't built on luck. They're built on shared goals and a willingness to evolve together.\nBrian Page is the founder of Modern Husbands, a company dedicated to helping couples manage both financial and home responsibilities as a team.

India is one of the biggest buyers of Russian oil, according to data from Kpler which shows total Russian crude exports amount to around 3.35 million barrels per day, of which India takes about 1.7 million and China 1.1 million.\nIn New Delhi, there must be \"confusion,\" Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group and former White House energy advisor to former President George W. Bush, told CNBC.\n\"Joe Biden went to India after the invasion of Ukraine and begged them to take Russian oil, the Indians hardly imported any Russian oil, and they begged India, 'please take the oil,' so that crude prices would remain low, and they did. Now we're flipping around and saying, 'why are you taking all this oil,'\" McNally added.\nIndustry sources in the Indian petroleum sector told CNBC the country has abided by all international sanctions, and that India is doing the global economy a \"favor\" by buying Russian oil which in turn, stabilizes prices. The sources did not wish to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.\nIndia has argued that it if it were to stop buying Russian oil, a plan must be put in place to stabilize energy markets, along with a contingency to fill the shortfall in supply if Russian barrels are taken off the market.\n\"In case India decides to cut Russian oil imports, the refineries likely would try to find alternative barrels from the Middle East, as they used to rely on those barrels until 2022. Likely other buyers would not step in,\" Giovanni Staunovo, a commodity analyst at UBS told CNBC.\nRussia is the third largest global crude producer, after the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. Moscow produces nearly 11 million barrels of oil per day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. India's Russian crude oil imports was 38% in both 2023 and 2024 and is currently 36% in 2025. Total Indian crude imports are increasing each year with rising demand, and as a result, imports of Russian crude in 2025 are their strongest annual pace yet.\nIf this supply was to be removed from the market, prices would skyrocket, according to the industry sources in the Indian petroleum sector. \"If India were to stop buying Russian crude oil today, global crude prices could jump to over $200 per barrel for all global consumers,\" an industry source told CNBC.\n\"Very near term, there is a risk of a pop in brent prices to $80 or above,\" McNally told CNBC, signaling that the impact of additional tariffs and a potential cut to Russian oil imports would be significantly less catastrophic.\nU-turn\n\"When they didn't want India to buy something, they told us,\" an industry source in the Indian petroleum sector said. This was indeed the case when India was once purchasing Iranian crude, which New Delhi no longer buys and is now sanctioned as Washington doubles down on its maximum pressure campaign against the Islamic Republic.\nHardeep Singh Puri, India's petroleum minister, last month told CNBC's Dan Murphy: \"The price of oil would have gone up to 130 dollars a barrel. That was a situation in which we were advised, including by our friends in the United States, to please buy Russian oil, but within the price cap.\"\nSara Vakhshouri, the founder and president of SVB Energy International, told CNBC the hefty duties announced by Trump are a \"negotiation tactic,\" aimed at \"reclaiming lost U.S. oil market share in India and oil export declines since 2022, and securing equivalent export of other commodity to India.\"\n\"India has always coordinated closely on US oil policy, including sanctions on Iranian oil. At the same time, for the Trump administration, energy security, affordability, and reliability are priorities\" Vakhshouri added.\nRussian crude has been placed under a price cap by the European Union since Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. That price cap, set at $60 per barrel, allows Russia to export its crude, but at a price lower than the commodity generally trades. The aim is to limit Moscow's revenue from oil exports, constricting the country's ability to finance its war in Ukraine. The policy was implemented by G7 nations, hoping to maintain a stable supply of Russian oil on the market.\nSources within the Indian petroleum sector told CNBC \"the price cap is a $1 to $2 difference\" and insists New Delhi is not buying Russian crude at a major discount per barrel.\nEven Russian LNG is not \"completely under US secondary sanctions, Europe still buys gas from Russia via pipelines and LNG. Only some Russian LNG export terminals (e.g. Artic LNG 2) are under sanctions, but not all LNG exports,\" UBS' Staunovo, told CNBC.\nIn 2021, Russia was the largest supplier of petroleum to the European Union. After the bloc's ban on seaborne imports of Russian crude, the share of imports from Moscow fell from 29% to 2% in the 2025. The EU still imports 19% of its LNG from Russia, according to data from the first quarter of 2025 from Eurostat.\nRussia is a member of OPEC plus, established alongside Saudi Arabia in 2016. The group works to stabilize oil prices, adjusting output based on market fundamentals and trends in supply and demand. A group of eight producers just moved days ago to raise output in September, fully unwinding cuts and helping calm fears of Russian supply concerns.\n\"While OPEC+ countries hold spare capacity to tackle supply disruptions, a full drop in Russian crude production/exports would see that spare capacity completely dwindling. The Biden administration was aware of this,\" UBS' Staunovo said.\nThe Russian price cap aimed \"to reduce the revenues of the Russian government by allowing Russian oil to remain in the markets and to prevent an oil price spike,\" Staunovo added, noting that these decisions were made in the run up to a presidential election in the U.S.\nNow, after winning that very election, Trump means business. Before slapping an additional 25% tariff on India on Wednesday, he told CNBC that India \"hasn't been a good trading partner.\"\nIt means that U.S. ties with New Delhi, a key security and defense partner, could be at risk. India responded sharply to Trump's criticism on Wednesday, saying it was \"unjustified and unreasonable\" and that it bought Russian oil with U.S. support.", "content_hash": "df4653a932cbec43e4e852f5f72548a4", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The company doesn't disclose national averages for listing views.\nHere are the 10 most in-demand ZIP codes in 2025, according to Realtor.com. For the rankings, listing prices and days on the market are based on the average of monthly medians from January to June 2025.\nWhy the hottest ZIP codes are mostly in the Northeast and the Midwest\nAs with previous years, the 2025 rankings for the hottest ZIP codes in the U.S. are dominated by the Northeast and Midwest, with Leominster, Massachusetts, and Ballwin, Missouri, both returning from last year's list.\nThe geographic trend is largely driven by \"buyers from high-cost metros\" like Boston or New York City, who are \"looking for relief without sacrificing access to jobs and amenities,\" says Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com.\n\"Many of these neighborhoods also offer newer homes than the surrounding areas, highlighting the critical role of new and infill construction in meeting today's buyer demand — even in a tough market,\" she says.\nWhile several ZIP codes had June median listing prices above the national median of $441,000 six of the 10 were more affordable than their surrounding metro areas, the report says. In Beverly, for example, the $719,000 median list price is significantly lower than the metro Boston median of $855,000, according to Realtor.com data, which uses June figures for ZIP-to-metro comparisons.\nIn some cases, listing prices exceed those in nearby major cities. For example, in Marlton, New Jersey, the median listing price in June was $530,000 — well above the $387,000 median in the adjacent Philadelphia metro area.\nThat's likely driven by demand from higher-income buyers seeking more space and relative value in suburban areas, while staying within commuting distance of major job centers, the analysis suggests.\nWhile the 10 hottest ZIP codes offer relative value, they also tend to attract wealthier buyers. Among the top 10 markets, median household income is nearly double the national figure, down payments are significantly larger and buyers skew older, with a median age of 56.\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

After all, that's been one of the major themes of second-quarter earnings season: results not living up to investors' lofty expectations. Broadcom is expected to report its latest results on Sept. 4. Broadcom shares are up about 28% year to date and have rallied about 10% since our previous sale in July, including a 2% bump today. This trim will help ensure we're not being too greedy. From this sale, we will realize a gain of roughly 238% on stock purchased in August and September 2023. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long AVGO. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

We think it's an opportunity. Revenue in the three months ended June 28 increased 2% year over year to $23.65 billion, missing expectations of $23.73 billion, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) in the fiscal 2025 third quarter totaled $1.61, outpacing the LSEG consensus of $1.47. On an annual basis, adjusted EPS jumped 16%. The stock dropped more than 3% in early afternoon trading. Shares entered the day up a little over 6% year to date, slightly trailing the S & P 500. .SPX YTD mountain Disney's year-to-date stock performance. Bottom line This wasn't the cleanest quarter. Disney's headline revenue and profit numbers were mixed, and it's a similar story under the hood. Nevertheless, as we dug deeper into the results, we see strength in all the parts of the business that matter most. In that way, there's a lot to like: Its direct-to-consumer streaming business continues to add subscribers and reported significantly better-than-expected profitability. The sports segment also reported better-than-expected profitability, and while ESPN revenue did decline slightly year-over-year, we think management is executing on a roadmap that will see the key business return to growth. A big part of that is a premium ESPN streaming offering set to launch later this month with features that have the potential to drive deeper engagement over time. Those include increased personalization and fantasy sports, alongside the ESPN suite of cable channels available on streaming for the first time. Its highly profitable experiences segment was the standout, outpacing expectations for both sales and earnings. Walt Disney World in Florida reported record third-quarter revenue, and the cruise business is \"doing extremely well right now,\" CFO Hugh Johnston said on the call. \"Forward bookings look great, and we're running at very high occupancies in terms of the cruise ships. In terms of thinking about bookings for experiences for the fourth quarter, right now, they're up about 6%. So, we certainly feel positively about that as well.\" Disney Why we own it: We value Disney for its best-in-class theme park business, which has immense pricing power. We also believe there's more upside in the stock as management cuts costs, expands profit margins through its direct-to-consumer (DTC) products and finds new ways to monetize ESPN. Competitors: Comcast , Netflix , Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount Global Last buy: March 10, 2025 Initiation: Sept. 21, 2021 Ultimately, we believe the House of Mouse is standing on strong ground, and members will be well-served by taking advantage of this weakness. Demand for the Disney experience remains strong, with park-goers continuing to flock to the Florida resort in record numbers despite the opening of Universal's Epic Universe in Orlando during the quarter (CNBC's parent company Comcast owns Universal). That clearly didn't dent demand. Meanwhile, Disney's sports streaming offering is going through a major renaissance that we think ultimately drives deeper engagement and complements its broader strategy on bundling . Part of that involves more deeply integrating Disney+ and Hulu content now that it owns the entirety of Hulu. The premium ESPN service will be an exciting new layer, offering cross-selling opportunities as consumers are given the opportunity to bundle a best-in-class sports and entertainment offering. We're therefore upgrading Disney shares to a buy-equivalent 1 rating and are increasing our price target to $135 apiece from $130. On Wednesday's Morning Meeting, Jim Cramer suggested that investors who want to amass, say, a 100-share stake in Disney should buy 50 shares now and build it up from there. Commentary While the chart above clearly shows mixed results, the strength came where it matters most, as discussed above. Within Disney's larger entertainment segment, direct-to-consumer is the primary focus for investors. Even though revenue was a bit light, its operating income was fantastic, coming in well ahead of expectations. It's clear that the DTC business has turned the corner and is now very much a money making business. Disney+ added 1.8 million subscribers in the quarter, exiting with 128 million total subscribers. Disney+ and Hulu exited the quarter with 183 million subscriptions, an increase of 2.6 million versus the prior quarter. On the earnings call, CEO Bob Iger said Hulu was being fully integrated into Disney+. \"This will create an impressive package of entertainment pairing the highest caliber brands and franchises, great general entertainment, kids programming, news and industry-leading live sports content, all in a single app.\" He added, \"over the coming months, we will be implementing improvements within the Disney+ app, including exciting new features and a more personalized homepage. All of which will culminate with the unified Disney+ and Hulu streaming app experience that will be available to consumers next year.\" The performance of Disney's linear networks — including the likes of ABC, Freeform, FX and its namesake Disney channel — was lackluster, but the cord-cutting dynamic is well understood on Wall Street. As a result, investors would be better served by a long-term focus that prioritizes the growth of DTC rather than the linear network woes. Disney's sports segment is all about ESPN and its ongoing revitalization efforts. Earlier Wednesday, we learned that ESPN's new streaming service will launch on August 21, include all content from the linear TV networks and cost $29.99 a month. \"The enhanced ESPN app will be a sports fan's dream, with key new features planned for launch, such as multi-view enhanced personalization, integration of stats, betting, fantasy sports and commerce, and a personalized SportsCenter,\" Iger said on the call. \"And fans with subscriptions to the Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN bundle will be able to watch ESPN content directly inside Disney+.\" We also learned Wednesday that the streaming platform has inked 5-year deal with WWE to steam the latter's premium wrestling events. Select events will also air on ESPN's linear channel. On Tuesday evening, it was announced that ESPN has reached a deal with the NFL for media assets, in exchange for a 10% stake in ESPN. Clearly management is looking to launch the new ESPN streaming service with a bang, and its decision to offer a special bundle price for the first year — $29.99 a month for Disney+, Hulu and ESPN — should provide a nice boost to overall subscriber numbers. There was plenty to like with Disney's experiences performance. In particular, domestic parks and experiences business saw a 22% growth in operating income. That was fueled by guests spending more money at its theme parks in Florida and California, coupled with positive contributions from the launch of the Disney Treasure in the first quarter of the year. With that ship now in its fleet, Disney saw higher passenger cruise days and higher occupied room nights. Iger offered updates on Disney's major investments to expand its theme parks. \"Expansion projects are underway across every one of our theme parks globally from a new World of Frozen land opening at Disneyland Paris in 2026 and to the Villains and Cars themed areas at Magic Kingdom to a Monsters Inc. area at Disney's Hollywood Studios to an Avatar themed destination at Disney California Adventure, in addition to a new theme park coming to Abu Dhabi,\" Iger said. The Abu Dhabi project was announced in May on the day of second-quarter earnings. Iger also noted that two more ships are on track to be added to Disney's cruise fleet later this year: The Disney Destiny and the Disney Adventure, which is its \"largest ship ever and the first to be docked in Asia, bringing our fleet to a total of 8 cruise ships operating around the globe,\" he said. Guidance Disney increased its 2025 guidance as follows: Now targeting adjusted EPS of $5.85, up from $5.75, which would be an 18% increase compared with the prior fiscal year. The Street was looking for full year earnings of $5.78 per share. Direct-to-consumer operating income of $1.3 billion, compared with approximately $1 billion previously. Experiences operating income to increase 8%, up from prior guidance to be grow between 6% and 8% year over year. Disney Cruise Line preopening expense of $185 million, less than the $200 million previously forecast. Equity loss from its joint venture in India is now expected to be about $200 million, down from the previous call for a loss of about $300 million. The following was reaffirmed: Entertainment operating income up a double-digit percentage versus the prior year. Sports operating income up 18% year over year.

Novo Nordisk's stock has cratered about 47% since the start of the year, as doubts emerged about the outlook for its GLP-1 drugs, Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for obesity. The company has said its business has been hurt by competition from compounding pharmacies, which are making knock-off versions of its semaglutide, the active ingredient in both brands. This prompted Novo to cut its annual forecast and oust its CEO. Lilly's business appears to be holding up much better, according to analysts. They anticipate the proof will be in the quarterly results and outlook. What's more, several analysts expect other catalysts, including next-generation drugs, to help propel Lilly shares higher. 'Potential materiality' So far this year, Lilly's stock has logged a roughly 3% decline, underperforming the market. However, catalysts could come as soon as Thursday, analysts say. \"We note that LLY's upcoming 2Q call is scheduled for 8:30am ET on Aug 7th, as opposed the company's standard 10am ET time slot for earnings calls after the market opens, suggesting potential materiality via topline trial results alongside earnings,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Asad Haider wrote in a July 28 research note. He said the report is \"the most highly anticipated near-term event\" across his pharmaceutical coverage. In addition to the financial outlook, investors are eager to hear more about orforglipron , the company's experimental GLP-1 pill. In June, at the American Diabetes Association conference, Lilly revealed the drug helped patients with type 2 diabetes in a late-stage trial lose weight without serious side effects . The readout of the phase 3 data for patients with obesity should be released soon. Wegovy's 'favored status' Analysts are also eager to hear management's thoughts on CVS Health 's policy of giving favored status to Wegovy over Lilly's Zepbound. The policy went into effect in July and means CVS Health's pharmacy benefit manager Caremark will prioritize Wegovy on its list of covered drugs. It has the potential to be a headwind for Lilly. However, patients may seek exemptions and remain on the weight loss drug or pay out of pocket on their own or via Lilly Direct, the company's direct-to-consumer website. Also, there is the possibility Lilly will strike a deal and get back on CVS Caremark's list of covered medications, analysts said. According to Bernstein analyst Courtney Breen, the first few weeks of the switch showed that patients changing from Zepbound to Wegovy was eclipsed by the number of patients starting the drug with a new prescription. On average, analysts surveyed by LSEG expect Lilly will earn $5.57 per share in the second quarter on revenue of $14.71 billion. If Lilly hits that revenue estimate, it will have achieved 30% growth year over year. Here's what else they're saying ahead of the report. LLY YTD mountain Eli Lilly shares year to date. Citigroup: Buy rating, $1,190 price target Citi analyst Geoff Meacham said Lilly remains one of its favorite stocks, and he placed a 90-day catalyst watch on it on July 30. His $1,190 price target implies 55% upside from Tuesday's close. \"GLP-1 script data from IQVIA give us continued confidence in achievability of Lilly's 2025 revenue guidance ($58B-$61B). Notably, Zepbound scripts remain robust (+45% q/q) and overall share increased to 65.5%, representing a gain of ~600bps in market share. We think this is particularly noteworthy given vials from LillyDirect now represent ~20% of TRx [total prescriptions] and highlight increasing potential for a consumer angle in GLP-1 sales … driving uptake going forward (2Q25e $3.1B; +$99M vs. BBG cons). [Type 2 diabetes drug] Mounjaro scripts rose 16.3% q/q and now captures 42.2% share (2Q25e $4.5B; +$18M vs. cons); though slower growth than Zepbound, this is expected given the more entrenched nature of the type 2 diabetes market. … Top of mind for investors will be orforglipron's phase 3 ATTAIN readouts for obesity (Jul/Aug). Weight loss of 12-15% is the efficacy bar and continuation of a squeaky-clean safety profile that we saw at ADA for ACHIEVE … will be paramount.\" Morgan Stanley: Overweight, $1,135 In early July, Morgan Stanley analyst Terence Flynn tweaked his price target, increasing it to $1,135 from $1,133. The target suggests 48% upside. \"In our view the magnitude of potential Mounjaro+Zepbound 2Q beat will dictate how LLY handles 2025 revenue guidance of $58-$61bn (MS $62.3bn vs. Cons $59.8bn), but we expect a raise of the low end at a minimum. LLY could also release Orfor Ph3 obesity and/or SURPASS-CVOT data in conjunction with earnings. … Interim Ph3 data for LLY's Kisunla in preclinical Alzheimer's (potentially later this year) could be a de-risking event for treating earlier in the disease course and expand the opportunity for the category, as well as provide lateral read-through to BIIB/Eisai's Leqembi (where Ph3 is also ongoing)\" Bernstein: Outperform, $1,100 Bernstein, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan all have a $1,100 price target for Lilly's stock, which suggests it could rise nearly 44% from Tuesday's close. \"We again see the potential for a meet or beat … , driven by Mounjaro & Zepbound performance. Given most of the street follow scripts closely in the US, the upside here arises from additional unexpected pricing (rebate adjustments), underreporting in IQVIA (a possibility), and ex-US performance (due to lower visibility). … Despite the potential for a top-line beat (we see potential for modest 1.2% beat above consensus at 14.6B), we don't anticipate LLY will be rushing to increase guidance, given last years back half challenges and the uncertainty for Q3 that remains on CVS caremark (although initial signs look strong).\" Wells Fargo: Overweight, $1,100 \"NVO lowering their guidance on Ozempic and Wegovy headwinds could be limited to NVO itself, as they cite continued compounding, competition, and slower market expansion. We believe LLY guidance can be raised on strong underlying trends. … Therefore, we would be buyers of LLY on the weakness since we expect a strong 2Q and a catalyst-rich 2H'25.\" JPMorgan: Overweight, $1,100 \"Overall, we are expecting a solid 2Q for LLY with upside to Mounjaro/Zepbound (based on strong TRx growth trends), and we estimate total sales in the qtr of $14.8bn (+$370mm vs cons). On the EPS line, we are slightly below consensus ($5.49, -$0.06) as we expect a continued opex ramp to support a growing late stage pipeline and [direct-to consumer] initiatives. Looking forward, we expect some moderation in Zepbound growth as the CVS formulary change takes effect on July 1 but expect the product to still grow TRx in 3Q and accelerate in 4Q. And for the year, our estimates are near the high end of the company's 2025 guidance on both topline ($60.8bn sales, +$1.3bn vs cons) and the bottomline ($22.09 EPS, +$0.07 vs cons) and we would not be surprised to see LLY raise guidance at some point in 2025 (although the company may take a more conservative approach on the timing/magnitude of the increases given 2024 guidance dynamics).\" Goldman Sachs: Buy, $883 Haider's $883 price target is about 15% above where Lilly shares closed on Tuesday. \" … we expect another revenue beat, driven by an [foreign exchange] tailwind and strong TRx growth for Zepbound/Mounjaro where our and consensus estimates have tracked higher into the print. ... Into the 2Q earnings call, we also note significant investor discussion on the magnitude of potential upward pressure on the company's FY25 revenue guidance where we expect management could tighten the range of $58-$61bn for the year by bumping up the low-end (based on 1H trends, GS/consensus estimates are $60bn/$60.6bn for 2025). These trends are now well-understood with investor focus higher on trying to triangulate the impact to 3Q25 sales for Zepbound/Mounjaro from the CVS formulary change in favor of Novo that took effect on July 1st.\"", "content_hash": "d16624f70943d237f271a92d750d4ba6", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Subsequent annual increases of 1% would reach a total of 15% of U.S. LNG required to be on U.S.-built vessels by 2047.\n\"The requirement of U.S.-built ships to move the country's LNG and crude is problematic,\" said Jason Feer, global head of business intelligence for Poten & Partners, a company specializing in energy market analysis and consulting, particularly in the LNG sector.\nThe U.S. government's new shipbuilding policy was undertaken as part of an investigation into China's dominance in the shipbuilding industry, as part of the broader national security concerns of the U.S. government (the Biden administration was pursuing the issue as well and released a report in January 2025 stating its recommendations). China manufactures as much as 75%-80% of global freight fleets. In April, Trump announced the new USTR policy to rebuild America's shipbuilding industry.\nOn Capitol Hill, Senator Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Senator Todd Young (R-IN), Representative John Garamendi (D-CA-8), and Representative Trent Kelly (R-MS-1) introduced the Shipbuilding and Harbor Infrastructure for Prosperity and Security (SHIPS) for America Act to close the gap with international builders through a series of programs.\nThere is only one U.S.-flagged LNG vessel currently operating, Crowley's American Energy, but it was made in France in 1994 and began service in March 2025 to carry LNG from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Puerto Rico. It is a Jones Act vessel, which means that, based on the 1920 maritime commerce law covering shipments between U.S. ports, it needs to be staffed by a U.S. captain and crew, and registered in the U.S., to be U.S.-flagged.\nThe current number of LNG carriers operating globally is 682, according to Poten & Partners. Only one of those vessels, the LNG Aquarius, was built by the United States. The LNG Aquarius was ordered on July 1, 1974, and delivered by General Dynamics on June 7, 1977. The vessel currently sails under the Indonesian flag, based on MarineTraffic vessel information.\nBy 2047, Poten & Partner estimates the U.S. would need 45 vessels to move the 15% of LNG required by the USTR guidelines. Currently, there is only one U.S. vessel on the global order books out of a total of 331 planned vessels, Feer said. On paper, he added, the number of LNG vessels on the order books \"looks good\" to support a U.S. energy export expansion. But under the new USTR guidelines, these vessels would not be eligible.\nHanwha Shipping, a U.S. subsidiary of South Korea's Hanwha Ocean, is now building a domestic liquefied natural gas carrier through its affiliate, Hanwha Philly Shipyard. This vessel will be the first U.S.-ordered, export market-viable LNG carrier in almost 50 years. A second possible LNG vessel could also be ordered.\nBased on the history of LNG shipbuilding, it takes approximately two and a half years for an LNG vessel to be built.\n\"Globally, you can build a lot of ships to support an expansion, but the problem is it has to be built in a U.S. shipyard, and the U.S. has not built a commercial ocean-going vessel in decades,\" said Feer. \"In that time, we have lost a lot of shipbuilding capacity, and the yards we have open are used for building Jones Act domestic ships and the Navy.\"\nAnother hurdle, Feer said, is the constraints in hiring skilled labor. \"There are not enough craft workers — pipefitters, carpenters, welders. Trying to build all of this, on top of a set deadline, is going to be a huge challenge,\" he said.\nThe costs associated with that skilled labor will also be a factor. It costs around $260 million to build an LNG vessel, according to industry estimates. A U.S.-made vessel can be approximately two to four times more expensive.\nFeer says there needs to be more clarity on what constitutes a U.S.-made vessel within the USTR mandate.\n\"Could the majority of the vessel be manufactured overseas and completed in the U.S.? Is it a U.S.-made engine? How many of the LNG vessels made by Hanwha would be made in Korea and finished here? It is unclear how feasible the USTR mandate is,\" he said.\nLouis Sola, former Federal Maritime Commission Commissioner appointed by President Trump, and now a partner at lobbying firm Thorn Run Partners, tells CNBC the math doesn't work.\n\"The question everyone is asking is simple,\" Sola said. \"Can the U.S. actually build enough LNG carriers fast enough under the SHIPS Act without shooting ourselves in the foot? We'll need as many as 50 vessels by 2050. Korean and Japanese yards already take over two years per ship and are booked solid, and we don't currently build this class here whatsoever,\" he added.\nThe USTR did not respond to a request for comment.\n\"Without some common-sense flexibility or a phased-in approach, the math just doesn't add up. We risk bottling up our own LNG exports and opening the market to the competition right when our allies need American energy the most,\" Sola said.\nAccording to BIMCO, the largest association for global ship owners, U.S. exports comprise up to 27.5% and 9.5% of global LNG and crude tanker demand, respectively. The U.S. predominantly uses South Korean LNG vessels to move the commodity.\nOverall, 78% of the LNG fleet is built in South Korea, while 13% and 7% are from Japan and China, respectively, according to BIMCO. South Korean shipyards also dominate the order book, with 64% of capacity on order, but Chinese shipyards are increasingly getting orders and now have 32% of capacity on order.\nReflagging of vessels, USTR mandate waivers\nNiels Rasmussen, chief shipping analyst for BIMCO, says one potential workaround is foreign-built ships that can currently be reflagged under specific conditions.\nThese ships must be owned by U.S. citizens or entities and qualify for one of the following programs: the Maritime Security Program, Cable Security Fleet, Tanker Security Fleet, Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement, or Ready Reserve Fleet. \"The SHIPS Act would also permit the reflagging of foreign-built ships for inclusion in the new Strategic Commercial Fleet Program (SCFP) for a seven-year period, which can be extended twice,\" said Rasmussen\nAs U.S.-built and flagged ships become available, they will replace foreign-built ships in the 250-ship SCFP fleet. However, foreign-built LNG tankers in the SCFP fleet would seemingly not satisfy USTR LNG export and would require a waiver to be able to export LNG, he said.\nAccording to shipping consultant Clarkson's, 2025 will see a record delivery of LNG vessels.\nIn addition to South Korea's lead position in ship orders, Swiss marine engine company WinGD has the most popular engine, and French engineering company Gaztransport & Technigaz, which specializes in membrane containment systems for liquefied natural gas (LNG) and other cryogenic gases, is the dominant containment system being used in the new vessels.\nThe U.S. may have to fall back on a waiver provision in the USTR mandate, according to energy experts.\nThe waiver provision, if used, would increase the cost of vessel components by 25%, but may be the best option relative to an unreasonable delay in ship availability, said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates.\nLipow said if there are not enough LNG vessels, a situation which could impact LNG production and crude production, the use of waivers would need to be considered.\n\"Oil wells also produce some associated natural gas with it so this can also impact U.S. oil production,\" said Lipow. \"The administration will not want to put the country in a situation where they would have to shut in production. If the markets are fearful that the U.S. does not have the ability to export LNG, prices could go down, and that would most likely lead to a waiver,\" he added.\nLipow noted that the use of waivers has been seen before in Jones Act vessels, so a foreign-flag vessel could transport U.S. gasoline between two U.S. ports. \"There is precedent for waivers on foreign-flag vessels to mitigate supply disruptions,\" he said.", "content_hash": "c3ba76daeac12f806dc3ac7a46b8fa22", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Markets: Stocks are nicely higher on Wednesday with the S & P 500 rebounding from a slight dip in the prior session. Apple is one of the big gainers in the session after the White House confirmed to CNBC that the company plans to add another $100 billion to its previous $500 billion manufacturing investment pledge to the United States over the next four years. Apple was also reportedly spared from the recent tariff escalation on goods from India. That one-two punch of good news has sent Apple shares up nearly 6% and on pace for their third session over the past year. Still waiting : It's been about one week, but we are still looking to buy some Starbucks and Palo Alto Networks shares at these levels when our trading restrictions allow. The way our restrictions work is that we're unable to trade any stock that Jim Cramer mentions on CNBC for the next 72 hours. Both stocks got dinged last week: Starbucks sold off on earnings despite CEO Brian Niccol explaining that the coffee chain's turnaround plan was ahead of schedule. And Palo Alto Networks was slammed after it said it was buying CyberArk for $25 billion. This is the largest acquisition in the company's history, which naturally brings some execution risk. However, CEO Nikesh Arora is known for his deal-making. When he says the identity security market is inflecting , making now the best time to enter the category, we want to be there with him. With a more than 1% gain Wednesday afternoon, Palo Alto shares are on track to snap a six-session losing streak that began July 29, the day that The Wall Street Journal first reported on acquisition talks with CyberArk. Up next : Companies reporting after the closing bell on Wednesday include retail darling AppLovin , language learning app Duolingo , cybersecurity provider Fortinet , Airbnb , coffee chain Dutch Bros , and sportsbook DraftKings . Meanwhile, Club name Eli Lilly is set to report earnings before the opening bell on Thursday, and we're looking for combined revenue from Mounjaro and Zepbound to come in above the FactSet consensus estimate $7.73 billion. A raise would be a plus, but Eli Lilly will have to at least maintain its full-year guidance to ease concerns about a potential slowdown in the GLP-1 market, which Novo Nordisk highlighted last week. We trimmed our Lilly position off that Novo news as a hedge against slowing trends. Other companies scheduled to report are electricity provider Vistra , HBO parent Warner Bros. Discovery , Band-Aid owner Kenvue , and aircraft parts maker Parker-Hannifin . On the data side, we'll be on the lookout for weekly jobless claims. This report suddenly has a lot more importance to it following last week's awful jobs number. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

That's largely because gold (and, as a result, the GLD Gold ETF ) has failed to reclaim its April highs. But let's zoom out. Back in October 2023, soon after GLD bottomed, we began tracking the performance spread between GLD and the S & P 500 . Up until the end of 2024, the performances were remarkably even. They didn't move in lockstep the entire time, but they didn't drift far apart either. That changed in December. Gold took off while the SPX sputtered — before ultimately collapsing through the first week of April. By early April, the spread had widened to nearly over 100%. It looked like a runaway train—until the stock market's historic pivot. Thanks to the epic equity comeback, that spread has since been cut in half and then some. The question — especially for gold investors — is whether a further reversion to the mean is next. Importantly, though, this recent bout of relative weakness hasn't been because GLD cratered. Instead, it's been a massive rotation back into equities. So, do we really need stocks to fall apart again for gold to move higher? On the surface, that makes sense. But as noted above, for over a year, both SPX and gold rallied together. And during that stretch, both were taking advantage of bullish chart setups. In fact, over the last year, GLD broke out of five bullish patterns. The sixth one has been under construction since April—and so far, we haven't seen a breakout. That's been frustrating, but the more times that 315-zone is tested without subsequently breaking down, the greater the odds it eventually gives way. Turning to the GLD/SPX relative ratio, the recent reversal occurred near the same trendline that capped prior rallies — twice before. Each of those prior peaks was followed by a long period of underperformance. For things to play out differently this time, we'll need to see a higher low—and a good place for that to happen is near the yellow highlighted support area from recent years. Also worth watching: the 14-week RSI of the GLD/SPX ratio, which is trying to hold near the 50-level. If that area can serve as a floor, it would support another leg of relative outperformance. Lastly, from a big-picture perspective, gold gained roughly +240% from its 2015 low to its 2025 high. That's impressive—but still well below the +700% and +650% moves from the 1970s and early 2000s, respectively. There's no guarantee we see a repeat of those historic runs—but one thing is clear from the chart: Gold trends for extremely long periods. And from that angle, this time has been no different.

Beauty's profits fell 30% in its fiscal first quarter as new tariffs on Chinese imports begin to affect the cosmetic company's bottom line.\nIn the three months that ended on June 30, E.l.f.'s net income fell to $33.3 million, down 30% from $47.6 million a year ago. The company, which sources about 75% of its products from China, also declined to provide a full-year revenue guide, citing the \"wide range of potential outcomes\" related to the new duties.\nInstead, the company only issued guidance for the first half of the fiscal year. E.l.f. said it is expecting sales growth to be above 9% in the first half of the year and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, margins to be 20%, compared with 23% in the first half of the previous fiscal year.\n\"We're operating in a very volatile macro environment, obviously a great deal of uncertainty on tariffs, so until we have greater resolution on what the tariff picture looks like, we didn't think it made sense to issue guidance,\" CEO Tarang Amin told CNBC in an interview. \"It's the uncertainty around the tariffs that make things more difficult.\"\nThe company has already raised prices by $1 to offset tariff costs and is working to expand its business outside of the U.S. and diversify its supply chain.\n\"We're under 55% tariffs on goods coming from China, and we've planned against that,\" Amin said. \"So I'm just waiting for that other shoe to drop to see OK, where do they really settle out? I never thought I would see a day that I'm happy to see 55% tariffs, but it's a lot better than 170%, so I think once we have that resolution, we'll be in a better spot.\"\nBeyond profits, E.l.f. beat expectations on the top and bottom lines.\nHere's how the cosmetics company performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n- Earnings per share: 89 cents adjusted vs. 84 cents expected\n- Revenue: $354 million vs. $350 million expected\nThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended June 30 was $33.3 million, or 58 cents per share, compared with $47.6 million, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items related to stock-based compensation and other nonrecurring charges, E.l.f. saw adjusted net income of $51.3 million, or 89 cents per share.\nSales rose to $354 million, up 9% from $324 million a year earlier. That marks the second quarter in a row in which revenue growth slowed to the single digits, a pattern the company hasn't seen since 2020.\nOver the past four years, E.l.f.'s sales have consistently grown in the high double digits, but that momentum has started to slow as the beauty category overall cools off following several years of outsized growth.\nAmin said growth is expected to improve in the current quarter. He pointed out that the quarter's 9% sales growth is on top of 50% growth in the year-ago period but acknowledged the category at large — and the state of consumer spending — has been soft.\n\"Sometimes people forget just how much we've been growing,\" Amin said. \"The category, the state of the consumer, is still challenged. There's a lot of uncertainty with tariffs, inflation.\"\nWhile the fiscal first quarter was slower than quarters past, Amin said Nielsen data shows the company is still taking market share and outperforming the overall category.\nA key aspect of the company's growth comes from buzzy product launches, which are often \"dupes\" of higher-priced prestige products. It recently launched its Bright Icon Vitamin C + E Ferulic Serum at $17, which is thought to have been inspired by a similar product from SkinCeuticals, which retails for $185.\nIt also released a new sunscreen and just closed on its acquisition of Hailey Bieber's beauty brand Rhode, which will launch in all Sephora stores in the U.S. and Canada in September. The effect Rhode will have on E.l.f.'s sales, and especially its launch in Sephora, won't be seen in its results until later this year.", "content_hash": "e3e8ccde9e5aec548c84dfe372aac44f", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

That was part of a big shift in Flamingo Estate's expansion as Christiansen realized that the company could help farmers make higher margin products by taking food grade ingredients into areas like household goods, beauty and the kitchen pantry.\nMany celebrities have endorsed, or directly worked with Flamingo Estate, starting with Chrissy Teigen and John Legend. Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and Oprah have both featured its products.\n\"Many were customers, just really happy customers and said we like what you are doing, can we get involved?\" Christiansen said. That led to Flamingo Estate transporting bee hives to the homes of celebrities to harvest honey for charity, with maybe the most famous example the hives on the roof of Lebron James's house.\nJulianne Moore has also produced honey, while Laura Dern has made olive oil, and next up, Christiansen said, is growing pickles with Pamela Anderson.\nChristiansen said if we want people to think about the environment differently, we have to show it to them differently. \"Taking unexpected faces and getting their hands in the soil,\" is one way to accomplish that, he said.\nOne thing he did learn from work on Hermes branding was what it takes for a brand to hold \"the test of time,\" he said, which has led Flamingo Estate to closely control its messaging, or as Christiansen said, \"police the brand cues very tightly,\" with his partner Aaron Harvey overseeing all of the design and Christiansen all the writing.\n\"There are so many people making things but not building brands,\" he said. In the way every product is made, bottled, and packaged, Christiansen says he sees \"real magic\" and a question that many bigger-scale product companies never even consider: \"Is there a true story to tell?\"\nChristiansen boils down his approach to building a broad consumer products company to \"making things I use every day at home. One great coffee, and one great product for skin, and one great thing for being in the sun all day.\"\n\"Even though it is broad, we have a really sharp focus on utility,\" he said.\nChristiansen also said he is a big fan of being \"radically inconsistent,\" an idea which is recognizable in the wide variety of products that the company now offers.\n\"We expect that from wine, season to season it's different and we celebrate it, but something made well like hand soap should be different season to season because botanicals will change and ingredients will change,\" he said. \"It's a little bit of calculated madness.\"\nThat approach may have reached its peak with a $75 compost bag that was produced as a Mother's Day-timed gift and got a much larger reaction than the company anticipated. There was utility in the idea, in that farm goats were producing so much manure, but Christiansen said it was also born of a belief in \"the power of play and trying things.\"\n\"Just to work seasonally and pivot and try and have fun. There is joy there that many brands don't have,\" he said.\nFlamingo Estate has dreams of being a billion-dollar company. It is not close to that yet, but it is growing, doubling sales this year to $30 million and forecasting $50 million in sales by early next year, according to Christiansen. The company has already expanded to Australia, is about to launch in Japan, and will enter the European market next year, he said.\nOne of the biggest hurdles was finding investors. Christiansen says it took several years to find the right partners and get properly funded, a process that included over 60 pitch meetings.\nOne issue, he says, was the fact that Flamingo Estate is not a \"single SKU\" product company. The venture capital community loves one-product companies, but Flamingo Estate is doing food, beauty, and household goods, and efficiently running the different businesses, which Christiansen said is \"a riddle\" for many investors.\nHe said many of the initial investment meetings would always circle back to the \"exit goal,\" a topic that Christiansen was not interested in.\n\"I would say 'we just started running, why are we talking exit?'\" he recalled.\nMany investors also wanted the company to focus on beauty because it has the highest margins and \"kill everything else,\" he recalled.\n\"Not following other people's playbooks, I think not doing that set us up well,\" he now says. \"There are lots of entry points into the brand,\" he added.\nThat leads Christiansen to say the one piece of advice he has for all business owners is to find the right partners, and in his experience, that meant people who have already built their own businesses, \"people who know what it's like to be in the thick of things,\" he said. \"They've made the best partners,\" he added.\nYou can watch Julia Boorstin's full interview with Richard Christiansen from CNBC's \"Small Business Playbook\" below:", "content_hash": "c3ffa56d2a3100853997b961490f4084", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

With these points generally valued at around 1.75 cents per point by the industry, this welcome bonus is worth about $1,400, which is a great return.\nThis bonus is earned in the form of Citi ThankYou® Points, which can be redeemed in a number of ways, from simple statement credits, to paying with points or transferring them to one of Citi's travel partners.\nBenefits and perks\nThe Citi Strata Elite comes with several perks, with the bulk of its value in travel and lifestyle categories.\nStatement credits\n- $300 Annual Hotel Benefit: Enjoy up to $300 off a hotel stay of two nights or more booked through Citi Travel every calendar year.\n- $200 annual Splurge credit: Every calendar year, earn up to $200 in statement credits from your choice of up to two of the following brands: 1stDibs, American Airlines, Best Buy, Future Personal Training and Live Nation, with the option to change your selection at any time.\n- $200 annual Blacklane credit: Enjoy up to $200 in statement credits, every calendar year, when booking with Blacklane, up to $100 from January through June and up to $100 from July through December.\n- Global Entry or TSA PreCheck® credit: Receive a statement credit of up to $120 every four years as reimbursement for either the Global Entry or TSA PreCheck application fee.\nWhile you do have to book via Citi Travel, the $300 hotel credit isn't tied to any specific brand, meaning you'll have more options. The $200 splurge credit is another welcome addition that gives you more control over how you earn rewards, letting you choose and switch between several brands, ranging from tickets to technology.\nOne credit that isn't as common is the one for Blacklane, a global chauffeur service. While it might serve as a nice luxury option for special occasions, odds are that you'll have an easier time with a taxi or public transportation.\nAdditional offerings\nIn addition to straightforward statement credits, the Strata Elite also offers some extra benefits:\n- American Airlines Admirals Club passes: Every calendar year, you'll receive four Admirals Club Citi Strata Elite passes, good for entry to 50+ Admirals Club lounges.\n- Complimentary Priority Pass Select membership: Access to 1,500+ airport lounges worldwide for the primary cardholder and authorized users, plus up to two guests.\n- Access to The Reserve by Citi Travel: A collection of 4.5- to 5-star hotels.\n- Travel and shopping protections: Perks like trip delay protection, enhanced trip cancellation and trip interruption protection, plus lost or damaged luggage protection, MasterRental coverage, extended warranty and purchase assurance plus.\n- Mastercard World Legend benefits: The newest premium tier to the Mastercard Collection, offering priority reservations at restaurants, including in Europe through Mastercard's partnership with TheFork, ticketing access and more.\nIf Citi happens to be a company you bank with, it's possible that you could be eligible for additional savings through an offer just for Citi customers:\n- Citigold® Private Client Relationship Tier credit: Citigold Private Clients who qualify for the card will receive a first-year banking credit of $595, covering the card's annual fee. You'll then receive a $145 annual credit each following year, with an open and current Strata Elite card.\n- Citigold® Relationship Tier credit: Citigold Clients who qualify for the card will receive a $145 banking credit with an open and current Strata Elite card.\nHow to earn and redeem Citi ThankYou Points\nEarning\nThe Citi Strata Elite has a high earnings rate when you book via the Citi Travel portal, and it offers elevated earnings rates during certain eligible times:\n- Earn 12X points on hotels, car rentals and attractions booked on cititravel.com\n- Earn 6X points on air travel booked on cititravel.com\n- Earn 6X points at restaurants on Citi Nights℠ purchases, every Friday and Saturday, from 6 PM to 6 AM ET; earn 3X points any other time\n- Earn 1.5X points on all other purchases\nWhat jumps out first is the very high 12X on hotels and more, but it is tied to the issuer's travel portal, a common theme with premium travel cards. It's also the first time we've seen a card that has a timed window to earn elevated rewards. It earns a higher rate at restaurants on Friday and Saturday nights, which could make your weekend date nights a little more affordable.\nRedeeming\nWhen redeeming the Citi ThankYou Points earned by your Strata Elite, you have several options to choose from, like:\n- Travel\n- Gifts cards\n- Cash back\n- Shopping via select retailers\n- Charitable donations\nWhile options like cash back and gift cards are usually the simplest, they often don't provide you with the best value; the highest value usually comes from taking advantage of the transfer partners offered through Citi:\n- AAdvantage® Program (1:1 ratio for Citi Strata Elite, Citi Strata Premier and Citi Prestige cardmembers)\n- ALL Accor Live Limitless (2:1 ratio)\n- Aeromexico (1:1 ratio)\n- Air France-KLM Flying Blue (1:1 ratio)\n- Avianca LifeMiles (1:1 ratio)\n- Cathay Pacific Asia Miles (1:1 ratio)\n- Choice Privileges (1:2 ratio or 2:3 with select Citi cards)\n- Emirate Skywards (1:1 ratio)\n- Etihad Guest (1:1 ratio)\n- EVA Air (1:1 ratio)\n- JetBlue TrueBlue (1:1 ratio or 5:4 with select Citi cards)\n- Leaders Club (5:1 ratio)\n- Preferred Hotels & Resorts (1:4 ratio)\n- Quantas Frequent Flyer (1:1 ratio)\n- Qatar Airways Privilege Club (1:1 ratio)\n- Shop Your Way (1:10 ratio)\n- Singapore Airlines (1:1 ratio)\n- Thai Royal Orchard Plus (1:1 ratio)\n- Turkish Airlines Miles&Smiles (1:1 ratio)\n- Virgin Atlantic Flying Club & Virgin Red (1:1 ratio)\n- Wyndham Rewards (1:1 ratio or 5:4 with select Citi cards)\nRates and fees\nThe Citi Strata Elite was built to compete with some of the most popular travel credit cards, and its $595 annual fee represents that. The card has no foreign transaction fees and a late or returned payment fee of $41.

The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.35%, ending at 21,242.70. The major averages saw sharp swings during the session, with the Dow up more than 300 points at its high and off more than 390 points at its low.\nThe blue-chip Dow was weighed down by a 2.5% decline in Caterpillar shares after the construction equipment maker warned of the effects of tariffs on its business.\nEli Lilly was another big laggard of the session, pulling back about 14% after late-stage trial results of its obesity pill disappointed investors. That's despite the pharmaceutical giant posting second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations and raising its full-year outlook.\nLooking past tariffs\nStocks initially rallied Thursday after President Donald Trump announced a day earlier that he will impose a 100% tariff on imported semiconductor chips, though not for companies that are \"building in the United States.\" The announcement sent shares of key semiconductor names like Advanced Micro Devices 5.7% higher. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) popped more than 1%.\nApple ticked up about 3% after the iPhone maker announced plans to spend an additional $100 billion on U.S. companies and suppliers over the next four years. That's on top of a $500 billion announcement Apple made in February.\n\"We're going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and semiconductors,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday. \"But the good news for companies like Apple is if you're building in the United States or have committed to build, without question, committed to build in the United States, there will be no charge.\"\nThe market had been shrugging off the Trump administration's \"reciprocal\" tariffs, which went into effect Thursday. Additionally, recent economic data, including weekly jobless claims, signaled the U.S. economy may still be in solid shape. This comes after July's weaker-than-expected jobs reading rattled the market last week.\n\"There's a lot to digest around tariffs and trade right now, and usually when you see a lot of complication around a macro environment that's not immediately negative to the economy or profits, the market … puts it to the side,\" said Anthony Saglimbene, Ameriprise chief market strategist. \"The market is just kind of concentrating on what it can discount right now, which is still a firm economic backdrop and strong earnings.\"\nHe said he expects the impact from Trump's tariffs to start showing up in economic data in the fall.\nLater Thursday, Trump announced that he has picked Stephen Miran, chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, to serve on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. He will replace Adriana Kugler following her resignation Friday.\nThe major averages are on track for a winning week as of Thursday's close. The S&P 500 has gained 1.6% in that period, while the Dow is on pace for a 0.9% advance. The Nasdaq Composite is poised for a 2.9% jump.", "content_hash": "f87e7cf5f2b80b1229b81b75ed5a283a", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

But if you're building in the United States of America, there's no charge.\"\nTrump had previously signaled that the duties on chips and semiconductors, which have become key components in virtually every industry, could come as soon as next week.\nThe remarks came after Trump touted a commitment by Apple to invest another $100 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, on top of the $500 billion the tech giant has previously pledged.\nSeveral top chipmakers, including Taiwan Semiconductor, Nvidia and GlobalFoundries, have already pledged to manufacture some of their products in the U.S.\nThey're not alone: More than 130 projects in the U.S. totaling $600 billion dollars have been announced since 2020, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.\nTSMC, the world's largest contract chip company, has pledged to invest a total of $165 billion in U.S. manufacturing.\nNvidia, the world's most valuable company, said in April that it plans to spend $500 billion on AI infrastructure in the U.S. over the next four years.\nGlobalFoundries pledged $16 billion in June to expand its semiconductor manufacturing at facilities in New York and Vermont.\nAlso in June, Texas Instruments announced a $60 billion boost to seven chip fabs in the U.S. The company counts Apple, Ford, Medtronic, Nvidia and SpaceX as customers.", "content_hash": "5e7fa1ffa7e7a3ccbad0b78d0b62e3c2", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Now, just $60 billion separates Musk from Oracle’s Larry Ellison—and another Tesla tumble could see Musk dethroned as the world’s richest man.\nElon Musk claims to have slashed billions of dollars worth of wasteful spending during his time as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)—but his controversial role may have done more damage to his pocketbook than he anticipated.\nThis year alone, Musk has lost some $80 billion in his net worth, bringing his current value to about $352 billion—a far cry from his over $450 billion peak late last year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nMusk’s wealth declines are largely tied to his 13% stake in struggling Tesla. Even after shareholders practically begged the billionaire to leave DOGE and focus on Tesla full-time, Musk’s return to Austin hasn’t been so glamorous. The electric-vehicle company missed Wall Street expectations and experienced a double-digit percentage revenue decline in the second quarter of 2025. Tesla’s stock price is down nearly 20% this year.\nBut shareholders are doing the opposite of pulling the plug on Musk; they’ve just awarded him a pay package worth some $29 billion—in what shareholders called a “critical first step toward” keeping “Elon’s energies focused on Tesla,” reports the New York Times.\nWhile Musk remains the No. 1 richest person on the planet, fellow members of the ultrarich like Larry Ellison and Mark Zuckerberg are tapping at the door to replace him at the top of the billionaire list.\nMusk’s climb to the top of the world\n2024 was a standout year for Tesla. The company’s stock nearly doubled, with the market cap topping $1.4 trillion in December. Due to his sizable stake, the jump boosted Musk’s wealth and seemingly cemented him at the time at the top of the list after years of back and forth among billionaires like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates.\nMusk’s success also comes from his stakes in his other companies, including XAI Holdings (the combined firm of social media X and AI startup xAI), SpaceX, Neuralink, and the Boring Company.\nBut like struggles at Tesla, his companies are causing financial headaches for the billionaire. xAI is reportedly burning through $1 billion a month, and the Boring Company’s valuation has decreased to $6.4 billion from $8.6 billion in July 2023, according to Bloomberg.\nWhile he did not take a salary from his role at DOGE, his companies have largely benefited from working with the government over the years. According to the Washington Post, his businesses have received some $38 billion in contracts, loans, subsidies, and more.", "content_hash": "f9581d43a3a116307fd59d5ce4fa85d6", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Maybe the roof needs urgent repairs, your HVAC system dies, or you want to jump into a renovation while you're still unpacking boxes. Naturally, many new homeowners ask: how soon can I get a home equity line of credit (HELOC) after I buy a house?\nThe good news is, there's usually no formal waiting period. In many cases, you can apply for a HELOC immediately after the purchase, depending on the lender and your financial profile. But that doesn't mean instant access to cash. Your lender may require that the deed be recorded first, and you'll still need to meet the standard eligibility criteria — like having enough equity and a low combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratio. If you're hoping to tap your equity soon after moving in, here's what you need to know about the timeline and approval process for getting a HELOC post-purchase.\nCan You Get a HELOC Immediately After Buying a Home?\nTechnically, yes — most lenders don't require you to wait a set number of days or months after your home purchase before applying for a HELOC. \"There is no waiting period,\" says Sarah DeFlorio, vice president of Mortgage Banking at William Raveis Mortgage. \"You can apply for a HELOC immediately upon purchasing, though different lenders have different policies. For example, one of our banks will not allow you to apply until the mortgage or deed has been recorded with the city or town municipality.\" That means, while there's no legal or regulatory delay, administrative steps like deed recording may slow things down by a week or two.\nAssuming everything is in order, you can generally expect the HELOC process — from application to closing — to take between 30 and 45 days. It's not quite as intense as your mortgage application, but you'll still go through income verification, a credit check, and possibly a new home appraisal. And yes — closing costs will apply again, even though you just paid them during the home purchase.\nGetting a HELOC shortly after buying a home doesn't happen overnight — even if there's technically no waiting period. Between verifying your equity, satisfying lender requirements, and closing the loan, there are several key steps you'll need to move through before the funds are available. Some parts of the process can move quickly, while others may take a few weeks depending on how your lender operates or whether additional documentation (like a home appraisal or deed recording) is needed. Here's a clear breakdown of what that process typically looks like from start to finish — so you'll know what to expect, how to prepare, and how long it might take before you're able to tap into your home equity.\nStep 1: Start With Enough Equity (Ideally 20% or More)\nThe biggest factor lenders consider is your equity — how much of the home you truly own. Most lenders require a combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratio below 85%, which means you'll usually need to have put at least 15% to 20% down when you bought your home. If you only put down 5% or 10%, you likely won't qualify right away.\nLet's run a quick example. Say you buy a home for $500,000 and put 20% down — that's $100,000 upfront and a $400,000 mortgage. Now let's say you want a $20,000 HELOC. The combined loan amount is $420,000. Divide that by your home's value ($500,000) and you get a CLTV of 84%. That's under the 85% threshold, so you'd likely qualify. But if you'd only put down 10% ($50,000), your CLTV would rise to 94%, making approval much more difficult.\nStep 2: Apply and Close on the HELOC\nOnce you've verified that your equity is sufficient and your finances are in good shape, you can submit your HELOC application. The process looks a lot like applying for a mortgage — you'll need to provide income documentation, undergo a credit check, and potentially schedule another home appraisal, even if one was completed recently.\nThis stage can take anywhere from one week to two months, depending on how quickly your lender processes paperwork and whether your home appraisal or deed recording introduces delays. Be prepared for additional closing costs, which vary by lender but often include origination fees, document prep fees, and recording charges. These aren't usually as high as mortgage closing costs, but they're still something to budget for.\nOnce your HELOC is approved and closed, the money doesn't just land in your checking account — but it becomes available to draw from. You'll enter what's known as the draw period, typically lasting 10 years. During this time, you can withdraw funds on an as-needed basis for things like renovations, emergency repairs, or debt consolidation. You'll only be required to make interest payments on the amount you borrow — not the full line of credit.\nEventually, the draw period ends and the repayment period begins. At that point, you'll need to start repaying the principal, along with interest. Some lenders also have inactivity fees or draw requirements, so it's important to read the fine print — but in most cases, you're not penalized for leaving money untouched in your credit line.\nWhat to Keep in Mind If You Want a HELOC Right After Purchase\nGetting a HELOC shortly after buying a home isn't unusual, but it's not guaranteed either. You'll need to hit the right balance of equity, income, and debt management to qualify — and the application timeline could be slowed by admin requirements like deed recording. Here are the most important takeaways:\nPut down at least 20% if you want a realistic shot at HELOC approval right after closing.\nExpect the process to take 30 to 45 days, even if you apply immediately.\nYou'll pay closing costs again, including possibly another appraisal fee.\nCLTV must be below 85%, so the more equity you have, the better.\nYour credit score and income still matter, just like with your mortgage.\nUltimately, the key is to treat a post-purchase HELOC like any other home loan — something that requires planning, documentation, and a strong financial position. If you're buying a home and know you'll want access to equity soon after closing, structure your purchase accordingly so you're not caught off guard.", "content_hash": "35f17f9569401886e85e8d60460d3ab3", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

As the fast-food giant prepares to release its financial report for the second quarter of 2025, all eyes are on how these results will shape its market trajectory. What key metrics should investors watch? What are analysts expecting? And how might these figures impact MCD’s stock moving forward? Let’s take a closer look:\nStarting the year near its lows around $276 at the beginning of 2025, the MCD stock saw a sustained upward move in early Q1, pushing through the Ichimoku Cloud resistance—a bullish sign—before entering a prolonged period of sideways consolidation between roughly $296 and $318. This period was characterized by a tug-of-war between bulls and bears, as seen in repeated tests of both support and resistance levels without a clear breakout.\nNotably, at the beginning of June, the share price dipped below the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling a temporary shift toward bearish momentum. However, this move failed to gain traction, and buyers soon regained control, lifting the price back into the cloud by mid-July and setting up the current test of resistance.\nThe Ichimoku Cloud analysis reveals that price action in recent months has often oscillated around the Kijun-sen and Tenkan-sen lines, suggesting indecision and a lack of strong directional momentum. The cloud itself has narrowed over time, reflecting this reduced volatility and pointing to a critical juncture where a breakout could be imminent. The current price of $302.80 is just below a significant resistance at around $304, which has capped gains multiple times since June. The price is also now testing the upper edge of the cloud, which, if broken decisively, could signal the start of a new bullish phase. Conversely, a failure at this level could trigger renewed selling pressure.\nRSI stands at 56, indicating that the stock is in neutral territory but leaning slightly toward bullish momentum. This mid-range RSI, combined with the upward slope in the accumulation/distribution line, suggests that while buying interest has been increasing, it has not yet reached an overbought condition. Volume trends further support this narrative: the Accumulation/Distribution (A/D) indicator has been climbing steadily, indicating that, despite choppy price action, there has been underlying accumulation throughout the year, which could provide fuel for a potential upward breakout if positive catalysts emerge.\nOn Wednesday, McDonald’s financial release is likely to be a pivotal event for its stock price. A strong earnings beat, particularly on comparable sales growth or margin improvement, could provide the spark needed for the stock to break out of its current range and retest higher levels near $308 or beyond. On the other hand, weaker-than-expected results or cautious forward guidance could reinforce the current resistance and drive the stock back toward the lower end of the recent trading range, possibly down to support near $296 or even $290.\nInvestors and traders will be watching closely for any commentary on consumer spending trends, input cost pressures, and global same-store sales—key metrics that could influence sentiment and dictate the stock’s next move.\nWhat Happened in Q1 2025?\nIn the first quarter of 2025, McDonald’s faced a challenging operating environment, particularly in key markets like the United States where consumer sentiment weakened notably. Amid economic uncertainty and a tightening in household budgets, McDonald’s core customer base—largely composed of low- and middle-income consumers—began to pull back on discretionary spending, affecting traffic and sales.\nThis was reflected starkly in the company’s quarterly results: U.S. same-store sales fell 3.6%, marking the worst decline in its domestic market since the pandemic-induced plunge of 8.7% in Q2 2020. The downturn was partly driven by bad weather early in the year, but the broader issue was a more cautious and price-sensitive consumer, hesitant in the face of economic pressures, including the recent implementation of broad tariffs by President Donald Trump, which have contributed to growing pricing concerns.\nThe weakness in consumer demand, particularly among lower-income segments, weighed on McDonald’s, whose business model relies on high-volume, value-driven sales. The company’s stock price reflected this uncertainty, with increased selling pressure coinciding with the disappointing earnings.\nIn response to these challenges, McDonald’s management moved quickly to stem the decline and reposition the brand for a recovery. CFO Ian Borden stated in February that Q1 would likely represent the low point for the year in terms of same-store sales, hinting at stronger performance in the quarters to follow. Part of McDonald’s strategy has been to lean into affordability and menu innovation, aiming to reignite consumer interest and drive traffic back to restaurants. The reintroduction of the Snack Wrap—long requested by customers and discontinued since 2016—formed the centerpiece of this push. Offering a combination of value and nostalgia, the Snack Wrap is part of a broader value menu strategy aimed at winning back price-sensitive customers.\nThis strategic shift has caught the attention of Wall Street. Goldman Sachs recently upgraded McDonald’s stock to a Buy, citing expectations that new product launches and refreshed marketing initiatives will help the fast-food giant reclaim market share, even as the broader restaurant industry grapples with the pressures of slowing consumer spending. UBS echoed this sentiment, highlighting the potential for snack wraps and other menu innovations to meaningfully lift sales in the second half of the year.\nDespite the rough start to 2025, McDonald’s maintained its full-year outlook. The company plans to open 2,200 new locations globally and invest between $3 billion and $3.2 billion in capital expenditures, with net restaurant openings expected to contribute just over 2% to systemwide sales growth. This long-term commitment suggests confidence in its ability to recover and expand, even amid short-term headwinds.\nWhat Should Traders Expect for Q2 2025?\nAs McDonald’s prepares to report its next earnings, traders should pay close attention to whether same-store sales in the U.S. have stabilized or shown signs of recovery. Any indication that menu innovations are boosting traffic would likely be seen as a positive catalyst for the stock, potentially reversing the negative sentiment that followed Q1 results. Moreover, guidance updates regarding the impact of tariffs, consumer demand trends, and margin management will be key in shaping the market’s expectations for the remainder of 2025.", "content_hash": "d2adaaf4a41a48f9cb1cb74743c05e30", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Thirteen branches have since followed, with Charleston and Columbia metro regions gaining steam this year.\nIts first Alabama location, in Huntsville, is slated to open Aug. 12. Birmingham will soon follow.\n‘Next-gen’ growth\nIts new branches, dubbed its “next-gen” financial centers, are smaller, more tech-forward (even in how they’re located) and more casual in feel than legacy branches. The way they’re laid out is one way Fifth Third shows up differently for its customers, Niehaus said.\n“Most of the time I never see anyone using the office,” Niehaus said of the next-gen branches’ sole closed-door setting. Instead, he said, customers and employees are using open-air spaces – there’s a booth, a “tech table” with a television, a transaction bar – often working side by side.\n“It’s about showing up how customers want us to show up, not building barriers between [them and] you, shutting a door and making you feel like you're locked in to have someone pitch you something. That is not who we want to be,” Niehaus said. “We're all about relationship banking, serving you how you want to be served.”", "content_hash": "a967e45bc45e612ec6ce804eb98d1835", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Credit Suisse was required to pay $2.48 billion as a civil penalty to the U.S. government and $2.8 billion in other forms of relief like loan modifications for distressed homeowners, loan forgiveness and financing for affordable housing projects.\nThis 2017 settlement was part of a broader effort by U.S. authorities to hold financial institutions accountable for their role in the 2007-08 financial crisis. The DOJ alleged Credit Suisse knowingly purchased and securitized poor-quality mortgage loans and misrepresented the risks associated with these securities to investors.\nIn the years preceding the financial crisis, several big banks were involved in misconduct related to RMBSs. The DOJ recovered roughly $36 billion in civil penalties from 18 financial institutions in connection with mortgage-backed securities fraud in the run-up to the financial crisis.\nUBS settled its own RMBS case with the DOJ for nearly $1.4 billion in August 2023, roughly four months after it bought Credit Suisse in a $3.25 billion government-orchestrated deal.\nIn July of that year, the Federal Reserve fined UBS $268.5 million over “unsafe and unsound counterparty credit risk management practices” between Credit Suisse and defunct investment fund Archegos.

Instead of trying to convince a cashier to accept your wallet address, these cards automatically convert your cryptocurrency into fiat currency at the point of sale, letting you tap and pay just like you would with any other Visa or Mastercard. Whether you're a long-term investor looking to unlock the utility of your crypto, or you're simply trying to make digital assets a part of your everyday finances, crypto debit cards can help bridge the gap between the blockchain and the real world. And unlike the clunky prepaid solutions of the early days, today's cards come packed with perks—cashback in crypto, airport lounge access, even rewards on your streaming subscriptions. But before you swipe your Bitcoin for a sandwich, let's break down how these cards work, which ones are best, and what to know before you add one to your wallet.\nWhat Is a Crypto Debit Card and How Does It Work?\nA crypto debit card functions much like the plastic card in your wallet right now—but instead of pulling from your checking account, it draws from your digital assets. You typically start by topping up your crypto debit card through a wallet or exchange app linked to your card provider. When you go to make a purchase, the card provider converts just enough crypto into your local currency to cover the charge. So, even if the merchant never sees your Bitcoin or Ethereum, you're still effectively spending it. Most cards are backed by major networks like Visa or Mastercard, meaning you can use them anywhere those brands are accepted—whether online, in-store, or even at the ATM. Some cards are virtual-only and work great for ecommerce, while others also offer physical cards you can carry. Depending on the provider, the card may support a range of coins and stablecoins, and some even let you toggle which asset gets spent first. It's a sleek way to make crypto functional in daily life without waiting for widespread adoption at the checkout line.\nDon’t Miss:\n-\nNew to crypto? Get up to $400 in rewards for successfully completing short educational courses and making your first qualifying trade on Coinbase.\n-\nA must-have for all crypto enthusiasts: Sign up for the Gemini Credit Card today and earn rewards on Bitcoin Ether, or 60+ other tokens, with every purchase.\nWhy You Might Want to Use a Crypto Debit Card\nCrypto debit cards aren't just about novelty—they can offer real utility, especially if you already hold digital assets and want more flexibility in how you use them. For starters, they eliminate the friction of converting crypto into fiat on your own before spending it. You don't need to make a sell order, wait for settlement, then transfer funds to your bank. Instead, the card handles that process in real time. For frequent travelers or remote workers earning in crypto, this can be a game-changer—no need to convert to USD or EUR ahead of time. On top of that, most crypto cards come with cashback or cryptoback programs, where you earn tokens back with every purchase. Some offer 1% to 8% back, depending on your staking level or card tier. And since you're already using crypto, it's nice to put those everyday expenses toward building more. Lastly, some cards include luxury perks like lounge access or partner discounts, which can turn a simple transaction into something more rewarding. If you already believe in crypto long-term, these cards are a natural extension of that lifestyle.", "content_hash": "8e3b0d46edc0c99b7556a15bb6f93db3", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

While Bitcoin still dominates the market cap rankings and headlines, it's the altcoins that are driving the most technical innovation, user adoption, and real-world utility. From smart contract platforms and cross-chain tools to meme coins with serious cultural staying power, the altcoin space is broader—and more competitive—than ever. For investors, that means more opportunities to diversify, but also more noise to cut through. This month's top picks aren't just based on hype—they reflect growing ecosystems, recent milestones, and long-term relevance in the crypto economy. Whether you're looking for blue-chip reliability or speculative upside, these altcoins stand out in August 2025. Some have been building for years. Others are climbing fast on the back of new features or integrations. Either way, they're worth watching closely if you're serious about navigating today's altcoin market.\nEthereum continues to anchor the altcoin market in 2025—and for good reason. It remains the most actively used smart contract platform, with billions in total value locked across DeFi protocols, rollups, and decentralized applications. What sets ETH apart right now is the combination of institutional trust and rapid infrastructure upgrades. Since the launch of Ethereum's \"Pectra\" upgrade in mid-2025, which further optimized data availability through proto-danksharding and improved validator efficiency, network performance has improved while gas fees have remained consistently low on Layer 2s. The Ethereum spot ETF—approved more than a year ago—has also brought steady capital inflows from traditional finance, helping to stabilize price action and reinforce ETH's reputation as a long-term asset. With deep liquidity, unmatched developer talent, and continued roadmap execution, Ethereum is as close to a \"default\" altcoin holding as you'll find. Whether you're new to crypto or looking to rebalance your portfolio, ETH remains a core pick.\nDon’t Miss:\nSolana has moved beyond its \"Ethereum killer\" label and carved out its own space in the crypto ecosystem as a fast, scalable, and increasingly resilient Layer 1 platform. In 2025, it's defined by consumer products (like the Saga smartphone series), a massive surge in on-chain activity across DeFi and gaming, and growing institutional attention. VanEck's Solana ETF, approved in July 2025, brought fresh visibility to the project and added a wave of legitimacy to SOL as an investable asset. The network currently processes more than 65 million transactions per day with minimal fees—thanks to ongoing core improvements and validator expansion. Solana has also become a hub for real-world assets (RWAs), NFTs, and stablecoin payments, attracting both retail users and builders alike. With over $9 billion now locked in its ecosystem, Solana shows both staying power and momentum. If you're looking for high-throughput, app-first blockchain exposure this month, SOL is easily a top-tier contender.\nRipple's XRP token continues to be one of the most watched and debated altcoins in the market, but in August 2025, it deserves a serious look for more than just its legal drama. With the SEC lawsuit fully resolved in late 2024 and XRP officially not classified as a security, Ripple has doubled down on its mission to modernize cross-border payments—and adoption is accelerating. Major banks in Asia and Latin America are now integrating RippleNet technology into their settlement systems, and the rollout of RLUSD, Ripple's U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, has begun to scale. RLUSD runs natively on the XRP Ledger and aims to bridge traditional finance with crypto liquidity. Meanwhile, XRP remains popular with traders due to its price volatility and frequent liquidity spikes. It's not without risk—XRP can move fast in either direction—but for investors looking to bet on institutional adoption, global remittance rails, and regulatory clarity, it's an increasingly credible hold in 2025.\nDogecoin is still defying gravity—and critics—well into 2025. What started as a meme in 2013 has now become one of the most recognizable cryptocurrencies in the world, with deep cultural roots and a passionate online following that refuses to let it fade. While Dogecoin doesn't offer the technical sophistication of other Layer 1 chains, it has one massive asset no other altcoin can claim: Elon Musk's continued support. Musk's frequent mentions of DOGE, combined with the steady development of Dogecoin Core updates and the coin's growing acceptance as a payment method (especially for Tesla merchandise), keep it in the spotlight. It's also benefited from the broader meme coin revival in 2025, with DOGE often acting as the bellwether for retail sentiment. Yes, it's volatile. No, it's not \"serious tech.\" But in a market that runs on attention, community, and brand strength, Dogecoin still matters—and that makes it worth watching this month.\nTrending Now:\nToncoin is having a breakout year in 2025, thanks largely to its seamless integration with Telegram's global user base. The Open Network (TON) was initially developed by Telegram before being spun out after regulatory friction—but the two platforms are now deeply aligned again, giving TON one of the most powerful distribution channels in crypto. The native wallet is now embedded into Telegram's app for over 800 million users, making crypto onboarding smoother than ever. TON is fast, low-fee, and supports a growing number of dApps, gaming projects, and NFT tools. It's also seeing real adoption in emerging markets where Telegram already dominates, positioning TON as a payment and messaging-layer hybrid. With a current market cap near $15 billion and steady ecosystem expansion, Toncoin is evolving from speculative bet to real infrastructure. If you're looking for a coin that blends social scale with blockchain performance—and isn't just another Ethereum clone—TON is one to keep your eye on in August.\nAvalanche remains a technically impressive altcoin, and 2025 finds it regaining momentum after a quieter 2024. With its unique \"subnet\" architecture, Avalanche enables developers to launch custom blockchains with specialized rulesets, offering flexibility that's hard to find elsewhere. This year, new subnets focused on gaming and real-world assets (RWAs) have seen strong uptake, and institutional players are beginning to explore Avalanche for compliant, purpose-built blockchains. The network's core technology continues to deliver on its promise of fast finality and high throughput, often outperforming Ethereum in speed and cost. While AVAX hasn't been immune to market cycles—it's still down from its all-time highs—it's now showing technical signs of recovery, and ecosystem activity is ticking upward. For investors who want exposure to high-performance blockchain infrastructure with a modular, customizable design, Avalanche is a strong contender. It may not dominate headlines, but its fundamentals remain intact—and its potential is far from priced in.\nChainlink continues to be one of the most essential pieces of infrastructure in the crypto world—and in 2025, it's finally starting to get priced like it. Chainlink's oracle network enables smart contracts to interact with real-world data, and its technology is now integrated into nearly every major DeFi protocol across Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, and more. This year, Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) has seen growing adoption by both decentralized applications and traditional financial institutions, offering a secure way to move data and value across blockchain networks. Meanwhile, Chainlink Functions allows developers to call APIs and use external data in smart contracts, opening up new possibilities for automation and hybrid applications. With enterprise integrations rolling out and tokenomics updates (including staking expansion and service fee sharing) helping drive demand for LINK, this is one of the few altcoins with a clear use case and actual cash flow potential. If you're investing based on fundamentals, Chainlink deserves serious weight.\nPolkadot is often viewed as a quiet operator in the crypto world—but don't confuse quiet with stagnant. In 2025, DOT continues to push forward as one of the leading multi-chain platforms, offering secure interoperability across parachains, app chains, and external blockchains. The recent rollout of asynchronous backing and JAM (Join-Accumulate Machine) has improved Polkadot's scalability and efficiency, making it more appealing for developers who need high-throughput, low-latency environments. While its \"Layer 0\" architecture is complex, it's precisely this design that allows Polkadot to stand out from other Layer 1s. The network's focus on governance, decentralization, and on-chain treasury management also makes it a favorite among protocol maximalists and DAO builders. Market-wise, DOT is still down from its peak, which means there's significant upside if the project's next growth phase takes hold. For those looking beyond hype and into structural crypto infrastructure, Polkadot remains a thoughtful and forward-looking altcoin to hold in August.\nDogwifhat is riding the meme coin wave into 2025 with more staying power than most expected—and it's more than just a joke now. WIF began as a cultural offshoot of Solana's meme coin scene, but it quickly gained traction thanks to strong branding, a vibrant online community, and a surprisingly savvy marketing engine. Its listing on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase last year gave it immediate visibility, and its low-friction, high-velocity trading style has made it a favorite among short-term speculators and retail holders alike. What separates Dogwifhat from other meme coins is its self-awareness and meme-native ethos—it doesn't pretend to be something it's not. In a market that often rewards attention more than fundamentals, WIF's ability to consistently trend on social platforms keeps it relevant. It's volatile, high-risk, and very sentiment-driven, but in a bullish or sideways market, coins like this can move fast. If you're playing the meme cycle, Dogwifhat's still got legs.\nPolygon enters August 2025 as one of the most battle-tested and widely adopted scaling solutions for Ethereum—and it's not slowing down. The launch of Polygon 2.0 in early 2025 transformed the MATIC ecosystem into a unified network of zero-knowledge rollups and app-specific chains, with upgraded token economics and protocol governance. Polygon has also been a go-to platform for major enterprise collaborations, powering digital ID solutions, loyalty programs, and Web3 brand activations for global companies. Developers still love Polygon for its EVM compatibility, active community, and broad infrastructure tools, while users benefit from low-cost, fast transactions and access to DeFi, gaming, and NFT platforms. MATIC itself has been relatively stable during recent market swings, showing signs of accumulation from long-term holders. With over $1.5 billion in total value locked and dozens of high-profile integrations underway, Polygon remains one of the most accessible and resilient altcoins in crypto. For scalability, utility, and brand relevance, MATIC continues to deliver.\nSee Next:\nThis article 10 Best Altcoins to Buy in August 2025 originally appeared on Benzinga.com", "content_hash": "414e58fa830970a665c3b3816b51030d", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Quinn, on the other hand, earns $50,000 and is currently in graduate school. Despite the wide income gap, her husband accuses her of financial abuse.\nSeparate Finances, Growing Tensions\nQuinn said the couple keeps separate bank accounts, something she claims was her husband’s idea from the start of their relationship. “I wanted joint even before we got married,” she said. “But he insisted on having separate for the time being.”\nDon't Miss:\n-\n‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones.

He later cut to the heart of the matter: “There's no abuse here. It's just stupidity.”\n“You guys are like Venmoing each other, going tit for tat and scoreboards, and you have more than me this month,” he said with Ramsey adding, “This is not abuse by either one of you, and that is not a word you should use about your spouse.”\nTrending: $100k+ in investable assets?

Quinn revealed her husband is secretly planning a divorce with his mother. “I found emails that were between his mother and he where he was claiming that I am coercively controlling him, that I'm financially abusing him,” she said. “And she was talking to him about how she's going to pay for his retainer for his lawyer.”\nQuinn also shared that her husband gave her access to his phone due to a past porn addiction, which is how she discovered the emails. “He claims that he only does that because he's upset,” she said, but Ramsey wasn’t buying it: “He's a child. He's being a little boy and he ran to his mommy.”", "content_hash": "ab70086835efb0ddcd7a5294103dacf6", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

But getting to seven figures isn't all about swinging for the fences. Often, it is easier to get there by reliably hitting singles and doubles.\nThis is why you might want to look at SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT: SPYD). Here's how it could help you build your net worth -- and also some things you need to understand before you buy it.\nWhat does SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF do?\nFrom a high-level view, SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF simply tracks the S&P 500 High Dividend Index. So what the index does, the exchange-traded fund (ETF) does.\nIn this case, the index is very simple to understand. It takes the 80 highest-yielding stocks from the S&P 500 and then equally weights them. Easy-peasy.\nThis creates a portfolio that has a well-above market yield. Right now, the S&P 500 is yielding 1.2% or so. But SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF's dividend yield is 4.5%, which is nearly four times higher! To be fair, investors are giving up total return in favor of income here. But that isn't the end of the world by any stretch of the imagination.\nEssentially, if you include SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF in your portfolio as a foundational investment, you give yourself the leeway to buy other things. You can layer on dividend growth investments or even higher-risk tech stocks, if you like.\nThe basic idea is that SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF gives you the freedom to do other things, effectively allowing you to build a more balanced portfolio. It could be an integral part of a millionaire-making portfolio.\nRisks of owning SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF\nThat said, the simple approach that SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF takes needs to be examined in a bit more detail.\nThe S&P 500 is a committee selected collection of roughly 500 companies that are large and economically important. The quality of the companies being selected isn't guaranteed to be high and, in fact, the S&P 500 usually contains more than a few troubled businesses. Buying the highest-yielding stocks from the index means you will own at least a few high-risk turnaround stories.", "content_hash": "3d5fd8b4d7167723f1a0538b0cb11723", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Polygon has also been a go-to platform for major enterprise collaborations, powering digital ID solutions, loyalty programs, and Web3 brand activations for global companies. Developers still love Polygon for its EVM compatibility, active community, and broad infrastructure tools, while users benefit from low-cost, fast transactions and access to DeFi, gaming, and NFT platforms. MATIC itself has been relatively stable during recent market swings, showing signs of accumulation from long-term holders. With over $1.5 billion in total value locked and dozens of high-profile integrations underway, Polygon remains one of the most accessible and resilient altcoins in crypto. For scalability, utility, and brand relevance, MATIC continues to deliver.\nSee Next:\nThis article 10 Best Altcoins to Buy in August 2025 originally appeared on Benzinga.com", "content_hash": "414e58fa830970a665c3b3816b51030d", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Quinn, on the other hand, earns $50,000 and is currently in graduate school. Despite the wide income gap, her husband accuses her of financial abuse.\nSeparate Finances, Growing Tensions\nQuinn said the couple keeps separate bank accounts, something she claims was her husband’s idea from the start of their relationship. “I wanted joint even before we got married,” she said. “But he insisted on having separate for the time being.”\nDon't Miss:\n-\n‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones.

He later cut to the heart of the matter: “There's no abuse here. It's just stupidity.”\n“You guys are like Venmoing each other, going tit for tat and scoreboards, and you have more than me this month,” he said with Ramsey adding, “This is not abuse by either one of you, and that is not a word you should use about your spouse.”\nTrending: $100k+ in investable assets?

Quinn revealed her husband is secretly planning a divorce with his mother. “I found emails that were between his mother and he where he was claiming that I am coercively controlling him, that I'm financially abusing him,” she said. “And she was talking to him about how she's going to pay for his retainer for his lawyer.”\nQuinn also shared that her husband gave her access to his phone due to a past porn addiction, which is how she discovered the emails. “He claims that he only does that because he's upset,” she said, but Ramsey wasn’t buying it: “He's a child. He's being a little boy and he ran to his mommy.”", "content_hash": "ab70086835efb0ddcd7a5294103dacf6", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

But getting to seven figures isn't all about swinging for the fences. Often, it is easier to get there by reliably hitting singles and doubles.\nThis is why you might want to look at SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT: SPYD). Here's how it could help you build your net worth -- and also some things you need to understand before you buy it.\nWhat does SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF do?\nFrom a high-level view, SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF simply tracks the S&P 500 High Dividend Index. So what the index does, the exchange-traded fund (ETF) does.\nIn this case, the index is very simple to understand. It takes the 80 highest-yielding stocks from the S&P 500 and then equally weights them. Easy-peasy.\nThis creates a portfolio that has a well-above market yield. Right now, the S&P 500 is yielding 1.2% or so. But SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF's dividend yield is 4.5%, which is nearly four times higher! To be fair, investors are giving up total return in favor of income here. But that isn't the end of the world by any stretch of the imagination.\nEssentially, if you include SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF in your portfolio as a foundational investment, you give yourself the leeway to buy other things. You can layer on dividend growth investments or even higher-risk tech stocks, if you like.\nThe basic idea is that SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF gives you the freedom to do other things, effectively allowing you to build a more balanced portfolio. It could be an integral part of a millionaire-making portfolio.\nRisks of owning SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF\nThat said, the simple approach that SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF takes needs to be examined in a bit more detail.\nThe S&P 500 is a committee selected collection of roughly 500 companies that are large and economically important. The quality of the companies being selected isn't guaranteed to be high and, in fact, the S&P 500 usually contains more than a few troubled businesses. Buying the highest-yielding stocks from the index means you will own at least a few high-risk turnaround stories.", "content_hash": "3d5fd8b4d7167723f1a0538b0cb11723", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

A former trader at Goldman Sachs and Tiger Management, Morehead had become orange-pilled just a few years before, convinced that Bitcoin would reshape the global economy. He believed in the currency so fervently that he came out of semiretirement to remake his hedge fund, Pantera Capital, into one of the world’s first Bitcoin funds.\nThe new operation, launched in 2013, got off to a roaring start, with backing from two of Morehead’s fellow Princeton alumni, Pete Briger and Mike Novogratz, both from the private equity giant Fortress. The trio watched with glee as the Bitcoin purchased by Pantera at an initial price of $65 soared to over $1,000 by the end of the year. But then disaster struck as hackers cleaned out the fledgling crypto industry’s main exchange, Mt. Gox, and the price of Bitcoin plummeted 85%. “People would say, ‘Didn’t you do that Bitcoin thing that died?’” Morehead recalls. “It’s still alive!” he would respond.\nDuring his 2016 trip to evangelize Bitcoin, Morehead took 170 meetings, each time going into a prospective investor’s office and spending an hour arguing why the new currency was the most compelling possible opportunity. The result: He managed to raise just $1 million for his flailing fund. Even worse, Morehead’s own fees totaled around $17,000. “I earned $100 a meeting, going out there trying to evangelize people to buy Bitcoins,” he tells Fortune.\nLess than a decade later, as Bitcoin pushes $120,000, Morehead’s brutal early slog feels like the stuff of founder mythology—right up there with the tales of Apple’s Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak tinkering in Jobs’ parents’ garage, or Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger trading stock tips at an Omaha dinner party.\nToday, Pantera manages over $5 billion in assets across different crypto funds. Its holdings comprise digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as venture investments in projects such as Circle, which went public in June, and Bitstamp, which was acquired by Robinhood earlier this year for $200 million. But what sets the firm apart from the crowded field of crypto VCs is its early-mover status as a storied bridge between the buttoned-up world of traditional finance and the once-renegade crypto sector. At the center is Morehead, an unsung figure in an industry dominated by larger-than-life characters.\n“I’m very stubborn, and I am totally convinced [Bitcoin] is going to change the world,” Morehead tells Fortune. “So I just kept going.”\nBack before Wall Street infiltrated the blockchain industry, Morehead stood out in the chaotic world of early crypto. A two-sport athlete at Princeton in football and heavyweight crew, Morehead still has the broad shoulders and square jaw of his youth. The figure he cut was a far cry from the wiry, iconoclastic types who spent most of their time on internet message boards. Morehead, in contrast, came from the conventional world of finance. He’s still rarely spotted without a blazer on.\nMorehead had already had a long trading career before learning about Bitcoin. After stints at Goldman Sachs and Tiger, he began his own hedge fund, Pantera, which flamed out during the 2008 financial crisis, right around the time that a shadowy figure named Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin to the world in an online white paper.\nMorehead first heard about Bitcoin in 2011 from his brother and was vaguely aware that a classmate from Princeton, Gavin Andresen, was running a website that gave out 5 Bitcoins to any user for solving a captcha (current street value: $575,000). But Morehead didn’t think much about it until a couple of years later, when another classmate, Briger, invited Morehead for coffee at the San Francisco office of Fortress to talk crypto, with Novogratz calling in. “Since then, I’ve been possessed by Bitcoin,” Morehead says.\nTech is famous for its so-called “mafias”—clusters of employees from prominent organizations like PayPal who go on to lead the next generation of startups. In crypto, it’s not a company but a university, with Princeton responsible for some of the industry’s most influential projects. Briger and Novogratz both served as key backers of Pantera, with Morehead even moving into empty office space at Fortress’s San Francisco office. Briger remains a powerful, albeit behind-the-scenes, presence in crypto, recently taking a seat on the board of directors of Michael Saylor’s $100 billion Bitcoin holding firm, Strategy. Novogratz went on to found Galaxy, one of the largest crypto conglomerates. And another classmate, Joe Lubin, went on to become one of the cofounders of Ethereum.\nBut back in 2013, it still seemed far-fetched that Ivy League graduates working in the rarified fields of private equity and macro trading would be interested in Bitcoin. Briger tells Fortune that he first learned about it from Wences Casares, an Argentine entrepreneur and early crypto adopter, while sharing a room at a Young Presidents’ Organization gathering in the San Juan Islands. Briger quickly saw the appeal of upending the global payments system—a point he sticks by today, though he argues that Bitcoin is still in its infancy. He says that Bitcoin mirrors the promise of the internet, which facilitated a new form of information flow. “The fact that money movement doesn’t happen in the same way is a real shame,” he says.\nAfter sharing the idea with Novogratz, they thought that Morehead, who had experience working in foreign exchange markets, would be the right person to bring on. When Morehead decided to devote the rest of his financial career to crypto, he rebranded Pantera as a Bitcoin fund and opened it back up to outside investors. Briger and Novogratz both signed on as limited partners, with Fortress and the venture firms Benchmark and Ribbit taking general partner stakes, though they would later withdraw. His old mentor at Tiger, the legendary investor Julian Robertson, even backed a later fund.\nIn the hurly-burly early days of crypto, entrepreneurs had to confront dramatic booms and busts that make today’s volatility look like minor blips. But the wild price roller-coaster wasn’t the biggest headache, Novogratz recalls. It was simply trying to procure BTC in the first place.\nHe went to Coinbase, then just a year old, to try and buy 30,000 Bitcoins, which would have sold for around $2 million. He was met with a pop-up that his limit was $50. After trying to work it out with Olaf Carlson-Wee—Coinbase’s first employee, who would go on to become a famed crypto figure in his own right—the firm agreed to increase his limit all the way to $300.\nMorehead’s most impressive achievement, however, may be sticking it out during the doldrums of 2013 through 2016, when prices remained in the basement and no one outside of the insular blockchain community paid Bitcoin much mind. “In those quiet years where crypto wasn’t doing shit, Dan was out there beating the pavement,” Novogratz tells Fortune.\nThat epoch still had its highlights, including three annual conferences hosted by Morehead out of his Lake Tahoe home. At one, Jesse Powell, cofounder of the exchange Kraken, opted out of taking a private plane chartered by Morehead and drove instead. “There was a large enough fraction of the Bitcoin community [there] that he feared if the plane crashed, it would take Bitcoin down,” Morehead recalls.\nUnlike many of his compatriots, Morehead never positioned himself as a “Bitcoin maxi,” or someone who argues that no other cryptocurrencies should exist. After buying up 2% of the global Bitcoin supply, Pantera became an early investor in Ripple Labs, which created the digital asset XRP. “The way I think about it is Bitcoin is obviously the most important,” Morehead says. “But there isn’t one internet company.”\nAccording to Morehead, Pantera has made money on 86% of its venture investments. It’s a staggering figure considering that the vast majority of VC-backed startups fail. Crypto may be more forgiving given that many projects come with an accompanying cryptocurrency, meaning speculative value often endures even if a startup’s product goes nowhere.\nMorehead now spends half his year in Puerto Rico, which has become a hotbed for crypto. Joey Krug, then a partner at Pantera and now at Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, had relocated down there, and Morehead decided to make the move. He estimates there are 1,000 blockchain entrepreneurs on the island, though they’ve drawn scrutiny for driving up real estate prices. Morehead faced an inquiry from the Senate Finance Committee over whether he violated federal tax laws by moving to the island and earning more than $850 million in capital gains from Pantera. He told the New York Times earlier this year that he believed he “acted appropriately with respect to my taxes” and declined to comment further to Fortune.\nMorehead acknowledges that much of the crypto industry is saturated with gambling, with Pantera staying away from memecoins, unlike many other venture firms. Still, he argues that it shouldn’t distract from blockchain’s broader goal of reshaping global finance. “It’s ridiculous to try and take down the blockchain industry because of a little sideshow,” he says. “[GameStop] doesn’t mean the entire U.S. equity market is tainted.”\nPantera continues to grow, including raising a fifth venture fund with a $1 billion target, which Morehead says the firm will close after finishing investing out of its fourth fund later this year. Pantera has also moved into the red-hot field of digital asset treasuries, where publicly traded companies buy and hold cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets.\nBut Bitcoin remains at the core of Pantera’s strategy. At the end of last year, its Bitcoin fund hit 1,000x, with a lifetime return of over 130,000%. When asked for a prediction of where Bitcoin is headed, Morehead has always had the same answer: The price will double in a year. For the most part, the simple model has worked, though Morehead admits the days of rapid growth are likely slowing down. He argues Bitcoin will still go up another order of magnitude, meaning it will approach $1 million, though he thinks that will be the last time it has a 10x increase.\nMorehead is happy to shoulder the criticism if Bitcoin never reaches that milestone. In 2016, after all, he was struggling to make the case for the cryptocurrency at $500. And less than a decade later, he’s just getting started. “I have the same conviction—the vast majority of institutions have zero,” he tells Fortune. “It feels like we have another couple of decades to go.”\nUpdated to reflect the latest regulatory filing figures on assets under management.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "content_hash": "a8e0237655ef8895573d1e67be72f410", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

A two-sport athlete at Princeton in football and heavyweight crew, Morehead still has the broad shoulders and square jaw of his youth. The figure he cut was a far cry from the wiry, iconoclastic types who spent most of their time on internet message boards. Morehead, in contrast, came from the conventional world of finance. He’s still rarely spotted without a blazer on.\nMorehead had already had a long trading career before learning about Bitcoin. After stints at Goldman Sachs and Tiger, he began his own hedge fund, Pantera, which flamed out during the 2008 financial crisis, right around the time that a shadowy figure named Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin to the world in an online white paper.\nMorehead first heard about Bitcoin in 2011 from his brother and was vaguely aware that a classmate from Princeton, Gavin Andresen, was running a website that gave out 5 Bitcoins to any user for solving a captcha (current street value: $575,000). But Morehead didn’t think much about it until a couple of years later, when another classmate, Briger, invited Morehead for coffee at the San Francisco office of Fortress to talk crypto, with Novogratz calling in. “Since then, I’ve been possessed by Bitcoin,” Morehead says.\nTech is famous for its so-called “mafias”—clusters of employees from prominent organizations like PayPal who go on to lead the next generation of startups. In crypto, it’s not a company but a university, with Princeton responsible for some of the industry’s most influential projects. Briger and Novogratz both served as key backers of Pantera, with Morehead even moving into empty office space at Fortress’s San Francisco office. Briger remains a powerful, albeit behind-the-scenes, presence in crypto, recently taking a seat on the board of directors of Michael Saylor’s $100 billion Bitcoin holding firm, Strategy. Novogratz went on to found Galaxy, one of the largest crypto conglomerates. And another classmate, Joe Lubin, went on to become one of the cofounders of Ethereum.\nBut back in 2013, it still seemed far-fetched that Ivy League graduates working in the rarified fields of private equity and macro trading would be interested in Bitcoin. Briger tells Fortune that he first learned about it from Wences Casares, an Argentine entrepreneur and early crypto adopter, while sharing a room at a Young Presidents’ Organization gathering in the San Juan Islands. Briger quickly saw the appeal of upending the global payments system—a point he sticks by today, though he argues that Bitcoin is still in its infancy. He says that Bitcoin mirrors the promise of the internet, which facilitated a new form of information flow. “The fact that money movement doesn’t happen in the same way is a real shame,” he says.\nAfter sharing the idea with Novogratz, they thought that Morehead, who had experience working in foreign exchange markets, would be the right person to bring on. When Morehead decided to devote the rest of his financial career to crypto, he rebranded Pantera as a Bitcoin fund and opened it back up to outside investors. Briger and Novogratz both signed on as limited partners, with Fortress and the venture firms Benchmark and Ribbit taking general partner stakes, though they would later withdraw. His old mentor at Tiger, the legendary investor Julian Robertson, even backed a later fund.\nIn the hurly-burly early days of crypto, entrepreneurs had to confront dramatic booms and busts that make today’s volatility look like minor blips. But the wild price roller-coaster wasn’t the biggest headache, Novogratz recalls. It was simply trying to procure BTC in the first place.\nHe went to Coinbase, then just a year old, to try and buy 30,000 Bitcoins, which would have sold for around $2 million. He was met with a pop-up that his limit was $50. After trying to work it out with Olaf Carlson-Wee—Coinbase’s first employee, who would go on to become a famed crypto figure in his own right—the firm agreed to increase his limit all the way to $300.\nMorehead’s most impressive achievement, however, may be sticking it out during the doldrums of 2013 through 2016, when prices remained in the basement and no one outside of the insular blockchain community paid Bitcoin much mind. “In those quiet years where crypto wasn’t doing shit, Dan was out there beating the pavement,” Novogratz tells Fortune.\nThat epoch still had its highlights, including three annual conferences hosted by Morehead out of his Lake Tahoe home. At one, Jesse Powell, cofounder of the exchange Kraken, opted out of taking a private plane chartered by Morehead and drove instead. “There was a large enough fraction of the Bitcoin community [there] that he feared if the plane crashed, it would take Bitcoin down,” Morehead recalls.\nUnlike many of his compatriots, Morehead never positioned himself as a “Bitcoin maxi,” or someone who argues that no other cryptocurrencies should exist. After buying up 2% of the global Bitcoin supply, Pantera became an early investor in Ripple Labs, which created the digital asset XRP. “The way I think about it is Bitcoin is obviously the most important,” Morehead says. “But there isn’t one internet company.”\nAccording to Morehead, Pantera has made money on 86% of its venture investments. It’s a staggering figure considering that the vast majority of VC-backed startups fail. Crypto may be more forgiving given that many projects come with an accompanying cryptocurrency, meaning speculative value often endures even if a startup’s product goes nowhere.\nMorehead now spends half his year in Puerto Rico, which has become a hotbed for crypto. Joey Krug, then a partner at Pantera and now at Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, had relocated down there, and Morehead decided to make the move. He estimates there are 1,000 blockchain entrepreneurs on the island, though they’ve drawn scrutiny for driving up real estate prices. Morehead faced an inquiry from the Senate Finance Committee over whether he violated federal tax laws by moving to the island and earning more than $850 million in capital gains from Pantera. He told the New York Times earlier this year that he believed he “acted appropriately with respect to my taxes” and declined to comment further to Fortune.\nMorehead acknowledges that much of the crypto industry is saturated with gambling, with Pantera staying away from memecoins, unlike many other venture firms. Still, he argues that it shouldn’t distract from blockchain’s broader goal of reshaping global finance. “It’s ridiculous to try and take down the blockchain industry because of a little sideshow,” he says. “[GameStop] doesn’t mean the entire U.S. equity market is tainted.”\nPantera continues to grow, including raising a fifth venture fund with a $1 billion target, which Morehead says the firm will close after finishing investing out of its fourth fund later this year. Pantera has also moved into the red-hot field of digital asset treasuries, where publicly traded companies buy and hold cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets.\nBut Bitcoin remains at the core of Pantera’s strategy. At the end of last year, its Bitcoin fund hit 1,000x, with a lifetime return of over 130,000%. When asked for a prediction of where Bitcoin is headed, Morehead has always had the same answer: The price will double in a year. For the most part, the simple model has worked, though Morehead admits the days of rapid growth are likely slowing down. He argues Bitcoin will still go up another order of magnitude, meaning it will approach $1 million, though he thinks that will be the last time it has a 10x increase.\nMorehead is happy to shoulder the criticism if Bitcoin never reaches that milestone. In 2016, after all, he was struggling to make the case for the cryptocurrency at $500. And less than a decade later, he’s just getting started. “I have the same conviction—the vast majority of institutions have zero,” he tells Fortune. “It feels like we have another couple of decades to go.”\nUpdated to reflect the latest regulatory filing figures on assets under management.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "content_hash": "a8e0237655ef8895573d1e67be72f410", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Among the cattle, Texas is also home to more than 15,300 wind turbines across 239 projects and 197 utility-scale solar farms.\n“Solar and wind energy now frequently provide more than 45% of the state’s electricity needs,” says Dennis Wamsted of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.\nWith such strong credentials in renewables, it is little wonder that proposals to build more than 100 new gas-fired power plants were met with furore among some. According to non-profit environmental group Environmental Integrity Project (EIP), as of April 2025, plans were afoot to build 108 new facilities and expand 17 others, adding as much as 58GW; there were also proposals, without specific detail, for five other projects.\nIn a June report, the EIP said many of the proposals included requests to access the Texas Energy Fund, which meant using state taxpayer dollars, adding further fuel to the fire. The group identified proposals such as the 930MW three gas‐turbine project near Corpus Christi; the 900MW two gas-turbine project west of Houston; and another 900MW facility to the south-west of the city.\nWamsted notes that how many of the proposals EIP identified will actually be built is left unanswered and believes Texas will continue to lead US renewables. However, “Texas is also the leading market for gas-based thermal power”, caveats Pavan Vyakaranam, energy analyst at Power Technology’s parent company GlobalData. According to GlobalData, Texas was home to 81.53GW of gas power capacity in 2024, far beyond runner-up Florida’s 54.96GW.\nIt is becoming increasingly likely that the state’s clean energy push may not go hand in hand with equal efforts to reduce thermal power as the energy transition requires – but why is Texas, alongside other US states and industrialised countries, looking at gas again?\nTech needs gas\nData centres are increasingly in demand as AI and automation markets boom. In the US, data centre investments nearly quadrupled between 2019 and 2024, according to International Energy Agency (IEA).\nWamsted says it is clear that in Texas, data centre buildout is a strong driving force behind the projected increase in power demand placed on the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).\nThis is not just a problem for Texas. IEA data shows that globally, data centre electricity consumption is expected to more than double to around 945 terawatt-hours by 2030.\nThe Trump administration has pushed for data centre and energy co-expansion across US states through favourable conditions such as tax incentives. The latest state to signal its intent to bank on this opportunity was Pennsylvania, which secured investment in excess of $90bn from technology, energy and finance companies to become an AI hub backed by state and federal economic incentives.\nAlthough many of the rumoured projects for this hub include clean energy, some are said to contain plans for new natural gas facilities, raising questions of which energy source is best suited to meet date centres’ needs.\nIn the US at least, with the Trump administration’s preference for hydrocarbons, gas power holds a significant advantage, says Vyakaranam. “In order to meet such a huge increase in demand [from data centres], there is a need for large capacity additions. With [Trump’s] pro-fossil fuel policies in place, it is both more economical and, from clearances perspective, easier to roll out gas-based projects than others like renewables.”\nHe also notes that gas power offers better grid stability with flexibility – able to be quickly started and stopped – and reliability – providing constant power generation to ensure continuous operations for data centres – in comparison to renewables. “Renewable power, due to its intermittent nature, cannot be a sole solution [for data centres] without any backup power or storage.”\nHowever, Wamsted is dismissive of the notion that gas is absolutely needed, saying any rise in demand can be met reliably and economically by renewable sources in markets like Texas with significant renewable capacity. “[In Texas] the 24/7 power demand sought by data centres and other high load users can be supplied by the ERCOT system. Saying data centres require gas or nuclear since they are supposedly more reliable is misleading,” he argues.\nDo renewables have the power over gas?\nWamsted notes that Texas’ growing renewables capacity meets much of the state’s needs even as demand on the ERCOT climbed by 31.3% between 2016 and 2024. “Texas actually is a prime example of how quickly we can transition grids from fossil fuels to renewable energy, even without state support,” he says.\nIn theory, Texas could prove it is possible to power the AI future with clean energy.\nMany Texas-based data centres are already trialling this. In 2024, Sabey Data Center Properties completed the construction of a Tier III two-storey 19,875m² facility in Austin, with a commitment to operate on 100% renewable energy. Similarly, Equinix built a Tier IV facility in Dallas to be entirely powered on renewables. As recently as April 2025, Soluna Holdings’ said its 120MW South Texas data centre project, Project Hedy, will also be powered entirely by wind.\nThere are others outside of the US, notes Vyakaranam. Malaysia’s Bridge Data Centres is actively integrating 400MW of renewable energy into its operations, with a commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040. The country’s AirTrunk Operating is also constructing a data centre with the capacity to generate up to 30MW of renewable energy.\nDespite these noteworthy blueprints, however, it seems Malaysia will also go big on gas as it tries to reduce coal use, yet balance the economic benefit of a growing data centre industry with the power it needs. With projections that the country will see demand triple in the five years to 2027, it plans to add 6–8GW of gas-fired capacity by the beginning of the next decade, according to the CEO of state utility provider Tenaga Nasional Berhad, Megat Jalaluddin.\nWhile the country also has a goal of doubling its renewable capacity by 2030, overall, the transition to clean energy is more a long-term goal than one to meet the urgent demands of data centres.\nMeanwhile, Vyakaranam says the US renewables sector is facing major challenges under the current administration, with Texas being no exception. “Trump’s position is poised to result in a significant increase in the growth of gas-powered energy production and stagnation of the renewables market,” he says.\nThis approach has its own difficulties. The US, Malaysia and others looking at a gas power boom face stiff competition for gas components – thus, heftier price tags.\nThe substantial increase in the gas-based project pipeline has seen the lead time for gas turbines reach around 5–7 years, according to GlobalData, meaning equipment manufacturers have had to ramp up production as they contend with huge order backlogs. “Power generation companies, in order to secure turbine supplies, are engaging in aggressive procurement strategies such as making order requests years in advance, diversifying their supplier network, and coming up with different project designs and configurations to avoid any grid reliability shortfalls,” Vyakaranam notes.\nThese considerations threaten Texas’ new gas turbine plans as they “cannot be resolved quickly, if at all”, warns Wamsted, adding that engineering, procurement and construction companies have “limited capability to meet the rapid proposed buildout”.\n“Both of these capacity problems are raising the cost of gas-fired generation, which could put a brake on planned additions,” he continues. “New gas pipelines will be needed for many of the planned expansion efforts, which will take time and have significant capital costs.”\nAre Malaysia and Texas part of a bigger picture?\nVyakaranam believes that renewables alone cannot yet power the world through its AI revolution – instead, gas power has to be part of the mix. “Although there will be a continued push towards renewables and battery storage innovations, which will eventually help meet data centres’ demand,” he says, “gas and nuclear will have to do some of the heavy lifting in the meantime.”\nWamsted takes a different view: “I would say it is renewables that can quickly and affordably meet the US’ rising electricity needs, not gas, which may be sold out through 2030, or nuclear, which is unlikely to add significant new capacity before 2035 at earliest.”\nHe also cautions against relying on gas alone. “All generation systems require maintenance and have unforced outages during the year […] Relying on one resource – or worse, one facility – would be highly risky,” he says.\nHowever, the same could be said about renewables, particularly given their reliance on weather conditions and without the support of energy storage.\nWith data centres – and everything they enable – now part of our world, it seems energy transition hopes are destined to do battle with our thirst for technology. With strong support and opposition for both renewables and gas power to support the AI boom, the reality is likely somewhere in between.\nTherefore, perhaps Texas and Malaysia have got it right, in spite of the raised eyebrows their approaches elicit. With battery storage still lacking, new gas turbines backlogged and nuclear, at best, a long-term investment, the best way to meet the exponentially increasing demand from data centres may be for renewables and gas power to work together.\nOf course, even this peculiar collaboration is not enough. To ensure a reliable and sustainable AI future, power capacity additions – regardless of energy source – will need to be paired with efforts to upgrade ageing grids, expand energy storage and decentralise energy systems as a whole, while tailoring energy solutions for each data centre to its local surroundings.\n\"Gas versus renewables: how will the power demand of data centres be met?\" was originally created and published by Power Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on SBSW. Sibanye Stillwater Limited's share was trading at $9.24 as of July 25th. SBSW’s trailing and forward P/E were 4.67 and 10.94, respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nA mine entrance, showcasing the precious metals and minerals that this company produces.\nSibanye-Stillwater (SBSW), a major producer of platinum group metals (PGMs)—platinum, palladium, and rhodium—offers a leveraged play on a sector where years of underinvestment and misjudged demand forecasts have created the setup for an extended upcycle. PGMs are essential for automotive catalysts and jewelry, with catalytic converters alone accounting for 43% of platinum and 84% of palladium demand.\nMarket pessimism has been fueled by overestimates of battery electric vehicle (BEV) penetration, but BEV sales growth in the U.S. and Europe flatlined in 2024, suggesting that internal combustion engine and hybrid vehicle demand—and thus PGM demand—will remain resilient. Supply is structurally constrained: South African PGM miners underspent by ~$18 billion over the last decade, 40% of global supply operates at or below cash costs, and production is forecast to decline through 2029.\nWith long lead times for new supply, a persistent deficit projected by the World Platinum Investment Council, and palladium in deficit until at least 2028, any uptick in demand can drive a sharp price response. Recycling, a secondary supply source, remains depressed post-COVID, adding to market tightness. SBSW’s profits, crushed by low PGM prices in 2024, have substantial torque to higher prices, as shown in 2020–2021 when the stock hit $20 on elevated metal prices.\nToday, at $7, platinum’s rebound to $1,250 suggests early signs of a cyclical turn. Risks include economic weakness, faster BEV adoption, and rising recycling supply, but with constrained production, a decade of underinvestment, and platinum already rallying, SBSW presents asymmetric upside if PGM prices sustain an upcycle.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Sibanye Stillwater Limited (SBSW) by Hugo Navarro in February 2025, highlighting its diversified asset base in PGMs, gold, lithium, and recycling, with growth levers despite weak PGM prices. The stock has appreciated by about 130% as PGM prices rebounded. The thesis still stands, and Walter99 shares a similar view but emphasizes SBSW’s leverage to a sustained PGM upcycle.\nSibanye Stillwater Limited is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 20 hedge fund portfolios held SBSW at the end of the first quarter which was 18 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of SBSW as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

That means that most investors can build their cash stakes, at least in part, by pruning appreciated holdings.\nHere’s some guidance on the amount, source, and location of those liquid reserves, according to the Bucket approach to retirement portfolio planning.\nRightsizing Bucket 1\nYour cash bucket should consist of one to two years’ worth of portfolio withdrawals, not living expenses.\nIn order to set up Bucket 1 initially, think through your cash flow sources for the first few years of retirement.\nFor example, let’s say a 66-year-old wants to retire in two years and expects that he’ll need to spend $80,000 per year, in total, from his $1.5 million portfolio, at that time. He wants to delay filing for Social Security until age 70, so all of his spending will come from his portfolio in those first few years of retirement. After that, roughly half his spending needs will come from Social Security.\nIf he wanted to be conservative, he could build a cash cushion consisting of $160,000—his years 1 and 2 portfolio withdrawals.\nHis Bucket 2—high-quality bonds—would consist of eight years’ worth of portfolio withdrawals, which at that point will be $40,000 per year. The remaining $1 million and change could go into a globally diversified equity portfolio.\nWhere to put the money?\nIt’s also worth considering the “where” of your liquid reserves. To do so, consider your sequence of withdrawals in retirement.\nTaxable accounts are often first in the queue for retirement withdrawals because their ongoing tax costs are higher than tax-sheltered accounts.\nBut some retirees may benefit from spending from their tax-deferred accounts early in retirement, with an eye toward reducing future required minimum distributions and tax bills. This is a good spot to get some advice from a financial or tax advisor.\nArmed with the knowledge of where you’ll turn for your spending in the first part of your retirement, you can then figure out where best to hold your liquid reserves.\nWhere to get the money?\nThe next step is figuring out how to build up this reserve. Ideally, you’d give yourself a couple of years to enlarge your cash position rather than having to find the money just before retirement.", "content_hash": "d794799e4693f2bdab0a76564c9014b3", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Visa ( V ): Which One of These Stocks Flashing Unusual Options Activity Wins Out ? ", "published_at": "2025-08-06T05:15:00+00:00", "source_id": "gdelt_finance_yahoo_com", "source_name": "finance.yahoo.com via GDELT", "crawl_method": "gdelt", "language": "en", "paywall": false, "text": "Last week, two financial services giants, Coinbase (COIN) and Visa (V), were key highlights in Barchart’s Unusual Stock Options Volume screener. However, this data interface covers 500 of the most aberrant securities. Just by logical inference, there’s simply no way that all 500 of these stocks are compelling bullish opportunities. So, it raises the question, which one of these giants deserves your attention?\nUnlike typical fare from the financial publication industry, I’m not going to leave you hanging — I have a clear opinion on the matter. But first, we should drill down what we saw in the derivatives arena.\nHeading into the weekend, total options volume for COIN stock reached 708,839 contracts, representing a 114.67% lift over the trailing one-month average. Further, call volume stood at 450,671 contracts, while put volume landed at 258,168 contracts. On paper, this dynamic seems favorable for Coinbase.\nDrilling into options flow — which focuses exclusively on big block transactions likely placed by institutional investors — the screener revealed that net trade sentiment reached about $2.371 million. However, relative to total gross bearish volume of over $18 million, the net trade sentiment metric wasn’t overwhelmingly significant.\nWhat did make COIN stock extremely conspicuous was its volatility. On Friday, the security lost almost 17% due to Coinbase missing analysts’ estimates for both earnings and revenues. Notably, total transaction revenues decreased 2.1% on a year-over-year basis to $764.3 million in the quarter. The deceleration was pegged to lower consumer and institutional transactions.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, total options volume for V stock clocked in at 49,931 contracts, representing a 72.51% lift over the trailing one-month average. Here, call volume was only 18,484 contracts while put volume stood at 31,447 contracts.\nStill, a similar dynamic materialized in Visa’s options flow screener, which showed net trade sentiment of $88,300. As it turned out, the biggest transactions in terms of dollar volume were for sold (credit-based) puts. Such transactions tend to have neutral-to-bullish posturing.\nUsing options data, nothing really separates Coinbase from Visa. Sure, the latter did beat earnings expectations. However, it also issued a cautious outlook that sent V stock tumbling.\nWhy One Name Stands Out From the Other\nAlthough unusual options data is intriguing, it’s difficult to extract a descriptive analysis from derivative market transactions. That’s because unusual options activity is happening pretty much all the time. Since we’re also dealing with continuous scalar signals, it’s impossible to objectively discern whether the activity is “good” or “bad” for bullish retail investors.\nContinuous signals are by nature unbounded, meaning that they could rise indefinitely. So, by logical deduction, no falsifiable mechanism exists to determine a share price as a “good discount” or if a company disclosed “bad earnings.” These are relative terms.\nAs far as I can tell, there’s only one objective truth: at the end of the day, the market is either a net buyer or a net seller. And critically, it can’t be both at the same time.\nThrough this framework, we can say that in the past 10 weeks, the market voted to buy V stock six times and sell four times. Through this period, the security incurred a downward bias. For brevity, we can label this sequence as 6-4-D.\nWhat’s significant here is that this quantitative signal has only materialized 15 times on a rolling basis since January 2019. Moreover, in 80% of cases, the following week’s price action results in upside, with a median return of 1.63%. In comparison, the chance that a long position in V stock will rise on any given week is 56.4%. Therefore, an incentive exists to take a wager here, assuming that the implications of the 6-4-D hold true.\nFor COIN stock, the past 10 weeks saw an even split in terms of market sentiment dominance. Overall, the security saw an upward bias and therefore, the sequence can be abbreviated as 5-5-U. Unfortunately, with this signal, the chance that COIN will rise in the following week is only 50%.\nTo be fair, the baseline probability for COIN stock on any given week is only 46.22%. On a relative scale, investors have an edge. However, it’s a tiny one and without a directional bias, the most realistic options strategy may be an iron condor of some sort.\nIron condors can be awesome vehicles in the right circumstances. At the same time, they tend to be quite expensive due to setting up profitability zones on opposing ends. Therefore, I believe speculators would be better served with Visa stock. It’s boring, yes, but it appears to be giving you a directional edge.\nPutting the Numbers Together for V Stock\nBased on the market intelligence above, a solid idea to consider is the 345/350 bull call spread expiring Sep. 19. This transaction involves buying the $345 call and simultaneously selling the $350 call, for a net debit paid of $250. Should V stock rise through the short strike price ($350) at expiration, the maximum profit is also $250, a payout of 100%.\nIt goes without saying that much hinges on the statistical reliability of the 6-4-D sequence. Running a one-tailed binomial test reveals a p-value of 0.053. That means there’s a 5.3% chance that the implications of the signal could materialize randomly as opposed to intentionally. That’s right near the cusp of statistical significance, making Visa stock very intriguing.\nTo be clear, a high confidence level of non-randomness doesn’t necessarily mean that upside odds this week are absolutely 80%. Sentiment regimes can change without warning since the stock market is an open, entropic system. That said, from a descriptive point of view, the odds favor the bulls right now.\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Rivian is currently able to sell EVs directly to consumers in 25 states and in Washington, D.C.\nOhio’s BMV did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n“Ohio’s prohibition of Rivian’s direct-sales-only business model is irrational in the extreme: it reduces competition, decreases consumer choice, and drives up consumer costs and inconvenience — all of which harm consumers — with literally no countervailing benefit,” lawyers for the company wrote in the complaint.\nRivian is asking the court to allow the company to apply for a dealership license so it can sell vehicles directly. Ohio customers have to buy from Rivian vehicles from locations in other states where direct sales are allowed. The cars are then shipped to Rivian service centers within Ohio.\nAllowing Rivian to sell directly would not be treading new legal ground, the company argues in its complaint. Tesla has had a license to sell in Ohio since 2013 and can sell directly to consumers.\nWhat’s stopping Rivian is a 2014 law passed by the state’s legislature. That law, which Rivian says came after an intense lobbying effort by the Ohio Automobile Dealers Association (OADA), effectively gave Tesla a carve-out and blocked any future manufacturers from acquiring the necessary dealership licenses. (The OADA did not immediately return a request for comment.)\n“Consumer choice is a bedrock principle of America’s economy. Ohio’s archaic prohibition against the direct-sales of vehicles is unconstitutional, irrational, and harms Ohioans by reducing competition and choice and driving up costs and inconvenience,” Mike Callahan, Rivian’s chief administrative officer, said in a statement.\nRivian has won legal fights over direct sales before. In 2021, Rivian and Lucid Motors were granted dealership licenses to sell EVs in Illinois. That state’s dealer association sued to try to block Rivian and Lucid from selling directly but ultimately failed.\nLucid Motors, meanwhile, filed a lawsuit of its own in Texas in 2022 in a challenge to that state’s direct-sales ban.

This suggests XRP could be in the early stages of a short-term breakout.\nJoin the discussion with CryptoWendyO on Roundtable here.\nIf XRP breaks through the $3.10 level, analysts believe it could rally to $3.30 — putting it within striking distance of its 2018 all-time high of $3.84. However, if the rally fades, XRP could fall back to $2.85 as support.\nLong-term conviction\nXRP’s long-term holders — also known as HODLers — are growing in number.

Subscribe to our free daily Nrn newsletter.\nEYM Café — a former operator of at least 13 Panera Bread cafes in Eastern Texas — has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, court records show.\nPer the EYM Café bankruptcy documents, the former Panera operator had little to no assets, and between $10 million and $50 million in debt owed to at least 100 creditors. The bankruptcy documents show that EYM Café owes rent to 13 different landlords, $550,000 in federal taxes to the Internal Revenue Service, and $354,714 in Texas state taxes.\nEYM Café is operated by Eduardo Diaz as part of EYM Group. Pizza Hut franchisee, EYM Pizza and KFC franchisee, EYM Chicken — also operated by Diaz — separately filed for bankruptcy in July 2024, and June, respectively. Following bankruptcy proceedings, EYM Pizza shuttered and sold more than 77 Pizza Hut restaurants. Additionally, 10 months prior to filing for bankruptcy in June, EYM Chicken abruptly closed about 25 KFC restaurants in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin.\nEYM Café’s Chapter 11 filing reflects ongoing legal and financial issues with the group. In March 2024, EYM Group, which at the time operated 142 Pizza Hut locations across Illinois, Indiana, Georgia, South Carolina, and Wisconsin, filed a lawsuit against Pizza Hut, alleging a breach of contract. Later that year, Pizza Hut countersued EYM Group for failing to pay royalties on time, which led to a legal dispute that was later settled when EYM Pizza filed for bankruptcy following a precipitous decline in sales.\nAccording to Google and Yelp listings, many of the Panera Bread cafes operated by EYM Group have since closed.\nContact Joanna at joanna.fantozzi@informa.com", "content_hash": "a1ccc5594270179d71bac5322ca364d4", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

However, it maintained guidance of between $6 and $7 billion FCF in 2025, on par with its 2024 $6.767 billion FCF.\nIf that actually happens, PYPL stock could be undervalued. It could be worth over 30% more at $88.35 per share. This article will show why.\nPYPL is at $67.75 in midday trading on Monday, Aug. 4. That's about $10 below its pre-earnings peak of $77.98 on July 24. Moreover, PYPL is still well below its Jan. 30 peak of $89.57.\nStrong Margins Except for Free Cash Flow\nPayPal's revenue rose +5.1% YoY to $8.288 billion, which was slightly higher (+2.56%) than analysts' estimates of $8.081 billion. Moreover, most of its margins were flat or slightly higher, except for free cash flow (FCF).\nFor example, its all-important take-rate (i.e., revenue / total payment volume (TPV) fell just 2 basis points to 1.87% from 1.89% last year. That means that with higher TPV volume, PayPal is still able to “take” its traditional fees from customers.\nIn addition, its transaction margin (TM) (i.e., TM/revenue) rose just slightly to 46.38% from 45.76% last year. (Note the company talks about TM dollars up 7%, but this does not compare TM against higher revenue.)\nHowever, PayPal's operating cash flow (OCF) fell 41.1% from $1.525 billion last year to just $898 million. The deck said that this was affected by shifts in working capital timing (remember OCF includes addbacks to net income, one of which is changes in net working capital).\nAfter slightly higher capex, this led to a 49% drop in free cash flow (FCF) from $1.368 billion to $692 million. Its adj. FCF was 42.5% lower at $656 million.\nHowever, PayPal implied in its guidance that this was a one-off dip. In other words, the net working capital movements that led to a dip in Q2 will balance out later in the year. It maintained its outlook on page 14 of its Q2 presentation deck from last year that FCF would range between $6 billion and $7 billion. That would be on par with its 2024 FCF of $6.767 billion.\nSo, if that happens, could PYPL stock be undervalued here? Let's look at its FCF yield metrics.\nSetting a Price Target Using FCF Yield\nPayPal does not pay a dividend to shareholders. But, if it did, the payment would be funded by its free cash flow. Let's just assume that it eventually pays out 50% of FCF to shareholders.\nWhat would the stock be worth then?\nHere is how we can work that out. Using the company's guidance (see above), we could expect at least $6.5 billion in FCF this year. That represents 19.7% of analysts' estimates of $33.03 billion in revenue this year. Moreover, next year they are projecting $35.05 billion, so FCF could rise to:\n$35.05 billion x 0.197 = $6.9 billion FCF 2026\nThat implies that its FCF yield is 10.68% given its market cap today of $64.59 billion (according to Yahoo! Finance).\nIf PayPal paid out 50% of that to shareholders, that would equal $3.45 billion, or a dividend yield of over 5%:\nHowever, this may be too high a yield, and the stock's market cap might rise to lower this yield. For example, Stock Analysis shows PayPal has generated $5.3 billion in trailing 12-month (TTM) FCF. So, its TTM FCF yield is lower than 10.68%:\nTherefore, if PayPal paid out 50% of its FCF as a dividend, the equivalent dividend should be 4.095%:\n$3.45b 2026 div / 0.04095 = $84.25 billion projected mtk cap\nThat is 30.4% higher than today's market value of $64.59 billion. In other words, PYPL stock is potentially worth +30.4% more than today's price of $67.75:\n$67.75 x 1.304 = $88.35 target price\nAnalysts Agree PYPL Stock is Undervalued\nYahoo! Finance shows that 43 analysts covering PYPL have an average price target of $83.26. That's +22% higher than today's price. Similarly, Barchart's survey shows an average of $81.14.\nSimilarly, Stock Analysis shows that 33 analysts have an average price target of $83.00. However, AnaChart.com, which tracks recent analyst recommendations, shows that 35 analysts have an average price target of $89.04. That is closer to my price target of $88.35 above.\nAs a result, the average survey price target from analysts is $84.11, or +23.6% higher than today's price.\nThe bottom line here is that either using a FCF analysis or just from analysts' target prices, PYPL stock looks to be too cheap.\nOne way to play this is to sell short out-of-the-money (OTM) put options. That way, an investor can get paid while waiting to buy in at a lower price.\nShorting OTM PYPL Put Options\nFor example, look at the Sept. 5 expiration period, 32 days from now (days to expiry or DTE). The $65 strike price put option contract has a midpoint premium of $1.03. This strike perice is 4% below the trading price (i.e., out-of-the-money or OTM).\nThat means a short-seller of this put contract makes an immediate yield of 1.585% (i.e., $1.03/$65.00 = 0.015846).\nThe investor first secures $6,500 in cash or buying power with their brokerage firm. Then they enter an order to “Sell to Open” 1 put contract at $65.00 for expiry on Sept. 5.\nThe account will then immediately receive $103.00 (i.e., $1.03 x 100 shares since each put contract represents 100 shares). So, the $103.00 income represents 1.585% of the $6,500 secured as collateral.\nAs long as PYPL stays over $65.00 on or before Sept. 5, the account will not be assigned to buy 100 shares at $65.00. But, even if this happens, the net breakeven buy-in is just $63.97 (i.e., $65.00-$1.03). That is 5.9% or more below today's price, so it provides good downside protection.\nMore risk-averse investors can sell short the $64.00 strike price put contract and still receive $79 for an investment of $6,400. That represents a 1.234% one-month yield.\nNote that there is a slightly lower delta ratio, -22%, or a 22% chance that PYPL will fall to this strike price. That is based on historical volatility.\nThe bottom line is that investors can set a lower buy-in by shorting OTM puts. Moreover, existing investors in PYPL can earn a pseudo dividend yield here.\nFor example, if this 1.585% short-put one-month yield play can be repeated over 3 months, the expected return yield is 4.755%. That is higher than our expected 4.1% annual dividend yield if PayPal were to pay out 50% of its FCF next year (see above).\nThe bottom line is that PYPL stock looks deeply undervalued here. One way to play it is to short OTM puts in nearby expiry periods.\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

It could be seen as a stark warning or as simple pragmatism: The single most important skill for young workers at this moment is not specialization, but the ability to learn rapidly and adapt continuously. His reasoning is simple yet profound: “ChatGPT can teach you any new areas,” rendering traditional academic paths and fixed skill sets increasingly obsolete. The title of the episode was more blunt: “College Degrees Are Becoming Useless.”\nThe Sun Microsystems cofounder, known for his contrarian views and unwavering certainty in technological possibilities, painted a future where artificial intelligence (AI) will fundamentally transform the job market. He asserted that “there isn’t a job where AI won’t be able to do 80% of 80% of all jobs” within the next three to five years. He explained that the vast majority of all job functions will be replicable by AI, hence the 80% of 80% estimate. It recalled Sam Altman’s claim that AI will result in “intelligence too cheap to meter.”\nLooking 10 to 15 years out, Khosla said, he believes “there’s no chance there’s a job that humans do that AI can’t do almost as well.” He allowed for some minor exceptions and said even heart or brain surgery an AI should theoretically be able to perform to a high level, although regulation may not allow it. This rapid pace of change, faster than the world has seen in the past 50 years, demands a radical shift in how young people approach their careers, he argued.\nFor a 22-year-old wondering where to focus their efforts, Khosla’s advice is clear: “You have to optimize your career for flexibility, not a single profession.” He emphasized that the value of learning lies not in mastering one specific trade like welding, finance, or even accounting, but in cultivating “the ability to learn” in its own right. He claimed that at 70 years old, he is learning at a much faster pace than ever before, and every young person should strive for this capability. This includes thinking from first principles and jumping into diverse fields, whether physics, biology, or finance, because AI tools will facilitate the rapid acquisition of new knowledge.\nKhosla argued that even disciplines like computer science are valuable less for programming expertise (which AI increasingly handles) and more for the “process of thinking” and understanding systems and architectures they impart. The ultimate goal for a young individual, he suggests, is to choose a path where “your knowledge compounds and your capability compounds over time,” mirroring the principle of financial compounding in knowledge acquisition.\nThe quality of the entrepreneur\nFor aspiring entrepreneurs, Khosla advises a strategic focus, since he believes that anybody in any industry not using AI will be rendered obsolete by somebody who is using the tool. While AI may democratize technology, he said, success will hinge on the innate “quality of the entrepreneur”—their ability to think strategically, envision long-term goals, select the right teams, and wisely choose who to trust for advice. Khosla believes the current shortage is not of technology or capital, but of “great entrepreneurs who know how to make these choices.”\nBeyond individual careers, Khosla and Kamath talked about the wider implications of AI on the economy. Khosla said it should drive down the cost of many things, acting as a deflationary force on many services, and he envisioned an AI-powered utopian future where services like education, medical expertise, and legal advice become “almost free.” He speculated that in 20 to 25 years, $10,000 might buy more goods and services than $50,000 does today, thanks to the deflationary impact of machines providing abundant services.\nThe career path open to Gen Z\nKhosla is far from the only thought leader weighing in on the employment prospects for Gen Z in the age of AI. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang have engaged in an ever-more-heated war of words over the former’s doomsday prediction that 50% of all white-collar jobs will be wiped out. Geoffrey Hinton, the “godfather of AI,” has largely agreed with Amodei, saying that only the “very skilled” will remain employed. Huang and Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell have largely agreed with Khosla, arguing that creativity and constant learning will create new jobs for the economy in a virtuous cycle.\nGoldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius has looked at the data and echoed Khosla’s argument that college degrees are losing value, finding that the “safety premium” of a college degree is disappearing. Berkeley economist Brad DeLong agrees that the college degree is losing its status but casts the blame away from AI and toward the policy uncertainty plaguing the economy, arguing that many Gen Z college graduates are going unhired because conditions are just too risky for most companies. Goldman seems to agree with DeLong, finding in July that AI was overhyped as a reason for most corporate layoffs. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve isn’t completely sold on the revolutionary prospects of AI, arguing that it may be a revolutionary invention like the electric dynamo, but may end up being a one-off boost to productivity, like the light bulb.\nGen Z, for its part, seems to be craving more human connection. Starbucks recently announced it would sunset its mobile-only locations, thought to be more appealing to Gen Z and a desire for “frictionless” experience, in favor of a renewed emphasis on hospitality and human-to-human connection. The generation has been weathering criticism of late that they lack the social skills necessary for success, with the stereotypical “Gen Z stare” at the center of the conversation. Careers site Glassdoor, for its part, has punctured the myth of “conscious unbossing” by Gen Zers, finding that they are becoming managers at exactly the same historical rate as any other generation, AI notwithstanding.\nUltimately, Khosla’s message for the next generation is one of relentless pursuit of learning and adaptability. In a world rapidly being reshaped by AI, the ability to continuously reinvent oneself and embrace new knowledge may be the ultimate differentiator for survival and success. The human capacity to learn new things, after all, is endless.\nFor this story, Fortune used generative AI to help with an initial draft.

SHAK’s trailing and forward P/E were 476.48 and 99.01, respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nShake Shack (SHAK) has surged ~72% since April 2025, driven by optimism around margin expansion, store growth guidance, and marketing under CEO Rob Lynch, but the rally rests on shaky fundamentals. Comparable sales (SSS) have recovered to low single-digit growth post-April due largely to aggressive promotions and limited-time offers (LTOs), masking longer-term traffic declines.\nManagement’s plan to grow to 1,500 company-owned stores by 2037 appears overly ambitious given intensifying competition and the limited whitespace in Tier 1 markets, where rivals like Five Guys have already slowed expansion. The Street is also overly optimistic on margin expansion, forecasting a 220 bps increase through 2027, but most gains to date have come from low-hanging cost cuts such as labor reductions.\nPromotional deals touted as margin accretive, like free items with modest minimum spend, risk cannibalizing average order value rather than driving incremental revenue. Heavy reliance on LTOs, exemplified by the Dubai Chocolate Shake temporarily accounting for 5% of sales, creates a vulnerability as colder months approach and seasonal demand fades. Analyst extrapolations of these outsized results appear unrealistic, setting up for negative revisions.\nMeanwhile, Lynch’s operational track record raises concerns: his tenure at Papa John’s saw deteriorating product quality, strained franchisee relations, and a 50% stock decline post-COVID, all blamed on external pressures but widely attributed to cost-cutting that compromised brand equity. SHAK’s value proposition hinges on quality ingredients, making further erosion of this core differentiator particularly risky. Any guidance cut, LTO pullback, or quality misstep could trigger a sharp rerating from current levels.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Wingstop Inc. (WING) by Monopolistic Investor in March 2025, which highlighted strong operating efficiency, rapid expansion plans, and upside potential despite high leverage. The company’s stock price has appreciated by approximately 29% since our coverage, as growth and margins continued to impress. The thesis still stands on long-term expansion. stressed_senior110 shares a contrarian view on Shake Shack Inc.

Pakistan is boosting its sugar imports in an attempt to stabilize domestic prices.\nMore News from Barchart\nLast Friday, NY sugar slid to a 1.5-week low and London sugar fell to a 4-week low on signs of stronger sugar production in Brazil. Last Thursday, Unica reported Brazil's Center-South sugar output in the first half of July rose +15% y/y to 3.4 MMT. Also, the amount of sugarcane being crushed for sugar by Brazil's sugar mills has increased to 54% from 50% the same time last year.\nThe outlook for higher sugar production in Brazil is bearish for sugar prices. Datagro said last Monday that dry weather in Brazil has encouraged the country's sugar mills to increase their cane crushing, diverting more of the cane crush toward more profitable sugar production rather than ethanol.\nThe outlook for higher sugar exports from India is negative for prices after Bloomberg reported that India may permit local sugar mills to export sugar in the next season, which starts in October, as abundant monsoon rains may produce a bumper sugar crop. India's Meteorological Department reported today that cumulative monsoon rain in India is at 500.8 mm, or 4% above normal as of August 4. Also, the Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association said last Thursday that it will seek permission to export 2 MMT of sugar in 2025/26.\nThe outlook for higher sugar production in India, the world's second-largest producer, is bearish for prices. On June 2, India's National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories projected that India's 2025/26 sugar production would climb +19% y/y to 35 MMT, citing larger planted cane acreage.

With the FCA preparing a sweeping redress scheme covering historic discretionary commission arrangements, banks and brokers now face the challenge of unpicking years of legacy data, contracts, and consumer interactions — often dating back to 2007.\nLegal experts say the UK Supreme Court has handed down one of the most consequential rulings for the motor finance industry in years — dramatically reducing the scope of legal liability for firms involved in discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs), while leaving the door open for regulatory redress on a vast scale.\nAnnounced on 1 August, the judgment in a trio of linked cases — Johnson v FirstRand Bank, Wrench v FirstRand Bank, and Hopcraft v Close Brothers — determined that motor dealers arranging finance do not owe a fiduciary duty to consumers, even when they fail to disclose commission arrangements. Observers say this wipes out a key legal argument underpinning many of the thousands of historic motor finance complaints lodged in recent years.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has since announced plans for a much smaller redress scheme, that could ultimately cost lenders between £9 billion and £18 billion.\nAccording to Fitch Ratings, the Supreme Court ruling “materially reduces the potential scope of consumer redress for UK banks,” especially since it rejects the fiduciary duty argument. Large-scale claims based solely on the non-disclosure of commissions are now unlikely to have legal traction.\nHowever, this doesn’t mean banks are off the hook. The FCA has already confirmed it will launch a consultation this October on a sector-wide redress scheme. The scheme would require lenders to reassess complaints relating to DCAs issued between 2007 and 2021 and compensate customers for overcharging — plus interest.\nFitch estimates that of the £9–18 billion in potential costs, £5–11 billion may fall on banks, with the rest borne by non-bank lenders such as car manufacturers’ captive finance arms. While Fitch says this is largely “absorbable from earnings or actions already taken,” it expects banks will need to increase the £2 billion in redress provisions they’ve already set aside.\nThe rating agency adds that the financial impact is unlikely to be evenly distributed, since lenders had differing commission structures, sales volumes and documentation quality during the review period.\nFrom a legal standpoint, experts broadly welcomed the clarity provided by the ruling.\nJonathan Butler, legal counsel to the Vehicle Remarketing Association (VRA) and a partner at Geldards, highlighted three practical implications for motor retailers and lenders. “Firstly, we shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that this is good news,” he said. Potential exposure is “well below the largest forecasts,” with many claims likely capped at under £950.\nSecondly, he stressed that firms can now begin assessing their risk. “They should be tracking down all relevant paperwork dating back to the 2007 cut-off point… If it clearly explained that a commission was due and they can show the level was less than 55%, they roughly know the maximum that will be payable.”\nButler’s third point is more of a warning: firms must scrutinise old contracts with finance providers to check for indemnity clauses. These sometimes required dealers to cover the cost of customer claims — and may now be enforceable.\nHe also cast doubt on the practical viability of the FCA’s redress model: “The Johnson-type threshold is actually a value judgment… These are highly fact sensitive matters. It needs qualified people to make assessments… It’s far from clear how the FCA envisages this working in the real world.”\nAcross the legal sector, most commentary saw the judgment as a partial win for the industry, but not a clean slate.\nTim West, dispute resolution partner at Ashurst, said the ruling clarifies that claimants now face a higher bar to prove dealers owed them an undivided duty of loyalty. “This will make motor finance claims based on undisclosed commissions more difficult to bring,” he said. However, he added that the door remains open to unfair relationship claims under the CCA, where commissions were particularly large or hidden.\nLorraine Johnston, Ashurst financial regulation partner, agreed. “The decision on Johnson will give the government stronger grounds to progress CCA reform with greater vigour,” she said, adding that the FCA will now likely pursue “a more limited redress scheme” for DCA cases over a defined period.\nSteven Francis of Faegre Drinker described the ruling as a “real vindication” for lenders, given the rejection of fiduciary duty arguments. But he warned: “The Supreme Court also found that the relationship [between Mr Johnson and FirstRand] was unfair… The importance of this should not be overlooked.” That aspect, he said, would require lenders to revisit their historic practices.\nRichard Coates, head of automotive at Freeths, reinforced the point: “The judgment opens the gateway for consumers to bring claims under the Consumer Credit Act, where particularly large commissions have been paid.”\nUnsurprisingly, law firms representing consumers saw the decision differently.\nCoby Benson, solicitor at Bott & Co, called it a “serious setback for financial justice” and warned it “sends a concerning message to the industry that a lack of transparency can go unpunished.” Nonetheless, he insisted that “we will not stop here,” suggesting new legal arguments may be pursued under the CCA.\nRobert Whitehead, chairman of Barings Law, described the judgment as a “major blow to consumer protection” and a missed opportunity for accountability. “Thousands of car buyers were sold finance deals without ever being told that brokers and dealers were pocketing secret commissions,” he said. “It’s disappointing that the Supreme Court has chosen not to hold the industry accountable.”\nEven if litigation risk has narrowed, the motor finance sector still faces an enormous operational burden, reputational challenges and regulatory scrutiny.\nRichard Barnwell, partner at BDO, warned that while fiduciary duty claims have been ruled out, redress for unfair relationships could still reach “£5–13 billion or more.”\nBrian Nimmo, head of redress at Broadstone, added that lenders must now “review all of their DCA cases, assess whether they are unfair and then calculate potential redress, which will be a significant exercise.”\nGreg Huitson-Little, of Menzies LLP, pointed to the long-term consequences for public trust: “Although the Supreme Court’s decision reverses much of the Court of Appeal’s earlier decisions, the reputational damage is already done… The days of opaque ‘deals’ must come to an end.”\nAnd from a market-wide lens, Ian Hughes, CEO of Consumer Intelligence, summarised the ruling as “clarity the industry needed” but also a call to action. “The industry must meet this challenge constructively… This is a consequence of legacy practices from a minority of market participants.”\nIndustry observers say the FCA’s upcoming consultation will be crucial in determining how redress is structured — especially whether it requires consumers to opt in, or whether lenders will be expected to proactively compensate affected borrowers. With final rules not expected until 2026, the industry now enters a period of preparation, calculation and, for many, negotiation over who ultimately bears the cost of past practices.\nThe legal questions may be answered — but the financial, operational and reputational challenges are only just beginning.\n\"Motor finance sector braces for operational test after Court ruling\" was originally created and published by Leasing Life, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

It needed approval from at least three quarters of creditors to unlock an emergency loan from its own founders, the billionaire Lewis family.\nHowever, the company did not secure 75pc of the vote in every individual class of creditor, with some landlords resisting the plans. There are 10 creditor categories, ranging from councils owed business rates to landlords. Store owners include British Land, the Crown Estate and Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group.\nOf the stores in the plan that River Island is not proposing to close, the company is aiming for three-year rent cuts of between 75pc and 25pc. The owners of 24 shops are asked to accept zero rental payments.\nThe plan will be put before the High Court on Thursday for a formal decision on whether to approve the restructuring.\nA spokesman for River Island said: “River Island circulated its proposals for a restructuring plan to creditors on June 20. In combination with the company’s ongoing transformation strategy, the plan is a proactive measure to place the company on a firm footing.\n“We have been having positive conversations with key stakeholders and are confident that we will achieve approval of the plan in the coming days.”\nRiver Island employs 5,300 staff in around 230 stores and another 950 at its headquarters in Hanger Lane, West London.\nIt blamed its liquidity crisis on “a sharp rise in the cost of doing business over the last few years” and the shift to online shopping, burdening it with “a large portfolio of stores that is no longer aligned to our customers’ needs”.\nSome landlords have expressed frustration at the fact that they face financial pain as a result of what they claim is the retailer’s mismanagement.\n“This is family-run, they’ve just overstretched, and it’s unfair that the landlords will struggle because they haven’t maintained their relevance,” one landlord, whose stores are unaffected, previously told The Telegraph.", "content_hash": "440f63c0e9f1031c6fd7b6713f21dd6d", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

According to a CivicScience survey at the time, 38% expected improvement in their personal finances over the subsequent six months. But with the uncertainty over tariffs and the economy as a whole in 2025, some of that optimism has worn off.\nHere’s a look at the factors affecting Americans’ perceptions of their own financial situation and how they tend to change over time.\nHow Do Americans Feel About Their Finances in 2025?\nAccording to Gallup, as of April 2025, Americans have decidedly soured on the economy, the stock market and their own personal finances. In fact, the Gallup data shows that a record-high 53% of Americans now believe their financial situation is actually getting worse.\nThis is the first time since 2021 that a majority of Americans have felt pessimistic about their finances and marks a decided change from January 2025, when the majority were much more positive about the stock market and the economy.\nHow much have opinions changed? Here’s an overview of the Gallup poll results:\n-\nThe stock market: In January, 61% of respondents felt the stock market would go up, but in April, 58% expected the market to fall.\n-\nInflation: In January, 52% of respondents expected inflation to go up, but that percentage increased to 63% by April.\n-\nInterest rates: The percentage of Americans expecting inflation to rise jumped from 52% in January to 63% in April.\nCheck Out: I’m an Economist — Here’s How Likely a Recession Is for the Second Half of 2025\nPerhaps most significantly, a record high of respondents said that their financial situation is getting worse. More than half called their financial situation either fair or poor, with only 10% regarding it as excellent. Similarly, Americans’ outlook for the future has soured, as well. The Gallup research shows that a record-high 53% of respondents see their financial position as getting worse, versus just 38% seeing a major improvement.\nHow Much Do Tariffs Play a Role?\nIt’s likely more than a coincidence that Americans changed their attitudes about the economy and their finances shortly after President Donald Trump announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs. If nothing else, the uncertainty regarding exactly what the final tariff policy will look like — and how it will affect American businesses — has diminished the confidence of the American consumer over the short run.", "content_hash": "c1020abb55c83ee1e2c2b29a90bb7cde", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

(NYSE: SDHC), which went public in January 2024, positioned itself as a disciplined growth story in the high-demand housing markets of the Southeastern and Southern U.S., focusing on resilient entry-level and empty-nester buyers. Its “land-light” model, leveraging finished lots through option contracts, and an efficient operating culture under seasoned leadership, fueled rapid growth, with 2024 closings and revenue rising 25% and 28%, respectively.\nHowever, early 2025 revealed a stark reversal. While Q1 revenue grew 19% year-over-year, gross margins compressed sharply to 23.8%, pressured by rising lot costs and sales incentives, while net new orders stagnated at 768 homes. Backlog collapsed by 29% in units and 29% in value, foreshadowing weaker future revenue. Cash burn accelerated, with operating cash outflows surging to $34.9 million and leverage rising from 0.8% to 9.5%, eroding the balance sheet.\nSDHC’s model, highly reliant on third-party developers, faces external risks, including affordability pressures from mortgage rates likely to remain above 6%, lumber price volatility, and potential U.S.–Canada softwood duties doubling. Competitive comparisons are unfavourable: Green Brick Partners’ 31.2% gross margin and Dream Finders Homes’ 18% growth in net orders highlight SDHC’s operational underperformance.\nA $50 million buyback and insider purchases project confidence, yet with cash reserves halved, the move may reflect financial engineering ahead of declining earnings.

The U.S. copper tariffs were only on semi-finished products such as wires and pipes, and spared key inputs like ore, cathodes, and concentrates, which are the most commonly imported forms of copper.\nSupplies of copper had been previously rushed into the U.S. to frontload ahead of what were expected to be much wider-encompassing Trump copper tariffs. Analysts now warn that the U.S. may face a glut of copper, with excess inventory potentially being re-exported and adding further pressure to global prices.\nThe huge sell-off in copper futures last week spilled over into price pressure on other metals futures markets, including silver (SIU25), platinum (PLV25), palladium (PAU25), and even gold (GCQ25). That's because panic selling in copper futures spooked the traders of other metals, prompting very degrees of selling pressure, including sharp losses in silver.\nThere’s an old trader adage that says when markets turn very anxious, “If you can’t sell what you want, you sell what you can.” Such was likely the case for at least some copper traders last week.\nLME, COMEX Warehouse Stocks Told a Telling Tale\nAlso, in anticipation of U.S. copper tariffs, reports said copper was transferred from the London Metals Exchange (LME) warehouses to COMEX warehouses. At the end of 2024, LME copper stocks were 271,400 metric tons (MT), and then fell two-thirds to 90,625 MT, at the end of June.\nIn the meantime, COMEX copper warehouse inventories rose by around 125%, from 93,161 MT to 211,209 MT. In late July, LME stocks were 136,850 MT, with COMEX stocks at 250,819 MT.\n“The bottom line is that copper that flowed from abroad to the U.S. had distorted the supply and demand fundamentals, leading to a significant price divergence. The divergence corrected with the price carnage on July 30 and 31,” reported Andy Hecht.\nTakeaways for Traders of All Markets\nThose of us who have been in the marketplace for many years have seen a few of them. They don’t come often, but when they do, they are dreaded. When unexpected market shocks like last week’s copper debacle occur, all hell can break loose in the marketplace, or at least within a market sector. Those unexpected shocks to the markets blindside all traders and can propel price volatility into the stratosphere.\nThe assassination attempt on President Reagan, the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, the stock market crash of 1987, the failed coup attempt in the former Soviet Union, the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the U.S, the COVID-19 eruption, and now the copper debacle. These are a few of history’s fundamental general marketplace, or market sector, shocks that I have experienced as a market watcher over the past 40-plus years.\nFortunately, I have never been caught in a real bad way on the wrong side of markets when prices have reacted violently to unexpected shocks. However, I have occasionally pondered the risk of being in the middle of a trade when a shock does occur. I have heard horror stories of traders getting wiped out in a single day and never recovering.\nOf course, there are always a few who happen to be on the right side of a market when an unexpected shock occurs, and they might make a quick and unexpected fortune. However, more times than not, a market shock will initially cause price volatility both on the upside and on the downside, as markets react and then overreact to early reports and rumors of a major shock event. That kind of volatility is detrimental to both bulls and bears.\nWhat to Do?\nWhat can a trader do to prepare for these rare market shocks? Frankly, not much can be done, effectively. Of a bigger danger to most traders are what I call the mini-shocks in markets, such as the “Mad Cow” disease scare in cattle futures, or the “irrational exuberance” phrase famously uttered in a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, which rattled the financial markets. I would categorize the copper debacle as a mini-shock because it impacted only a few markets.\nOne way to try to prevent being on the wrong side of a major or mini market shock would be to purchase well out-of-the money put or call options on futures that are “on the other side” of a bigger trading position you have in place. For example, if a trader has a big long position on in grains heading into a summertime weekend — when weather patterns can be less predictable —they may choose to purchase cheaper out-of-the money put options to somewhat hedge that long grain futures position.\nBut this particular type of hedge with options is usually less-than-ideal, and does cut into any already-accrued profits. Putting on this type of hedge on a regular basis would be akin to driving down the street in your passenger car not only wearing your safety belts, but also wearing a crash helmet.\nMore often than not, these rare shocks to markets are just a slight risk that all traders have to accept to be in the business of trading. Worrying too much about the phenomenon is a psychological negative that can, by itself, be damaging to a trader.\nTell me what you think.

Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc.'s share was trading at $27.61 as of July 28th.\nA scientist in a laboratory coat looking into a microscope at human bone regeneration samples.\nUltragenyx Pharmaceutical (RARE) has seen its share price halve in just two weeks, largely due to a halted trial and an FDA rejection, but the market appears to have overreacted. The company’s Phase 3 trial for setrusumab, a potential blockbuster therapy for a rare bone disease, failed to meet an early “stop-for-efficacy” milestone, yet the study remains on track, with safety intact and final results expected in late 2025 under less stringent endpoints.\nMeanwhile, the FDA issued a complete response letter for another gene therapy candidate, citing manufacturing issues rather than safety or efficacy concerns. The program remains viable, with a resubmission expected once production adjustments are made. Despite these setbacks, Ultragenyx continues to generate meaningful revenue, posting $139 million in Q1 and guiding for over $640 million in 2025, and maintains a robust cash position of around $560 million, with management projecting lower cash burn.\nBeyond setrusumab, the company’s pipeline is well diversified, featuring DTX401, a gene therapy for glycogen storage disease that met Phase 3 goals and is slated for FDA submission this year, as well as an advanced Angelman syndrome program in Phase 3. None of the recent regulatory or clinical updates involved failures of safety or efficacy, leaving the scientific foundation of the pipeline intact. Analysts’ average price targets remain near $100, implying a potential threefold upside from the current ~$26 level. With solid fundamentals, multiple near-term catalysts, and a temporarily depressed valuation, Ultragenyx represents a compelling contrarian opportunity as panic-driven selling unwinds.\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Capricor Therapeutics, Inc.

SYM’s forward P/E was 263.16 according to Yahoo Finance.\nA robotics technician in a clean room programming a CNC series product.\nSymbotic (SYM), an industrial robotics company, is in a rapid growth phase, expanding revenue at 40% YoY while trading at a trailing EV/Sales of 2.26x, notably lower than industrial robotics peers such as Rockwell Automation (5.5x), ABB (3.7x), and Fanuc (3.7x). These peers, though boasting stronger gross margins in the high-30% range and EBIT margins of 15–20%, have much slower growth rates, reflecting their mature scale.\nTeradyne, which operates primarily in chip testing but derives 13% of its revenue from robotics supporting Amazon’s distribution centers, trades at a 5x EV/Sales multiple with a 60% gross margin and EBIT margins above 20%, though its robotics profitability is enhanced by the higher-margin chip testing business. Symbotic’s gross margin, by contrast, has lagged at 16–18%, with a recent uptick to 19.6%.\nThis margin gap stems from its highly customized deployments, which carry higher costs, and a deliberate focus on hypergrowth over near-term profitability, resulting in deployment cost overruns. A key strategic milestone was Symbotic’s acquisition of Walmart’s robotics division in January 2025, securing a 12-year exclusive agreement (2025–2037) to supply robotics for Walmart’s accelerated pickup and delivery centers. This contract provides a durable growth runway and positions the company as a critical supplier in a large, recurring demand environment.\nIf Symbotic’s margins can converge toward peer levels as it scales, investors could benefit from a powerful combination of sustained top-line growth and potential multiple expansion. However, after adjusting for the dual-share structure and Class V shares, the EV/Sales ratio appears closer to 15.3x, reducing its perceived valuation appeal.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on NANO Nuclear Energy Inc.

BLDR’s trailing and forward P/E were 17.39 and 16.86, respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nA crane carrying heavy building materials, representing the robust civil engineering products of the company.\nBuilders FirstSource (BLDR), the largest supplier of structural building products and value-added services in the U.S., stands out for its integrated model, spanning lumber, engineered wood, and specialty materials, alongside custom fabrication and installation services that together represent nearly half of revenue. These high-margin offerings create deeper customer ties and insulate earnings from pure commodity price swings.\nWith 590 locations across 43 states, BLDR’s reach across homebuilders, commercial contractors, and remodelers provides resilience and purchasing power in a fragmented market. However, the backdrop remains challenging: U.S. housing faces affordability constraints from ~7% mortgage rates, tight inventories, and uneven construction activity, with single-family starts expected to rise modestly in 2025 even as multifamily softens.\nBLDR’s Q1 2025 results reflected these pressures, with sales down 6% year-over-year to $3.7 billion, adjusted EBITDA contracting 31.7% to $369 million, and free cash flow plunging to $45 million. Guidance for 2025 implies EBITDA margins of 10.6–12.3% with acquisitions driving most top-line growth, underscoring ongoing organic headwinds. Management remains focused on a long-term strategy anchored in digital transformation, with myBLDR.com processing over $1.5 billion in orders and 42% of 2024 volume already digital, aiming to embed BLDR into customer workflows.\nAggressive M&A, such as the $828 million acquisitions of Alpine Lumber and O.C. Cluss, and an $8 billion buyback program that retired nearly half the share base since 2021, reinforce confidence in cash deployment.

BBAR’s trailing P/E was 11.24 according to Yahoo Finance.\nThe CEO of the retail bank standing in front of the company's logo, pointing to the future of the business.\nArgentina, long plagued by boom-bust cycles, may now be entering a period of macroeconomic normalization between 2025–27. With sovereign spreads potentially compressing by over 500 basis points within 18 months, banks emerge as the most direct equity beneficiaries due to their sensitivity to interest rates and operating leverage. As policy rates decline faster than deposit rates adjust, banks immediately monetize net interest margin (NIM) expansion.\nTheir cost structures—primarily peso-denominated—combined with inflation-linked revenue, provide powerful operating leverage. Current price-to-book (P/B) valuations already embed extreme earnings pessimism, implying returns on equity (ROE) well below the cost of equity (COE), suggesting material upside if macro conditions stabilize.\nWithin this setup, Banco BBVA Argentina (BBAR) stands out. Even after assuming a 120 bp NIM haircut to reflect easing rate expectations, BBAR’s fundamental outlook remains compelling. It benefits from structurally cheap funding, with 63% of deposits in non-interest-bearing sight accounts. Its digital scale, with 63% of transactions via mobile, supports an ambitious cost-to-income ratio target below 50% by 2027.\nBBAR also leads in credit quality with a 1.8% non-performing loan ratio and 140% coverage—the best among peers. Its NIM shows resilience, declining by just ~40 bp for every 100 bp policy rate cut due to lagged deposit repricing. A sustainable 17% ROE (up from 16%) against a 24% COE underpins a 2.0× P/B valuation, implying a price range of $18–22 per ADR. With macro tailwinds aligning, BBAR offers high-conviction equity convexity to Argentina’s potential macro rerating.\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Bancolombia S.A. (CIB) by Unemployed Value Degen in January 2025, which highlighted its dominant market share, digital bank Nequi, and potential for a valuation rerating.

EPIF’s key strategy is to acquire small to mid-size real estate and real estate related assets in Southern Europe with the potential for attractive risk adjusted returns. The Fund initially closed with Eurocastle committing to invest €8 million alongside a €2 million commitment from its JV Partner. EPIF is now being marketed to potential investors with a target size of €100 million.\nBy the end of June 2025, EPIF had received over €36 million of capital commitments. In July 2025, an additional €25 million was raised, bringing total committed capital in the Fund to over €61 million. In addition, prospective investors representing a further €20 million in commitments are in the final stages of due diligence.\nIn addition to Eurocastle generating attractive risk adjusted returns on its share of any investments made, subsidiaries of the Company are also entitled to market standard management and incentive fees from third-party investors.\nBy the end of the first half of 2025, the Fund had made two commercial real estate investments in Athens, Greece reflecting its focus on opportunistic investments with strong value-creation potential. The investments comprise the acquisition of a small upscale shopping centre acquired out of a distressed situation and a 70% stake in a vacant office property acquired from a defaulted borrower at a substantial discount to comparable sales in the area.\nTo fund these investments, EPIF had called approximately €7.7 million of capital by June 30, 2025. At that date, the Fund reported a NAV of €8.3 million, an 8% increase relative to the capital called, reflecting the appreciation in the value of the real estate acquired to date, net of all setup and running costs. Of the total capital called, Eurocastle invested €1.7 million, while its corresponding share of EPIF’s NAV stood at €1.8 million.\nSubsequent to the June 30, 2025, EPIF called €11.5 million of capital to acquire an interest in a large portfolio of Italian real estate assets. The portfolio primarily consists of office properties leased to government agencies. The assets are currently undergoing a disposal process, with EPIF acquiring its stake at a significant discount to the portfolio’s reported value.\nIn parallel, EPIF has been underwriting a number of additional opportunities and has an active pipeline of potential investment opportunities exceeding €50 million.\nWith EPIF reaching over €61 million in investor commitments, the Board determined that Eurocastle has established a sustainable platform that it anticipates growing in future years. In light of the Company’s strengthened financial position and prospects, the Board reassessed the level of Additional Reserves and approved the release of approximately €4.6 million in Liquidation Reserves. As at 30 June 2025, the remaining Additional Reserves of approximately €6.0 million relate exclusively to the legacy German tax matter.\nIncome Statement for the Quarter ended 30 June 2025 and First Six Months of 2025 (unaudited)\nBalance Sheet and Adjusted NAV Reconciliation as at 30 June 2025 and as at 31 December 2024\nAGM RESULTS AND PDMR DEALING NOTIFICATION\nAs previously mentioned, all ordinary and extraordinary business tabled before the meeting in accordance with the Notice of Annual General Meeting circulated to shareholders on [14] July 2025 was approved.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on UNFI. United Natural Foods, Inc.'s share was trading at $27.66 as of July 29th. UNFI’s trailing and forward P/E were 9.45 and 19.88, respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nA close-up view of organic fruits and vegetables in a local retail store.\nUnited Natural Foods Inc. (UNFI) represents a middle-innings turnaround and deleveraging story, trading at just 6.6x FY25E EBITDA despite showing encouraging early results from a three-year recovery plan. The company operates two segments: wholesale distribution—its core business with 250,000 SKUs across 11,000 suppliers serving 30,000 locations, primarily grocery chains—and a legacy retail segment of 75 grocery stores from the 2018 SuperValu acquisition, which contributes no meaningful EBITDA.\nUNFI had strong pre-2018 growth, but the SuperValu deal saddled it with leverage and underperforming assets, pushing shares from $50 to $10. After a post-pandemic rebound, FY24 saw a renewed earnings collapse, but management responded in October 2024 with a three-year plan focused on flat revenue, high-single-digit EBITDA growth, higher free cash flow, and lower leverage. Execution is ahead of schedule: FY25 revenue is pacing at $31.7bn (above flat projections, even after a $350–400m cyberattack impact), EBITDA guidance is $550m–615m, and FCF has doubled to $200m.\nNet leverage is expected to fall to 2.5x by FY26—one year ahead of plan. If UNFI delivers on FY27 targets of $650m EBITDA and 0.5% FCF margin, the business could generate $150m in FCF and trade closer to 7x EBITDA, implying a stock price of $48—offering a 30% IRR from current levels. The market’s hesitation likely stems from current debt at $1.9bn and the recent cyberattack, but operational impacts appear contained, and investor confidence is returning. Ultimately, this looks like a straightforward execution story where simply hitting already conservative targets could yield strong equity upside.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. (FDP) by Charly AI in March 2025, which highlighted its operational turnaround and focus on high-margin produce. The company's stock price has appreciated approximately by 20.3% since our coverage. This is because the thesis is playing out. Value Don’t Lie shares a similar outlook in their recent coverage of UNFI.\nUnited Natural Foods, Inc. is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

Is that enough to live on?\nHome buyers and homeowners looking to refinance may be wondering if it’s a good time to jump in, or if they should wait to see if rates drop even further.\nThat’s a tough decision at a time when the U.S. economy’s future looks uncertain and finding a new job has gotten harder for people in search of work. People have been putting off buying homes due to uncertainty about the economy, according to a recent survey by Bright MLS.\nBut at the same time, many buyers and homeowners have been waiting for mortgage rates to drop. At present, “there’s a lot of opportunity out there for both home buyers and homeowners,” Alex Elezaj, chief strategy officer at United Wholesale Mortgage UWMC, told MarketWatch.\n“If you’re in the market to buy a home, lower rates could mean you can afford more houses for your money,” he added.\nWhen rates drop, homeowners can look at not only lowering their existing mortgage rate, but also shortening their loan term, he added, such as going from a 30-year to a 15-year mortgage, if they are able to afford it. A shorter-term mortgage allows the homeowner to pay off their mortgage faster and reduce interest payments.\nWith the average rate on the 30-year mortgage at its lowest level since October, homeowners who are refinancing from higher interest rates could see substantial monthly savings.\nIf a homeowner has an outstanding mortgage-loan amount of $300,000 and a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 7.5%, that translates to a $2,100 monthly payment. If they were to refinance that loan to a 6.57% rate, that monthly payment would be about $1,900 — nearly $200 cheaper. The calculation only includes the principal and interest portion of the mortgage, and doesn’t account for additional fees involved in refinancing, such as closing costs and appraisal fees.\nThe vast majority of homeowners have a mortgage rate below 6%, according to a previous analysis of federal-government data by the real-estate platform Redfin.

LULU’s trailing and forward P/E were 14.73 and 14.60 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nAn athletic person entering a retail store, giving a glimpse of the fitness lifestyle.\nLululemon Athletica (LULU) stands to benefit from the rapidly expanding global sportswear market, projected to grow from $220.3 billion in 2025 to $350.45 billion by 2032 at a 7.84% CAGR, driven by rising female sports participation and strong growth in apparel, which accounts for over 60% of the market. With 2025 revenue estimated at $10.5 billion, 13% of which comes from China, Lululemon is expected to outpace the broader market, growing China sales at 17–18% annually and the rest of the world at 10%, supported by its premium brand positioning and continued international expansion.\nThis trajectory implies total revenue of $21.7 billion by 2032, translating to an 11.1% CAGR, with net income projected at $3.47 billion, assuming a steady 16% net margin. Applying a 3% terminal growth rate and discounting at 10%, the equity’s present value is approximately $26.2 billion, implying a fair value of $215–220 per share. A continuation of 11% revenue growth over the next seven years makes LULU attractive, underpinned by a robust balance sheet with $1.3 billion in cash, zero debt, and steadily rising retained earnings.\nFurthermore, the company’s expanding loyalty base contradicts perceptions of waning demand: Essentials membership has surged from over nine million in 2022 to 22 million by September 2024.

On 2025 estimates, it trades at ~4x EV/Sales and 14x EV/FCF, a discount to peer GoDaddy (GDDY), which trades at 5.6x EV/Sales and 17x EV/FCF despite slower AI adoption. The market appears to undervalue WIX’s accelerating AI buildout, where it is leading the web development space in integrating AI-driven tools, positioning itself ahead of competitors like GDDY.\nWith earnings scheduled for early August, investor focus is on whether WIX can deliver a “beat and raise” quarter that could catalyze a multiple re-rating. A re-rate in line with GDDY’s valuation range of 5.5–6x sales implies a share price of $220–240, representing meaningful upside. A probability-weighted scenario framework suggests an expected post-earnings return of about 12%, with a bull case ($230, 20% probability) on upside surprise, a base case ($165, 50%) assuming in-line results, and a bear case ($135, 30%) if results disappoint or guidance is cautious.\nEven in the base case, WIX remains attractively positioned given its leading AI initiatives and discounted valuation relative to peers. The combination of a clear catalyst in the upcoming earnings report, a compelling valuation gap, and structural growth from AI integration offers a favorable risk/reward profile.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on JOBY. Joby Aviation, Inc.'s share was trading at $16.66 as of July 31st.\nA futuristic electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft soaring through the sky.\nJoby Aviation ($JOBY), known for its electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft and partnerships with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), has quietly begun testing a new hydrogen-powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) called the JAI 30. While the company has not publicly acknowledged this aircraft, tracking data shows the JAI 30 completed a nine-hour flight, placing it among the longest-endurance hydrogen-powered UAVs. FAA registration records and eyewitness reports confirm Joby’s activity at the Pendleton UAS Range, a premier U.S. drone testing site.\nThe aircraft, powered by a hydrogen-electric drivetrain, is notably larger and heavier than China’s AVIC model, which currently holds the endurance record. This move underscores Joby’s broader transformation from an air taxi operator to a vertically integrated aerospace firm. The JAI 30 development builds on Joby’s acquisition of H2FLY in 2021 and its successful hydrogen-electric demonstrator flight in 2024.\nThe firm has further strengthened its position with the 2024 acquisition of Xwing’s autonomy division, aligning with DoD interests in unmanned and hydrogen-powered flight under programs like AFWERX and Agility Prime. Xwing’s control station, now seen adjacent to the JAI 30 at Pendleton, highlights this integration.\nMilitary observers suggest hydrogen UAS may support logistics for small forces in isolated environments due to their energy advantages. Joby’s presence at Pendleton — which offers 14,000 square miles of low-traffic airspace and advanced testing capabilities — signals serious intent to scale UAV operations. With strategic DoD ties and internal capability expansion, Joby’s JAI 30 may be a foundational step in next-gen autonomous hydrogen flight.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico (PAC) by Chit Chat Stocks in May 2025, which highlighted strong domestic travel trends, pricing power, and undervaluation.

VRE’s trailing P/E was 7.30 according to Yahoo Finance.\nA portfolio of multifamily properties in a city skyline, emphasizing the size and scale of the company's real estate investments.\nVeris Residential (VRE), a $1.5B market cap multifamily REIT, owns high-quality, newer apartment assets concentrated in high-barrier markets like Jersey City, Port Imperial, Boston, suburban NJ/NY, and DC. The company, formerly Mack-Cali, fully transitioned out of office properties by 2024 and rebranded in 2021 to reflect its multifamily focus. Amid a strategic review, Veris has begun executing on its plan to sell $300–$500M of assets to reduce leverage below 9.0x net debt/EBITDA and repurchase up to $100M in stock.\nIn Q2 2025 alone, Veris announced $385M in property sales and binding contracts, and an additional $60M of land sales. These non-core, lower-yielding properties were sold at cap rates of ~5.25%, focusing on smaller, more liquid deals. These dispositions sharpen Veris’s portfolio concentration in its prime Jersey City and Port Imperial holdings, potentially making it a more attractive M&A target. Despite elevated leverage and G&A costs, Veris trades at a ~6.1% implied cap rate, or ~28x AFFO, but at a ~25% discount to an estimated net liquidation value of $20/share. Private market comps and recent transactions by peers like KKR, AvalonBay, and Equity Residential support VRE’s valuation.\nThe board, handpicked by activist investors Madison International and Bow Street, appears aligned with shareholders and a potential take-private. Madison’s founder recently stepped down from the board, and the CIO’s quiet exit suggests the company may not redeploy sale proceeds, reinforcing the M&A narrative. While standalone performance is constrained by debt and limited cash flow, Veris’s high-quality portfolio, especially its NJ waterfront land, represents significant embedded value and a compelling takeover target.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on STAG Industrial, Inc. by Steve Wagner in May 2025, which highlighted strong lease spreads, disciplined asset recycling, and conservative leverage.

HHH’s trailing P/E was 10.83 according to Yahoo Finance.\nHoward Hughes Holdings (HHH) trades at $68.65 as of July 15, 2025, down nearly 10% YTD, pressured by a soft real estate market, high interest rates that weigh on valuations and leasing, analyst downgrades, and concerns around Pershing Square’s fee structure. Yet the underlying fundamentals support a multi‑year turnaround. The U.S. housing market remains structurally undersupplied after a decade of underbuilding, and HHH owns 33,342 sellable acres concentrated in top‑performing markets like Las Vegas (Summerlin) and Houston (Bridgeland), positioning it to meet surging demand when rates fall.\nIts master‑planned community (MPC) land is significantly understated on the balance sheet: while carried at $2.5 billion under GAAP, filings suggest a current market value closer to $22 billion, implying a ~$20 billion understatement and a pre‑tax profit multiple of 8.6× per acre that the market largely ignores. In parallel, HHH’s commercial real estate portfolio remains resilient despite macro headwinds, with office occupancy at 88% and multifamily and retail above 95%, providing stable cash flow to fund MPC development.\nUnder Bill Ackman’s leadership, HHH is evolving into a diversified holding company with ambitions beyond real estate. A planned insurance platform could create investable float, unlocking scalable, compoundable earnings and a valuation re‑rating beyond the sum of its land assets. As interest rates normalize and housing demand accelerates, the combination of a deeply undervalued land bank, high‑occupancy income properties, and a strategic transformation led by a highly aligned sponsor sets the stage for a significant revaluation, offering an asymmetric long‑term risk/reward profile.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Howard Hughes Holdings Inc. by Bulls On Parade in February 2025, which highlighted undervalued master‑planned communities, strong operating income growth, and strategic refocus under Pershing Square.

UNFI’s trailing and forward P/E were 9.45 and 19.88, respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nA close-up view of organic fruits and vegetables in a local retail store.\nUnited Natural Foods Inc. (UNFI) represents a middle-innings turnaround and deleveraging story, trading at just 6.6x FY25E EBITDA despite showing encouraging early results from a three-year recovery plan. The company operates two segments: wholesale distribution—its core business with 250,000 SKUs across 11,000 suppliers serving 30,000 locations, primarily grocery chains—and a legacy retail segment of 75 grocery stores from the 2018 SuperValu acquisition, which contributes no meaningful EBITDA.\nUNFI had strong pre-2018 growth, but the SuperValu deal saddled it with leverage and underperforming assets, pushing shares from $50 to $10. After a post-pandemic rebound, FY24 saw a renewed earnings collapse, but management responded in October 2024 with a three-year plan focused on flat revenue, high-single-digit EBITDA growth, higher free cash flow, and lower leverage. Execution is ahead of schedule: FY25 revenue is pacing at $31.7bn (above flat projections, even after a $350–400m cyberattack impact), EBITDA guidance is $550m–615m, and FCF has doubled to $200m.\nNet leverage is expected to fall to 2.5x by FY26—one year ahead of plan. If UNFI delivers on FY27 targets of $650m EBITDA and 0.5% FCF margin, the business could generate $150m in FCF and trade closer to 7x EBITDA, implying a stock price of $48—offering a 30% IRR from current levels. The market’s hesitation likely stems from current debt at $1.9bn and the recent cyberattack, but operational impacts appear contained, and investor confidence is returning. Ultimately, this looks like a straightforward execution story where simply hitting already conservative targets could yield strong equity upside.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc.

People have been putting off buying homes due to uncertainty about the economy, according to a recent survey by Bright MLS.\nBut at the same time, many buyers and homeowners have been waiting for mortgage rates to drop. At present, “there’s a lot of opportunity out there for both home buyers and homeowners,” Alex Elezaj, chief strategy officer at United Wholesale Mortgage UWMC, told MarketWatch.\n“If you’re in the market to buy a home, lower rates could mean you can afford more houses for your money,” he added.\nWhen rates drop, homeowners can look at not only lowering their existing mortgage rate, but also shortening their loan term, he added, such as going from a 30-year to a 15-year mortgage, if they are able to afford it. A shorter-term mortgage allows the homeowner to pay off their mortgage faster and reduce interest payments.\nWith the average rate on the 30-year mortgage at its lowest level since October, homeowners who are refinancing from higher interest rates could see substantial monthly savings.\nIf a homeowner has an outstanding mortgage-loan amount of $300,000 and a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 7.5%, that translates to a $2,100 monthly payment.

A continuation of 11% revenue growth over the next seven years makes LULU attractive, underpinned by a robust balance sheet with $1.3 billion in cash, zero debt, and steadily rising retained earnings.\nFurthermore, the company’s expanding loyalty base contradicts perceptions of waning demand: Essentials membership has surged from over nine million in 2022 to 22 million by September 2024. Taken together, LULU’s superior growth prospects, financial strength, and brand stickiness suggest an appealing risk-reward profile, positioning it to capture disproportionate share in a structurally growing sportswear market.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU) by FeedbackAlarmed5045 in May 2025, which highlighted its strong competitive moat, premium pricing power, and strategic growth initiatives. The company’s stock price has depreciated about 28% since then due to weaker near-term sentiment. The thesis still stands given resilient fundamentals, while OneTarget9322 shares an identical thesis but emphasizes long-term growth, China expansion, and valuation upside.\nLululemon Athletica Inc. is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 48 hedge fund portfolios held LULU at the end of the first quarter which was 60 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of LULU as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

The firm, based in Uruguay, sells products in around 20 Latin American countries.\nNet revenue of $6.8 billion was up 34% year-on-year, beating the estimate of $6.7 billion, with sales measured by gross merchandise value rising 37% on a forex-neutral basis.\nIn early June, MercadoLibre cut the threshold for purchases eligible for free shipping in Brazil, after also lowering shipping costs for companies and users selling on its platform in May, amid fierce competition in the country's e-commerce segment.\nBrazil, the firm's main market, together with Mexico helped MercadoLibre to increase total items sold by 31% in the quarter, the fastest pace year-on-year since mid-2021.\nHowever, that also hurt margins, said Chief Financial Officer Martin de los Santos.\n\"We don't want to miss the growth opportunities ahead of us,\" he said in an interview. \"That might generate some short-term margin pressure, but we are very optimistic about the long-term trajectory of our profitability.\"\nEarnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) reached a record high of $825 million, but also missed the $869 million forecast. The EBIT margin stood at 12.2%, down from 14.3% a year earlier.\nThe CFO said that among the main impacts on margins were investments in free shipping and related marketing, and growth in its so-called 1P business, which sells directly to customers.\n\"We expect a negative reaction given the earnings miss, however, we do not expect sustained underperformance as downward revisions should be limited,\" Santander analysts, including Ruben Couto, wrote in a note to clients.\nAsked if similar free-shipping policies could take place in other countries, MercadoLibre commerce head Ariel Szarfsztejn, who is set to become chief executive next year, told an analysts' call that the firm \"will evaluate, and we will decide eventually which policies we want to bring where.\"\nIn its earnings report, MercadoLibre also said deeper currency-related losses, mainly due to Argentina's peso, and a higher tax rate hit its net profit in the quarter.", "content_hash": "6ba7f88dfad2699017bc5714705a5072", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

WIX’s trailing and forward P/E were 59.72 and 20.24, respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nCopyright: rawpixel / 123RF Stock Photo\nWix.com (WIX) has drawn renewed attention following its recent share price pullback, now trading around $150 with a market cap of $8.5 billion. On 2025 estimates, it trades at ~4x EV/Sales and 14x EV/FCF, a discount to peer GoDaddy (GDDY), which trades at 5.6x EV/Sales and 17x EV/FCF despite slower AI adoption. The market appears to undervalue WIX’s accelerating AI buildout, where it is leading the web development space in integrating AI-driven tools, positioning itself ahead of competitors like GDDY.\nWith earnings scheduled for early August, investor focus is on whether WIX can deliver a “beat and raise” quarter that could catalyze a multiple re-rating. A re-rate in line with GDDY’s valuation range of 5.5–6x sales implies a share price of $220–240, representing meaningful upside. A probability-weighted scenario framework suggests an expected post-earnings return of about 12%, with a bull case ($230, 20% probability) on upside surprise, a base case ($165, 50%) assuming in-line results, and a bear case ($135, 30%) if results disappoint or guidance is cautious.\nEven in the base case, WIX remains attractively positioned given its leading AI initiatives and discounted valuation relative to peers. The combination of a clear catalyst in the upcoming earnings report, a compelling valuation gap, and structural growth from AI integration offers a favorable risk/reward profile. If the company executes, it could see a swift multiple expansion, bringing shares closer to peer levels, while downside risk appears cushioned by underlying fundamentals and a growing AI-driven competitive edge.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Wix.com Ltd. by The Dutch Investors in November 2024, highlighting Wix’s scale-driven moats and durable growth.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on JOBY. Joby Aviation, Inc.'s share was trading at $16.66 as of July 31st.\nA futuristic electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft soaring through the sky.\nJoby Aviation ($JOBY), known for its electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft and partnerships with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), has quietly begun testing a new hydrogen-powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) called the JAI 30. While the company has not publicly acknowledged this aircraft, tracking data shows the JAI 30 completed a nine-hour flight, placing it among the longest-endurance hydrogen-powered UAVs. FAA registration records and eyewitness reports confirm Joby’s activity at the Pendleton UAS Range, a premier U.S. drone testing site.\nThe aircraft, powered by a hydrogen-electric drivetrain, is notably larger and heavier than China’s AVIC model, which currently holds the endurance record. This move underscores Joby’s broader transformation from an air taxi operator to a vertically integrated aerospace firm. The JAI 30 development builds on Joby’s acquisition of H2FLY in 2021 and its successful hydrogen-electric demonstrator flight in 2024.\nThe firm has further strengthened its position with the 2024 acquisition of Xwing’s autonomy division, aligning with DoD interests in unmanned and hydrogen-powered flight under programs like AFWERX and Agility Prime. Xwing’s control station, now seen adjacent to the JAI 30 at Pendleton, highlights this integration.\nMilitary observers suggest hydrogen UAS may support logistics for small forces in isolated environments due to their energy advantages. Joby’s presence at Pendleton — which offers 14,000 square miles of low-traffic airspace and advanced testing capabilities — signals serious intent to scale UAV operations. With strategic DoD ties and internal capability expansion, Joby’s JAI 30 may be a foundational step in next-gen autonomous hydrogen flight.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico (PAC) by Chit Chat Stocks in May 2025, which highlighted strong domestic travel trends, pricing power, and undervaluation. The company’s stock price has appreciated by approximately 11.79% since our coverage. This is because the thesis played out. The thesis still stands as fundamentals remain solid. Hunterbrook’s recent work on Joby Aviation presents a distinct opportunity in next-gen aerospace, with a sharp focus on innovation and long-range autonomy.", "content_hash": "85ea8470b85968d2ad3dde6a12af26f5", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

VRE’s trailing P/E was 7.30 according to Yahoo Finance.\nA portfolio of multifamily properties in a city skyline, emphasizing the size and scale of the company's real estate investments.\nVeris Residential (VRE), a $1.5B market cap multifamily REIT, owns high-quality, newer apartment assets concentrated in high-barrier markets like Jersey City, Port Imperial, Boston, suburban NJ/NY, and DC. The company, formerly Mack-Cali, fully transitioned out of office properties by 2024 and rebranded in 2021 to reflect its multifamily focus. Amid a strategic review, Veris has begun executing on its plan to sell $300–$500M of assets to reduce leverage below 9.0x net debt/EBITDA and repurchase up to $100M in stock.\nIn Q2 2025 alone, Veris announced $385M in property sales and binding contracts, and an additional $60M of land sales. These non-core, lower-yielding properties were sold at cap rates of ~5.25%, focusing on smaller, more liquid deals. These dispositions sharpen Veris’s portfolio concentration in its prime Jersey City and Port Imperial holdings, potentially making it a more attractive M&A target. Despite elevated leverage and G&A costs, Veris trades at a ~6.1% implied cap rate, or ~28x AFFO, but at a ~25% discount to an estimated net liquidation value of $20/share. Private market comps and recent transactions by peers like KKR, AvalonBay, and Equity Residential support VRE’s valuation.\nThe board, handpicked by activist investors Madison International and Bow Street, appears aligned with shareholders and a potential take-private. Madison’s founder recently stepped down from the board, and the CIO’s quiet exit suggests the company may not redeploy sale proceeds, reinforcing the M&A narrative. While standalone performance is constrained by debt and limited cash flow, Veris’s high-quality portfolio, especially its NJ waterfront land, represents significant embedded value and a compelling takeover target.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on STAG Industrial, Inc. by Steve Wagner in May 2025, which highlighted strong lease spreads, disciplined asset recycling, and conservative leverage.

HHH’s trailing P/E was 10.83 according to Yahoo Finance.\nHoward Hughes Holdings (HHH) trades at $68.65 as of July 15, 2025, down nearly 10% YTD, pressured by a soft real estate market, high interest rates that weigh on valuations and leasing, analyst downgrades, and concerns around Pershing Square’s fee structure. Yet the underlying fundamentals support a multi‑year turnaround. The U.S. housing market remains structurally undersupplied after a decade of underbuilding, and HHH owns 33,342 sellable acres concentrated in top‑performing markets like Las Vegas (Summerlin) and Houston (Bridgeland), positioning it to meet surging demand when rates fall.\nIts master‑planned community (MPC) land is significantly understated on the balance sheet: while carried at $2.5 billion under GAAP, filings suggest a current market value closer to $22 billion, implying a ~$20 billion understatement and a pre‑tax profit multiple of 8.6× per acre that the market largely ignores. In parallel, HHH’s commercial real estate portfolio remains resilient despite macro headwinds, with office occupancy at 88% and multifamily and retail above 95%, providing stable cash flow to fund MPC development.\nUnder Bill Ackman’s leadership, HHH is evolving into a diversified holding company with ambitions beyond real estate. A planned insurance platform could create investable float, unlocking scalable, compoundable earnings and a valuation re‑rating beyond the sum of its land assets. As interest rates normalize and housing demand accelerates, the combination of a deeply undervalued land bank, high‑occupancy income properties, and a strategic transformation led by a highly aligned sponsor sets the stage for a significant revaluation, offering an asymmetric long‑term risk/reward profile.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Howard Hughes Holdings Inc. by Bulls On Parade in February 2025, which highlighted undervalued master‑planned communities, strong operating income growth, and strategic refocus under Pershing Square.

RDDT’s trailing and forward P/E were 84.21 and 149.25, respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nReddit has recently surged following the announcement of a new AI feature, combined with being the only major website to post visitor growth in recent weeks. This bullish momentum contrasts sharply with prior bearish arguments around slowing user growth and AI-driven risks, which seemed compelling when shares traded near $250. However, at $115-$120 with 15% of its market cap expected to be in cash within a year, the stock offered an attractive setup. On Tuesday, it rallied to $145, marking a nearly 50% gain in a month.\nWhile short-term uncertainty persists, the long-term thesis remains intact and stronger than before. Reddit has effectively consolidated what used to be a fragmented internet of blogs and forums, emerging as the primary destination for community-driven discussions after the decline of platforms like Digg. As AI reduces reliance on traditional web searches, Reddit’s role as a real-time, user-generated content hub makes it indispensable for search relevance. Unlike platforms dominated by video content and plagued by bot-driven engagement, Reddit’s text-based structure and topical depth position it as the last major source of authentic, evolving data.\nWith 20%+ user growth, international expansion ahead, and ARPU optionality, revenue and profitability could inflect meaningfully, propelling shares into the $200 range over time. In the near term, volatility driven by user growth metrics and trader sentiment may persist, but the platform’s strategic importance in an AI-driven internet ecosystem underpins its long-term value. At current levels near $140, upside potential remains compelling, with a personal fair value estimate of $160 and significant multi-year growth optionality.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Reddit, Inc.

Trading at just ~10x free cash flow, ~9x forward P/E, and less than 1x sales, the company is growing revenues from $3.7B in 2023 to an expected $4.9B by 2025, while improving margins and maintaining a healthy balance sheet. The business operates with 8–10% net margins, ~30% ROE, and minimal China tariff exposure (~5–6%), limiting downside risk from geopolitical tensions. Q1 FY2025 results were strong, with a $1.59 EPS beat versus $1.33 expected.\nANF has also authorized a $1.3B buyback program, with $200M spent in Q1 alone—no dilution, just enhanced shareholder value. Recent stock weakness stems from tariff concerns and sluggish Abercrombie brand performance, not deteriorating fundamentals. Notably, Hollister, which accounts for ~50% of revenue, is seeing strong traction, fueled by a Gen Z-focused strategy including viral TikTok collaborations such as with Spencer Barbosa and a hit 2000s retro collection. Web and foot traffic data suggest robust in-store activity and growing online interest.\nA second catalyst looms: the launch of a 25th anniversary collection on July 29, already generating millions of views and viral momentum on social media. While core Abercrombie remains flat, recent signs hint at a potential rebound. Alternative data (Google Trends, TikTok metrics, website traffic) shows rising interest across both brands.

VAL’s trailing and forward P/E were 11.48 and 13.79 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nA large oil drilling platform in the ocean, surrounded by turbulent waters.\nValaris (VAL), the world’s largest operator of high-spec offshore drilling rigs, is a deep-value play hiding in plain sight. After emerging from Chapter 11 in 2021, the company now controls a highly strategic asset base of twelve seventh-generation drillships, five semi-subs, and over thirty modern jack-ups—irreplaceable rigs that would cost over $25 billion to build today, yet trade at just ~15% of replacement cost.\nWith offshore dayrates back to ~$500k and no new drillships expected before 2028 due to a decimated supply pipeline, the setup for existing players is highly favorable. Offshore drilling is resurging as shale output flattens, and major oil companies are ramping up long-cycle projects in Brazil, Guyana, and the Gulf of Mexico, where offshore production costs now rival or beat shale at $30–$50 per barrel.\nValaris is positioned to capture this demand surge with an industry-leading fleet and a cleaned-up balance sheet—net debt is just $800 million against a $4.1 billion backlog. If dayrates return to prior peaks of $700k+, annual free cash flow could exceed $2 billion, against a current EV of only $3.9 billion. Activist investor Mohnish Pabrai took a material stake in Q1 2025, likely attracted by the company’s asset backing, earnings torque, and capital discipline.\nNear-term catalysts include easing FPSO bottlenecks, tightening rig availability, and potential short squeezes with 14% of shares sold short. Risks remain—oil below $55, safety incidents, or future overbuilding—but current valuations offer a compelling margin of safety. With tight supply and disciplined capital allocation, Valaris could plausibly triple from here.\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Valaris Limited by Alpha Ark in February 2025, which highlighted the company’s dominant fleet, improving balance sheet, and rising offshore dayrates.

TSCO’s trailing and forward P/E were 28.49 and 27.47 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nAn equestrian rider proudly leading a horse around a competition course.\nTractor Supply Company (TSCO) has returned to beating earnings, albeit marginally, though this was somewhat expected given its historical tendency to underpromise early in the year. Management’s “story of halves” narrative implied that weakness in the first quarter was acceptable so long as the second half delivered, driven by easing deflation and stronger transactions. However, the sequential deceleration in transactions in Q2, despite favorable tailwinds like weather, an Easter shift, and an easy comp base, raises concern about the trajectory.\nComps did improve sequentially through the quarter, particularly in May and June, and encouragingly, momentum has carried into Q3. Yet, questions remain around whether this reflects stronger traffic or just higher ticket sizes. New initiatives such as Fusion remodels, expanded garden centers, final-mile delivery, and PetRX are promising, but investors are beginning to question whether these efforts will meaningfully accelerate the business or simply help it maintain its current position. The once-anticipated high-single-digit lift from garden centers and Fusion remodels appears absent, despite having 650 such centers in place.\nManagement’s cut to share repurchase expectations, from $525–600M to $325–375M, introduces skepticism about their stated confidence. Maintaining full-year comp guidance despite Q2 outperformance similarly casts doubt on the strength of visibility. The newly introduced “managing to the midpoint” commentary may be cautious tariff-related positioning, but it adds to mixed signals. While management continues to voice strong optimism, the business hasn’t hit the low end of its long-term comp algorithm for six quarters. Targeting balanced ticket and transactions in 2H may be ambitious given historical performance, especially with broad inflation pressures returning.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Tractor Supply Company (TSCO) by Flyover Stocks in May 2025, which highlighted the company’s strong rural moat, niche customer base, and defensible positioning against big-box competitors.

Subscribe to our free daily Nrn newsletter.\nDenny’s Corp. reported mixed results for its two brands in the second quarter ended June 25, the company said Monday.\nThe Spartanburg, S.C.-based family-dining company said it noted some “near-term choppiness” in consumer spending that yielded a second-quarter same-store sales decline of 1.3% at Denny’s and an increase of 4% at the daytime café Keke’s Inc.\n\"We have continued to stay nimble, innovate, and meet the guests where they are,” Kelli Valade, Denny’s CEO, said in a statement. “For Denny’s, this meant innovating its value platform, leaning into its off-premises strength, and optimizing the franchise system, while Keke’s expanded its portfolio 7% year-to-date, launched its first-ever systemwide promotion, and continued to steal share from its competitive set.”\nValade said the economy showed some “near-term choppiness,” but Denny’s was able to trim corporate administrative expenses by about of 3.5% compared to the prior-year quarter.\nDenny’s also refranchised three Keke’s company cafes with more on the horizon,” she said.\n“We will continue to be agile,” Valade said.\nFor the second quarter ended June 25, Denny’s reported net income of $2.5 million, or five cents a share, compared to $3.6 million, or seven cents a share, in the same period last year. Revenues were $117.7 million, compared to $115.9 million in the same quarter a year ago.\nThe company said the revenue increase was primarily driven by the development of additional Keke's company units and partially offset by the previously discussed strategy of closing lower-volume franchised Denny’s stores.\nDuring the quarter, Denny’s completed 14 remodels, including five at company restaurants. Keke's opened eight new cafes, including four franchised locations.\nAs of June 25, Denny’s had 1,558 restaurants, including 1,474 franchised and licensed restaurants and 84 company-operated stores. Of those, 74 restaurants were Keke’s.\nContact Ron Ruggless at Ronald.Ruggless@Informa.com\nFollow him on X/Twitter: @RonRuggless", "content_hash": "eebd5dac36d851cafd33fabc9ce49609", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Now, from Tesla (TSLA) to Block (XYZ) to even the federal government, it seems that everyone is doing it to various degrees. I am referring, of course, to becoming a crypto treasury company or adopting a dedicated strategy to accumulate reserves of a specific cryptocurrency. Although most of the time, the preferred choice of crypto is the world's most popular and largest digital asset, Bitcoin (BTCUSD), building reserves of a token that's not as widely accessible for investment can be a strategically prudent move. That's because it can raise the stock's appeal as a “proxy trade” for the underlying token.\nBased on recent headlines, it seems that this is exactly what cancer-focused clinical-stage biotechnology company Sonnet BioTherapeutics is doing with the little-known HYPE crypto.\nFounded in 2011, Sonnet BioTherapeutics (SONN) has focused on developing novel immuno-oncology therapeutics using its proprietary F_HAB platform, which leverages fully human albumin-binding antibody fragments to deliver immune-activating molecules such as IL‑12 or IL‑6 directly to tumors.\nValued at a modest market cap of $8.9 million, SONN stock has gained 89.4% on a YTD basis, but still closed Monday at a price of $2.83, placing it firmly in penny stock territory.\nFollowing the Wall Street trend, Sonnet has recently formed a SPAC-like business combination to transition into a crypto treasury company focused on the HYPE token. The company has agreed to merge with Rorschach I LLC, a newly formed vehicle backed by Atlas Merchant Capital, Paradigm, and other crypto-investor groups. Through this merged company, which will be called Hyperliquid Strategies, Inc or HSI, it will hold about 12.6 million HYPE tokens worth $583 million at the time of signing of the agreement and $305 million in cash, totaling an assumed $888 million valuation.\nNotably, Sonnet's legacy biotech unit will operate under HSI as its wholly owned subsidiary.\nCommenting on the development, interim Sonnet CEO Raghu Rao said, “Following a thorough review, we believe this proposed combination with Rorschach provides us with a unique and exciting opportunity. We will be able to capitalize on the recent advancements around digital assets and equip Sonnet with funding to potentially realize the future value of our existing biotech assets.\"\nBob Diamon, co-founder and CEO of Atlas, who is poised to be the Chairman of the Board of the new entity, added, “We believe HYPE and the Hyperliquid protocol represent a truly differentiated offering within the digital asset space. We believe Hyperliquid Strategies will be well placed to maximize these opportunities because of our unique team of investors and operators with deep, relevant crypto and financial services experience.”\nBut why HYPE? What is its utility, and can it draw interest from crypto investors over the long haul - or will the “hype” die down after a while? Let's find out.\nWhat is HYPE?\nHYPE is the native token that powers the Hyperliquid network, an advanced decentralized exchange built entirely on its own Layer-1 foundation. Unveiled in the latter part of 2024, Hyperliquid has carved out a place among the most prominent projects in the digital asset space, and is now counted among the top 15 by total market cap.\nRather than depending on established chains like Ethereum (ETHUSD), Hyperliquid was architected independently, allowing for performance levels uncommon in decentralized finance. Its infrastructure enables extraordinary transactional speeds (up to 100,000 operations each second) with settlement finality taking less than a second. These capabilities allow for trading behavior that more closely resembles traditional high-frequency environments.\nNotably, one of Hyperliquid’s distinguishing traits lies in its market model. Unlike many decentralized exchanges that function through automated market makers, this protocol maintains an entirely on-chain order book. The result is a structure similar to centralized platforms in terms of price precision and trade depth, but with the transparency and auditability of blockchain. Every order and execution can be verified without intermediaries.\nAnother key feature is the absence of gas fees. By removing that cost layer, the platform opens the door for frequent and efficient trading, appealing to both individual and institutional participants. This also provides the technical flexibility required to support broader blockchain use cases. Over time, the same infrastructure may facilitate the tokenization of assets in sectors like real estate, raw materials, or environmental credits, allowing for divisible ownership and on-chain liquidity.\nHYPE’s total supply is capped at one billion tokens, with the current valuation placing its market capitalization at around $12.6 billion.\nDire Financial Straits\nSonnet's transformation to a HYPE treasury company may have been accelerated by its poor financial condition, characterized by widespread losses and pre-revenue status.\nFor the six months ended March 31, 2025, net cash outflow from operating activities increased to $5.38 million from $2.36 million in the same period a year ago. Even more troubling was a “going concern” warning in the quarterly filing (emphasis added):\n“The Company has incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and it expects to generate losses from operations for the foreseeable future primarily due to research and development costs for its potential product candidates. The Company believes its cash at March 31, 2025 of $2.1 million will fund the Company’s projected operations into July 2025. Substantial additional financing will be needed by the Company to fund its operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern exists.”\nIn other words, the biotech company went public with its HYPE treasury news just before its previously stated funding runway - and ability to continue as a going concern - was about to run out.\nAnalyst Opinion\nUnsurprisingly, SONN has limited coverage on Wall Street, with just one analyst following the shares. Although that one analyst calls the stock a “Strong Buy,” I would steer clear of SONN due to its unproven track record in its core business, cash flow struggles, and limited evidence of HYPE becoming a prominent cryptocurrency in the future. Granted, HYPE use-cases and utility could be exciting, but currently the story around Sonnet seems to be just that - hype.\nOn the date of publication, Pathikrit Bose did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

KMI’s trailing and forward P/E were 22.96 and 21.69, respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nAerial view of an oil and gas pipeline, spanning vast landscapes.\nKinder Morgan (KMI) is being re-evaluated as a growth stock rather than just a yield play, following a highly encouraging earnings call that has strengthened investor conviction. Originally a candidate for trimming at $30 after a steady climb from $17, KMI is now seen as a top-10 portfolio idea with $40+ upside potential. The company’s strategic position in U.S. energy infrastructure is unmatched—40% of all U.S. LNG exports flow through its pipelines, and with America pushing export-driven trade policy, this structural advantage is only becoming more valuable.\nBeyond exports, KMI’s pipeline network is also increasingly tied to the data center boom, particularly in the Western U.S., where major new projects will need reliable gas supply. Regulatory winds are shifting in KMI’s favor: with a Republican-led FERC and faster permitting by the Army Corps of Engineers, the environment is primed for a capital investment cycle. KMI also disclosed that due to tax rule changes, it expects to avoid paying cash taxes in 2026 and 2027—providing meaningful support to cash flows.\nWhile the company already has a solid backlog, management hinted at a significant wave of new projects post-2026, bolstering optimism. KMI stands out even at a 4% yield, offering more compelling risk-reward than similar-yielding utilities like Evergy. Peer comparisons are unflattering—Williams and Antero have already rallied, and concerns remain around Canadian regulatory risk for TRP. The only pipeline builder, Primoris, has already tripled. In this context, KMI emerges as a rare infrastructure play with growth, yield, and policy tailwinds converging.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Kinder Morgan, Inc. by Gregg Jahnke in October 2024, which highlighted the company’s strong backlog growth tied to AI demand and U.S. manufacturing reshoring. The stock has appreciated approximately 13% since our coverage, as capital spending picked up. Gregg Jahnke shares an identical view but now emphasizes KMI’s growth identity and regulatory tailwinds.\nKinder Morgan, Inc. is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

Beyond gaming, Unity’s real-time 3D (RT3D) tools serve industries like architecture and aerospace, while its Grow Solutions arm monetizes content through a robust ad network.\nDespite its leadership in game engines and partnerships with Apple and Google for XR, Unity has faced turbulence since its 2020 IPO, which was timed at peak tech valuations. Missteps such as the controversial runtime fee and heavy layoffs under previous leadership damaged developer trust and investor confidence, driving the stock from $201 to $14.\nA major turnaround began in late 2023, with strategic restructuring and renewed focus on core strengths under interim CEO Jim Whitehurst, followed by the appointment of Matthew Bromberg as CEO in 2024. Unity exited non-core businesses, raised subscription pricing, and launched Unity Vector, its AI-powered ad platform, ahead of schedule, positioning it to compete more effectively with ad tech leader AppLovin.\nEarly results are encouraging, with improving developer sentiment—80% plan to upgrade to Unity 6—and operational discipline reflected in rising margins and free cash flow. While Unity remains unprofitable and faces execution and macro risks, its undervalued position relative to peers and exposure to high-growth trends in gaming, AR/VR, and AI-powered advertising offer a compelling contrarian case.

HRMY’s trailing and forward P/E were 13.13 and 9.29, respectively, according to Yahoo Finance.\nA close-up of a pharmaceutical drug bottle, showcasing the potential of the company's innovative therapies.\nHarmony Biosciences Holdings, Inc. (HRMY) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on innovative treatments for rare neurological diseases. Its flagship product, WAKIX®, a first-in-class histamine H3 receptor antagonist for excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy in adult narcolepsy patients, drives the company’s strong financial performance. In 2024, Harmony generated $714.7M in revenue with a 30% EBITDA margin, supported by WAKIX serving approximately 7,300 patients in a U.S. narcolepsy market of 170,000. The company is targeting $1B+ in narcolepsy revenue by 2030 through continued patient growth, label expansions such as pediatric narcolepsy, and next-generation formulations in development.\nBeyond WAKIX, Harmony is diversifying with an advanced pipeline addressing significant unmet needs in rare neurological disorders. Key programs include pitolisant for Prader-Willi Syndrome (Phase 3), Myotonic Dystrophy (Phase 2), and idiopathic hypersomnia (Phase 3 expected in late 2025); ZYN002, a cannabidiol gel for Fragile X Syndrome (Phase 3 data due Q3 2025) and 22q Deletion Syndrome; and additional assets like BP1.15205 (orexin-2 receptor agonist) and HBS-102 (MCHR1 antagonist).

ZETA’s forward P/E was 25.13 and according to Yahoo Finance.\nZeta Global’s core competitive advantage stems from its unique architecture, where AI is native to the application layer, enabling faster, real-time decision-making and superior user experiences—similar to CrowdStrike’s lightweight agent advantage in cybersecurity. This infrastructure allows Zeta to process data with low latency, delivering better ROI to clients and positioning it as a vertical ontology player that automates marketing much like CrowdStrike automates security.\nAlthough Zeta’s free cash flow per share has grown at a slower pace than CrowdStrike’s, its resilience during downturns in 2020 and 2022 is notable, reflecting the strength of its rearchitected platform launched in 2021. Gross margins have expanded meaningfully, and the company has beaten and raised guidance for 15 consecutive quarters.\nZeta now counts 44% of the Fortune 500 as customers, including major names like United Airlines and Samsung, and has seen a sharp increase in “Scaled Customers,” suggesting growing traction and validation of its platform. Zeta’s long-term vision is to become a “Singularity Scaler”—a digital twin of every advertising channel—by creating a unique ID-based data cloud that locks in clients through exclusive activation pathways.\nHowever, this promising trajectory is clouded by short-seller allegations of inflated revenues via “consent farms” and concerns about CEO David Steinberg’s controversial past with InPhonic, which ended in bankruptcy. While these concerns warrant caution, Zeta’s compelling operational performance and differentiated technology continue to warrant close observation. Valued at just over 2x sales and with a modest net cash position, Zeta could become an attractive opportunity—pending validation from a marquee, trusted customer.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Zeta Global Holdings Corp.

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) rose +1.58%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) rose +1.96%.\nStock indexes rallied sharply on Monday as they recovered from some of last Friday's steep losses. Recent stellar earnings results boosted Magnificent Seven technology stocks and semiconductor chip makers, supporting gains in the broader market. Stocks also have support from speculation that last Friday's dismal payroll and ISM manufacturing reports will prompt the Fed to cut interest rates. The chances of a Fed rate cut at the September FOMC meeting rose to 90% from 40% before the reports were released.\nMonday's US economic news was mixed for stocks.

However, June factory orders ex-transportation rose +0.4% m/m, stronger than the expectations of +0.3% m/m and the largest increase in 7 months.\nIn the latest tariff news, President Trump said Monday that he would be \"substantially raising\" the tariff on US imports from India from the current 25% due to India's purchases of Russian oil. Last Thursday, President Trump raised tariffs on some Canadian goods to 35% from 25% and announced a 10% global minimum, along with tariffs of 15% or higher for countries with trade surpluses with the US, effective after midnight on August 7. According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\nThe markets this week will focus on earnings reports and any fresh tariff or trade news. On Tuesday, the June trade deficit is expected to narrow to -$61.1 billion from -$71.5 billion in May. Also on Tuesday, the July ISM services index is expected to climb by +0.7 to 51.5.

Sep T-notes on Monday recovered from overnight losses and rallied to a 3-month nearest-futures high, and the 10-year T-note yield fell to a 1-month low of 4.192%.\nT-notes have positive carryover support from last Friday's weaker-than-expected payroll and ISM manufacturing reports, which boosted the chance of a Fed rate cut at next month's FOMC meeting to 90% from 40% before the reports. Also, Monday's -1% drop in WTI crude oil prices reduced inflation expectations, a bullish factor for T-notes. In addition, Monday's strength in European government bonds provided carryover support to T-notes.\nGains in T-notes were limited by a sharp rebound in equity markets, which curbed safe-haven demand for government securities. Also, supply pressures are weighing on T-notes as the Treasury will auction $125 billion of T-notes and T-bonds in this week's August quarterly refunding, beginning with Tuesday's $58 billion auction of 3-year T-notes.\nEuropean government bond yields on Monday moved lower. The 10-year German bund yield fell to a 1.5-week low of 2.624% and finished down -5.4 bp to 2.624%. The 10-year UK gilt yield dropped to a 1-month low of 4.501% and finished down -1.9 bp to 4.509%.\nThe Eurozone Aug Sentix investor confidence index unexpectedly fell -8.2 to -3.7, weaker than expectations of an increase to 6.9.\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 15% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\nUS Stock Movers\nStrength in the Magnificent Seven technology stocks supported gains in the broader market.

The surge brings year-to-date net inflows to $672.8 billion, translating to an average of $96 billion per month. At that pace, 2025 is on track to mark a second consecutive year of $1 trillion-plus inflows. U.S. equity ETFs led the way in July with $52 billion in net inflows, buoyed by continued strength in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100. Both indexes rallied to record highs during the month, driven by the ongoing boom in AI-related tech stocks. International equity ETFs followed with $26.2 billion in inflows, while U.S. fixed-income ETFs brought in $18.3 billion. Currency ETFs also posted a strong month, gathering $11.9 billion as investors sought exposure to cryptocurrencies. VOO Leads ETF Inflows Among individual funds, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) topped the list with $12.5 billion of inflows in July. It has now collected $72.6 billion in 2025 alone, far ahead of any other ETF and on pace for another $100 billion-plus year. In second place for the month was the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which pulled in $5.3 billion. With Bitcoin prices hitting record highs above $120,000 in July, the fund’s year-to-date inflows have reached $20.3 billion. The iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) also saw a notable pickup, attracting $4.2 billion during the month and bringing its 2025 total to $6.2 billion. Ether prices soared in July on the back of strong ETF demand and growing interest in stablecoin infrastructure and Ether-based corporate treasury strategies. Other ETFs drawing significant inflows in July included the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF), the Simplify Government Money Market ETF (SBIL) and the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV). LQD Tops Outflows On the flip side, the largest outflows came from credit and small-cap funds. The iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) led the redemptions list, followed by the Vanguard Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF (VCLT) and the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM). Bond yields mostly stayed within their recent range in July as investors weighed inflation risks against signs of cooling in the labor market.

In my column today I look at why rather than firing the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, President Donald Trump could have claimed that the weak jobs data and dramatic market reaction vindicated his stance that the Fed should cut rates.\nIf you have more time to read, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today.\n1. Brexit's parallels with Trump tariffs tell a tale: MikeDolan 2. Never mind Wall Street records, investors rethink USmarket supremacy 3. Latest Trump tariffs unlikely to budge, top negotiatorsays 4. BOJ gears up to hike rates again but leaves free hand ontiming 5. BP makes its largest oil and gas discovery in 25 yearsoffshore Brazil\nToday's Key Market Moves\n* FX: Most emerging currencies rise against a soft dollar.MSCI's LatAm FX index has biggest 2-day rise in 2 months. * STOCKS: Main Asian, European, U.S. global indices allrise strongly. Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 lead U.S. rally, bothup 2%. * SHARES/SECTORS: S&P 500 communications index +2.6% andtech index +2.2%. Nvidia shares +3.6%, Tesla +2.2%. * BONDS: Treasuries prices rise, pushing 2-year yield to a3-month low of 3.66%. Yields down 2 bps across the curve. * COMMODITIES: Oil falls around 1.5% to its lowest in aweek after OPEC+ agrees to another large output increase.\nStocks bounce back, bonds more cautious\nAfter getting slammed on Friday by unexpectedly poor U.S. employment figures, U.S. and world stocks rebounded on Monday. Whether this is a short-term technical recovery or the resumption of the bull run of recent months remains to be seen.\nIn isolation, the positive start to the week has been pretty impressive. Wall Street more than recovered the ground it lost on Friday, led by the Nasdaq and Russell 2000, as investors bet that both tech and small caps would be among the big winners in a lower interest rate world.\nThe global recovery was probably overdue. The MSCI All Country index's rise on Monday snapped a six-session losing streak, its worst run in nearly two years.\nWhile Friday's slump in U.S. bond yields reflected deepening growth fears and contributed to the huge equity selloff, the further drift lower in yields on Monday supported equity sentiment.\nThe feel good factor could prove fleeting though. The U.S.-centric issues that drove last week's selloff - growth fears, tariff concerns and unusually high levels of policy uncertainty - haven't disappeared.\nTrump said on Monday he will substantially raise tariffs on goods from India over its Russian oil purchases, while Switzerland says it is ready to make a \"more attractive offer\" to Washington to avert the steep 39% tariffs it is facing.\nInvestors are increasingly nervous about political interference in independent U.S. institutions after Trump fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer for allegedly rigging the jobs data. This comes amid Trump's verbal attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates, and as he prepares to announce his nomination to replace Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, who surprisingly resigned on Friday.\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, the U.S. earnings calendar heats up again and purchasing managers index data will give an insight into how the service sectors in many of the world's major economies fared in July.\nTrump scores major own goal with labor official firing\nU.S. President Donald Trump's decision to fire a top labor official following weak jobs data obviously sends ominous signals about political interference in independent institutions, but it is also a major strategic own goal.\nTrump has spent six months attacking the Federal Reserve, and Chair Jerome Powell in particular, for not cutting interest rates. The barbs culminated in Trump branding Powell a \"stubborn MORON\" in a social media post on Friday before the July jobs report was released.\nThe numbers, especially the net downward revision of 258,000 for May and June payrolls growth, were much weaker than expected. In fact, this was \"the largest two-month revision since 1968 outside of NBER-defined recessions (assuming the economy is not in recession now),\" according to Goldman Sachs.\nThis sparked a dramatic reaction in financial markets. Fed rate cut expectations soared, the two-year Treasury yield had its steepest fall in a year, and the dollar tumbled.\nA quarter-point rate cut next month and another by December were suddenly nailed-on certainties, according to rate futures market pricing. This was a huge U-turn from only 48 hours before, when Powell's hawkish steer in his post-FOMC meeting press conference raised the prospect of no easing at all this year.\nTrump's constant lambasting of \"Too Late\" Powell suddenly appeared to have a bit more substance behind it. The Fed chair's rate cut caution centers on the labor market, which now appears nowhere near as \"solid\" as he thought.\nTrump could have responded by saying: \"I was right, and Powell was wrong.\"\nInstead, on Friday afternoon he said he was firing the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, for faking the jobs numbers. Trump provided no evidence of data manipulation.\nSo rather than point out that markets were finally coming around to his way of thinking on the need for lower interest rates, Trump has united economists, analysts and investors in condemnation of what they say is brazen political interference typically associated with underdeveloped and unstable nations rather than the self-proclaimed 'leader of the free world.'\n\"A dark day in, and for, the U.S.,\" economist Phil Suttle wrote on Friday. \"This is the sort of thing only the worst populists do in the worst emerging economies and, to use the style of President Trump, IT NEVER ENDS WELL.\"\nUNCERTAINTY PREMIUM\nIt's important to note that major – even historic – revisions to jobs growth figures are not necessarily indicative of underlying data collection flaws. As Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale, argued on X over the weekend: \"BLS's first-release estimates of non-farm payroll employment have gotten more, not less, accurate over time.\"\nIt should also be noted that the BLS compiles inflation as well as employment data, so, moving forward, significant doubt could surround the credibility of the two most important economic indicators for the U.S. - and perhaps the world.\nPart of what constitutes \"U.S. exceptionalism\" is the assumption that the experts leading the country's independent institutions are exactly that, independent, meaning their actions and output can be trusted, whatever the results.\nBaseless accusations from the U.S. president that the BLS, the Fed and other agencies are making politically motivated decisions to undermine his administration only undermine trust in the U.S. itself.\n\"If doubts are sustained, it will lead investors to demand more of a risk premium to own U.S. assets,\" says Rebecca Patterson, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"While only one of many forces driving asset valuations, it will limit returns across markets.\"\nThis furor comes as Fed Governor Adriana Kugler's resignation on Friday gives Trump the chance to put a third nominee on the seven-person Fed board, perhaps a potential future chair to fill that slot as a holding place until Powell's term expires in May. Whoever that person is will likely be more of a policy dove than a hawk.\nPolicy uncertainty, which had been gradually subsiding since the April 2 'Liberation Day' tariff turmoil, is now very much back on investors' radar.\nWhat could move markets tomorrow?\n* China, Japan, euro zone services PMIs (July) * South Korea inflation (July) * U.S. services PMI, ISM (July) * U.S. trade (June) * U.S. Treasury auctions $58 bln of 3-year notes * U.S. earnings including Caterpillar, AMD and Pfizer\nWant to receive Trading Day in your inbox every weekday morning?

VICI’s trailing and forward P/E were 12.69 and 11.78, respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nA business executive in a sharp suit shaking hands on a real estate deal.\nVICI Properties (VICI) represents a classic mispricing in today’s market, trading around $32 per share despite intrinsic value estimates exceeding $55. Formed in 2017 through Caesars Entertainment’s restructuring, VICI owns an unparalleled portfolio of experiential real estate assets, including Caesars Palace and MGM Grand, under exceptionally long-term triple-net leases averaging over 40 years. This model transfers operational risk to tenants and delivers near-97% EBITDA margins, making its cash flows highly predictable and inflation-protected through CPI-linked escalators. The company generates robust AFFO growth and a 5.5% dividend yield, positioning it as a potential Dividend Aristocrat.\nWall Street misclassifies VICI as a cyclical gaming REIT, overlooking its strategic pivot toward premium experiential infrastructure such as wellness resorts, championship golf destinations, and family entertainment centers. These assets are resistant to digital disruption and cement VICI’s structural moat, reinforced by iconic irreplaceable properties, regulatory barriers, long-term leases, scale advantages, and exclusive rights of first refusal on future developments. Management’s disciplined capital allocation, lean structure, and strong alignment—backed by CPI-linked rents and accretive M&A—further bolster its competitive edge.\nEmbedded optionality from strategic partnerships and expansion into new gaming markets remains underappreciated, offering asymmetric growth potential. Catalysts such as broader gaming legalization, continued diversification beyond gaming, and institutional recognition of VICI as essential infrastructure could drive multiple expansions. At the current valuation, investors pay for stability while receiving secular growth and hidden growth levers for free. This disconnect creates a compelling risk/reward profile with equity-like upside and bond-like income, making VICI a rare opportunity for long-term investors.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on STAG Industrial, Inc. by Steve Wagner in May 2025, which highlighted its strong industrial real estate platform, disciplined capital recycling, and steady FFO growth supported by logistics demand. The company’s stock price has appreciated by approximately 3.92% since our coverage. This is because operational strength drove consistent results. The thesis still stands as industrial fundamentals remain robust.

AN’s trailing and forward P/E were 11.96 and 9.84 ,respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nAn AutoNation-branded dealership, showcasing the wide variety of new and used vehicles on offer.\nAutoNation recently disclosed a notable one-time performance-based RSU award for CEO Michael Manley in its latest proxy, marking a significant departure from past practices. Granted on March 1, 2025, the award offers up to 134,365 shares, with threshold performance yielding 26,873 shares, translating to over $25 million at the top end based on the $182 grant-date stock price.\nThe award is tied to absolute stockholder return over five years and includes service requirements, with cliff-vesting after the performance period and forfeiture upon voluntary resignation or retirement without “good reason.” Specific performance hurdles remain undisclosed, and the company stated that additional details will follow next year. This grant coincided with AutoNation’s regular annual awards, about two weeks after full-year results, suggesting no timing manipulation.\nWhile the exact hurdles are unknown, modeling scenarios illustrate the potential upside. Assuming threshold performance aligns with a 5% CAGR, the stock would need to hit ~$232, making the award worth ~$6 million, modest relative to Manley’s typical $7–10 million annual stock compensation. At maximum performance, likely implying a 15% CAGR and a ~$366 stock price, the payout could reach ~$49 million, significantly exceeding his historical grants. The award’s accounting value is $15 million, and Manley still received his standard ~$4.6 million RSU grant.\nWith AutoNation trading at 9–11x forward P/E and a continued focus on aggressive share repurchases, achieving double-digit CAGR appears plausible. Given the scale of this incentive and its alignment with shareholder returns, the grant signals management’s confidence, making a compelling case to back Manley’s long-term strategy.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Lithia Motors, Inc.

It’s too soon to call this the “Palantir earnings reaction,” as we won’t get that return in the books until Tuesday’s session - but until then, it’s interesting to note that PLTR options traders were pricing in the stock’s tamest earnings reaction in a year.\nSpecifically, the weekly Aug. 8 options series for Palantir stock reflects an expected 10.20% move in either direction after tonight’s earnings, which would be the smallest post-earnings price swing for PLTR in a year, by a very narrow margin.\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nPayPal Maintains its Huge FCF Guidance Despite a Q2 Drop - Is PYPL Stock Too Cheap?\n-\nCoinbase (COIN) vs. Visa (V): Which One of These Stocks Flashing Unusual Options Activity Wins Out?\nPalantir’s Q2 Report Crushes Estimates\nAs for the actual report, Palantir Technologies hit a major milestone in Q2 2025, delivering its first-ever billion-dollar quarter with revenue reaching $1.004 billion. That’s a remarkable 48% year-over-year growth, and it surpassed analysts’ expectations of $939 million. The company's performance was particularly strong in the U.S. market, where revenue surged by 68% to $733 million, with U.S. commercial revenue showing exceptional growth of 93% to reach $306 million.\nThe government sector continues to be a substantial revenue driver, with revenue increasing by 53% to $426 million, bolstered by significant contract wins - including a landmark $10 billion U.S. Army framework agreement. Palantir’s success here can be attributed to increasing demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities and expanding presence in defense technology, with strong momentum across both commercial and government segments.\nAlong with this exceptional Q2 performance, Palantir raised its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to $4.14-4.15 billion, up from previous estimates of $3.89-3.90 billion. Management is guiding for 83% revenue growth in the all-important U.S. commercial segment to over $1.3 billion for the full year.\nFor Q3, the company projects revenue between $1.083-1.087 billion, representing the highest sequential quarterly revenue growth in company history and a 50% annual increase.\nAnalysts Are Still Waiting on a PLTR Stock Pullback\nPLTR stock is up about 549% over the past 52 weeks, and is the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 Index ($SPX) in 2025.

SQM’s trailing and forward P/E were 16.97 and 20.45 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nA laboratory technician pouring a specialty blend of industrial chemicals into a beaker. Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile (SQM), one of the world’s largest lithium producers, is strategically positioned to benefit from structural demand growth driven by electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage systems (ESS), and the energy transition. SQM operates unique low-cost assets, including the lithium-rich Salar de Atacama and the nitrate- and iodine-rich El Norte Grande, enabling strong margins across lithium, specialty plant nutrients (SPN), and iodine. Lithium remains the core driver, accounting for 43% of 2024 profits, supported by global consumption growth from under 500kt in 2022 to over 1,000kt in 2024, with projections reaching 3Mt by 2030. Although lithium prices collapsed nearly 90% from the $80k/t peak during the 2021–2022 frenzy to $8k/t currently due to oversupply, this level is below the marginal cost for most producers and unsustainable. Prices must normalize to incentivize greenfield projects required to meet future demand, with new supply needing $15k–$25k/t to be viable. SQM’s ability to withstand lower prices is enhanced by diversification; SPN and iodine, which together contribute over 50% of profits, offer steady cash flow and downside protection. Iodine prices remain near record highs due to tight supply, while SPN profitability is stabilizing post-war volatility. Long-term lithium demand is underpinned by EV adoption, improving battery technology, and rising ESS needs, with AI-driven power requirements adding further tailwinds. While near-term risks include slower EV demand in China and potential efficiency gains from direct lithium extraction (DLE), these are unlikely to alter the structural growth trajectory. With a recovery in lithium prices likely and SQM trading below intrinsic value, the stock offers an attractive entry point with meaningful upside potential.

Notably, the recent Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering release has been Hasbro’s most successful ever, reinforcing strong demand for its gaming portfolio and setting the stage for upside surprises in earnings.\nIn addition to these growth drivers, Hasbro offers an attractive 4% dividend yield and is expected to announce a share repurchase program within the next year, enhancing shareholder returns even if the stock price remains range-bound in the short term.

However, this segment, while essential, faces structural challenges as global car sales remain cyclical and decline outside China, where Chinese OEMs largely avoid Mobileye. Surround ADAS, a step above basic systems, is now highly competitive, with rivals like Qualcomm, Aptiv, and LG, making market share retention uncertain.\nThe real growth narrative lies in advanced driving solutions—SuperVision (L2+), Chauffeur (L3), and Drive (L4)—which command higher ASPs and unique business models. While these platforms showcase technological leadership, adoption has been slower than expected. Despite bullish commentary on strong OEM interest and testing progress, Mobileye has yet to secure major new contracts for SuperVision or Chauffeur, with timelines slipping toward 2028 due to OEM decision delays and limited competitive urgency outside China.\nManagement acknowledged slow momentum in L2+ and L3, citing unclear OEM pricing strategies and lack of market pressure. The bright spot remains Drive, Mobileye’s L4 platform, which is scaling faster than anticipated with Volkswagen and could exceed 100,000 vehicles by decade’s end. The launch of the EyeQ6 chipset and continued execution on advanced programs reinforce Mobileye’s strong technology base, but without new wins, the near-term growth outlook remains uncertain. Mobileye is in a “show-me” phase, needing to demonstrate its ability to capture meaningful share in next-gen ADAS and automated driving markets before the narrative can shift decisively bullish.\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Innoviz Technologies Ltd. by Danny Brody in January 2025, which highlighted the company’s turnaround potential and strong LiDAR prospects for autonomous vehicles.

In addition, Shift4 is pursuing a unified commerce strategy similar to Adyen and expanding aggressively into emerging global markets.

Management has delivered strong performance over the past four years as a public company, and valuation remains compelling, with the stock trading at roughly one-third of Toast’s market cap.\nHowever, there are notable risks. Shift4 carries a high debt load, which increased following its financing for the Global Blue acquisition and could weigh on the company during a downturn. The reliance on adjusted EBITDA also raises concerns about transparency. Additionally, competing directly with Toast—considered the category leader—poses challenges.

But when it comes to wealth in America, not all states are equal. While residents in certain states enjoy high wages, booming job markets, and strong economies, others lag behind with lower earning potential.\nMedian household income is one of the clearest indicators of a state’s overall wealth, showing not just how much the richest residents make, but how well the typical household is doing. Let's dive deeper into the wealthiest states according to median income.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\n10 wealthiest states in the U.S.\nWe used the latest data from the Federal Reserve to determine the top 10 wealthiest states in the U.S., according to the real median annual household income in each state.\nHere’s a closer look at the wealthiest states in the U.S. by income, as well as some additional factors that impact overall wealth in each state, such as net worth and gross domestic product (with higher GDPs indicating greater economic activity). Find out if your state made the list.\n1. Massachusetts\nMedian annual household income: $106,500\nThe top spot for the wealthiest state in the U.S. goes to Massachusetts. The median household income is a whopping $106,500 — that’s over $25,000 more than the national average.\nThe state also has a median net worth of $308,400. However, it also has the second-highest cost of living in the nation. Total GDP is $780.7 billion.\n2. Maryland\nMedian annual household income: $102,000\nThe runner-up for the wealthiest state in the U.S. is Maryland. This state has a slightly lower cost of living than the top state on our list, as well as a slightly lower median annual household income of $102,000.\nThe median net worth in this state is $304,600, and total GDP is $542.7 billion.\n3. Utah\nMedian annual household income: $101,200\nThe third-wealthiest state according to median household income is Utah. The cost of living is on the higher side compared to other states, but the annual household income is $101,200 — more than $20,000 above the national average.\nThis state also has a median net worth $305,600 and GDP of $300.9 billion.\n4. New Hampshire\nMedian annual household income: $98,780\nNext on our list is New Hampshire. Residents of this state also enjoy higher incomes, with a median annual household income of $98,780.\nHowever, the median net worth is $190,200, which is slightly lower than the national average of $192,300. The state’s GDP is $121.2 billion.\n5. Alaska\nMedian annual household income: $98,190\nAlaska took the fifth spot on our list with a median annual household income of $98,190 — just over $17,500 more than the national average.\nThis state does have an above-average cost of living, which may offset the benefits of higher incomes. And its GDP is significantly lower than some of the other states on this list at about $70 billion.\n6. Hawaii\nMedian annual household income: $97,360\nIn addition to being a popular tourist destination, Hawaii is also one of the wealthiest states, with a median household income of $97,360.\nAdditionally, the median net worth in this state is the highest in the country at $472,600, and the GDP is about $115.6 billion. That said, Hawaii also has the highest cost of living in the country.\n7. Colorado\nMedian annual household income: $96,640\nColorado residents boast a median annual household income of $96,640, or more than $16,000 above the national average.\nThe median net worth in Colorado is also on the higher end at $283,700, though the cost of living in this state is also higher than the national average. And Colorado’s GDP is one of the highest on our list at $553.3 billion.\n8. Virginia\nMedian annual household income: $96,490\nVirginia is for lovers — and some of the wealthiest Americans. The median net worth in this state is nearly $200,000 and the median household income is just under $100,000.\nCost of living in this state is also just above the national average, while its GDP is the third-highest on our list at $764.5 billion.\n9. Washington\nMedian annual household income: $93,440\nWashington state’s median annual income is nearly $13,000 more than the national average. And the median net worth in this state is a whopping $375,100, though the cost of living is also quite high.\nWashington’s GDP is the highest of the states on our list at $854.7 billion.\n10. Connecticut\nMedian annual household income: $92,240\nThe final spot on our list goes to Connecticut. Residents of this state earn a median household income that is about $11,000 more than the national average. The median net worth for this state also sits at $194,400, or just over $2,000 more than the national average.\nHowever, the cost of living in Connecticut is also on the higher end.

As an individual, it’s possible to earn a high income but still have a low overall net worth.\nRead more: 6 ways to increase your net worth\nWealth is determined by what you keep, not just what you earn. Other factors to consider beyond income include:\n-\nDebt-to-income ratio: Your debt-to-income ratio, or DTI, measures how much of your total monthly income goes toward debt obligations. The more you have to pay toward debts each month, the less money you have to put toward other spending, saving, and investing. In other words, even if you’re earning a higher salary, carrying large amounts of debt can eat into that income and make it difficult to build lasting wealth.\n-\nCost of living: The cost of living in your state impacts how much of your income goes toward essentials like housing, groceries, food, etc. If you live in a state with a higher cost of living, it may negate the benefits of a higher income since you have to spend more on everyday expenses.\n-\nTaxes: State taxes can have a big influence on wealth building because they directly affect how much of your income you get to keep and invest. Higher state income taxes, for example, can widen the gap between your gross vs. net income.\nAll of these factors can drastically impact a person’s experience living in a particular state and their wealth-building journey. While some states have higher earners than others, on average, those higher earners may also be faced with higher costs that eat into their earnings.\nIn other words, a high salary improves your potential for wealth, but it doesn’t guarantee it.\nRead more: These are America’s best and worst states for saving money in 2025\n>> Sign up for Mind Your Money newsletter for weekly tips and insights", "content_hash": "df3d9bbb18854af9a0d05c02c097a070", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

In short, traders should be on alert for further signs of potential downside.\n\"Volatility” is a loaded word; when most mention it, they mean negative or downside volatility. (Most folks don’t mind when price spikes are higher, right?)\nFriday’s weak jobs numbers appear to have significantly rearranged the pieces on the proverbial trading board—particularly worrisome given the likely growth-impeding Trump tariffs set to take effect August 7.\nA week ago, everything was peachy-keen, pointing to a steady-as-she-goes Fed interest rate policy going into the September 17-18 FOMC meeting. As of July 31, the odds of a Fed rate change in September were 60% in favor of no change, about where it has been over the prior few weeks.\nNow, that's changed-- significantly.\nStock market volatility may crush complacency\nThe odds that interest rates would stay the same may have been priced into stocks, given that major market indices climbed to new all-time highs last week.\nHowever, Friday’s Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs report may have changed everything. It showed anemic July job growth of only 73,000 versus expectations of 110,000.\nWorse, revisions to May and June erased over a quarter million jobs, painting a much weaker picture of the US labor situation than previously recognized.\nAfter the jobs data was released, the market did an about-face, concluding that instead of no cuts, the Fed would lower rates by a quarter percent in September and potentially reduce them even more before the end of the year.\nAccording to futures data on August 1, CME Fed Fund Futures priced in a 76% chance of a 0.25% Fed rate cut in September, with a total of 0.62% in cuts expected by the December FOMC meeting.\nIncreased chances of a rate cut would usually be good news for stocks, because it would mean more economic activity, higher revenue, and bigger profits.\nThis time around, however, cuts would be for all the wrong reasons: tariff uncertainty, job market weakness, fear of a US or global recession/slowdown, not to mention the undermining of the Fed’s independence and the credibility of the BLS data, all contributing to a bleak outlook for the US in second half of 2025.\nAfter the jobs data revisions, President Trump fired BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer in frustration.\nFriday’s jobs data is a major market wake-up call\nFriday’s data questions the overall strength of the US economy, and markets were not pleased.\nThe S&P 500 index lost 1.6% on Friday while other major indices slipped as well (NASDAQ down 2.2%), and crude oil dropped 2.9% on fears of a US and broader global slowdown.\nThese recent developments represent a significant fundamental shift over mere hours and are likely not nearly fully priced into stocks. That may mean some near-term pain for investors. For those with some dry ammo (cash on the sidelines), the weeks ahead could offer discount buying opportunities.\nStock charts don't look good\nTechnical analysis charts historical prices to gain insight into what may happen next. Unfortunately, the following charts paint a significant and similar technical picture, one of downside risk momentum increasing and looking poised to plumb further depths.\nFirst up is the MSCI All-World Developed Index (ACWI), an index of all major developed economies’ stock markets. It shows a sharp gap lower on Friday with a bearish crossover of the Kijun (red) line by the Tenkan (blue) line appearing to be imminent, which would be another bearish signal. The top of the cloud at 124.89, some 3.2% lower than current levels, is the next key source of Ichimoku support.\nThen, there’s US stocks alone as shown below by the Daily S&P 500 Index. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust's (SPY) price has gapped below the Tenkan and Kijun lines, which are also set to cross over bearishly shortly. The top of the cloud, currently at 598 and rising slightly, is the next major source of Ichimoku support, below which may signal even steeper losses toward the bottom of the cloud (light red line) at the 560 level.\nAs a sign of energy demand and a proxy for global growth, the price of crude oil (WTI) is frequently a leading indicator for major risk and growth assets, including stocks and commodities.\nIts chart also shows a bearish gap lower in Friday’s price action, with a daily close below the red Kijun line, but so far holding above the cloud base at $66.85. A daily close below that level will be very bearish for oil prices and the overall outlook.\nWhat all this means for investors now\nThe overall picture that emerges is one of potential downside, barring any sudden reversals by the US administration on tariffs or other policies. However, a policy reversal seems less likely this time around in light of the administration’s efforts to formally impose tariffs, which starts on August 7.\nIf so, the TACO trade (Trump Always Chickens Out) may be a thing of the past.\nAs a result, investors may have to sit through some tough days in the weeks ahead, especially if the weakness suggested by price charts bears out.

It's a revolving credit line split into two distinct stages: the draw period and the repayment period. And how you manage the draw period can determine whether your HELOC becomes a smart financial tool or a source of stress later on.\nThink of the draw period as your window of flexibility—where you get access to your funds, set your repayment habits, and prepare for what comes next. Used wisely, it's a powerful way to handle home improvements, debt consolidation, or unexpected expenses without derailing your long-term financial goals.\nWhat Is the HELOC Draw Period?\nThe draw period is the initial phase of your HELOC where you're allowed to borrow against your available line of credit. This period typically lasts up to 10 years, though the exact timeframe varies by lender. During this stage, you can withdraw money whenever you need it, similar to a credit card. You'll only pay interest on the amount you actually borrow, not the full credit limit, which makes HELOCs attractive for homeowners who want flexible access to capital without committing to a large lump-sum loan. Depending on the lender, you may be required to make small monthly payments during this time, usually interest-only. But don't let those low payments fool you—what you don't pay now will catch up to you later.\nOnce the draw period ends, you'll no longer be able to borrow against your HELOC, and the loan transitions into the repayment phase. This means your monthly payments will increase significantly, as you'll now be responsible for both the principal and the interest. Jose Garcia, president and CEO of Northwest Community Credit Union, emphasizes the importance of being prepared for that shift: \"This can lead to higher monthly payments, so it's important to plan accordingly.\" In short, the draw period gives you spending power, but it's up to you to use that power responsibly—and to prepare for when the real bills come due.\nWhen you open a HELOC, your lender will approve a credit limit based on your available home equity—usually up to 80% of the value of your home minus what you still owe on your mortgage. For example, if your home is worth $500,000 and you owe $200,000 on your mortgage, you have $300,000 in equity. A lender might approve a HELOC for 80% of that equity—$240,000 in this case. But that doesn't mean you're handed $240,000 in cash on day one. You can withdraw as much or as little as you need, when you need it, up to your approved limit.\nThe interest rate on a HELOC is typically variable, meaning it can rise or fall depending on market conditions. This means your interest payments could fluctuate month to month during the draw period. While it's tempting to treat the HELOC like a safety net or easy-access cash, it's important to keep track of what you're borrowing—and what those future payments might look like if rates go up. During the draw period, your lender may offer the option to pay just the interest on the money you've borrowed. But that doesn't reduce your principal balance, and once the draw period ends, the payments can rise sharply as you're required to pay both principal and interest over a shorter time span—usually 10 to 20 years.\nSmart Strategies for Managing the HELOC Draw Period\nNot all homeowners treat the draw period with the seriousness it deserves, and that's often where problems begin. The flexibility of a HELOC can lull you into thinking of it as \"free money\"—but every dollar borrowed must be repaid, and with interest. The first and most important rule is to resist the urge to max out your available credit just because it's there. You're not required to use the full amount, and every dollar left untouched is one that won't accumulate interest. Garcia advises: \"Keep track of your borrowing and ensure you can manage the higher payments once the repayment period starts.\" In other words, always look ahead—even when it feels like you're in control today.\nAnother smart tactic is to make principal payments during the draw period, even if your lender only requires interest payments. By doing so, you reduce your total balance and lighten your future repayment burden. This can be especially important if interest rates are rising, since the variable nature of HELOCs means that today's manageable payment could balloon tomorrow. If your finances allow, consider paying more than the minimum each month, or set up automatic transfers to chip away at the balance regularly. You'll thank yourself later when you're no longer allowed to draw funds but still owe a significant amount.\nCommon Pitfalls to Avoid\nPerhaps the most common mistake homeowners make during the draw period is underestimating how quickly a low-interest, interest-only payment can spiral into a much larger monthly burden. The shift from draw to repayment can feel jarring, especially if you haven't built room into your budget for larger payments. Another misstep is using the HELOC to cover day-to-day expenses or as a Band-Aid for poor financial habits. While HELOCs can offer relief in a crisis, using one to fund a lifestyle you can't sustain can backfire. Because your home serves as collateral, falling behind on payments isn't just a credit issue—it could eventually lead to foreclosure.\nThere's also the risk of variable interest rates increasing unexpectedly, especially if you're using a large portion of the credit line. Unlike a fixed-rate loan, HELOC payments are tied to broader market trends, and those can change quickly. If rates rise, your minimum payment might jump significantly—even if your balance stays the same. That's why it's critical to stay informed about your rate structure, track how much you've borrowed, and understand how rate changes will affect your monthly payment. Don't rely on guesswork. Know your numbers—and how much you can truly afford.", "content_hash": "f7594a6a6704ce307d1fb27d5a133b3d", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

In May, it introduced McCrispy Chicken Strips as a permanent menu item.\nThese promotions are in addition to the $5 meal deal and the buy-one, add-one for $1 offers launched last year.\nCEO Chris Kempczinski said re-engaging the low-income consumer is \"critical\", as they typically visit its restaurants more frequently than middle- and high-income groups.\n\"This bifurcated consumer base is why we remain cautious about the overall near-term health of the U.S. consumer,\" he said.\nMenu innovation and promotions had also helped Domino's report upbeat U.S. same-store sales, while weakening demand hurt sales at Yum Brands and Chipotle Mexican Grill.\nFor the second quarter, customer visits to McDonald's outperformed the wider quick-service restaurant category, data from foot traffic tracking firm Placer.ai showed.\n\"While rivals like Yum Brands and Chipotle struggled with consumer pullback, McDonald's played to its strengths by leaning into value, nostalgia and limited-time promotions,\" eMarketer analyst Zak Stambor said.\nComparable sales in U.S., McDonald's biggest market, grew 2.5%, compared with a 0.7% decline a year ago.\nSales in its business segment where restaurants are operated by local partners, jumped 5.6%, led by Japan, while it rose 4% in international markets, on demand recovery in the UK, Canada and France.\nAdjusted net income of $3.19 per share exceeded estimates of $3.15.\n(Reporting by Savyata Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)", "content_hash": "f81c8768fcca88803cd91ec2be56a91b", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

This sentiment is echoed by nearly half of the respondents who stated that tariffs are influencing their workforce-related decisions, potentially affecting employment levels.\nThe impact of tariffs extends beyond immediate operational concerns.\nThe survey found that 56% of businesses are reducing or delaying their product and service offerings.\nAdditionally, 47% have scaled back or are considering scaling back their US-based operations.\nPartners in supply chains are also feeling the pressure, with 30% reporting a pullback in operations.\nNFTC international supply chain policy vice president John Pickel said: “Volatility in trade policy, and tariffs in particular, are hurting rather than helping US companies. US-based firms create American jobs, supply our domestic economy, and foster international competitiveness by sourcing and selling in the global economy. Injecting uncertainty into this process increases costs, thwarts innovation, and threatens to bring back shortages of the products we all use.”\nThe international response to US tariffs is another challenge for American businesses.\nUp to 60% of companies have noted that foreign countermeasures are diminishing the global competitiveness of their products and services. This has led some firms to reassess their long-term investment strategies in the US market, the survey noted.\nMoreover, the complexity and overlapping nature of various tariff measures, such as those under Section 232 combined with reciprocal actions, are adding to compliance burdens.\nIn some cases, all respondents reported moderate to significant disruption due to \"tariff stacking,\" which complicates strategic planning and capital allocation.\n“Rather than incentivising domestic production, the current tariff environment and broader trade policy uncertainty is paralysing supply chain decision-making, forcing companies to delay or even cancel projects that support American jobs,” Pickel added.", "content_hash": "7f4071b6c19ea08e41548f9cba451d5b", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

(NYSE:TMO) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:\n\"Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.'s (NYSE:TMO) sales and earnings growth expectations were revised lower for this year. Ongoing tariff headwinds have hindered sales in China while policies and rhetoric have dramatically reduced funds flowing to U.S. academic and government research institutions, which make up about 8% of Thermo’s annual sales. On the positive side, first quarter results showed a return to mid-single-digit growth from Thermo’s biopharma customers, which is Thermo’s largest end market and accounts for about half of annual sales. This comes after a multi-year period of inventory destocking that hampered sales growth in 2023 and 2024 before our initial purchase. A continuation of this trend would be a strong indicator for the company and its shares, and we believe that is likely what we will see as the rest of 2025 unfolds, driven by a strong pipeline of biologic drugs and increased use of Thermo’s (and other’s) single-use products to manufacture these drugs. While we don’t know if the current administration in Washington will temper its hostility to U.S. academic and government research or if trade relations with China will materially improve, the shares are currently trading at a nearly decade-low valuation multiple on earnings that are already reflecting the headwinds above to a large degree. We added to the position during the quarter and continue to believe long-term secular demand for novel drug therapies will eventually overshadow near-term politically-driven headwinds.\"", "content_hash": "15ac87174dc11ae1c5418f861d1d4839", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Earnings exceeded expectations for the quarter, and expectations for the full fiscal year fell by just 1 to 2% after the report. We think the stock price overreacted, and we used share price weakness to add to the position. The crux of the negative sentiment on Becton is that it may be a business that grows between 3-5% rather than one that grows between 5-6%. We’d note that the company grew its base (ex COVID-19 testing revenue) revenue organically by 7% from fiscal 2021 to 2024. Whether the company grows organic revenue at 4.5% or 5.5% going forward, we’re not sure. But we do feel confident that in either case the stock is worth more than its current valuation of less than 12x forward earnings. Tariff impacts, Chinese volume-based procurement discounts, customer inventory management dynamics, and some transitory competitive product impacts all had impacts on recent revenue growth. However, margin expansion has exceeded expectations, investments have set up an expected revenue acceleration, and the smoothing effects of time on normal business vicissitudes are set to improve growth relative to last quarter’s result. Becton Dickinson is the category leader in product lines representing 75% of its revenue, 85% of its revenue is recurring, the business is highly profitable, and demographics portend increasing demand for its products over the coming decades.

Growth lagged the 26% increase from the same period in 2024, though revenue soared past the previous DKK 125bn.\nOverall sales rose 18% year-on-year at constant exchange rates (CER) to DKK 154.9bn for H1. Revenue for Q2 was DKK 76.8bn, slightly ahead of the DKK 76.6bn analysts forecast. Ozempic generated DKK 64.5bn in H1, while Wegovy contributed DKK 36.8bn.\nLower-than-expected sales for Wegovy and Ozempic is one of the reasons Novo Nordisk cut its 2025 sales outlook last week. The company, holder of one of the largest market capitalisations in Europe, warned that full-year sales growth was expected to be 8% to 14%, a steep climbdown from its May forecast of 13% to 21%.\nDespite holding first to market advantage in the GLP-1RA space, Eli Lilly has surpassed Novo Nordisk’s market lead with tirzepatide, marketed as Mounjaro in type 2 diabetes and Zepbound in weight loss, in part due to its higher efficacy over semaglutide.\nAnalysis by GlobalData in January 2025 demonstrated that tirzepatide was outpacing semaglutide in the obesity market, the former having a higher sales ceiling forecast by 2031. Last year, Eli Lilly’s sales grew 32% compared to 26% for Novo Nordisk. Eli Lilly has not yet announced its Q2 2025 results, but investors will be keeping a close eye on whether the sales gap between the two drugs has widened again.\nLower sales have not solely been caused by Eli Lilly – the rise in compounded semaglutide has been a big cause of concern for Novo Nordisk. These alternatives, which are cheaper and more accessible for patients, have eroded market share for the drugmaker. The competition forced Novo to cut the price of Wegovy in the US and introduce more direct-to-patient delivery methods. The company has maintained that continued compounding is unlawful and unsafe.\nBarclays analysts said in a note that the company expects deeper erosion in the US market – the region most affected by lower sales – in the second half of the year, as per Reuters.\nOn the same day it announced its H1 and Q2 results, Novo Nordisk separately revealed that it has filed 14 new lawsuits against makers of unapproved compounded drugs claiming to contain semaglutide. It brings the total lawsuits levelled by the company to 132 across 40 US states.", "content_hash": "4d9933e32b2cadfa8c95e366f92037d1", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

It relies on revenue from its licensing deal with French drugmaker Sanofi and vaccines in development, including a COVID-flu combination shot and for bird flu that is currently undergoing lab testing.\nNovavax had licensed the rights for its COVID-19 shot, Nuvaxovid — also its sole commercial product — to Sanofi in an up to $1.2 billion deal last year.\nThe company expects its 2025 adjusted revenue to be between $1 billion and $1.05 billion, up from $975 million to $1.03 billion forecast earlier. This excludes Sanofi sales and royalties.\nNovavax also beat Wall Street expectations for second-quarter revenue, driven by a $175 million milestone payment related to the U.S. approval of Nuvaxovid in May.\nIt plans to start a post-marketing study on Nuvaxovid by the end of the year, and estimates that to cost between $70 million and $90 million. The company expects Sanofi to reimburse about 70% of the costs, while it will absorb the rest.\nNovavax's traditional protein-based COVID-19 shot offers an alternative technology to messenger RNA-based rivals from Pfizer and Moderna, but has failed to make a mark in the U.S. vaccine market due to manufacturing issues and regulatory hurdles.\nThe biotech, however, sees an opportunity after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said it would wind down mRNA vaccine development under its biomedical research unit, BARDA, which helps companies develop treatments and diagnostic tools to address public health threats.\n\"There is the potential opportunity for us, particularly since other platforms may be taken out of consideration,\" Novavax Executive Vice President Silvia Taylor said on a post-earnings call.\nNovavax said it is working with BARDA on potential funding for its H5N1 bird flu vaccine candidate.\nIt reported total quarterly revenue of $239 million, beating analysts' estimate of $147.96 million, according to data compiled by LSEG.\nNet income was down 34.4% at $106.51 million.\n(Reporting by Mariam Sunny in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)", "content_hash": "0eed362581f9692a0d394b9dab879bda", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Intel reported its second-quarter earnings results in late July, but Lip-Bu Tan's public memo, published at the same time as the release, drew most of the attention of investors.\nThe CEO, who took over the position in March, laid out several strategic initiatives designed to turn around Intel's financial position. And considering Intel's importance in the semiconductor industry, they have the potential to reverberate across multiple companies.\nIn fact, it's great news for one of the most dominant forces in the industry, while another major player could see even greater uncertainty in its future. Here's why.\nThe most important announcement in Intel's news release\nWhile Intel beat revenue expectations for the second quarter, that was completely overshadowed by Tan's plans to make Intel \"a more financially disciplined foundry.\" The foundry business (that's the business of actually making the physical chips) generated $4.4 billion in revenue last quarter, up 3% year over year.\nBut the vast majority of that $4.4 billion in revenue stems from intersegment services (i.e., printing and packaging Intel's own chips for sale). Just a minuscule $22 million came from making chips for other semiconductor companies, and that's down from $39 million in the same quarter a year ago.\nOver the past decade, Intel's foundry capabilities have fallen behind those of its biggest competitor, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM). As a result, in the risks section of its 10-Q, the company says, \"We have been unsuccessful to date in attracting significant customers to our external foundry business.\"\nThat's why Tan says Intel needs a big change. \"There are no more blank checks,\" he wrote regarding investing in foundry equipment. Instead, the focus is on ramping up Intel's newest node exclusively for in-house chips. A node shrinks the size of the transistors printed on the chip, enabling faster and more power-efficient chips by packing more transistors per square millimeter of silicon.\nIntel's newest node is called 18A, denoting a node size of 18 angstrom (1/10,000 of a millimeter). Note that the size has mostly become marketing for incremental node shrinkage. Then there's Intel's next-generation node, 14A, which will only move forward if Intel receives customer commitments first.\nThat represents a huge shift in strategy for Intel as it could withdraw altogether from leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing in the not-too-distant future. That would cede the most profitable segment of the market to its competitors, and Intel would become one of their customers for its most advanced chips. That could have some serious repercussions throughout the industry.\nBad news for one of Intel's suppliers\nTan's decision to pull back on spending for the foundry means equipment manufacturers may be losing a big customer. One of the companies that would be hit hardest is ASML Holding(NASDAQ: ASML). It makes cutting-edge lithography machines required for the most advanced chipmaking processes.\nWhen ASML released its second-quarter earnings, management tempered growth expectations for 2026. \"We continue to see increasing uncertainty driven by macro-economic and geopolitical developments. Therefore, while we still prepare for growth in 2026, we cannot confirm it at this stage,\" management wrote.\nWith Intel's earnings release, we now have more details on why ASML isn't so confident in its future. Intel's 14A process is heavily reliant on the capabilities of ASML's tools. Its latest high numerical aperture (NA) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machine reportedly costs $400 million. Intel represented a significant buyer for ASML, but that's now a much more questionable source of revenue.\nLosing business from one of its biggest customers is certainly bad news for the stock. But there are no viable substitutes for ASML's machines. Losing Intel as a customer would sting, but other foundries may pick up the slack over time as demand for leading-edge chips doesn't appear to be slowing down anytime soon. At a price of around 25 times forward earnings, the market may be giving investors an opportunity to buy ASML stock at a fair value on the setback.\nThe biggest winner from Intel's shift\nAs Intel pulls back on capital spending for its foundry and focuses on finding a significant customer for its 14A node, one of its biggest competitors stands to expand its lead. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), or TSMC, is planning to increase its capital expenditures (capex) by about 34% this year to reach $40 billion at the midpoint of its guidance.\nTSMC continues to invest with expectations for future growth. It's not waiting around to ensure demand before it spends, but management is still fairly disciplined when it comes to forecasting demand. It's seen strong early results from its N2 process, and it already has customers lined up. Its A16 process is progressing quickly as well.\nManagement expects fast adoption from artificial intelligence (AI) customers for its A16 process due to the power-efficiency improvements it offers over the current nodes.\nWith Intel pulling back on its foundry spending, TSMC's lead in both technology and capacity may grow even wider. And if Intel fails to attract a significant customer for its 14A process, it plans to discontinue investing in it entirely. That opens the door for TSMC to start printing Intel's chips next decade. Intel's management even said it would become dependent on TSMC for foundry services for nodes beyond 18A if it fails to advance 14A in its 10-Q.\nFor now, Intel is ceding the market for leading-edge chips to TSMC. That should support very strong revenue growth for the Taiwanese company over the next few years, as it ramps up its 2-nanometer process and finalizes the 16-angstrom process. Considering the stock currently trades around 25 times earnings expectations, and many analysts could revise those expectations higher with the potential for it to add more of Intel's business, it looks like a great opportunity for investors right now.\nDo the experts think Intel is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

While the sector remains smaller in volume compared to banking and insurance, experts warn its growth trajectory is a red flag for lenders and lessors alike.\nCases of asset finance fraud increased from 970 in 2017 to 1,560 in 2024 — a 60.82% rise — marking it as the third-fastest growing sector for identity fraud over the seven-year period. Although it accounted for just 0.65% of total fraud cases in 2024, the sharp rise suggests fraudsters are increasingly eyeing niche finance segments that may be more vulnerable to synthetic IDs or weak digital onboarding checks.\n\"Criminals are clearly diversifying,” said Gus Tomlinson, Managing Director at GBG. “While plastic cards and bank accounts remain the biggest targets, we're seeing significant upticks in sectors like asset finance, insurance, and communications —areas that haven't traditionally been the focus.”\nThe study, which analysed identity fraud trends across nine sectors between 2017 and 2024, revealed that insurance fraud saw the most dramatic rise — up by 211%, with cases jumping from 4,215 to 13,108. The communications sector followed closely, with a 114.77% increase.\nPlastic card fraud remains the most common identity fraud type, accounting for over 94,000 cases in 2024 — an increase of 60% from 2017 and now comprising nearly 40% of all cases. Bank account fraud, while growing at a slower rate of 12.42%, still makes up more than 24% of all fraud.\nMore traditional finance areas saw declines: mortgage fraud dropped by 33.33%, and loan fraud fell 22.16%, indicating possible improvements in fraud detection or a shift in criminal preference. “Fraudsters appear to be moving away from highly regulated sectors and toward those with faster access to funds or less stringent verification,” Tomlinson noted.\nVolatility in recent trends\nInterestingly, asset finance fraud recorded a dramatic year-on-year drop of 80.09% between 2023 and 2024, indicating that either fraud prevention measures have been tightened or criminals have redirected their focus. By contrast, the communications sector saw a 72.72% surge in the same period, becoming a key focus for fraudulent activity in the digital age.\nMethodology\nGBG’s analysis is based on identity fraud case data collected from 2017 to 2024 across multiple sectors: Cifas Fraudscape. The study tracks changes in fraud volume, percentage share, and sector rankings, providing insights into both long-term trends and short-term year-on-year shifts. The data encompasses over 239,000 identity fraud cases recorded in 2024, up from approximately 174,500 in 2017.", "content_hash": "ac0ab0f7723e88a58cdeb88631a8dc7c", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

(NYSE:FND) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:\n\"Floor & Decor Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:FND) operates a chain of ~250 warehouse stores focused exclusively on hard surface flooring and wall covering, decorative accessories, and installation materials. The company has curated a global network of ~250 suppliers from which they directly source product, removing multiple steps in the supply chain between end customer and manufacturer at a typical flooring retailer. This direct-sourcing model combined with their large format stores allows Floor & Décor to offer more attractive pricing, a larger assortment of flooring options across a wide range of price points, and keep job-sized inventory in stock, which is especially attractive to professional installers. The current environment is a challenging one for the company as low single-family home turnover and high interest rates have depressed remodel activity while tariffs may increase the price of flooring projects. Impressively, the company has demonstrated significant supply chain flexibility, reducing its China cost-of-goods-sold exposure from 50% in 2018 to an expected low to mid-single-digit percentage by the end of 2025. While the near future is likely to be tumultuous for the company, we believe homeowners will maintain the desire to improve their homes once we emerge from the current economic cycle and that Floor & Décor will have further improved their scale and selection advantages once that occurs.\"", "content_hash": "a8a0a19fc98b77f7af85af2c06a917ef", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Even including Hasbro’s 4%+ dividend (5.3% on today’s price), this was not a successful investment in absolute or relative terms. On the positive side, Magic the Gathering – the largest toy and game brand in the US not named Lego – continues to perform well and the management team made impressive progress on a multi-year turnaround plan in the Consumer Products (traditional toys) division that looked likely to improve operating profit margins from negative in 2023 to nearly 10% this year. However, after a decade-plus of growth throughout the steepest part of the smartphone and tablet adoption curve, toy industry sales have been persistently weak following COVID, which has limited Hasbro’s overall growth potential. Additionally – and unfortunately – Hasbro also manufactures more than half of their products in China. Since toys are a category that has typically shown a lot of price elasticity, limiting Hasbro’s ability to respond to tariffs with price increases, tariffs would significantly impair the profitability and the turnaround plan for the Consumer Products division. We chose to redeploy the capital invested in Hasbro into other names in the portfolio that should also benefit from a normalization of trade relations while having less downside risk should tensions continue.\"", "content_hash": "8d9eb34d534057cb3d667861490b27f4", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

It will be intriguing to see whether or not incoming CEO Greg Abel makes any major changes to the company's equity portfolio when he takes over.\nWhatever happens, Buffett will remain an investing legend for Berkshire Hathaway's incredible performance during his tenure. Many of his stocks are still solid buys today, and Visa(NYSE: V) and American Express(NYSE: AXP) look like good ones right now.\n1. Visa: Growing with the economy\nVisa is the largest credit card network in the world. It has more than $16 trillion in trailing-12-month payment volume and works with 14,500 partnering institutions. It's accepted by more than 150 million merchants.\nIn general, Visa's performance is a good indication of what's happening in the economy, since it depends on consumer spending. In its fiscal 2025's third quarter (ended March 31), the company demonstrated momentum, and it expects that to persist.\nRevenue increased 14% year over year to $10.2 billion, beating analyst expectations of $9.85 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) based on adjusted generally accepted accounting principles were up 23% to $2.98, higher than Wall Street expectations of $2.85. Management said there was resilience in both discretionary and nondiscretionary categories.\nAlthough Visa is an established financial giant, it's very much in tune with new technology and other trends. It pioneered the chip-enabled credit cards that make contactless payments possible and are still a relatively new phenomenon, and it's bringing artificial intelligence (AI) and stablecoins into new product development.\nFor example, it's testing Visa Intelligent Commerce, which allows customers to make purchases through AI agents. The company has moved beyond being a simple credit card network, and its other categories are driving higher growth. Visa Direct, for example, is the largest global money-movement program in the world, and transactions increased 25% year over year in the second quarter.\nThe stock dropped after the company announced third-quarter earnings this week. The market seemed disappointed that it didn't raise its full-year outlook, even though it maintained that tariffs wouldn't have a strong negative effect. The stock is still outpacing the S&P 500 this year, but it's a great time to buy shares before they start climbing again.\n2. American Express: The closed-loop model\nAmerican Express is also a credit card network, but it's a lot more than that, too. It has features that make it stand out from other financial stocks and that make it one of Buffett's favorite stocks.\nBeyond its credit cards, Amex also has a full banking segment. It has a closed-loop model, which means it funds its own credit cards, rather than partnering with other financial institutions, like Visa does.\nThere are several benefits to this model. One is that as a bank, it has a lot of cash from deposits, with which it makes net interest income. That's a great feature for when interest rates are high and spending is low, which hurts the credit card segment. In the second quarter, net interest income increased 14% over last year and represented about 23% of total revenue.\nIt also has a fee-based model, and although it does offer some no-fee options, most of its cards have an annual fee. That creates a cycle of recurring revenue and generates loyalty; customers love the rewards program that they get by paying the annual fee. Revenue increased 9% year over year in the 2025 second quarter, and fees increased 20%, accounting for 14% of the total.\nThe company targets an affluent clientele that's generally more resilient than the mass market and tends to spend more. It's resonating with younger shoppers, who continue to drive growth. Millennials' spending increased 10% year over year in the second quarter, and Gen-Z spending was up 40%. As they use Amex products throughout their financial journeys, they're likely to fuel growth for a long time.\nThe company added 3.1 million new cards in the second quarter, which is a typical addition for AmEx. 1.5 million were U.S. consumer cards (the remainder were business or international consumer cards), which is low for the industry.\nThe beauty of this is that AmEx doesn't need to add millions of customers to get the same revenue as other credit card companies do because its customers spend much more than the mass consumer. Adding fewer customers but higher-spending ones each quarter leaves open a long growth runway. For comparison, its trailing-12-month revenue is almost double Visa's.\nWall Street wasn't thrilled with the company's second-quarter results, as was the case with Visa, indicating that the market is expecting more in light of the improving economy. American Express stock is up just slightly year to date, but it offers years of continued potential gains for long-term investors.\nShould you buy stock in Visa right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

Here's the Biggest Reason Why There's Still Time.\nKey Points\n-\nBitcoin’s supply is limited to 21 million coins, making it a rare digital asset.\n-\nMining rewards are cut in half every four years, slowing the creation of new coins.\n-\nMassive gains in Bitcoin’s price haven’t necessarily closed the door for new long-term investors.\nIt may feel pointless to buy Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) today. The original cryptocurrency rose to all-time highs near $115,500 last month. It has gained 88% over the last year, 400% in three years, and 40,440% in a decade.\nWith jumps like these in the rearview mirror, it must be too late to get started with this newfangled digital currency. Right?\nWell, that's true only if you don't think Bitcoin has a long-term future. That could be a big mistake, though. Bitcoin was designed to gain value against fiat currencies in the long run, and the economic model is near the start of a long runway.\nBitcoin mining keeps getting harder\nBitcoin's white paper describes two methods for adding monetary value to the cryptocurrency.\nThe computers running the system currently receive 6.25 Bitcoins when a data block is completed -- about once every 10 minutes. Generating the data blocks requires a lot of computing power and electricity, making the process similar to investing in land, work, and mining equipment to collect physical gold ore.\nThe rewards are halved after every 210,000 data blocks, or approximately four years. The fourth Bitcoin halving took place in April 2024, and the next should fall in March 2028. The rewards will eventually be smaller than the tiniest fraction of a Bitcoin that the system can use in transactions, known as a satoshi. That will be the end of Bitcoin creation, and all processing rewards from that point (around the year 2140) will come from transaction fees.\nLost coins and lasting value\nThere will never be more than 21 million Bitcoin in circulation. The real coin reserve is actually a bit smaller, as some coins are lost forever and can't be replaced.\nSo there's a strictly limited supply of Bitcoin. If demand for this cryptocurrency increases over time, the coin price should also rise. It's a basic supply and-demand calculation, further protected by the large investments already made in the Bitcoin mining infrastructure.\nWith Bitcoin exchange-traded funds on the market and rising institutional investments, Bitcoin looks poised for a long and wealth-building history.\nShould you buy stock in Bitcoin right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.", "content_hash": "8ff3040bc70e188c3d0cf670e07cb37f", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

But some Wall Street analysts said the outlook left more to be desired.\n\"The updated guide was not as good as bulls likely hoped,” KeyBanc analyst Brandon Nispel wrote in reaction, noting that while the quarter featured some bright spots, softer underlying results in parks and streaming could increase investor scrutiny ahead of Disney's fiscal 2026 guidance, due next quarter.\nAll in on ESPN: New NFL, WWE deals\nPrior to its earnings update, Disney confirmed previous reports that ESPN has reached a preliminary deal to acquire key NFL Media assets, including NFL Network, NFL RedZone, and NFL Fantasy, in exchange for a 10% equity stake in the network.\nAlongside the sale of NFL Network, the league and ESPN have also agreed to a second deal under which the league will license certain NFL content and intellectual property to ESPN for use across NFL Network and related assets.

Earnings increased from $1.39 per share a year ago.\nHowever, ongoing weakness in Disney’s linear networks business weighed on the quarter. Revenue in the segment fell 15% year over year while operating income dropped 28%.\nOn the streaming front, Disney said it will merge its Disney+ and Hulu platforms next year.\n\"This will create an impressive package of entertainment, pairing the highest-caliber brands and franchises, great general entertainment, family programming, news, and industry-leading live sports content in a single app,\" the executive team wrote on Wednesday.\nDisney+ added 1.8 million subscribers in the quarter, falling short of the 2.05 million analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected.\nDisney's direct-to-consumer segment, which includes Hulu and Disney+, posted a profit of $346 million, compared to a $19 million loss a year ago. The company continues to prioritize consistent profitability in streaming amid the ongoing shift away from traditional pay-TV. Disney is targeting approximately $875 million in streaming profits for fiscal 2025.\nTheme parks power on\nMeanwhile, the parks business continued to shine in the quarter, though analysts flagged potential headwinds ahead.\nRevenue of $9.09 billion beat expectations of $8.87 billion, with the company posting a 22% rise in operating income at its domestic parks. Walt Disney World delivered record Q3 revenue, while broader gains were fueled by increased guest spending, higher hotel occupancy, and a rise in cruise volumes following the successful launch of the Disney Treasure late last year.\nOn the earnings call, executives said bookings for the Experiences segment are tracking about 6% higher so far in the current quarter, signaling continued strength across parks, cruises, and resorts.", "content_hash": "d85c1a3a5af348f0870d9ebf31793516", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

It might also sell minority stakes in companies to aid the expansion, it said.\nAnalysts have said that mass robotaxi deployment could lower driver-reliant Uber's operating costs and boost profitability.\nThe company has been offering Waymo robotaxis on its ride-hailing app in Austin, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia. In April, Uber entered a deal with Volkswagen for thousands of autonomous electric vans in the United States over the next decade.\nIt also struck a $300 million partnership in July that will allow it to deploy more than 20,000 autonomous taxis, made by EV startup Lucid and powered by self-driving tech from Nuro, over six years.\nDespite strong regulatory scrutiny, doubts about wider adoption, and high costs forcing many firms to shut down, Tesla and Waymo have been pushing to expand robotaxi services, a business Elon Musk has said could be worth trillions of dollars.\nWaymo is present in five U.S. cities, including San Francisco, while Tesla launched a limited robotaxi service in Austin in June and started ride-hailing operations in the Bay Area last month.\nUber said it has not yet seen any changes in demand trends in Austin or San Francisco since Tesla's services were launched in the cities.\n\"To a lot of these companies, it does seem this will be a worthwhile endeavor ... as there are lofty predictions about the robotaxi industry's total addressable market,\" said Ken Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management.\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Soni, Shinjini Ganguli and Lincoln Feast.)", "content_hash": "df277ece4d736b179e86d224fa06e013", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

But for Tyer, a small electrical contractor in Manchester, New Hampshire, success has brought a new kind of challenge: finding licensed electricians who not only know the work — but also show up sober, stay focused, and share his customer-first mindset.\nTyer called into Dave Ramsey's \"EntreLeadership\" podcast recently to ask a question that many small business owners struggle with: How do I find qualified workers who don't drink or do drugs on the job?\nDon't Miss:\n-\nThe same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.\n-\nAccredited Investors: Grab Pre-IPO Shares of the AI Company Powering Hasbro, Sephora & MGM—Secure $0.63 Shares Before 8/14\nSuccess Came Fast — But Staffing Became a Setback\nIn just one year, Tyer's business grew from $160,000 to $1.1 million in revenue. But behind the numbers, trouble was brewing. \"I had to fire two of them,\" he said, referring to his original team of four. The issue wasn't skill — it was behavior. \"The issue is they don't fit my culture,\" he explained. \"Customer satisfaction is my number one priority.\"\nRamsey agreed that the challenge is real. \"You're looking for the top 10 to 20% of human beings walking around out there with an electrician's license,\" he said. \"There's more donkeys than thoroughbreds, man.\"\nHire Slow, Fire Fast — And Build a Solid Culture\nRather than settling for anyone with a license, Ramsey urged Tyer to stay the course. He said the kind of high-character people Tyler is looking for do exist, they're just harder to find.\nTrending: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share.\nRamsey encouraged Tyer to focus on building a workplace that attracts the right kind of people — even if that means slowing down growth. \"I would grow slower rather than grow fast and have to do it over and over again,\" Ramsey said.\nWhy Workplace Culture Matters More Than Perks\nWhile Tyer mentioned he can't compete on benefits — he offers a 401(k) without a match and no health insurance — Ramsey believes culture is a stronger pull than compensation. \"I have never overpaid intentionally to hire someone,\" he said. \"You want people to join this team.

Concurrently, the proportion of respondents who said that their company had an ESG strategy fell to 39% from 46% in Q1.\nIn its report accompanying the survey results, GlobalData said: “The growing anti-ESG movement primarily started in the US and has since spread to other parts of the world. Anti-ESG politicians, lobby groups and other stakeholders have put pressure on companies to drop their ESG strategies. This may create confusion among employees as to whether their company still has an ESG strategy.”\nIndeed, the anti-ESG movement may also be contributing to a change in company priorities. Of the five major themes polled, ESG is now ranked bottom in terms of what respondents believe will most impact their business in the next 12 months, having fallen below cybersecurity. In addition, the lowest proportion of respondents, 7%, indicated ESG since Q4 2023, when the figures stood at 4%.\nThe top three themes respondents expect to impact their business over the next 12 months are geopolitical conflict (40%), high inflation (33%) and digitalisation (10%).\n“Once again, geopolitical conflict was the theme with the highest ranking in terms of disruptiveness,” GlobalData outlined. “The proportion of respondents answering in this way increased from 36% in Q1 2025 to 40% in Q2. Geopolitical tensions have increased steadily in recent quarters, with concerns about war in the Middle East ratcheting up in Q2 as the US bombed nuclear sites in Iran.”\nIt added: “For the second consecutive quarter, high inflation was just off the top spot of perceived disruptiveness. Economic concerns have been rife this quarter, especially with uncertainty around the US government’s tariff policy. However, the risk of geopolitical conflict is perceived as a greater short-term threat.”\nGlobalData also noted that high-profile cyberattacks on UK retailers, including Marks & Spencer and Co-op, have led to an increased focus on cybersecurity.\n\"Uncertainty about corporate ESG spikes\" was originally created and published by Mining Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Apple still relies on Chinese manufacturing for a significant amount of its device production, but tariffs and geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S. are making it more important for the tech giant to bolster its domestic manufacturing base.\nWhat's next for Apple?\nApple's business is still enormously profitable, and its iPhone line continues to enjoy a dominant position in the mobile market. On the other hand, it looks like the impact of market saturation and commodification trends is starting to make growth much more difficult to come by -- and the company hasn't scored big wins with artificial intelligence (AI) in the same way that other \"Magnificent Seven\" companies have. Additionally, the company is facing some significant headwinds in the Chinese market that are weighing on overall business performance.\nApple is still a great company, but it faces the challenge of introducing major new products or services that can help reenergize growth.

As social media and e-commerce grows, the attraction of buying a vehicle online, skipping a large portion of the in-person sales journey, has become appealing to a wide range of buyers.\nSome industry experts predict up to 42% of sales will be online by 2026, growing to 56% by 2030. Alongside this 83% of buyers wish they could shop for cars online, 75% say video has influenced a purchase and 29% says they would now buy their next car entirely online.\nOEMs such as Audi have adapted to this new way of selling by partnering with video commerce platform specialist, Bambuser. Since the partnership Audi has launched twenty new vehicles via shoppable video, and says it has seen an increase in customer interest and engagement.\nWe spoke to Maryam Ghahremani, CEO, Bambuser, and Pontus Lamberg, digital marketing manager at Audi Sweden, to learn more about the benefits of such new sales platforms.\nJust Auto (JA): Who are Bambuser?\nMaryam Ghahremani (MG): The company started in 2007, and it was the first company in the world to do a live stream from a mobile phone. This was before the iPhone was launched. They did the first live stream with a Nokia phone with no screen. The company really pioneered mobile live streaming since the early days. A lot of journalists were using the app to stream news from the field directly into the news desk.\nWe decided to pivot into live shopping because of three things. The first one was e-commerce. It had been static for 25 to 30 years. To begin, it was a picture, some text and a buy button. Then everything evolved to include shipments tracking, payments, peer recommendations and so on.\nWe decided that e-commerce was where we want to be, ensuring that how you present your product can be more educational, inspirational, immersive, and fun.\nThe second reason for the pivot was video. Today, 82% of all IP traffic in the world is video; the majority of what we do all day long is spend time watching videos of all sorts – watching news, talking to our loved ones, sitting in meetings, watching YouTube, and much social media is video content, of course. Based on that, we thought that if the Internet is becoming video, then commerce will, over time, adapt and become video also. Today though, if you look at e-commerce, it's very, very static. It's not video first at all.\nThe third reason was China. They are ahead of us between five and eight years when it comes to how they behave in digital world. They're ahead of the world. We looked at China, and we said that let's build something that works for Western markets.\nHow did the company start working with automotive clients?\nToday we have Mercedes, Audi, Volvo, and we are in discussions with a lot of the other big OEMs.\nMG: Tesla opened the door to selling cars digitally. They opened the digital space for automotive. For us it started with Hyundai who were our first client within automotive in the US. They run a lot of live shows; they run around 10-20 shows a week. They've been doing it for the past four years. It's the dealers that run the shows across the US market, and they use the live or pre-recorded solutions.\nToday we have Mercedes, Audi, Volvo, and we are in discussions with a lot of the other big OEMs. I think this format is going to be a staple in the next two to three years.\nHow is Audi utilising Bambuser to reach their target audience?\nWhen Audi did the live stream launch for the Q6, you could see that they had more test drives booked, viewers stayed longer, the engagement was boosted.\nThe live event can still be streamed on the website, they’re still picking up interest, and seeing a lot of engagements. With e-commerce you create assets and you can keep them up on your website for a while and they continue to generate interest afterwards.\nThey really wanted to have a channel that could help them to reach a younger audience. A lot of automotive companies want to know how they can get to a more digitalized customer journey. I think those were the two biggest things; they wanted to have a new, fresh take on the digital customer experience/journey, but also, work out how to reach the younger audience. Audi is launching over twenty new models, and they wanted to showcase all those models via livestreams, and we can help with that.\nRetail today really needs to rethink the customer experience. The customer experience needs to be tailored, and personalised. It needs to be a ‘wow’ experience, and I think you can tailor it with adding more digital touch points, make it a ‘wow’ journey. Looking at automotive, it's so old school which I think means they lose out on a lot of sales, because the younger generation are very different in their expectations.\nPontus Lamberg (PL): Audi Sweden is expanding digital platforms like Audi Live. Retail partners in Sweden are being trained to integrate these tools, ensuring a smooth transition from digital to physical. Dealers are also encouraged to localise content on their websites.\nAudi Sweden saw a rise in Swedish EV sales in Q1 2025, aligning with global trends. With new EV and plug-in hybrid models coming, Audi aims to meet growing demand and strengthen its market position in Sweden.\nWhat are the main benefits of video commerce platforms for automotive?\nMG: If you look at automotive compared to the other industries, the only thing that's more expensive is buying real estate or a property. I would class automotive as luxury because it's very expensive. It's not a quick add to cart and checkout. It is a complex product, it's very technical, a lot of the standards need to be high on the sell end; you can't just put anyone in front of a camera. You need to have education about what you're selling and the workflows with cameras.\nWhen we look at why are automotive using this channel to sell, I think they're looking at the younger generation. Looking at Gen Z, it's the richest generation ever, and in 2028 a lot of that wealth will be inherited, but they're also making a lot of money. We predict that Gen Z is going to be the richest generation after silver spenders.\n. Looking at Gen Z, it's the richest generation ever, and in 2028 a lot of that wealth will be inherited, but they're also making a lot of money.\nTheir behaviour is very different to a silver spender or a millennial. They spend an average of three times more time daily watching video, compared to a traditional web format, like a website. If you have social commerce or live streaming for your brand, you can get them to stay on your website three times longer than coming in and going out. That three times longer buys you a lot of time to educate, inspire, and create a relationship.\nI think what makes this channel really strong is thinking: how can I get them into my customer relationship management (CRM) to be able to create that relationship. What we can see with that generation is that they are very social media friendly. They love social media formats, which is short form videos, very snappy, very short form.\nTheir attention span is short. If you want to reach them, having a flat website with picture and text won't do it. You really need to go a bit further, I'd say, above and beyond, to create something that will catch their attention and keep it. A lot of aspiration and inspiration today happens on social media.\nIf they land on your website from a YouTube clip or a TikTok reel, how do you pick them up in the same mode, which is a short-form video, where they can watch, endlessly scroll, ask questions, book a test drive? It’s not just video, it needs to be interactive, engaging. Either it needs to be highly educational or very inspiring and fun. We see around 23% higher engagement when they land on a video rather than just landing on a page that's static.\nWith the younger generation, what we're seeing is that they're quite comfortable with this; they don't want to drive for 45 minutes to come out and look at a car. It works better for them to do the first part digital, but the last part, (which is driving the car), in person.\nPL: The benefits of shoppable video are significant for both Swedish customers and Audi Sweden. For customers, it offers the convenience of accessing detailed product information anytime, along with clearer explanations of complex features, which helps build confidence in their purchasing decisions. For Audi Sweden, it results in better-informed leads, ensures consistent brand messaging across channels, and enables the brand to reach a broader audience that prefers digital-first experiences.\nShoppable videos blend inspiration, information, and interaction, letting users explore features and take action in one seamless experience — boosting engagement and speeding up decision-making\nDo you see solutions such as this continuing to grow in popularity in the future?\nMG: If you look three to five years ahead, I think this is going to be a commodity. I think that it's the purchase funnel, and the customer experience together, they go hand in hand.\nThe automotive industry, for example, is much more aware of environmental sustainability - all those things that are elements that are hard to explain in text - but you can do that in a video for 30 seconds. You can explain why you're a sustainable company, and how you’re a sustainable brand within this industry. Saying it with picture and text is going to be super tough.\nCustomers are looking for that authenticity - they want storytelling about someone that's in love with your brand.\nI think tailoring it, and having this nice journey and having the blend of both is going to be critical. I think around 2027, 2028 is going to be a turning point, because that's when we see Gen Z being the ones with the power. I think that's where the brands are going to hurt financially if they don't convert into that experience.\nPL: Online sales are growing but won’t replace dealerships. Instead, they complement them. Audi Sweden is building a seamless experience across digital and physical channels, giving customers flexibility while preserving the value of in-person interactions.\n\"Item has been added to cart: vehicle purchasing with shoppable video\" was originally created and published by Just Auto, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

First, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) announced it would allow lenders for government-sponsored entity (GSE) mortgages to use an alternative to the FICO score. Then, toward the end of the month, FICO reported mixed earnings that may have disappointed some investors.\nIs FICO's monopoly in question?\nWhile there have been some talk of alternative credit scores in recent years, the FICO score has typically enjoyed, and still does enjoy to a large extent, a near-monopoly on credit scoring.\nBut early in July, FHFA director Bill Pulte announced the agency would begin allowing lenders to use the alternative VantageScore 4.0 for assessing borrowers' creditworthiness for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loans, without having to build new tech infrastructure.\nVantageScore was the creation of the three major credit bureaus in 2017, which aimed to incorporate alternative data not used by the traditional FICO score to assess hard-to-score borrowers who may not have more established credit. Since Fannie and Freddie loans make up about half of all mortgage loans in the U.S., the new rule relaxation could have an effect on the use of the FICO score.\nThen, toward the end of the month, FICO reported earnings, showing solid 20% growth on the back of 34% growth in its Scores segment. FICO actually beat revenue and adjusted earnings per share expectations for the second quarter, but the company didn't raise its full-year revenue guidance. Furthermore, the Scores segment's growth rate was lower than the 41% price hike FICO announced late last year.\nWhen FICO raised prices, it was criticized by FHFA director Pulte at the time, and he appears to be looking for ways to drive down the costs of originating mortgages and homeownership. That may include going after FICO's monopoly in some ways, even though the FICO score is a very small proportion of the total cost of getting a mortgage.\nWhere does FICO go from here?\nEven after the past month's drop, FICO still trades at 37 times this year's earnings estimates. While not cheap, that's a much more reasonable price to pay than the stock's super-high valuation earlier this year, when it was nearly double where it is now. After all, the FICO score is still the go-to credit score for the vast majority of lenders.", "content_hash": "0e478512296b94151da01267e094b869", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Although Cubans know little about it, GAESA controls dozens of profitable businesses, including a huge chunk of tourism, most of the island’s gas stations and supermarkets, the money-transfer business, currency exchange agencies and the operations at a special development zone on Mariel Bay.\nThe Cuban government has made every effort to obscure the role of its armed forces in what experts say is the country’s worst economic collapse since its independence, exclusively blaming U.S. sanctions instead. But the wealth amassed by the Cuban military at the expense of the Cuban people is a secret no more.\nThe Herald reported in December on a rare leak of secret military documents revealing that Gaviota, a GAESA tourism subsidiary that handles 55% of all hotel rooms in the country, was sitting on a $4.3 billion stash. It was the first time financial data from GAESA’s secret account books were made public.\nNow, a larger trove of secret accounting documents obtained by the Herald, including several financial statements from 2023 and 2024, shows that the figure was just a fraction of the money in GAESA’s coffers.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nThe conglomerate generated $2.1 billion in net profits during the first quarter of 2024, according to the documents. Cimex, the group’s largest holding, which handles retail, banking, international trade and several other businesses, was responsible for over half of it, reporting $3.4 billion in revenue and $1.2 billion in earnings as of March last year. The records show that GAESA made significantly more in 2023.\nGAESA’s riches are so vast that, even excluding the assets held by Cimex, which accounts for an estimated 40% of the military conglomerate’s revenue, the remaining companies had a total of $18 billion in assets in March 2024 that could be quickly converted into cash. Of those, $14.5 billion was deposited in bank accounts or GAESA’s own financial institutions.\nThe leaked secret documents provide the most detailed portrayal yet of GAESA’s finances and offer definitive proof of its oversized role in Cuba’s economy.\n“This is the first time that detailed financial data of GAESA is available to assess its monopolistic and financial power with numbers. The financial statements confirm GAESA’s enormous influence on the Cuban economy,” said Pavel Vidal, a leading Cuban economist who teaches at Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Colombia and who reviewed the financial statements at the Herald’s request.\n“They have international dollar reserves, and yet the rest of the economy is falling apart,” he added.\nA shadow government\nThat GAESA holds such large dollar reserves, Vidal says, suggests that it has unofficially assumed the role of the country’s central bank in managing international currency reserves, holding large idle dollar deposits. However, it is unclear how that money is used. The conglomerate, which is believed to keep most of its hard currency in its own financial institutions or bank accounts abroad, keeps its accounting books out of reach of government auditors. Some of its companies are registered abroad, including Cimex, which is registered in Panama.\nVidal compared GAESA with “a parallel government that is neither accountable nor responsible” to the national assembly — Cuba’s version of a parliament — nor the country’s auditing arm. When he worked at Cuba’s Central Bank as an analyst, he said, staffers in charge of developing monetary policy and accounting for the country’s monetary assets did not have access to documents from financial institutions that are part of GAESA, such as Banco Financiero Internacional.\nGAESA’s books are such a state secret that when Gladys Bejerano, at the time the island’s general comptroller, told the Spanish news agency EFE last year that she could not audit GAESA because it was not under her supervision, she was fired from the post shortly after without explanation.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nAt the same time, the financial documents obtained by the Herald show the ongoing economic crisis on the island has not totally spared the military’s riches. By August last year, non-Cimex companies listed only $14 billion in current assets and $9.3 billion deposited in banks, meaning that in five months, GAESA had burned through $5 billion, likely due to a dramatic decline in tourism revenue.\nIn recent years, GAESA has been heavily investing in building luxury hotels for a moribund tourism industry, effectively squeezing the state out of the funds it could use to invest in healthcare, energy and food.\nThe fact that the Communist Party and the civilian branches of the government — both led on paper by the country’s handpicked president, Miguel Díaz-Canel — cannot make GAESA turn over money to cover the most urgent needs of Cubans speaks volumes about the political power amassed by the armed forces in recent years under Castro. And the secret financial information confirms the notion that the Cuban military has become a shadow government in control of the island’s most valuable resources.\nUltimately, the secret documents expose the lack of transparency involving the dealings made by those at the top of the communist regime in Havana and the hollowness of their calls for the population “to resist” scarcities that they secretly have the resources to alleviate. They also demonstrate what many economists, dissidents, exiles and Cubans on the island have been arguing for some time: that the Cuban government has been falsely blaming the U.S. embargo as the sole cause of the island’s impoverishment.\nCuba’s Comptroller General, Miriam Marbán González, did not respond to a request for comment about the figures in the documents obtained by the Herald. The Foreign Ministry also did not immediately reply to questions sent by the Herald.\nSecret financial statements\nThe Herald obtained 22 financial statements from GAESA’s internal accounting system for March and August of 2024.\nThe spreadsheets include the conglomerate’s consolidated balance sheet and income statement, along with other financial forms that account for assets, liabilities, cash flow, investment expenses, inventory, sales and earnings. Some of the forms follow a similar format to the ones used by other Cuban state enterprises and even include a “Ministry of Finances and Prices” heading.\nThe statements are minutely detailed, suggesting the military keeps a close eye on its finances. Two spreadsheets titled Balance de Datos (Data Balance) for March and August 2024 have 688 rows of detailed information about 25 companies in the conglomerate, grouped into three categories: state enterprises, “international economic associations” and mipymes, the Spanish acronym for micro, small and medium enterprises. Some of the companies mentioned have not been previously identified as part of GAESA.\nSome of the statements include sales and profits data for March and August 2023 for comparison purposes. The 2023 information reflects the activities of the entire conglomerate, including Cimex, the island’s largest commercial corporation.\nHowever, Cimex data is not included in the 2024 financials, possibly due to accounting delays caused by a “cybersecurity incident” in January 2024 that shut down the company’s digital systems for several months. Still, the Herald obtained another key document: a PowerPoint presentation prepared for an April 2024 meeting of Cimex’s top managers that compared the company’s performance in March 2024 to its annual plans.\nBecause Cuba’s economy is partially run in dollars and GAESA has revenue streams and expenses in both the local peso currency and dollars — for example, it sells gasoline, handles foreign remittances and runs stores in dollars — the documents show the conglomerate employs a dual accounting system that tracks operations on each currency separately. All dollar figures reported by the Herald originally appear as such in the spreadsheets and are additional to amounts reported in pesos.\nAfter reviewing the data obtained by the Herald, Vidal said the documents “confirm that approximately 40% of the economy operates under different rules than the rest, with very little transparency, no oversight from civil institutions, and a high degree of independence from the agencies responsible for managing the economy.”\nThis “duality of powers,” he added, explains why hotel construction continues while agriculture and manufacturing industries are in ruins, and food production has fallen dramatically.\nHaving a military business group controlling so much of the economy, Vidal said, does not encourage competition, efficiency, or innovation, nor does it favor economic development. GAESA’s “excessive power and lack of transparency allow political and military elites to use it as a mechanism to extract revenue from society and make corruption easier,” he added.\nThe records show that the military holds on to the dollars tightly, financing much of its operations and investments with the local peso and keeping most of its substantial foreign currency revenue in the bank —a highly conservative strategy that is behind the ongoing crisis.\nThe eye-popping dollar figures in the statements contrast with everything else happening on an impoverished island, where people spend much of their time without electricity and many still depend on meager food rations to survive. The average monthly wage of a state worker in Cuba last year was 5,839 pesos, equivalent to approximately $16. Pensioners earn even less, averaging 1,999 pesos, or roughly $5.\nThe military’s political power\nExperts trying to understand how the island’s future might look in a political transition see the Cuban military as a major contender that has secured control over the country’s key assets.\nThe birth of GAESA goes back to the early 1990s, rooted en previous efforts by Fidel Castro’s aides to create an obscure network of offshore companies to skirt the U.S. embargo and other businesses to get their hands on U.S. dollars. But when Raúl Castro, who was in charge of the military for more than five decades, replaced his brother Fidel in 2006, military officers began taking more control of the economy under the argument that they were more efficient than bureaucrats.\nGAESA expanded even further in 2016 when it took over the Banco Financiero Internacional as well as Habaguanex, a corporation that Fidel Castro favored with a special license to run hotels, shops and restaurants in Old Havana.\nGAESA’s operations are overseen by the military’s secretive Department V, which appears mentioned in some of the financial statements obtained by the Herald. Raúl Castro also ensured GAESA remained under the direct control of the Castro family. For several years, until his sudden death in 2022, Gen. Luis Alberto Rodríguez López-Calleja — Raúl Castro’s former son-in-law and the father of two of his grandchildren — headed the conglomerate.\nSince Rodríguez’s death, however, GAESA has been led by Brig. Gen. Ania Guillermina Lastres Morera, an official who climbed the military career ladder with no known direct connections to the Castro family. She was deputy chief of Department V and was formerly GAESA’s vice president.\nU.S. is watching\nIn recent years, U.S. policymakers have been paying closer attention to the Cuban military power play.\nDuring the first Trump administration, Marco Rubio, at the time a U.S. senator from Florida, spearheaded a push to sanction GAESA, which was added to a Treasury Department blacklist of sanctioned companies. The State Department also created a list of restricted companies and properties linked to GAESA, which prohibits U.S. businesses and nationals from any dealings with them.\nIn his Senate confirmation hearing to become Secretary of State earlier this year, Rubio highlighted the role of GAESA’s in Cuba’s ongoing crisis. “The problem in Cuba, he said, is that “despite being a communist regime… GAESA… owns everything that makes money in Cuba.\n“And while you have electrical blackouts and you have all these other problems economically in Cuba, GAESA is sitting on billions of dollars that they’ve generated for their permanency,” he added, citing earlier Herald reporting.\nRubio recently expanded the list of banned military-controlled entities in Cuba, and regulations stemming from a recent presidential memo are expected to impose secondary sanctions on foreign companies dealing with them.\n“GAESA is the financial foundation for the Cuban regime and should be treated as such,” a senior State Department official said. “Evidence of secret dollar reserves held by GAESA, while the Cuban people lack basic needs, serves as further evidence that President Trump’s actions to strengthen the U.S. policy towards the Cuban people was of the utmost importance.”\nHow big is GAESA?\nWhile experts have long known that GAESA controls large portions of the island’s economy, the records obtained by the Herald provide for the first time a clearer picture of its heft on the island’s GDP, the measure of all the goods and services produced in a country.\nWorking with the 2023 financial data obtained by the Herald and official Cuban government data, Vidal conservatively estimated that GAESA’s gross profits in 2023 were equivalent to around 40% of Cuba’s official GDP of 869 billion pesos. that year.\nIn specific areas where GAESA has a significant presence, like tourism, construction, transportation or finance, its share is likely higher, Vidal noted. And if compared with what the government collects in taxes, GAESA’s revenue in 2023 was 3.2 times the state’s revenue.\n“There is no precedent for this,” Vidal said. “I haven’t been able to come up with a similar example of a conglomerate that has such a large participation in a country’s economy. GAESA’s share of Cuba’s GDP exceeds the percentage attributed to state-controlled oil companies in Latin America, such as Ecopetrol in Colombia, Petrobras in Brazil, or even PDVSA in Venezuela.”\nAccording to the August 20214 balance sheet, Gaesa had an additional 234 billion Cuban pesos in assets, excluding those attributed to Cimex. At the official exchange rate used by state enterprises, which equates one dollar to 24 pesos, those assets would be equivalent to an additional $9.8 billion.\nA source familiar with GAESA’s operations, who asked for anonymity out of fear of government retaliation, said the conglomerate uses the one-dollar-to 24-pesos rate for its activities. That’s the same rate Vidal used to estimate the conglomerate’s share of the GDP.\nHowever, the government’s official rate overestimates the value of the peso, which has been losing value dramatically in recent years. In the informal street dollar market, where one dollar is worth around 370 pesos, the 234 billion pesos would be equivalent to just $632 million.\nAmong non-Cimex companies, three had the highest dollar bank deposits as of March last year, according to the records: GAESA’s flagship tourism company, Gaviota, with $8.5 billion; TRD Caribe, a national hard-currency store chain, with $3.4 billion; and Almacenes Universales, which handles Mariel port operations and logistics at the special development zone, with $1.6 billion.\nNevertheless, Cuban officials have repeatedly told the Cuban people, the United Nations, foreign creditors and even allies that U.S. sanctions prevent them from paying for essentials such as milk for children, medicines, and maintenance for the country’s crumbling energy and telecommunications infrastructure, or making good on foreign debt payments.\nAs the energy grid collapsed again in March, Díaz-Canel told a gathering of left-leaning activists and journalists that his government was not responsible for the debacle.\n“The problems we have today are not due to mismanagement by the Cuban government as the empire wants to present it,” he said, referring to the United States. “We simply have not had the money for years to maintain the thermoelectric plants to make the repairs.”\nThe strategy has proven successful in securing donations from foreign governments, subsidies from allies, improved payment terms from creditors and even debt forgiveness. Yet the documents obtained by the Herald show the military has billions of dollars to cover the country’s most vital expenses, including the $43 million needed annually to guarantee access to 63 priority medications that have been in short supply in Cuban pharmacies and the $250 million required annually to operate and maintain the country’s electrical grid.\nEconomic decline also hit the military\nAt the same time, the spreadsheets also reveal the extent to which even military-owned companies have been losing billions of dollars.\nIn 2023, the Cuban economy shrank by 1.9% according to government figures, and the country’s GDP was still 10% down from pre-COVID-19 levels. Still, the entire military conglomerate, including Cimex, generated $17 billion in sales and $7.2 billion in net profit during the first eight months of 2023, according to an income statement comparing year-over-year performance.\nThe numbers for 2024 look remarkably worse. By August 2024, GAESA companies — not including those run by Cimex — reported $5.6 billion in net sales and $2 billion in earnings, a 67% decrease in sales and a 72% decrease in profits compared to the same period in 2023.\nThe fact that the 2024 statements do not include Cimex’s accounts cannot alone explain the steep decline. In particular, the record shows that the military’s big bet on tourism — continuing to build new hotels despite very low occupancy rates — has turned disastrous.\nBy 2023, tourism revenue had shrunk by about 62% compared to 2019, according to data published by Cuba’s National Office of Statistics and Information. Still, 37% of all government investments went to tourism and hotels last year, according to official figures, 11 times higher than investments in public health and education. But it has been a staggeringly losing bet: The number of tourists declined 9.6% from 2023, the worst performance in 17 years, excluding the COVID pandemic years.\nThat is reflected in the financials of Gaviota, the military’s tourism arm, which shows the company lost $5.8 billion in just five months in 2024.\nIn March of that year, the company showed deposits of $8.5 billion – about half held in unidentified bank accounts, the rest at RAFIN S.A., a financial institution owned by GAESA. Five months later, the money Gaviota held at RAFIN had vanished, and the tourism company reported only $2.7 billion in the bank.\nThere is a chance that the military may have simply moved the missing dollars abroad or used them to finance other investments without explanation in the records. But the collapse of tourism on the island makes for a reasonable explanation for at least some of Gaviota’s losses.\nThough Cimex does not appear on the financial statements from 2024, the PowerPoint presentation obtained by the Herald reveals that the company lost 30% of its expected dollar earnings in the first quarter of 2024. In that period, Cimex reported only $1.2 billion in net profits, $500 million less than what the company expected. Its wholesale trade business, carried out in dollars, fell 63% from expectations, and exports were down 37%.\nThe significant drop in GAESA’s 2024 revenue helps explain why the military has aggressively pushed to limit the growth of the island’s small but significant private sector, attempting to restrict private wholesalers and importers that it perceives as competitors. It also helps to explain other recent unpopular measures, such as a price hike on internet data packages for cell phones, which fueled protests by university students but increased dollar sales for ETECSA, the country’s telecom company. ETECSA is partly owned by RAFIN S.A, GAESA’s financial institution.\nNo taxes on profits\nIf GAESA’s businesses provide the government with the dollars needed to pay for services and goods for the population, there is no evidence of such activity in the conglomerate’s own accounting books. Instead, the statements suggest that GAESA’s money is mostly retained in the military’s coffers.\nThe leaked documents expose a striking fact: GAESA companies pay zero taxes on their dollar sales and no taxes on profits in either foreign or peso currencies. None of the documents show that GAESA paid any taxes on operations carried out in dollars.\nGAESA’s consolidated balance sheet for August 2024 shows that what it owed to the government’s budget — 920 million pesos — was less than one percent of the total net sales in pesos it had reported in that period — 100 billion pesos.\nIn fact, the conglomerate received from the government 10 times what it owed in taxes at that point last year, 9.2 billion pesos, reported as “state investment/public sector.” Taxes paid by Cimex do not appear in the statements.\nUltimately, it is not known how much of the tax money reported in the forms ends up in government accounts — because all taxes paid by GAESA go directly to a previously unknown tax entity named the Tax Administration Office of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, the source knowledgeable about GAESA’s operations said.\nThe Herald could not find any public information about this office.\nLack of transparency\nOne surprising detail in the financial statements, which an accountant also reviewed at the Herald’s request, is that the financial statements underreported the conglomerate’s net worth, specifically regarding its dollar holdings.\nFor example, the August 2024 statements show that the conglomerate, excluding Cimex, had $2 billion in net worth, the same figure reported as profits in the forms. But if the typical formula to calculate a company’s net worth— assets minus liabilities — is applied, then GAESA had approximately $13 billion in addition to 28 billion pesos.\nAnother startling finding is that even if GAESA uses the $1-equals-24-pesos exchange rate for its operations, the accounting system adds amounts in both currencies together to report total figures in pesos in every category, basically using a 1:1 exchange rate that obscures the company’s real dollar resources.\nIt is not known whether GAESA is using these accounting maneuvers to conceal its dollar holdings from other branches of the government, tax authorities or the National Office of Statistics and Information. Given GAESA’s economic heft, experts believe it is likely that some version of its financials is reported to the statistics office.\nWhile most state companies must provide their balance sheets and other forms to ministries, local governments and the national statistics office, the ministries of the Revolutionary Armed Forces and the Interior — which is in charge of state security — are exempt from doing so.\nTwo government resolutions establishing how state companies pay taxes and report their finances include the same language: “The Ministries of the Revolutionary Armed Forces and the Interior adapt compliance with the provisions of this resolution to their specific needs.”\nAfter reviewing some of the figures obtained by the Herald, Mauricio de Miranda Parrondo, another Cuban economist who teaches at Pontificia Javeriana University in Colombia, expressed concern that the lack of transparency surrounding GAESA’s activities might conceal corruption.\n“It has long been evident that GAESA not only constitutes a financial empire parallel to the country’s economy and not part of it, but rather constitutes a power in itself that is unaccountable to the country’s institutions or to the country itself,” he said.\n“What guarantee is there that, if a systemic change occurs in Cuba, the resources that appear to be under the control of this entity can be prevented from being plundered from the public treasury?” de Miranda Parrondo said. “These are resources of the Cuban people and must be under their control.”", "content_hash": "2254db5b786117cb2a152b901a2fc7ca", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Many healthcare stocks offer attractive dividend yields.\nSome stocks stand out more than others, though. Here are the three healthcare stocks paying the highest dividends in 2025.\n1. SIGA Technologies\nSIGA Technologies (NASDAQ: SIGA) focuses primarily on developing drugs for treating orthopoxviruses. Its flagship product is TPOXX, an antiviral medication that's approved in the U.S. and Canada for treating smallpox and in Europe, Japan, and the U.K. for treating smallpox, mpox, cowpox, and vaccinia complications.\nThe company's dividend yield is a lofty 9.29%. However, there's something investors should know about SIGA's dividend. The drugmaker doesn't pay a regular dividend but, instead, has declared special cash dividends for four consecutive years.\nSpecial cash dividends usually aren't viewed as favorably by income investors as established programs that pay dividends on a monthly or quarterly basis. The risk that a company will decide against paying a special cash dividend in the future is probably higher than the risk that a company will suspend a regular dividend.\nSIGA's ability to pay dividends in the future depends largely on how seriously governments perceive the threat posed by smallpox, mpox, and other orthopoxviruses. For now, the threat level is high. That probably bodes well for the company declaring a special cash dividend in 2026, but it's difficult to predict what will happen with SIGA's dividend beyond then.\n2. Pfizer\nPfizer (NYSE: PFE) is the most well-known of the high-paying healthcare dividend stocks on this list. The company was founded in 1849. Today, it's one of the biggest drugmakers on the planet, with a market cap of over $130 billion and a lineup that includes multiple blockbuster drugs.\nIncome investors have a lot to like about Pfizer. Its forward dividend yield stands at 7.32%. The company has paid a dividend for 346 consecutive quarters and has increased its dividend for 16 consecutive years. Its management team remains committed to sustaining and growing the dividend.\nPfizer faces some challenges that could limit how much it's able to increase the dividend over the next few years, though. By the end of 2028, the company will lose patent protection for kidney cancer drug Inlyta, autoimmune disease drug Xeljanz, blood thinner Eliquis, breast cancer drug Ibrance, prostate cancer drug Xtandi, rare-disease franchise Vyndaqel/Vyndamx, and Mektovi, which treats melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer.", "content_hash": "b998c232f08d1f8542cb1a16c8eaeea3", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

That's quite impressive! You might, therefore, want to invest in Costco yourself. Well, here's a green flag for you -- but there's a red flag, too.\nThe green flag is simply Costco itself and the way it does business. It serves multiple stakeholders very well: It limits its markups on products, offering customers good prices; it offers above-average wages and benefits to its employees; and it delivers not only solid stock-price appreciation over time to shareholders but also dividend income. Costco's dividend yield was recently just 0.55%, but the company has occasionally paid out some hefty special dividends. Policies and practices such as these result in rather loyal customers, employees, and shareholders.\nCostco is an appealing stock for lots of reasons, a key one being its membership model. You need to be a member to shop there, and memberships start at $65 per year. That alone delivered close to $5 billion in revenue for Costco in 2024 -- and it made up the bulk of profits, too.\nThe company also has a strong private-label brand in Kirkland, which generates greater profits than name-brand items in general.\nSo, what's the red flag? Well, it's Costco's valuation, which seems on the steep side. Its recent forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 46 is above its five-year average of 40, and its recent price-to-sales ratio of 1.56 is above the five-year average of 1.12. Buying into the company today would leave you with little or no margin of safety. And safety would be welcome these days, with so much economic uncertainty, due to tariffs, for example.\nCostco often trades at a lofty valuation, though, because it has performed so well. So, if you're afraid you may never see a much more attractive price, you might just buy some shares for your long-term portfolio, but perhaps not a boatload. You might build a position in the stock incrementally over time.\nShould you buy stock in Costco Wholesale right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Costco Wholesale wasn’t one of them.

His main talking points were predictions for easier monetary policy, for stocks to rally as a consequence, for the dollar to soften and for the U.S. Treasury curve to steepen (whereby long bond yields BX:TMUBMUSD30Y trade much higher than short-term notes).\nMost Read from MarketWatch\n-\nMortgage rates plunge to 10-month low, opening window of opportunity for house hunters\n-\nMy late husband’s employer is forcing me to take 10% 401(k) distributions. Help!\n-\nWhy Nvidia and other chip stocks are shrugging off Trump’s latest tariff threat\nHis conviction that rates will be cut stems from the observation that 2-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD02Y yields at 3.7% are some 70 basis points or so below the Fed funds rate FF00. The bond market, he notes, is looking for a rate cut and as he points out, “the Fed always follows the two-year.” His views are reinforced by his relatively dispassionate approach to inflation. He thinks the Fed must look through the impact of tariffs and also points out that commodity prices generally are not flashing inflation signals, even with the propellant of a weaker dollar.\nHe quotes Milton Friedman to back up his argument: “Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon” while highlighting that the M2 measure of money supply is not rising in an alarming way. Tariffs don’t increase money supply, he adds, and he prefers to watch import and export prices as a measure of capturing inflation. These readings average out around the Fed’s target at present.\nGundlach was positive on stocks because rate cuts take the pressure off stock valuations — lower rates means less competition from bonds and reduce the discount rate applied to future earnings streams — but his views are nuanced by his bearish stance on the dollar. While he thinks equities will rally in international markets as well as the U.S., a lower dollar will improve the returns on the former.\nGundlach also is of the opinion that the Treasury curve will continue to steepen, with the yield difference between the 2-year and 30-year bonds could jump from 110 basis points right now to 150 basis points. And, because Fed Chair Jerome Powell will most likely be replaced by a rates dove, this trend is likely to intensify as short-term yields fall.", "content_hash": "a1dfb43c92c836e67f245655925aeb30", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

But what is it like to be a top executive when you’re off the clock?\nFortune’s series, The Good Life, shows how up-and-coming leaders spend their time and money outside of work.\nToday we meet Eric Chen, the CEO and cofounder of financial blockchain Injective Foundation.\nHype around cryptocurrency has been growing for years, and Wall Street is now finally embracing it. Chen’s company provides investors a secure platform to reinvent global markets; he says his layer 1 blockchain is one of the largest crypto networks ever built, leading the industry in user activity, transactions, and monetary volume. Since its 2018 inception, Injective has processed more than 2 billion on-chain transactions, with over 1.5 million wallets on the system. It has raised $56 million from major investors such as Binance, BitGo, Pantera, Jump—and even ex–Shark Tank billionaire investor Mark Cuban.\n“The mission is simple: to create a truly free and fair financial system through decentralization,” Chen tells Fortune. “It does so by giving every builder, financial institution, and user the tools they need to reinvent global markets in a fully transparent and permission-less manner.”\nOver the past seven years, Injective has grown to a $1.34 billion company—and at 26 years old, Chen is just getting started. More impressively, he launched the company at just 19 while enrolled in New York University. Chen was studying finance and mining Ethereum in his dorm room, all while interning at Innovating Capital on a hedge fund desk. The then-teenager was inspired to launch Injective after witnessing the inefficiencies of the traditional market, so he dropped out of NYU and started building his billion-dollar business.\nInjective has since made leaps in progress; Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile’s telecoms arm, joined as a validator, bringing Fortune 500–quality network infrastructure. Cboe Global Markets—the largest options exchange in America—also submitted a request to list the fund, signaling strong institutional interest and placing Injective among networks with potential U.S.-listed ETFs.\nBecause of his business’s massive growth, Chen says he can’t remember a time when he was fully away from his work. The CEO’s fun luxury gadgets—including a $2,900 mattress cover, Oura ring, and racing simulator—help keep him sane, he says, in the thick of his busy schedule. He never buys groceries, opting to eat out in New York City or DoorDash his food. Taking very few swanky vacations, he lives a globe-trotting lifestyle through his business, with trips to Seoul, London, Toronto, Abu Dhabi, and Singapore this year.\nFortune: What’s been the best investment you’ve ever made?\nMy Eight Sleep mattress cover, around $2,900. It enables me to be maximally efficient with sleep and minimize chances of productivity drop-off due to poor sleep quality.\nAnd the worst?\nI wouldn’t say there’s been a single “worst” investment so far. Every decision, whether it’s worked out or not, has taught me something valuable and shaped how I think going forward. I try to approach everything with a learning mindset, which helps turn even the less successful bets into long-term upside.\nHow do you commute to work?\nI live in New York, so my commute is usually a quick walk from home to the office.\nHow much is in your wallet? Do you have any fun credit cards you’d recommend?\nFiat [government tender, like the U.S. dollar] is dying so I actually never carry any cash!\nDo you invest in shares?\nI mainly only buy and hold crypto via apps on Injective. I dollar-cost-average into my favorite assets and use various programmable AI-driven bots to automate most trades, since I’m normally very caught up with work to follow the markets closely these days.\nThe best approach is to learn by doing, while keeping risk low at the start. There are many great resources online including tutorials, videos, and forums that can help you build a strong foundation. Most platforms also offer paper trading, which allows you to practice with simulated money and no real financial risk. Use that experience to gain confidence before investing actual funds. Make sure you feel prepared to handle the ups and downs of the market before jumping in.\nWhat personal finance advice would you give your 20-year-old self?\nInvest more in Bitcoin.\nWhat’s the one subscription you can’t live without?\nMy Oura ring subscription. It’s great for tracking daily calories and sleep, which honestly is a godsend.\nWhere’s your go-to wristwatch from?\nI love my Apple watch. Simple yet effective.\nHow do you get your daily coffee fix?\nBack when I first started Injective in college, I was running almost entirely on Red Bull. We even had a Red Bull fridge in our first office to keep a steady supply. These days I’ve made the switch to Celsius or double-espresso to keep me going.\nWhat about eating on the go?\nLike with my workouts, I try to be pretty disciplined about stepping away from my desk for lunch when I can. Most days, I’ll eat in our communal office kitchen. It’s a good break and gives me a chance to catch up with the team. That said, there are definitely days when things are nonstop and I end up eating at my desk or on the go.\nI used to order takeout a ton since I have no time to cook, but recently I’ve started to meal prep. So, usually I just eat that at my desk while catching up on news at the same time.\nWhere do you buy groceries?\nThis is going to sound horrible, but I am not sure I ever really buy groceries. I live off of meal prep and DoorDash most days.\nHow often in a week do you dine out versus cook at home?\nAbout 90% of the time, I end up eating out between work meetings, dinners, or just taking advantage of being in New York. There’s always something new to try, and so many great spots nearby.\nAny go-to restaurants or takeaways near you?\nOne of my favorites right now is Barlume, a Mediterranean place near our office that I go to pretty regularly.\nWhere do you shop for your work wardrobe?\nComfort has always been my priority. My style has definitely changed since college—whose hasn’t? Back then I’d just throw on whatever I got from conferences or hackathons. These days, I still keep it comfortable, but now I’ll reach for something like Sporty & Rich.\nWhat would be a typical work outfit for you?\nI wouldn’t say I have a set everyday wardrobe. Some days it’s gym shorts, a polo, and flip-flops, especially if it’s a more casual day. Other times, if I have an important meeting, I’ll opt for a shirt and chinos. It really depends on what the day calls for.\nAre you the proud owner of any futuristic gadgets?\nI’m not sure if it counts as futuristic, but my guilty pleasure is definitely the racing simulator I have at home. It’s the biggest gadget I own, and it does an insanely good job of simulating the real thing.\nHow do you unwind from the top job?\nIf I have the time, I love playing tennis. It’s one of the few things that really helps me unplug and reenergize. It’s physically active but also mentally engaging, which makes it the perfect combination for me. Even just hitting for an hour clears my head and gives me a second wind.\nWhat’s the best bonus treat you’ve bought yourself?\nAfter hosting a big Injective event in Belgium, I booked a few hours on a real race track with my friends. The simulator practice paid off.\nHow do you treat yourself when you get a promotion?\nI usually don’t buy myself anything physical as a reward, to be quite honest. Getting to go to a concert with my friends or checking out interesting performances in the city is the closest thing to a bonus reward I would say.\nTake us on holiday with you: What’s next on your vacation list?\nMy next vacation will actually be to Northern Macedonia to attend the wedding of one of our original Injective developers. It’s a special full-circle moment, and I’m excited to celebrate with someone who’s been part of the journey since the early days.\nUsually my “vacations” are just work conferences around the world. This year alone, I will have been in Seoul, London, Toronto, Abu Dhabi, and Singapore for talks I am giving.\nHow many days of annual leave do you take a year?\nWhat’s a day off? Jokes aside, I actually can’t remember a time when I was 100% away from work. Even when I might be at a friend’s housewarming or visiting a new city, I am 24/7 terminally online.\nFortune wants to hear from business leaders on what their “Good Life” looks like.

Derby\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -Less than a week after deciding against an interest-rate cut, some Federal Reserve policymakers are signaling rising angst about a cooling U.S. labor market and a slowing economy, even as they continue to express uncertainty about the outlook for inflation, which remains stuck above the Fed's 2% goal.\nMinneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari on Wednesday said that for him, it all adds up to a case for interest rate cuts in coming months.\n\"The economy is slowing, and that means in the near term it may become appropriate to start adjusting,\" Kashkari said on CNBC's Squawk Box, adding that two quarter-percentage-point rate cuts by the end of the year \"seems reasonable to me.\"\nRecent data \"suggests the real underlying economy is slowing. I've got confidence that that is happening,\" Kashkari said. \"How long can we wait until the tariff effects become clear? That's just weighing on me right now.\"\nSpeaking early this week to Reuters, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said it could take six months or more to learn whether the Trump administration's tariffs will push up inflation persistently. Meanwhile, while she was \"willing\" to leave rates on hold last week, the slowing labor market makes her increasingly uncomfortable about making that same decision in upcoming meetings, she said.\nLike Kashkari, she views two rate cuts this year as probably appropriate, though given the state of the economy she said that doing more than two rate cuts is more likely than doing fewer.\nNeither Kashkari nor Daly has a vote on interest rate policy this year, but their arguments are similar to those made by two Fed governors who dissented at the Fed's decision last week to hold the policy rate steady while awaiting more clarity on how rising import tariffs will feed through to consumer prices.\nTwo days after the meeting, the Labor Department released a monthly jobs report that showed weaker-than-expected job growth in July and big downward revisions to payroll estimates for May and June.\n\"This is concerning,\" Fed Governor Lisa Cook said of the report, noting that revisions typically occur at inflection points in the economy.\nCook did not say how the fresh labor market data has influenced her view on appropriate monetary policy.\nShe, like Kashkari and Daly, said she is also focused on whether any increase in prices will be one time or more persistent.\n\"It is critical that we try to understand better which one this could be, but it's limited and the information we have is limited and the way we can incorporate it into our models is limited,\" she said.", "content_hash": "8f907c210f4c54a55a7d0a65281decb1", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Hugo Boss attributed this decline to a tough prior-year comparison, which benefited from an eyewear contract renewal.\nThe fashion house’s brick-and-mortar retail business decreased 4%, while brick-and-mortar wholesale was flat. Meanwhile, its digital business grew 5%.\nBoss menswear’s 2% growth was strengthened by heightened consumer engagement and sell-through rates for the first Beckham X Boss collection, codesigned by David Beckham.\nMeanwhile, Hugo Boss said it was taking proactive steps to help the long-term performance of Boss womenswear and the Hugo brand, including streamlining product assortment and refining sales activities.\n“Importantly, we remain committed to our long-term ambition of strengthening brand relevance over short-term gains,” CEO Daniel Grieder said in the release.\nFor the second half of the year, the company plans to create cost efficiency and work on brand relevance. It expects to make profitable improvements for the rest of the fiscal year.\nIn terms of sourcing, Hugo Boss said it has taken preventative measures to keep up with changing tariff policies, including increasing inventory coverage in the U.S. and rerouting products from China to other regions.\nLast quarter, Yanmei Tang, analyst at Third Bridge, said Hugo Boss appeared to be well positioned against tariff pressures, with more than 50% of its production in Europe and another 20% in Turkey.\nHugo Boss continues to expect group sales of between 4.2 billion and 4.4 billion euros for the full year.", "content_hash": "79787bdf0ba33ff01eaf9233b7c186d7", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

According to Federal Reserve data, U.S. consumer debt now exceeds $18.2 trillion, and the average per-household debt rate is $105,056.\nNow, one of the problems with being middle-class is that you generally aren’t wealthy enough to not worry about money. Depending on your personality, a side effect of that could be making unwise or unhealthy financial choices that people with more money tend to avoid.\nWealthy individuals tend to prefer quality products and assets that are going to last over visible, flashy status symbols.\nThe Millionaire Next Door found that millionaires avoid conspicuous consumption. This means budgeting wisely and purposefully choosing modest homes and used cars. A real millionaire is more likely to drive a Ford than a Bentley.\nPicking actual, high-quality value over flashy, name-brand alternatives is a sign of wealth. Unlike middle-class people, the truly wealthy are focused on preserving and growing their financial resources.\nLottery Tickets and High-Risk, Low-Return ‘Gambles’\nMore wealthy households focus on risk-adjusted, wise investments, rather than speculative gambles.\nOne study found that 23% of people with incomes below $25,000 regularly play the lottery. Meanwhile, most wealthy people avoid the lottery or other forms of gambling.\nThe reasons for this are pretty obvious. Whether you’ve made your own wealth or are born into a wealthy family, rich people know there’s no shortcut to financial comfort and security.\nConspicuous Consumption During Lifestyle Creep\nAn “expenditure cascade” or “lifestyle creep” concept explains how middle-income earners spend more than they expect. This can happen subtly across so many areas of life.\nWhy buy cheap towels, dishes, shoes, or cars when you can afford better? In some ways, this is simply treating yourself or your family to nice things and replacing older, cheaper items with newer ones. But it gets to a point where “treats” are costing you money you could be saving, investing, or putting to better use.\nWealthier individuals avoid the lifestyle creep trap by maintaining a consistent, values-based spending plan, instead of upgrading necessary and unnecessary items with every increase in income.\nResisting the psychological pressure to match their neighbors’ spending patterns, or people they follow on Instagram, is a great way to avoid overspending.\nHidden Bank and Credit Card Fees\nBank and credit card charges, like overdrafts or annual card fees, are a silent drain on your finances. During 2024, banks and credit card providers kept increasing fees, charging people even more for having accounts and cards.\nWhile middle-class consumers often overlook them, wealthy people work to eliminate any unnecessary costs proactively. People with money can negotiate better terms, get credit more easily, maintain minimum balances, avoid fees, and choose financial products that fit with their needs and lifestyle.\nExtended Warranties and Pointless Extras\nExtra warranties and service plans may seem reassuring, but they rarely provide good value.\nWhy take out insurance on an item that costs less than $100? If the cost of replacing it is more than the insurance, and the chance of it breaking and needing replacing is limited, then it’s a pointless extra.\nWhen you’ve got more money, you can use savings or disposable income to cover repairs. This way, you don’t need to worry about extended warranties that aren’t worth the money. You can calculate the statistical likelihood of needing repairs compared with the cost of coverage, and choose to handle the cost yourself instead of having a pointless extra insurance policy.\nUnused Gym Memberships and Subscriptions\nAccording to research, approximately 67% of gym memberships go unused.\nAbout 32.42% of Americans pay for a gym membership, with the majority going once or more per week. However, a silent minority are just wasting money and never or hardly ever going to the gym.\nHigher-income individuals are more likely to cancel underutilized subscriptions or choose pay-per-use options actively. Or have a gym at home, or a personal trainer. Either way, they’re investing in their physical health, instead of paying for a gym they never visit.\nWealthy people regularly audit their recurring expenses and remove anything that doesn’t provide ongoing value. It’s important to understand that small monthly charges accumulate into annual financial waste that is unnecessary.\nImpulse Purchases and Emotional Spending\nWealthy people have money, keep and retain it for themselves and future generations because they focus on strategic investments that generate long-term returns.\nImmediate gratification and impulse purchases are less common than those among middle-class consumers. Emotional spending decisions, which mean buying items they don’t need during sales or when stressed, are less common for wealthy individuals.\nThere is a fundamental difference in mindsets: while middle-class spending often reflects aspirations or immediate desires. Wealthy spending reflects calculated decisions designed to preserve and grow wealth over time. Each purchase is evaluated not just for its immediate benefits, but for its impact on long-term financial health.", "content_hash": "a38b5db0746f4b33ef43ee406a0bc906", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The company previously launched a direct-to-consumer service that allows patients to book telehealth appointments, schedule vaccinations and fill prescriptions for certain medicines, such as those Pfizer sells for migraine and COVID-19.\n“We think it is a fantastic way to go ahead, so we will work collaboratively to do it,” Bourla said.\nObesity drugmakers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have also recently opened up more ways for cash-paying patients to access their weight loss medicines directly. Other companies are signaling interest, too, in exploring ways to sidestep pharmacy benefit managers. These drug-purchasing middlemen extract from drugmakers rebates that insurers say they use to lower overall costs, but not necessarily in ways that are obvious to a prescription-filling patient.\nExpanding direct-to-consumer options was one of four demands Trump made of the pharmaceutical industry last week in letters issued to 17 drugmakers, including Pfizer.\nIn those letters, the president threatened to use “every tool” the U.S. government has available if the companies don’t take steps to lower the cost of their products to the prices paid in other industrialized countries. Such a “most favored nation” policy could be a major blow to the industry, although analysts are divided on how sweeping its impact would be if limited only to Medicaid, as Trump indicated.\nOn Tuesday’s call, Bourla said he is in “active discussions” at the “highest levels of the U.S. government,” including conversations with Trump, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz.

On Tuesday, Trump suggested he wasn't considering lowering tariffs on India.\nHere are the latest updates as the policy reverberates around the world.\nLIVE1809 updates\nBrett LoGiurato\nTrump signs executive order implementing trade pact with Japan\nPresident Trump has signed an executive order implementing the US's trade deal with Japan, the White House said Thursday.\nThe move cements tariffs of 15% on most imports from Japan.\n\"Under the Agreement, the United States will apply a baseline 15% tariff on nearly all Japanese imports entering the United States, alongside separate sector-specific treatment for automobiles and automobile parts; aerospace products; generic pharmaceuticals; and natural resources that are not naturally available or produced in the United States,\" the order\nThe US trade deficit widened to its largest amount in four months in July as companies raced to import products in order to front-run President Trump's latest round of broad-based tariffs.\nBloomberg reports that the goods and services trade gap grew nearly 33% from the prior month to $78.3 billion, Commerce Department data showed Thursday. The value of imported goods increased 5.9% in July, driven by industrial supplies, consumer goods, gold, and capital equipment. Exports also ticked higher during the month.\nThe swings in trade this year have created volatility in gross domestic product (GDP) readings as well, as frequent policy changes have led some importers to pull forward or pause shipments. Following the release of trade deficit data, Goldman Sachs lowered its third quarter GDP growth forecast to 1.6% from 1.7%.\nIf Trump's biggest tariffs get thrown out, companies could get a refund — but not consumers\nWhile companies absorb tariff costs and pass some of them along to consumers, President Trump has been touting the amount of money US tariffs are bringing the government.\nBut if the Supreme Court upholds a lower court's ruling that the tariffs are illegal, thereby striking them down, the government could have to refund the taxes it has collected on imported goods. That would mark a huge reversal in Trump's trade policy — but not one that is likely to land consumers any cash back.\nIndia looking beyond US for pharma exports amid tariff tensions\nIndia is seeking to boost drug exports to Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, in an effort to reduce dependence on the US market amid tariff concerns, Reuters reports.\nChina just made its latest deliberated move in its trade dance with the Trump administration.\nBloomberg reports:\nChina started imposing levies on additional US optical fiber imports, after a six-month investigation found that American companies had circumvented its anti-dumping measures.\nThe duties, ranging from 33.3% to 78.2%, took effect Thursday Beijing time on “certain cut-off shifted single-mode optical fiber” from the US, according to a statement from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce.\nAmong the companies subject to the new duties, Corning Inc. (GLW) now faces a 37.9% levy, OFS Fitel LLC is at 33.3% and Draka Communications Americas Inc. has a 78.2% duty.\nThe probe was the first anti-circumvention investigation China has ever initiated, the Mofcom said in a separate statement published Thursday.\nCarney sends envoy to DC after 'constructive' Trump call\nBloomberg reports on some progress around talks between the US and Canada:\nAs a reminder, some goods from Canada face 35% US tariffs. But many goods are exempted under the US-Canada-Mexico trade agreement, leading Carney to boast that the effective 5.5% rate is the \"lowest average tariff of any country in the world.\"\nBut sectoral duties — and overall certainty — remain a concern:\nBolsonaro's coup trial speeds ahead as his son tries to keep Trump engaged\nBloomberg has an interesting nugget in a story today about former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's coup trial.\nEduardo Bolsonaro, the former president's son, took a leave from Brazil's Congress and moved to the US to lobby President Trump on his father's cause. He wasn't pushing for — and didn't expect — the US leader to respond by levying 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports. Politically, it has backfired.\nAnalysis: Trump's tariffs threaten to choke European chemicals recovery\nEurope's chemical makers face new strain as US tariffs disrupt trade.

If you are looking for a Vanguard exchange-traded fund (ETF) to buy today, with $1,000 or $10,000, you could invest in tech stocks -- or you could buy into a sector that's supplying something vital to the technology sector.\nHere's why conservative investors, income investors, and even growth investors may want to buy the Vanguard Utilities Index ETF(NYSEMKT: VPU) today.\nUtilities are boring, right?\nUtilities used to be called \"widows and orphans\" stocks because they were so boring and reliable, and the income they produced could be used to pay for living expenses. The dividend story remains -- the Vanguard Utilities ETF's roughly 2.8% dividend yield is more than twice that of the S&P 500. (For reference, the Vanguard 500 ETF is an S&P 500 clone if that interests you.)\nThe boring part isn't quite the same as it used to be, however. But that's not because the utility business has suddenly become erratic. Regulated utilities still provide services that are vital to modern life, and they remain reliable businesses with monopoly operations and government overseers. The difference is that growth is likely to be a more important part of the story than it has been historically.\nTo put some numbers on that, demand for electricity grew a total of 9% between 2000 and 2020. But the world is becoming more and more dependent on technology, which has increased the demand for electricity and will likely continue to do so. That's why electricity demand is expected to grow by over 50% between 2020 and 2040. Big drivers are technologies like artificial intelligence, data centers, and electric vehicles.\nThe key is that this isn't a one-year trend. Rising electricity demand will play out over decades, and that means there's a long-term opportunity for investors. But what utility stock should you buy? You don't need to pick -- you can just buy the Vanguard Utilities Index ETF and get diversified exposure to the entire utilities sector.\nWhat does the Vanguard Utilities Index ETF do?\nTo be fair, the Vanguard Utilities Index ETF is not an exciting exchange-traded fund. It invests in utilities, which are fairly boring. And it is just an index fund, so it isn't actually doing anything special. But boring is good for some investors, particularly those with an income focus.\nTechnically, this ETF tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Utilities 25/50 Index.That sounds fancy, but it really isn't. The 25/50 is simply a reference to diversification requirements. The ETF just provides a diversified portfolio of electric, natural gas, water, and independent power companies. That said, electricity is a key component at around 90% of the portfolio, so this is a direct play on electricity demand growth.\nWith an expense ratio of around 0.09%, it's a pretty low-cost way to invest in the utility sector. It's a well-diversified choice for investors who want a fairly conservative income-oriented investment with some long-term growth tailwinds behind it. That's going to appeal to a lot of people. A $1,000 investment will net you around five shares of this ETF.\nWhat if the growth doesn't play out as expected?\nThe big risk right now is that the growth that Wall Street expects in the utility sector doesn't materialize. After all, the Vanguard Utilities Index ETF is up around 10% so far this year, which is pretty good for a utility. While it is possible that growth will stall out for the sector, that seems pretty unlikely given the long-term trends and the importance of power to technology.\nSure, the Vanguard Utilities Index ETF could pull back in the near term, but then there's the well-above-market dividend yield to fall back on. That will help keep you invested to take advantage of the long-term growth opportunity. So even in a worst-case scenario, most investors will still have something to appreciate here as they wait for electricity demand to grow over the coming decades.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard Utilities ETF right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard Utilities ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard Utilities ETF wasn’t one of them.

We now have 4,100 [people].\"\nThe company also lifted its guidance for the full year from between $3.89 billion and $3.9 billion to between $4.142 billion and $4.15 billion.\nWhy Palantir stock's valuation still looks risky\nThe company's incredible and efficient growth is undeniable, but I continue to have serious doubts about its long-term prospects. Its trailing price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is nearly 700, an astronomical figure. Its forward P/E is nearly 280. Tesla -- which I also think is severely overpriced -- is the only other top-20 stock that trades with a forward P/E over 100.\nThe company would have to achieve near perfection for many years to justify this sort of multiple. I'm not sure it can, despite the optimism of its CEO.

Rising expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts this year gave investors yet another reason to buy the dip.\nOur call of the day from Jim Paulsen of Paulsen Perspectives says this bull market has much more potential than investors realized, because several big pillars of traditional support for stocks have still not been tapped.\nMuch of that has to do with the Fed, which Paulsen believes has been too restrictive, a view he says is backed up by last week’s weak jobs data. In a new Substack post, the now-retired, 40-year Wall Street investment strategist talks about how the Fed could help unleash “full bull” support.\nPaulsen points out that the current bull run got its start when the Fed was tightening and has matured almost completely under that contractionary policy.\n“During the current bull run, the funds rate has been kept high, the yield curve has persisted near inversion and the annual growth in the real money supply has remained subpar,” he writes.\nA yield curve inversion — when yields on long-term debt drop below those of short-term — is often seen as a sign of pessimistic and worried investors who expect a slowing economy. Sluggish money supply growth can indicate an economy that’s struggling to expand, with fewer loans taken out and less activity as wary consumers tighten their belts.\nPaulsen blames the Fed’s “chronic contractionary monetary policy” for keeping those longer-term bond yields elevated, as well as the dollar strong and consumer confidence weak. Dollar strength can make it tough for American companies to compete abroad.\n“Should the Fed finally sustain a cycle of cutting the funds rate, it would bring much broader support to the stock market than widely perceived,” he says. Under that new stance, monetary growth would pick up, the dollar would weaken and bond yields, along with mortgage rates, would finally start to fall, with consumer confidence getting a boost.\nPaulsen then moves to the below chart showing the extent of potential stock market performance “left on the shelf during this bull market” because those key pillars of support aren’t yet being used.\nThe chart reflects the average annualized percent price gain in the S&P 500 index for all months since 1960, when those “key supports” were in place, versus when they weren’t, he explained.\n“Increasing or keeping the Fed funds rate at abnormally restrictive levels has probably significantly held back stock market results,” he says. Since 1960, the average annualized S&P 500 percentage price gain during months when the Fed was cutting has been 10.5 percentage points greater than when rates were rising, he noted.\nThe biggest deterrent to bull market returns has been the “watershed destruction of U.S. confidence,” says Paulsen. Since 1960, when U.S. consumer confidence has risen monthly, the S&P 500 average annualized percentage price gain was 15.8%, versus 1.5% during months of declining confidence.\nThe strategist says consumer confidence, nearly at record lows, is likely to head higher rather than lower in the next 12 months. “And, if it does, stock investors could enjoy a powerfully positive force they have rarely had the chance to savor yet during this bull run,” he says.\nTo be sure, not everyone agrees with Paulsen that rate cuts are needed. Bank of America told clients on Monday that markets are “conflating recession with stagflation,” and the Fed could hold rates until 2026.\nThe markets\nU.S. stocks SPX COMP DJIA have opened are mostly higher, with Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y BX:TMUBMUSD02Y rising and the dollar DXY rising.\nNeed to Know starts early and is updated until the opening bell, but to get it delivered once to your email box.

Scott Bessent does not want to be considered as a replacement for Fed Chair Jerome Powell. He also said Bank of America BAC and JPMorgan Chase JPMdiscriminated against him.\nSan Francisco Fed Pres. Mary Daly, told Reuters that the time was near for policymakers to begin cutting rates.\nSome Wall Street forecasters have been talking about how a pullback is overdue for the S&P 500. The chart from Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist, shows more than 30 corrections of 5% or more for the index since 2009. “The equity uptrend still deserves the benefit of the doubt. But after a powerful rally, some digestion is warranted, as is a reset of high investor expectations,” said Lerner. He sees a classic “two steps forward, one step back” setup ahead, and suggests a focus on buying large-cap growth and technology stocks in the event of any pullback.\nTop tickers\nThese were the most-active tickers on MarketWatch as of 6 a.m.:\nRandom reads\nBest — and sadly retiring — dog surfer in the world: Faith the pit bull.", "content_hash": "a3ff1fe1f7b31f8c1c41739bf5c4f53b", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The US Jul ISM services index unexpectedly fell -0.7 to 50.1, weaker than expectations of an increase to 51.5. Also, the Jul ISM services prices paid sub-index unexpectedly rose +2.4 to a 2.75-year high of 69.9, versus expectations of a decline to 66.5.\nStocks today initially opened higher on strength in technology stocks, led by an +8% jump in Palantir Technologies after it reported stronger-than-expected profits and raised its full-year forecasts. Stocks have continued support from speculation that last Friday’s dismal payroll and ISM manufacturing reports will prompt the Fed to cut interest rates. The chances of a Fed rate cut at the September FOMC meeting rose to 92% from 40% before the reports were released.\nThe US trade deficit for June was smaller than expected, a positive factor for Q2 GDP. The June US trade deficit shrank to -$60.2 billion from -$71.7 billion in May, better than expectations of -$61.0 billion and the smallest deficit in 1.75 years.\nDovish comments late Monday from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly were supportive for stocks when she said the time is nearing for Fed interest rate cuts, given mounting evidence that the job market is softening and there are no signs of persistent tariff-driven inflation.\nIn recent tariff news, President Trump said Monday that he would be “substantially raising” the tariff on US imports from India from the current 25% due to India’s purchases of Russian oil. Last Thursday, President Trump raised tariffs on some Canadian goods to 35% from 25% and announced a 10% global minimum, along with tariffs of 15% or higher for countries with trade surpluses with the US, effective after midnight on August 7. According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\nThe markets this week will focus on earnings reports and any fresh tariff or trade news. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to increase by +3,000 to 221,000. Also on Thursday, Q2 nonfarm productivity is expected to be +2.0% with unit labor costs rising +1.5%.\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 92% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and 64% at the following meeting on October 28-29.\nQ2 earnings reports released thus far suggest that S&P 500 earnings are on track to rise +9.1% for the second quarter, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 66% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, around 82% exceeded profit estimates.\nOverseas stock markets today are higher. The Euro Stoxx 50 is up by +0.21%. China’s Shanghai Composite closed up +0.96%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.64%.\nInterest Rates\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) today are down -2 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield is up +0.6 bp to 4.1982%. Sep T-notes today fell from a 3-month high, and the 10-year T-note yield moved up from a 3-month low of 4.183%.\nSupply pressures are weighing on T-notes as the Treasury will auction $125 billion of T-notes and T-bonds in this week’s August quarterly refunding, beginning with today’s $58 billion auction of 3-year T-notes. Also, signs of price pressures in the US service sector are bearish for T-notes after the July ISM services prices paid sub-index unexpectedly rose +2.4 to a 2.75-year high of 69.9.\nHowever, T-notes recovered most of their losses after the Jul ISM services index unexpectedly declined. T-notes found support from dovish comments late Monday from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, who said the time is nearing for Fed interest rate cuts given labor market weakness and no signs of tariff inflation. T-notes also have positive carryover support from last Friday’s weaker-than-expected payroll and ISM manufacturing reports, which boosted the chance of a Fed rate cut at next month’s FOMC meeting to 92% from 40% before the reports.\nEuropean government bond yields today are moving higher. The 10-year German bund yield fell to a 1.5-week low of 2.601% and is down -0.2 bp to 2.622%.

They also predicted sales would be about $14.4 million; Navitas reported nearly $14.5 million in sales. All of which sounds fine to me, so why is the stock down so much today?\nNavitas' Q2 earnings\nTurning to the report itself, here's what you'll find: Revenue may have met expectations, but it was still down more than 29% year over year. And although Navitas met expectations on earnings (i.e., losses) as well, the nickel it says it lost in the quarter was only a non-GAAP (adjusted) number. Earnings as calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), in contrast, showed a loss of $0.25 per share.\nThat's twice the sum Navitas lost per share a year ago. It's also 5 times the $0.05-per-share loss Wall Street is talking about.\nIs Navitas stock a sell?\nManagement tried to put a brave face on this miserable result, with CEO Gene Sheridan insisting that \"despite industrywide headwinds [he is] pleased with our teams' Q2 performance,\" and continuing to focus on making chips for the popular artificial intelligence and energy sectors.\nMeanwhile, though, the business keeps shrinking. Management forecast sales in Q3 will be only $10 million and, even non-GAAP, the company expects to continue losing money -- and probably not just in Q3. According to analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence, losses will continue as far as the eye can see, to 2028 at least, and probably beyond.\nIt's hard for me to recommend buying a stock like that.\nShould you buy stock in Navitas Semiconductor right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Navitas Semiconductor, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Navitas Semiconductor wasn’t one of them.

This may leave most Americans with a feeling of doubt about the actual ability to have enough money saved for retirement.\nRead Next: 6 Key Signs You’ll Run Out of Retirement Funds Too Early\nWays To Boost Retirement Savings\nAmericans need not despair because there are some easy ways to help build retirement savings.\n-\nAfter enrolling in an employer’s retirement savings plan, check whether it allows pre-tax contributions. These reduce taxable income by deducting money before federal income taxes are calculated. For instance, someone in the 12% tax bracket who sets aside $100 each pay period would see take-home pay reduced by about $88, plus any required Medicare, Social Security and state and local taxes, according to Merrill.\n-\nCheck whether an employer offers a 401(k) plan with contribution matching, and be sure to contribute enough to receive the full match. For example, if the employer matches 50% contributions up to 5% of an employee’s salary, and the annual salary is $50,000 with a $2,500 contribution, the employer would add $1,250.\n-\nIf age 50 or older, look into catch-up contributions to IRA or 401(k) plans since yearly contributions are limited if under the age of 50.\n-\nConsider opening a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. With a traditional IRA, contributions may be tax deductible and are made pre-tax, which means potential investment earnings will be able to grow without taxes until withdrawals are made during retirement. With a Roth IRA, contributions are made after taxes and withdrawals will be free of federal taxes after age 59-1/2.\n-\nThink about putting 1% or 2% of salary towards retirement savings, and then each year, raise the amount by 1% or 2% more, per This Is Pretirement.\n-\nAny time extra money like a bonus or a raise happens, put at least half of the amount towards retirement.\n-\nContemplate delaying retirement as far as possible. Every year retirement is delayed before the age of 70 will increase the monthly benefits available.\n-\nReflect on possibly having a side job or hobby as a way to make extra money to save for retirement, according to This Is Pretirement.", "content_hash": "ba3360fda2a288f88367ff78b499a480", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

But since the put side of a collar is bought, cheap is good.\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nOptions Traders Expected Palantir Stock's Tamest Earnings Reaction in a Year. Did They Get It Right?\n-\nPayPal Maintains its Huge FCF Guidance Despite a Q2 Drop - Is PYPL Stock Too Cheap?\nHowever, the call side of the options collar involves selling a covered call option. The usual motivation for that extra step is to pay for the put option that guards a stock or ETF from diving too far down. That covered call option is also somewhat inexpensive these days. And when we’re talking about selling away some of our potential upside profits, in exchange for some cash flow now to reduce the cost of the puts, it doesn’t make as much sense. Because the amount received for the call-writing transaction is not very much, relative to recent history.\nTLT: The Case for a Married Put Strategy\nA case in point for why a married put strategy might make more sense now than an option collar strategy is the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), which as shown below has an IV Rank of 15%.\nThat means over the past 12 months, the volatility level of TLT has been higher than the current 14% level 85% of the time. This means we don’t have to worry too much about volatility here.\nAs a side note, fans of covered call ETFs should pay close attention. Given lower volatility levels, the risk management provided by covered call ETFs today is much less powerful than it has been throughout the rest of 2025.\nAs with collars, there are many ways to approach the combination of marrying TLT shares and a TLT put option for every 100 shares owned. But the takeaway from this one example below is that I can go out to Nov. 21, and assuming I bought TLT around $88 a share, I can also buy a put struck at $88.\nThis means that except for the cost to buy the puts, I can’t end up with less than $88 a share of value… no matter what happens with interest rates or how much TLT falls. Plus, the cost to buy the puts is only $2.61 here, so about 3% of that $88 strike price.", "content_hash": "5615a2845e59f702d5ef407079cfcb35", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Today, fear is everywhere: in politics, in the markets, and in our planet’s future. However, uncertainty is also a call to lead with clarity, with intention, and with a long view. These are the moments that test legitimacy and define our legacy. When fear tempts us to retreat from what we know is right, it is precisely then that we must ask: What does the evidence tell us, and what kind of world do we want to create?\nIn today’s polarized environment, where diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risk analysis are under political attack, it’s easy to get swept up in the noise. Organizations like Adasina Social Capital, American Pride Rises Network and countless other values-aligned investors and entities have been outspoken advocates of DEI and ESG investing long before these attacks started. Our steadfastness has always been grounded in prudent investing and social justice values. Beneath the political noise, DEI and ESG are value-driven principles that improve outcomes across the board. From performance to customer loyalty, they reflect smart business tactics. They are strategic investing essentials, deeply tied to financial performance and risk management.\nInstitutional investors agree: 87% still believe ESG factors—including DEI considerations—are indicators of financial risk, not ideological positions. In an environment charged with fear and polarization, some may retreat from these proven frameworks in search of perceived safety. But like anyone in a volatile marketplace understands, smart money demands we stay the course. Integrating environmental risks, social dynamics, and governance structures leads to savvier decisions and stronger portfolios. It’s not political—it’s prudent.\nDEI drives measurable performance\nCompanies leading the pack in diversity outperform those at the bottom by a remarkable 36% in profitability. The gains extend even further, showing that diverse organizations see 19% higher revenues from innovation. Most compelling of all, highly diverse teams make better decisions up to 87% of the time.\nThese aren’t just feel-good stats—they’re flashing signals to investors: ignore DEI, and you’re leaving performance on the table.\nThe cost of retreat\nSince rolling back its DEI programs, Targethas seen 5 million fewer shopping trips among customers, with CEO Brian Cornell confirming that sales fell because of “the reaction to the updates we shared on [DEI] in January” as a key factor driving the decline. Meanwhile, Costco saw nearly 7.7 million more visits since doubling down on its commitment to DEI.\nThe impact extends beyond consumer behavior. In a recent survey of 750 U.S. business leaders, 2 in 3 say their company suffered consequences after cutting DEI programs, including diminished employee morale and difficulty hiring top talent. The workforce impact is stark: 82% of employees said pulling back on DEI made them less engaged, and 62% of job seekers say they’d turn down offers from companies that don’t stand for diversity. These consequences represent material risks to business performance that prudent investors must consider when evaluating potential investments.\nRecognizing these market realities, 1 in 3 business leaders in the above study say DEI is being reinstated. 75% admitted that whether or not their company has a DEI program ultimately comes down to what’s best for the bottom line, an admission that signals that business fundamentals, not political positioning, are still driving long-term decision-making.\nESG strengthens investment resilience\nThe politicization of ESG has created similar challenges, but the fundamental investment logic remains sound. Global insured losses from natural disasters reached $140 billion in 2024, the third most expensive year on record, forcing insurers to integrate climate risk data into pricing and underwriting decisions. To tell investors not to consider ESG factors forces them to intentionally ignore relevant information about a company, and investors simply won’t accept such constraints when performance and profitability demand comprehensive analysis. Smart investors know the truth: environmental risks hit supply chains, social issues affect talent retention, and governance impacts decision-making. These aren’t buzzwords—they’re business fundamentals. More than 75% of S&P 500 companies still tie executive compensation to ESG metrics, recognizing these factors as core business considerations. Market evidence continues to support this approach, as companies with strong ESG profiles show more resilient stock performance during market turbulence.\nShareholder support remains strong\nRecent shareholder voting patterns offer the clearest proof that investors remain committed to DEI and ESG risk analysis. In 2025, every single anti-DEI shareholder proposal—across 32 major companies—has failed and they’re consistently rejected by margins of 97-100%. Major companies across the political spectrum, including Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Walmart, and Goldman Sachs, have all seen overwhelming shareholder support for maintaining DEI initiatives. Remarkably, company management largely recommended voting against anti-DEI proposals as well, demonstrating robust alignment between corporate leadership and shareholders.\nThis universal failure rate across these major corporations reveals that institutional investors view diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives as business necessities, not political positions. . Market demand for ESG data has resulted in Bloomberg, MSCI, and S&P Global all increasing their ESG-related research and analytics products in 2024-2025, responding to institutional investor demand for comprehensive risk assessment tools.\nThe confident path forward\nThe current political environment has shifted the conversation around DEI and ESG, but wise organizations know nothing real has changed the underlying financial logic that drives smart investing. While others retreat, those who recognize DEI and ESG considerations as essential investing tools—not political statements—may find themselves uniquely positioned for what’s ahead. The market doesn’t follow rhetoric. It follows returns.\nIn moments of fear, we’re tested. But what will last is how we chose to act when it mattered.\nHistory will remember that the smart money wasn’t afraid—it was bold and invested with clarity, courage, and conviction.\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.", "content_hash": "759661d42ca9b78f534ad07e9cdb438b", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

AMD reports this week. Deere follows next week. Nvidia steps up near the end of August.\nNvidia shares have now more than doubled since their April lows, and you can expect analysts to jack up their price targets ahead of its upcoming financial report.\nCathie Wood is on a roll. The co-founder, CEO, and chief investment officer of Ark Invest is at her best when growth stocks are rallying, and that's the case right now. Her largest exchange-traded fund is up 42% over the past three months and a whopping 79% over the past year.\nArk bought shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Deere(NYSE: DE) on Monday, expanding her existing stakes. All three companies report earnings later this month. Let's take a closer look.\n1. Nvidia\nIt's not surprising to see Wood adding to the world's most valuable company by market cap. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a booming theme for aggressive growth investors. Nvidia is living proof that sometimes the best bet is the most obvious one. Its early leadership in graphics processing units (GPUs) has translated into putting out the most popular chips for data centers cranking out generative AI.\nNvidia is a 15-bagger over the past five years, and the shares have more than doubled since bottoming out three months ago. The stock hit another all-time high last week. It's the first -- but now not the only -- company to top $4 trillion in market cap. Nvidia has a crucial financial report coming before the end of the the month.\nExpectations are high heading into the fiscal second-quarter results that will be released on Aug. 27. Analysts see Nvidia's revenue soaring 52% to $45.7 billion. They are targeting $1 a share in earnings per share, a 47% improvement. It's not ideal to see the top line outpacing the bottom line, but Nvidia is navigating the current trade war constraints within the backdrop of booming demand for its wares. Nvidia is now starting to stockpile H20 chips, anticipating an ease of export restrictions into China.\nNvidia is now trading for 31 times next year's projected earnings. It's a high multiple, but justified if Nvidia can keep its heady growth rate going. It's even more remarkable that you could've bought the same stock three months ago when it had a forward earnings multiple in the teens. Analysts are scrambling to keep up.\nMorgan Stanley boosted its target price on Nvidia from $170 to $200 last week. You can expect other Wall Street pros to follow suit in the coming weeks ahead of Nvidia's financial report. The stock's rapid ascent has many bulls with price targets below where their shares are now, and that included Morgan Stanley perched at $170 with the stock now roughly $10 higher.\n2. Advanced Micro Devices\nTiming is everything. Ark boosted its position in AMD on Monday. The maker of microprocessors and GPUs reports fresh financials after the market close on Tuesday. One might assume that Wood believes that AMD will crank out well-received financial results, even though it wouldn't be a surprise to see her step up again as a buyer on Wednesday if the stock sells off on the news.\nAMD hasn't performed as well as Nvidia over the past few years. The shares have merely doubled over the past five years. It's rallying now.\nIt heads into Tuesday afternoon's critical update with momentum. Revenue is accelerating sharply in each of the last four quarters, fueled by a surge in its data center business.\nQ1 2024: 2%\nQ2 2024: 9%\nQ3 2024: 18%\nQ4 2024: 24%\nQ1 2025: 36%\nThis week's update will be interesting. Expectations aren't exactly elevated. Analysts are targeting a 27% jump on the top line, ending the four-quarter streak of accelerating growth. The market is also bracing for a 30% decline on the bottom line, as trade restrictions temporarily slow its shipments into China.\nWood is still a believer here. Ark's stake in AMD is actually more than double its Nvidia position across all of its ETFs. There's a lot riding on this week's report, and Wood is putting more chips on the table.\n3. Deere\nIn a portfolio loaded with tech-savvy disruptors, it may seem odd to find a 188-year-old company that makes farm tractors and construction site backhoes. However, Deere is a niche leader in tech and automation. It was even all over artificial intelligence before AI became popular. Just last week it launched a new digital self-repair tool.\nDeere is a global leader in agricultural, commercial, and construction equipment. This is a lumpy business, and revenue is declining for the second fiscal year in a row. Next week's fiscal third quarter isn't expected to be a winner. Analysts see a 27% slide in earnings on a 9% decline in revenue. However, Deere has managed to crank out double-digit percentage beats on the bottom line in three of its last four reports. The current tariff war and iffy global economy will sting in the near term, but infrastructure and agriculture needs aren't going away. Deere will be there, just as it has for nearly two centuries.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

After enjoying a strong run fueled by demand for its obesity treatments, the obesity drug pioneer is now under pressure from rising competition, particularly from Eli Lilly’s (LLY) weight-loss drugs, as well as trial setbacks for its next-generation therapies. In fact, things took a sharp turn on July 29, when the company cut its full-year sales growth guidance for the second time in just three months and named a new CEO.\nThe market response was swift and brutal, with NVO shares plunging over 21% in a single day. Now, with second-quarter earnings just around the corner on Aug. 6, does Novo Nordisk’s recent plunge present a golden buying opportunity, or is it a clear signal to keep your distance?\nBest known for its blockbuster weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, Novo Nordisk is a global healthcare leader with a long-standing focus on chronic disease. Founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark, the company has built a strong foundation in diabetes care while expanding its reach into obesity and other severe health conditions. The company commands a market capitalization of about $217.9 billion.\nWhile Novo Nordisk has been a trailblazer in the obesity drug market, its stock has hit a rough patch. Softer demand for its blockbuster drugs, combined with intensifying competition in the weight-loss space, has taken a toll on investor sentiment. The stock has tumbled a staggering 66% from its 52-week high of $139.74 reached in August 2024, and it's currently down 44.7% year-to-date (YTD).\nIn stark contrast, the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has managed to notch a gain of approximately 7.1% over the same period, while its rival Eli Lilly has seen only a marginal drop so far this year, highlighting just how far Novo has fallen out of favor with the market.\nGiven its underwhelming price action, Novo Nordisk stock is starting to look like a value play. Currently trading at just 12.5 times forward earnings, it’s priced well below the sector median of 16.87x, and dramatically lower than its own five-year average of 30.92x.\nNovo Nordisk’s Q1 Earnings Snapshot\nIn early May, Novo Nordisk posted a solid first-quarter earnings report for fiscal 2025, but the shine was dulled by a cautious outlook. Total revenue climbed 19% year-over-year (YOY) to 78.1 billion Danish kroner, powered by a massive 85% surge in Wegovy sales, which hit 17.4 billion Danish kroner. Ozempic also continued to perform, with sales rising 18% to 32.7 billion Danish kroner.\nProfits also impressed, with net profit climbing 14% to 29 billion Danish kroner, while operating profit increased 22% to 38.8 billion Danish kroner. But despite these promising numbers, Novo trimmed its full-year sales growth and operating profit growth guidance, citing “lower-than-planned penetration of branded GLP-1 treatments in the US.”\nThe company pointed to the growing presence of U.S. compounding pharmacies, which have been legally producing copycat versions of Wegovy and Ozempic under an FDA-approved exemption for addressing drug shortages. That growing parallel market has begun to chip away at Novo’s momentum.\nOn a more promising note, the company completed its REDEFINE 2 trial during the quarter, with its next-generation drug CagriSema delivering an impressive 15.7% weight loss in patients with obesity or overweight conditions and type 2 diabetes. Novo plans to file for its first regulatory approval in early 2026, potentially marking the next significant chapter in its obesity pipeline.\nNovo Nordisk Slashes Guidance Again and Names New CEO\nOn July 29, Novo Nordisk held a conference call that left investors rattled, as it unveiled major leadership changes and another sharp downgrade to its 2025 financial outlook. The company slashed its full-year sales growth guidance to 8%-14%, down from the previously expected 13%-21%. Operating profit growth was also revised lower, now projected at 10%-16% compared to May’s forecast of 16%-24%.\nThe revised outlook sent a strong signal that Novo is bracing for a more challenging year ahead. A big part of the pressure comes from its obesity blockbuster, Wegovy. In its update, Novo pointed to several headwinds weighing on U.S. sales, including the continued rise of compounded GLP-1 knockoffs, slower-than-expected market expansion, and increasing competition.\nThese challenges have clouded the outlook for one of Novo’s key growth drivers, sparking concerns about whether the company can maintain its dominance in the rapidly growing weight-loss market. Adding to the uncertainty, Novo also announced a leadership shake-up. Maziar Mike Doustdar, the current EVP of international operations, will take over as CEO on Aug. 7, succeeding Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen, whose surprise resignation was announced in May.\nThe transition comes at a pivotal moment, with the company under pressure to protect market share and reignite growth amid shifting dynamics in the obesity drug landscape.\nWhat Do Analysts Think About Novo Nordisk Stock?\nDespite all the swirling uncertainty, there’s still a hint of optimism in the air. With Novo Nordisk set to unveil its Q2 earnings on Aug. 6 and a new CEO stepping in shortly after, Wall Street hasn’t lost faith, with analysts leaning cautiously bullish, giving the stock a consensus rating of “Moderate Buy” overall.\nOf the 19 analysts offering recommendations, seven advise a “Strong Buy,” nine suggest a “Hold,” one advocates a “Moderate Sell,” and the remaining two maintain a “Strong Sell.” NVO’s average analyst price target of $71.75 suggests 47% potential upside from current levels. However, the Street-high target of $112 implies that shares can rally as much as 129.5% from current price levels.\nOn the date of publication, Anushka Mukherji did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Those who choose to stay are reportedly required to spend six days at the office and clock more than 80-hour weeks — draconian conditions that have become table stakes among workers at top AI firms.\n“We don’t believe in work-life balance—building the future of software engineering is a mission we all care so deeply about that we couldn’t possibly separate the two,” wrote Cognition CEO Scott Wu in the email.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Cognition for more details.\nGot a sensitive tip or confidential documents?

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter.\nTikTok continues to cement itself as the key hub for online music engagement, with its live stream broadcast of the latest “Tomorrowland” electronic music event drawing in more than 74 million viewers across both weekends of the event.\nThat bests TikTok’s previous Tomorrowland record back in 2023, which brought in 16 million live viewers.\nThe popularity of the event once again underlines the power of TikTok to drive music engagement, which also extends to its broader coverage of the multi-weekend festival within the app.\nAs per TikTok:\n“As Tomorrowland's year-long Official Content Partner, TikTok had access to the very best music and artists at the festival, broadcasting a 24/7 LIVE stream from the MainStage, Freedom Stage and OneWorldRadio, hosting the world's leading DJs and producers at our Content Studio, and sharing it all in the #Tomorrowland in-app content hub on TikTok. The TikTok community turned up in droves, enjoying more than 2.4 billion views of #Tomorrowland content during the two weeks, making Tomorrowland the biggest festival account on TikTok with over 9.2m followers, an increase of over 1.9m new followers over the two weeks.”\nIt’s another important indicator for TikTok, both in terms of music engagement, which has become a key driver of its popularity, and the rising interest in its livestream content.\nLivestreaming is central to TikTok’s broader commerce plans, with the Chinese version of the app driving huge interest in livestream shopping, which has provided a major revenue stream for the app.\nIndeed, the Chinese version of TikTok, called “Douyin,” generated in $US490 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV) in 2024 alone, with a significant portion of that coming via shopping live streams. By comparison, TikTok generated around $US33 billion in GMV, across all other markets.\nLive shopping has been a revolution of sorts in the Chinese market, and as such, TikTok has been hoping to replicate its success with Western audiences, though TikTok users haven’t expressed the same interest in such as yet.\nBut interest is growing. Last year, TikTok generated over $100 million in sales on Black Friday, which was triple the result it generated in 2023. Celebrity-led livestreams played a big part in this, and combined with its steadily growing livestream viewership, there are signs that TikTok’s shopping streams could eventually gain more ground with users.", "content_hash": "886ac96a2da54a02d670515f98673922", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

And Tony goes, ‘You’re going to tell me [White Oak] is closing, aren’t you?’ The rep says, ‘How did you know?’ And Tony was like, how could they not be closing?”\nMore from WWD\n-\nTime Capsules: Meet the Vintage Shop Owners Preserving American Fashion\n-\nGreensboro's Denim Tradition Lives On Through Proximity Manufacturing Company\n-\nInside Origin USA: Founder Pete Roberts on Building a Made in America Movement\nSearson and Patella visited the storied Greensboro, N.C.-based mill for its 110th anniversary in 2015. There, they learned that Tellason, the niche “Made in USA” brand they had founded six years prior, was the famous mill’s fourth-largest customer in the entire operation. “And they were proud of it,” Searson said. “We thought we’d be their 40th customer.”\nRevered globally for his historic ties to Levi Strauss & Co. and its American Draper X3 selvedge looms, White Oak’s closure after 112 years continues to weigh on the minds of denim heads and entrepreneurs alike.\nDespite being a small client, even at number four, Searson said the brand did everything it could on a “cultural and business level” to support White Oak. While larger companies “chased the rainbow to profits by going overseas,” he said Tellason was never tempted by cheaper fabrics from Italy, China or Turkey.\n“We committed to our raw materials,” he said. “We certainly could have saved money and been maybe more profitable by buying fabrics from somewhere else, but that would have taken away from the ethos of our brand, which is made in USA, cut and sell in San Francisco, all the way. So, my take is, we did our part. We decided to stay with it, stay the course, because it meant something to us on a cultural level. And denim, in our opinion, is a really special product.”\nTellason purchased a year-and-a-half‘s worth of proprietary fabric from White Oak ahead of its closure. The order was the last shipment to leave Greensboro. As the Tellason team unloaded the massive order in Oakland, Calif., Patella traveled to Japan to meet with mills about recreating the unique fabric. Kaihara Denim delivered.\n“The first run of samples they came up with based on what we were doing with White Oak was on point. We couldn’t even really tell the difference between White Oak and Kaihara,” Searson said.\nWhite Space\nWhile high-quality fabrics are available globally, White Oak’s demise left a significant gap in premium U.S.-made denim and disrupted both the production and purpose of many “Made in USA” brands.\nSince launching in 2010, Ginew has produced most of its small-batch collections in Los Angeles, Seattle and Portland, Ore. Until December 2017, the Native American-owned denim brand sourced all of its denim from White Oak.\nFollowing the mill’s closure, Ginew transitioned to sourcing premium fabrics from Nihon Menpu Mills in Japan and Vidalia Mills in Louisiana. The latter ceased operations last fall and is set to be auctioned off this month to resolve outstanding debts.\nDr. Erik Brodt (Ojibwe), cofounder of Ginew, said the focus has always been to source the highest-quality, most interesting fabrics. The task has never been easy. While sustainable fibers and technologies have become more accessible, finding high-quality U.S.-made fabric grows more challenging with each passing year.\n“Manufacturing denim apparel that is made with USA-made denim fabric has become more difficult,” he said. “There are several small mills that make premium denim in the U.S.; however, the cost, quality challenges and limited supply have made it tremendously difficult to source new, premium USA-made denim fabrics.”\nWhile Vidalia, with its promise of value-added fabrics and selvedge denim made on Draper X3 selvedge looms acquired from White Oak, seemed too good to be true for many industry insiders, brands like Ginew and Devil-Dog Dungarees were eager to place orders. Brodt said the mill produced “stunning denims” with intricacies and artisanal elements.\nDevil-Dog Dungarees incorporated Vidalia Mills denim into its 75th-anniversary jeans, a limited release that Jeff Rosenstock, Devil-Dog Dungarees president, said paid tribute to both the brand’s history and the legacy of American-made denim. “As the only mill producing premium selvedge denim on American soil, Vidalia’s craftsmanship and innovation helped preserve an important part of our industry’s heritage. Vidalia represented a rare commitment to domestic textile production, and its closure is a significant loss for the U.S. denim industry,” he said.\nOthers were more skeptical of the mill housed in a former Fruit of the Loom facility. To be a fully vertical denim mill with in-house spinning requires a right-sized facility and a knowledgeable workforce at each stage of production, not to mention cash. Pete Roberts, the founder and chief executive officer of Origin USA, said Vidalia lacked it all.\n“There’s a lot that goes into each one of those components, into carding and roving, into spinning, into dying, into weaving. And trying to bring back everything all at once with limited cash, using other people’s money in this massive space…it was kind of a pipe dream,” Roberts said.\n“It’s unfortunate for brand owners like me and the apparel industry at large in the United States, but hopefully there’s some lessons learned, and hopefully other people can pick up and push the ball a little further,” said Patrick Mate, founder and owner of Patriot Jean Co.\nGodmother NYC Inc founder and CEO Christine Rucci helps brands like Patriot Jean Co. build specialized supply chains around their design concept, price and finishing. She had “high hopes” that Vidalia would become a fully vertical supply chain factory for large- and small-scale full-package production. “It seems companies would rather shut down than invest in factories here. I have worked with so many of them for over 40 years and there are none left in the Southeast. Or they’ve shifted from jeans to government contracts to keep the lights on and people employed,” she said.\nCost Considerations\nProducing jeans domestically offers key advantages — such as speed-to-market, quality control and the flexibility to adapt designs to shifting demand — but these benefits come at a growing cost, driven by limited manufacturing capacity and tariffs introduced during the Trump administration.\n“The single greatest challenge to producing denim apparel domestically is cost,” Brodt said.\nNot only has it become more difficult for Ginew to obtain premium fabrics, but the cost of cut-and-sew has increased exponentially since 2017. And the market, while proud of “Made in USA” items, is not willing to pay the necessary end prices for clothing made domestically, he said.\nDespite being a small customer, Crawford Denim has provided consistent business to its U.S. factory partners for 12 years, even during the ups and downs of COVID-19. Founder Susie Shaughnessy chooses to buy deadstock denim and overstock fabrics from L.A. rag houses for her small-batch brand. The strategy prevents fabrics from ending up in landfills and helps fill the material void left by the great exodus of U.S. mills.\n“The biggest challenge is sourcing denim domestically,” Shaughnessy said. “Fewer mills are producing in the U.S., limiting options and elongating the time it takes to receive yardage. Ordering from North America and overseas suppliers is harder by the day.”\nShe added that the instability with current tariffs is driving brands and suppliers to increase their pricing because no one knows what costs will be levied against them when suppliers deliver.\nRucci’s greatest hurdle now is tariffs on imported fabrics. A $5 per yard fabric from China becomes $18 per yard with duty, tariffs and shipping, she said. On average, a jean requires 1.5 yards, which means it costs $27 for fabric alone. With a general CMT (cut, make, trim) of $35 for a minimum order of 1,000 units, plus $5 for trims and $20 for washes, the jean costs $78 right out of the factory, and that’s not factoring in shipping and other logistic fees.\nRucci said only direct-to-consumer brands can work with this costing, and those companies are often challenged by MOQ (minimum order quantity) and price, especially niche start-ups pursuing domestic manufacturing. Rucci’s solution is to group together small brands and to encourage them to share raw materials when possible. “I can set up a line with one color thread and sew three brands in one place,” she said.\nRucci has embarked on a sourcing journey in the Americas, sourcing denim from mills like Cone Denim in Mexico and cutting and sewing in the U.S. Her clients are mostly smaller brands like Raimundo Langlois, MarkWest Denim, Ginger + Dandelion and Corby Holbrook, all of which are making jeans in L.A. for their DTC businesses.\nPatriot Jeans Co. is her only client using 100 percent “Made in USA” components — from buttons to tissue paper — and manufacturing in El Paso, Texas. The men’s brand sources fabric from Mount Vernon in Trion, Ga., the only denim manufacturer in the U.S., and supplier to brands like Imogene + Willie and Origin USA.\nFabrics are not the only issue, either. Rucci said most American trim manufacturers want 10,000 to 20,000 for custom trims and they’re not always willing to do smaller quantities even with an upcharge. She must source certain trims outside the U.S. for that reason.\n“There are also many suppliers who stock imported fabrics and trims which are U.S.-based, which I consider U.S.-sourced,” she said.\nRucci’s core U.S. suppliers are YKK, A&E Thread, Carr Textiles, Copen United and American Made Knitters. She uses Caroda, a New York City-based factory, for raw denim programs. For bigger volumes with lower retail costs, she works a factory in El Paso for sewing and laundry. For larger volumes, she turns to factories in Mexico. Her network in L.A. includes American Made, Star Fades and Cotton Cloob.\nSince the Maquiladora Program in the 1960s, which allowed U.S. companies to set up manufacturing plants in Mexico, and later NAFTA in 1994, Rucci said “Made in Mexico” is widely accepted in the U.S. jeans sphere — though Rucci prefers to use the term “Made in North America.”\n“I worked for two years for a large Mexican jeans manufacturer, and they make for all the top American brands, which all had their own staff and offices within the factory,” she said\nBlurring Borders\nAccording to the FTC, for a product to be called “Made in USA” it must be “all or virtually all” made in the U.S., meaning the final assembly or processing of the product occurs in the U.S., all significant processing that goes into the product occurs in the U.S., and all or virtually all ingredients or components of the product are made and sourced in the U.S.\nIf brands can’t produce a garment that meets the strict criteria for a 100 percent “Made in USA” label, should they abandon domestic production altogether? It’s a pressing question for companies and organizations striving to scale and support U.S. manufacturing.\nStephen Lamar, president and CEO of AAFA, said the strict standards for using the unqualified “Made in USA” label — requiring nearly the entire supply chain to be domestic — can discourage U.S. production. Many manufacturers are unwilling to invest in partial domestic operations if they can’t fully meet the criteria, especially since they can’t charge premium prices for products labeled with qualifiers like “Made in USA of imported materials.”\nAs a result, he said the all-or-nothing nature of the labeling system can undermine its intended purpose of encouraging domestic manufacturing.\nIn the denim sector, many brands that manufacture in Los Angeles embrace “Made in L.A.” as their signature identity.\nHiroshi Kato opened its fully vertical factory in L.A. in 1991 and debuted its brand in 2013. Cut, sew, wash and finishing all take place in L.A., where the company recently launched a water recycling plant and a solar power system. “We aim to recycle 75 to 85 percent of the water used in processing jeans and return them to the factory. Additionally, more than 90 percent of the electricity used will be self-generated,” said Muneyuki Ishii, founder of Hiroshi Kato.\nThe brand’s signature four-way stretch selvedge fabric — used in popular styles like the Pen Slim and Hammer Straight — is sourced from Japan, but Hiroshi Kato remains committed to preserving its strong American roots.\n“Jeans were born in the U.S. Throughout the history and evolution of jeans, the value of jeans made in the U.S. has consistently remained significant and will continue to do so in the future,” Ishii said. “Every aspect of our process, from design and manufacturing to marketing, is based in the U.S., incorporating cultural evolutions into our American-made jeans.”\nHowever, without the factory Ishii said producing jeans in the U.S. would be nearly impossible. “Many factories in L.A. have ceased operations, making business challenging for us. We adapted by redesigning our supply chain and incorporating in-house operations to become fully vertical,” he said.\nDespite the growing challenges of U.S. jeans production, commitment can help overcome these obstacles. “Adopting advanced technologies and innovative business models is essential rather than repeating old methods,” he added.\nSearson isn’t looking to shake things up anytime soon. By sourcing premium Japanese fabrics at fair prices and crafting garments in San Francisco’s last remaining factory, Tellason maintains a steady approach, honoring tradition while embracing necessary change.\n“Now, if the factory we use closes, we’ll have to go somewhere else. That’s life. We’re big boys,” he said. “We can handle it, and we will pivot when needed, just as we did from White Oak to Kaihara. But if the green light is on at our factory in San Francisco, we will continue to make there. If the prices need to go up, we understand that, and we won’t bark about it.”\nDemand vs. Supply\nThough Rucci applauds brands that want to make “Made in USA” jeans, the industry vet warns of setbacks, adding that the “sad truth” is the industry is lacking in every aspect imaginable, from machinery and garment wet processing to skilled sewers.\nA persistent lack of skilled labor, especially in sewing, is one of the industry’s biggest issues, Lamar said. As companies consolidated factories due to labor shortages, they eventually closed facilities. Workers left for better-paying or more appealing jobs in other industries, like automotive or tech. Rebuilding the U.S. workforce would require textile and apparel companies to offer stronger incentives and rethink the image of factory work, especially the perception of spending eight hours a day at a sewing machine.\n“As a country, we should not be reliant on other nations for our goods. Apparel can be made quickly, ethically and reasonably priced in the U.S.,” Shaughnessy said.\nIn her experience working for U.S denim brands domestically and overseas, Shaughnessy said there’s a need for both, but that it must be recalibrated. Though she’s encouraged by a resurgence of small-batch sewers using vintage machines, business has tipped too far to imported consumer goods, impacting a knowledgeable workforce in the U.S. and artisans who view apparel manufacturing as an art form.\n“Having designed for larger brands while they still had domestic production, I know they can return to it,” she said. “We need to give consumers high-quality and abundant options to choose from.”\nEven as major brands continue to offshore production to reduce costs, smaller companies still face a David-versus-Goliath struggle when trying to access U.S. manufacturers. Rucci said big brands are starting to approach L.A. factories, laundries and dye houses with 10,000 to 20,000 units and she fears smaller brands will be dropped due to cost and margins. To make matters worse, she noted that many large companies are turning to U.S. or L.A. manufacturing merely as a temporary marketing tactic, rather than as part of a long-term sourcing strategy.\n“I have seen it happen repeatedly,” Rucci said. “It’s also hard on smaller brand owners because they’re often self-financed and don’t have steady monthly jeans production. Most of the factories bring in workers based on volume.”\nOn top of that, she said ICE raids in L.A. are making it more difficult to secure a workforce. “As many garment workers are immigrants, some workers are fearful to come to work. Just as we are promoting ‘Made in USA,’ the U.S. government is cracking down on the very skilled labor force we need to make here,” she said.\nGovernment Support\nAs if convincing U.S. consumers to spend more on domestically made products weren’t already difficult — especially in a time of tightened budgets — brands face an added challenge: the nation’s deteriorating global reputation.\nShaughnessy said overseas customers are turning away from U.S. products, both in protest of the current administration and the costs.\nOutside of the U.S., Brodt said the recent trade disputes have resulted in a geopolitical shift away from “Made in USA” with some blocs boycotting American items. “This has definitely been difficult for our business as international order cancellations are far outpacing new domestic orders,” he said.\nCompared to other countries, Brodt said federal and state governments can do more to support U.S. textile and garment manufacturing.\n“While other countries have subsidized their manufacturing sectors for decades, this sector in the U.S. has fallen behind in capacity, quality and skill. I think it is a critical time to evaluate the role of both federal and state governments in supporting USA manufacturing, to be able to compete at the cost, scale and quality of offshore and nearshore factories,” he said.\nThe government at all levels can help in a variety of ways. At the state and city level, offering tax incentives in specifically zoned manufacturing areas could be a highly effective strategy. Shaughnessy noted that organizations like SF Made in the Bay Area play a crucial role by helping brands access more affordable manufacturing facilities. She emphasized that investing in local businesses not only supports entrepreneurs but benefits the broader community by keeping spending and economic activity circulating locally.\nAt the federal level, Shaughnessy emphasized the urgent need to eliminate inconsistent tariffs. “They have been proven historically to be ineffectual and have driven up the everyday consumer’s cost of goods,” she said. “Incentives to larger American brands to offer U.S.-made product will also work, if the companies work at a different profit margin. There are large-scale manufacturers that work with the U.S. military that can accommodate larger orders for these big brands.”\nBut without decisive policy changes, Shaughnessy fears the outlook will continue to worsen. She suspects more brands, businesses and suppliers will fold if government officials fail to acknowledge the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policies and their frequent, unpredictable revisions. “It is economically challenging not to know what your duties and tariffs will be day to day,” she said.\nBrodt echoed these concerns, warning that small apparel businesses may become the unintended casualties of the current global trade environment. “We anticipate that supply chain disruptions will continue,” he added.\nPearson was even more direct, challenging the assumption that domestic denim manufacturing can be revived through tariffs alone. “You’re not just going to whip up a factory, are you? The idea of bringing denim manufacturing back to America by imposing tariffs — it’s not true. No one will open a factory to make denim again. It’s way too technical,” he said.\nInstead, he argued, the policies are actively undermining companies committed to U.S. production. “Why punish us for buying from Japan? I can understand if there was a solid mill, but we would have never gone to Japan because we like the USA story. It doesn’t exist. This broad stroke of tariffing everything — that’s a mistake,” he said.\nThis article was published in SJ Denim’s “Made in America” issue.

At the same time, it would refine more at home and therefore reduce crude oil exports to 393,100 bpd in 2035, from 487,900 bpd in 2026.\nThe target for local crude oil processing, including at the new Olmeca refinery in the port of Dos Bocas, is 1.3 million barrels per day. This would help wean the country off gasoline and diesel imports.\nOfficials reiterated the government's ambition to pay down debt - both maturing bond debt and what the company owes to providers.\nTo achieve all this, a new government-backed investment vehicle will seek to raise up to 250 billion Mexican pesos ($13 billion) for Pemex projects in 2025 alone.\nIt follows a $12 billion debt offering to ease Pemex's short-term financial pressures and support debt refinancing, announced last week.\nThis year, $5.1 billion of bond debt is due for repayment, followed by $18.7 billion for next year, and $7.7 billion for the year after.\nFinance Minister Edgar Amador said that through a capitalization and financing strategy currently underway, Pemex's financial debt should close this year at $88.8 billion and at $77.3 billion by 2030.\nPemex Chief Executive Victor Rodriguez also outlined several additional initiatives, including for the development of the Zama and Trion fields and returning to other fields with potential to lift production.\nIn addition, Pemex intends to build three new pipelines.", "content_hash": "2e388c6ec376eda221de057cd905de7f", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Bitcoin (BTC) is roughly the same percentage lower.\nEarlier today, Midnight — a so-called partner blockchain that uses Cardano's functionality for settling transactions — began distributing its NIGHT token through an airdrop dubbed the Glacier Drop. Wallets tied to XRP addresses received about 2.62 billion tokens, roughly 11% of the total allocation. The remaining tokens are earmarked for holders of ether (ETH), sol (SOL), Binance coin (BNB), Avalanche's AVAX (AVAX), and basic attention token (BAT), among others.\nIn a recent interview, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson said the Midnight project has drawn interest from major financial firms.\n“We’ve met with all the big guys,” he said, claiming that some were intrigued by the potential for anonymous crypto trading on the platform.\nSeparately, Cardano’s core development group, Input Output Global (IOG), received approval on Monday for a $71 million treasury proposal to fund 12 months of upgrades to the Cardano network. The on-chain vote drew scrutiny from some community members who raised concerns about transparency and how the funds will be spent.\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.
