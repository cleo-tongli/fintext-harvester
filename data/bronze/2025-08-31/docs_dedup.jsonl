September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) fell -0.68%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) fell -1.31%.\nStock indexes retreated on Friday, weighed down by weakness in technology stocks. Marvell Technology tumbled more than -18% to lead semiconductor stocks lower after reporting that Q2 data center revenue missed estimates. Also, Dell Technologies fell more than -8% to lead computer hardware stocks lower after reporting tighter profit margins on AI servers.\nStocks added to their losses after the August MNI Chicago PMI fell more than expected and after the University of Michigan's US August consumer sentiment index was unexpectedly revised lower. Also, inflation pressures remain sticky after the US July core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose by the most in five months.\nOn the positive side for stocks, US consumer demand remains resilient after July personal spending rose by the most in four months.

The Aug 5-10 year inflation expectations were revised lower by -0.4 to 3.5% from the previously reported 3.9%.\nLate Thursday, Fed Governor Christopher Waller stated that he supports a 25-bp rate cut at the September FOMC meeting and anticipates additional rate cuts over the next three to six months. He said, \"With underlying inflation close to 2%, market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, and the chances of an undesirable weakening in the labor market increased, proper risk management means the FOMC should be cutting the policy rate now.\"\nSan Francisco Fed President Mary Daly signaled she's open to lower interest rates soon, saying, \"It will soon be time to recalibrate policy to better match our economy.\" She added that tariff-related price increases \"will be a one-off\" and it \"will take time before we know that for certain, but we can't wait for perfect certainty without risking harm to the labor market.\"\nRegarding tariffs, President Trump on Monday threatened to impose new tariffs and export restrictions on advanced technology and semiconductors in retaliation against other nations' digital services taxes that hit American companies. Last week, Mr. Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware. The change went into effect last Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit.\nIn other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump on August 13 extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil.

The Euro Stoxx 50 fell to a 2-week low and closed down -0.83%. China's Shanghai Composite closed up +0.37%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.26.\nInterest Rates\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU5) Friday closed down -2.5 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield rose +2.4 bp to 4.227%.\nSep T-notes posted modest losses on Friday after the US July core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose to a 5-month high of +2.9% y\/y. T-notes also have carryover pressure from weakness in 10-year German bunds after the German Aug CPI rose more than expected.\nLosses in T-notes were limited after Fed Governor Christopher Waller said he supports a 25 bp rate cut at the September FOMC meeting and anticipates additional rate cuts over the next three to six months.

There are several support levels for the benchmark index: 6,340 (last week’s low); 6,260; 6,200; and 6,150.\nEven with SPX making another new high on Thursday, some market indicators are still leaning to the bearish side. One is the McMillan volatility band (MVB) sell signal, which remains in place.\nAnother set of bearish indicators are the equity-only put-call ratios. Both remain in a negative state for the market. Yes, there has been a slight rolling over of the ratios in the past few days, but so far that has not dissuaded computer-analysis programs from suggesting that these ratios will continue to rise — thus keeping their bearish outlook for stocks.\nMarket breadth has had trouble in recent weeks but may finally be coming around. Technically, both breadth oscillators are still on sell signals at this time. However, they have improved this week, and breadth has been more positive than the broad market.\nThe last remaining bearish indicator is realized volatility. The 20-day historical volatility of SPX (HV20) continues to rise. It’s at 12% now, and since it was recently as low as 6%, that is a sell signal for the broad market.\nOn a more positive note, new highs on the New York Stock Exchange continue to easily dominate new lows. That keeps this indicator in a bullish mode for stocks.\nThen there is the implied volatility complex, where nearly everything is bullish. The Cboe Volatility Index VIX continues to drift to low levels, having set new lows for the year. That keeps the “spike peak” buy signal intact, as well as the trend of VIX buy signals (those are buy signals for stocks, that is, not VIX). Both would be stopped out if VIX were to jump higher, rising above its 200-day moving average.\nThe last indicator that we view is the construct of volatility derivatives, and that is maintaining its positive outlook for the stock market. The term structures of the VIX futures and of the Cboe volatility indices continue to slope steeply upward. Moreover, the VIX futures are trading at a large premium to VIX. The first warning sign from this complex would be if September VIX futures began to trade at a higher price than October VIX futures, but that is nowhere near the case currently.\nIn summary, we are maintaining a positive outlook in general, because of the bullish nature of the SPX chart. We will trade all confirmed signals around that. Continue to roll deeply in-the-money options.\nNew recommendation: SPX straddle buy\nWhen the broad market reaches a previous all-time high accompanied by low volatility, it is often a good time to buy straddles on the broad market. In order to keep the cost down, we are going to use SPLG SPLG options. Even at low volatility, a SPY SPY October 645 straddle is not cheap in dollar terms — trading at about 25.50 or so. So, we recommend a straddle buy on the “mini-SPX” ETF, SPLG (State Street SPDR S&P 500 ETF). It’s the exact same chart as SPY, but about 1\/8th the price.\nBuy 2 SPLG (Oct. 17) at-the-money straddlesat a price of 3.05 or less.\nInitially, we will hold without a stop, but we intend to risk a maximum of about half the straddle price. Meanwhile, if the underlying trades at either three points higher or three points lower, then roll that side. For example, if SPLG trades up to 79, then roll the Oct. 76 calls up to the Oct. 79 calls; if it trades down to 73, then roll the puts down.\nNew recommendation: Southwest Airlines (LUV)\nThere has been a new buy signal issued by the weighted put-call ratio of LUV LUV. In the past year, two other reasonably strong buy signals have emanated from the same level.\nBuy 4 LUV (Oct. 17) 32.5 callsin line with the market.\nWe will hold these calls as long as the put-call ratio chart for LUV is on a buy signal.\nMarket insight: earnings of note\nNvidia (NVDA): Once again, Nvidia NVDA had a small move after its earnings report. This is the third of the past four quarters where the analysts have more or less gotten it “right” in terms of predicting Nvidia’s earnings. Option traders had priced the straddles coming into the earnings above at the average of the previous moves — estimating the post-earnings stock move at 11.7 points, or 6.45%. That was cheaper than five of the past 10 post-earnings moves.\nMongoDB (MDB): This stock had a positive and explosive reaction to a strong earnings report. The pre-earnings straddle for MongoDB MDB was priced at 35 points, or 16.3%. That’s a big price to pay for a straddle, but it was justified when the stock bolted 81 points higher after the earnings. That straddle was priced right in the middle of the 10 previous post-earnings moves: higher than five and lower than five.\nAbercrombie & Fitch (ANF): This stock seems to either have a large post-earnings move or practically no move at all — it’s feast or famine. This week, it was famine, as ANF ANF barely moved at all post-earnings. The straddle had been priced at 13 points, or 13.3% of the stock price. That was cheaper than five of the previous 10 post-earnings moves. Those five smallest moves average 3.2%, while the five largest moves average 15.3% — quite a difference.\nSo it seems that buying the straddles when they are priced right in the middle of the past 10 post-earnings moves is a 50\/50 proposition, as one might expect. A better prospect was Snowflake SNOW, where the straddle was priced at 22 points (11%) — cheaper than seven of the past 10 moves.\nFollow-up action:\nWe are using a standard rolling procedure for our SPY spreads: In any vertical bull or bear spread, if the underlying hits the short strike, then roll the entire spread. That would be roll up in the case of a call bull spread or roll down in the case of a bear put spread. Stay in the same expiration and keep the distance between the strikes the same unless otherwise instructed.\nAlso, for outright long options, roll if they become 8 points in-the-money.\nLong 2 APH APH (Sept. 19) 110 calls: The closing stop remains at 105.\nLong 1 TSEM TSEM (Sept. 19) 49 call: Roll up to the TSEM (Sept. 19) 60 call. After this roll, there won’t be a trailing stop, since we’ve taken in a lot of credits.\nLong 1 SPY (Sept. 5) 645 call and short 1 SPY (Aug. 15) 665 call: This position is the trend of VIX buy signal. Stop out if VIX closes above 19.0 for two consecutive days.\nLong 5 SVXY SVXY (Sept. 19) 47 calls: We monitor the weighted VIX futures premium via a proprietary calculation. Specifically, the calculation is at 2.64. This trade would be stopped out if it drops to 0.50 or lower. We will update the calculation weekly.\nLong 1 expiring SPY (Aug. 29) 645 call and short 1 SPY (Aug. 29) 665 call: We will hold until new lows outnumber new highs on two consecutive days on the NYSE. Roll: Sell the spread you own and replace it with this: Buy 1 SPY (Sept. 19) 647 call and Sell 1 SPY (Sept. 19) 660 call.\nLong 4 ATAI (Sept. 19) 2.5 calls: Stop out if ATAI ATAI closes below $3.95 on any day.\nLong 5 OPEN (Sept. 19) 2.5 calls: Stop out if OPEN OPEN closes below $3.60 on any day.\nLong 1 SPY (Sept. 19) 635 put and short 1 SPY (Sept. 19) 595 put: This position was bought in line with the equity-only put-call ratio sell signals. Those ratios remain on sell signals, so continue to hold.\nLong 1 SPY (Sept. 19) 635 call and short 1 SPY (Sept. 19) 655 call: This spread was bought in line with the “spike peak” buy signal. This trade will be held for 22 trading days from the time of the original signal (Aug. 4). It would be stopped out if VIX were to return to “spiking mode.”\nLong 4 HPE (Nov. 21) 20 puts: Sell these HPE HPE puts now, for the put-call ratio has rolled over and is descending.\nLong 4 XLF (Nov. 21) 53 calls: Hold this position as long as the weighted put-call ratio of XLF XLF remains on a buy signal.\nLong 1 SPY (Sept. 12) 636 put and short 1 SPY (Sept. 12) 611 put: This is based on the breadth oscillator sell signals. We will hold this position as long as both breadth oscillators remain on sell signals. That status will be updated weekly.\nLong 6 PPL (Oct. 17) 37 calls: we will hold these calls as long as the weighted put-call ratio of PPL PPL remains on a buy signal.\nLawrence G.

It was the first time in the Fed's 112-year history that a president has tried to fire a governor.\nTrump said he was doing so because of allegations raised by one of his appointees that she has committed mortgage fraud.\nCook has argued in a lawsuit seeking to block her firing that the claims are a pretext for Trump's true goal: Gaining more control over the Fed. A court may decide next week whether to temporarily block Cook’s firing while the case makes its way through the legal process.\nCook is accused of claiming two homes as primary residences in July 2021, before she joined the board, which could have led to a lower mortgage rate than if one had been classified as a second home or an investment property. She has suggested in her lawsuit that it may have been a clerical error but hasn’t directly responded to the accusations.\nFed independence ‘hangs by a thread’\nTrump and members of his administration have made no secret about their desire to exert more control over the Fed. Trump has repeatedly demanded that the central bank cut its key rate to as low as 1.3%, from its current level of 4.3%.\nBefore trying to fire Cook, Trump repeatedly attacked the Fed’s chair, Jerome Powell, for not cutting the short-term interest rate and threatened to fire him as well.\n“We’ll have a majority very shortly, so that’ll be good,” Trump said Tuesday, a reference to the fact that if he is able to replace Cook, his appointees will control the Fed's board by a 4-3 vote.\n“The particular case of Governor Cook is not as important as what this latest move shows about the escalation in the assaults on the Fed,” said Jon Faust, an economist at Johns Hopkins and former adviser to Powell. “In my view, Fed independence really now hangs by a thread.”\nSome economists do think the Fed should cut more quickly, though virtually none agree with Trump that it should do so by 3 percentage points. Powell has signaled the Fed is likely to cut by a quarter point in September.\nWhy economists prefer independent central banks\nThe Fed wields extensive power over the U.S. economy. By cutting the short-term interest rate it controls — which it typically does when the economy falters — the Fed can make borrowing cheaper and encourage more spending, growth, and hiring. When it raises the rate to combat the higher prices that come with inflation, it can weaken the economy and cause job losses.\nMost economists have long preferred independent central banks because they can take unpopular steps that elected officials are more likely to avoid. Economic research has shown that nations with independent central banks typically have lower inflation over time.\nElected officials like Trump, however, have much greater incentives to push for lower interest rates, which make it easier for Americans to buy homes and cars and would boost the economy in the short run.\nA political Fed could boost inflation\nDouglas Elmendorf, an economist at Harvard and former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, said that Trump's demand for the Fed to cut its key rate by 3 percentage points would overstimulate the economy, lifting consumer demand above what the economy can produce and boosting inflation — similar to what happened during the pandemic.\n“If the Federal Reserve falls under control of the president, then we’ll end up with higher inflation in this country probably for years to come,” Elmendorf said.\nAnd while the Fed controls a short-term rate, financial markets determine longer-term borrowing costs for mortgages and other loans. And if investors worry that inflation will stay high, they will demand higher yields on government bonds, pushing up borrowing costs across the economy.\nIn Turkey, for example, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan forced the central bank to keep interest rates low in the early 2020s, even as inflation spiked to 85%. In 2023, Erdogan allowed the central bank more independence, which has helped bring down inflation, but short-term interest rates rose to 50% to fight inflation, and are still 46%.\nOther U.S. presidents have badgered the Fed. President Lyndon Johnson harassed then-Fed Chair William McChesney Martin in the mid-1960s to keep rates low as Johnson ramped up government spending on the Vietnam War and antipoverty programs. And Richard Nixon pressured then-Chair Arthur Burns to avoid rate hikes in the run-up to the 1972 election. Both episodes are widely blamed for leading to the stubbornly high inflation of the 1960s and '70s.\nTrump has also argued that the Fed should lower its rate to make it easier for the federal government to finance its tremendous $37 trillion debt load. Yet that threatens to distract the Fed from its congressional mandates of keeping inflation and unemployment low.\nIndependence vs accountability\nPresidents do have some influence over the Fed through their ability to appoint members of the board, subject to Senate approval. But the Fed was created to be insulated from short-term political pressures. Fed governors are appointed to staggered, 14-year terms to ensure that no single president can appoint too many.\nJane Manners, a law professor at Fordham University, said there is a reason that Congress decided to create independent agencies like the Fed: They preferred “decisions that are made from a kind of objective, neutral vantage point grounded in expertise rather than decisions are that are wholly subject to political pressure.”\nYet some Trump administration officials say they want more democratic accountability at the Fed.\nIn an interview with USA Today Vice President JD Vance said, “What people who are saying the president has no authority here are effectively saying is that seven economists and lawyers should be able to make an incredibly critical decision for the American people with no democratic input.”\nAnd Stephen Miran, a top White House economic adviser, wrote a paper last year advocating for a restructuring of the Fed, including making it much easier for a president to fire governors.\nThe “overall goal of this design is delivering the economic benefits” of an independent central bank, Miran wrote, “while maintaining a level of accountability that a democratic society must demand.\" Trump has nominated Miran to the Fed's board to replace Adriana Kugler, who stepped down unexpectedly Aug. 1.\nThere could be more turmoil ahead\nTrump has personally insulted Powell for months, but his administration now appears much more focused on the Fed’s broader structure.\nThe Fed makes its interest rate decisions through a committee that consists of the seven governors, including Powell, as well as the 12 presidents of regional Fed banks in cities such as New York, Kansas City, and Atlanta. Five of those presidents vote on rates at each meeting. The New York Fed president has a permanent vote, while four others vote on a rotating basis.\nWhile the reserve banks' boards choose their presidents, the Fed board in Washington can vote to reject them. All 12 presidents will need to be reappointed and approved by the board in February, which could become more contentious if the board votes down one or more of the 12 presidents.\n“The nuclear scenario is ... the reappointment of the reserve bank presidents and interfering with that, (which) would be the signal that things are truly going off the rails,\" said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.","content_hash":"91ad66aa31c070c948cdf0d7d52ced08","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":8075,"method_rank":0}

My recent piece which covered my highest-rated Kings, drew the strongest interest among my published content to date, underscoring an appetite for reliable income in a volatile market.\nToday, I’m turning to a slightly different peer group: the Dividend Aristocrats. These are S&P 500 companies that have raised their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. While not all carry eye-popping yields, their combination of steady growth, global scale, and durable business models has made them some of the most reliable long-term income generators in the market.\nWith interest rates in flux and investors seeking stability, Aristocrats stand out as a rare group that can deliver both consistency and upside. Using Barchart’s Stock Screener and Wall Street’s consensus ratings, I’ve identified five Aristocrats analysts like best right now — plus a quick guide on how you can spot them yourself.\nHow I Came Up With My List\nAs usual, I started the analysis using Barchart’s Stock Screener. While I normally use one of my premade watchlists as a filter, today, I’m going to change it up a little and use one of Barchart’s own “Investing Ideas” while also hunting for “Strong Buy” ratings from Wall Street analysts.\nThe result? Five Dividend Aristocrats - which I’ve arranged by analyst rating, lowest to highest.\nWith the results on screen, let’s have a look at each and the metrics to decide if they belong in your portfolio.\nNucor (NUE)\nFounded in 1955. Nucor used to sell nuclear industry services, but after a few reorganizations in the company, it started producing steel in 1968. It went public in 1972. Today, Nucor is the largest steel producer and scrap recycler in North America, as one of the two primary suppliers of steel reinforcement for buildings, bridges, roads, and infrastructure.\nOver the years, Nucor has maintained its dominance by acquiring other steel producers, like Birmingham Steel in 2002 and Rytec Corporation in 2024.\nThe company’s second-quarter financials reported sales of $8.46 billion, increasing 5% from the same quarter last year. However, net earnings decreased 44% to $932 million.\nIn terms of dividends, Nucor has increased it for each of the last 52 years to where it is today: $2.19 per share annually, translating to an approximate 1.46% forward yield.\nA consensus among 14 Wall Street analysts is a “Strong Buy” rating on NUE stock. A high target price of $182 has been set, suggesting as much as 21% upside from today's prices.\nBarchart Opinion ratings have an overall average of 88% buy for NUE, combined with high strength and average direction, indicating significant short-term confidence that the stock will continue to grow.\nWest Pharmaceutical Services (WST)\nThe second company on my list of dividend stocks is West Pharmaceutical Services, a leading manufacturer of components and systems for injectable medicines. Their products include stoppers and seals, syringes and cartridge components, and containment and delivery systems for injectable medicines.\nThe company’s second-quarter financials reported net sales of $766.5 million, which rose 9.2% compared to last year, while net income also rose 17% to $131.8 million.\nNow, investors probably won’t care so much about West’s $0.84 annual dividend (0.34% yield), despite the fact they’ve grown it for 33 consecutive years. However, it is a quality company and they have increased their dividend >30% over the past 5 years. Perhaps down the line, this will continue.\nBased on a consensus among 14 Wall Street analysts, WST stock is a “Strong Buy”, consistent over the past three months. A high target price of $355 suggests as much as 44.6% upside over the next twelve months.\nMeanwhile, Barchart Opinion has an overall average of 40% buy, with the weakest short-term outlook on maintaining its current direction.\nS&P Global Inc (SPGI)\nS&P Global Inc. offers financial information and analytics. It is the parent company of S&P Global Ratings, S&P Global Market Intelligence, and S&P Global Mobility, among others. It is also the majority owner of the S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nS&P’s second-quarter financials reported a 6% increase in revenue compared to last year at $3.755 billion with net income rising 7% to $1.356 billion. The company pays $4.70 annually in dividends, translating to a low 0.85% yield.\nThat said, stockholders over the years will be very pleased with the stock’s performance.\nCurrently, the stock has a consensus “Strong Buy” rating from 24 Wall Street analysts. This rating has been consistent for the past three months, and suggests as much as 19.37% upside from its current price.\nBarchart Opinion supports this rating, with an 88% buy recommendation and a strengthening short-term outlook. Both short and long-term indicators suggest that SPGI stock will continue to grow.\nCoca-Cola Company (KO)\nThe Coca-Cola company is one of the largest beverage companies around, selling soft drinks, non-alcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups, and alcoholic beverages. Of course, its most recognizable product is Coca-Cola, or simply known as Coke.\nThe company’s second-quarter financials reported net revenue rising 1% to $12.5 billion compared to the same quarter last year. Net income, however, rose 58% to $3.2 billion. Out of that, Coca-Cola pays $1.99 annually, reflecting an annual dividend yield of 2.9%.\n24 analysts rate Coca-Cola stock a “strong buy”, unchanged over the last three months, indicating its long-term bullish outlook. If the stock reaches its high target, it would mean 24% upside from its current stock price.\nHowever, KO stock’s short-term performance has been weak. Barchart Opinion has a 40% sell rating on the stock, with an average short-term outlook with minimum strength.\nWalmart Inc (WMT)\nLast on my list of dividend stocks for a lifetime of income is Walmart Inc., another company that doesn't need any real introduction. (In the highly unlikely event you don’t know), Walmart is a global multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores.\nBut you may not know that Walmart is the world’s largest private employer, with more than 2.1 million employees.\nEven though Walmart is publicly traded, the Walton family owns approximately half of the outstanding shares.\nThe company recently released its second-quarter financial report. Revenue grew 4.8% from the same period last year to $177.4 billion, and net income grew 56.1% to $7 billion.\nWalmart currently pays $0.91 per year in dividends, reflecting a 0.95% yield.\nA consensus among 37 Wall Street analysts rate Walmart stock a “Strong Buy”, consistent and increasing over the past three months, suggesting that Walmart’s outlook is improving. If it reaches its high target of $127, then the stock price would have grown 32%.\nShort term technical traders will note that Barchart Opinion rating is a 40% buy, with “Weak” strength, and “Weakest” direction.\nFinal Thoughts\nIf history is any guide, Dividend Aristocrats have earned their reputation as long-term wealth builders. By steadily raising payouts through recessions, rate cycles, and market shocks, they’ve shown investors the power of disciplined dividend growth.\nThe five companies highlighted that span steel, healthcare, finance, beverages, and retail, all offer both resilience and analyst conviction. Some carry modest yields, others boast stronger growth prospects, but all have decades-long records of rewarding shareholders.\nFor investors seeking income that doesn’t depend on today’s interest-rate environment, while having the potential for capital appreciation on top, Dividend Aristocrats remain a class worth owning.\nOn the date of publication, Rick Orford did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

That changed when she qualified for $272,000 from a nonprofit to build a three-bedroom home because of a grant program that has helped make affordable housing possible in rural areas for decades. She moved in last June.\n“Every time I pull into my garage, I pinch myself,” Colley said.\nNow, President Donald Trump wants to eliminate that grant, the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, and House Republicans overseeing federal budget negotiations did not include funding for it in their budget proposal. Experts and state housing agencies say that would set back tens of thousands of future affordable housing developments nationwide, particularly hurting Appalachian towns and rural counties where government aid is sparse and investors are few.\nThe program has helped build or repair more than 1.3 million affordable homes in the last three decades, of which at least 540,000 were in congressional districts that are rural or significantly rural, according to an Associated Press analysis of federal data.\n“Maybe they don’t realize how far-reaching these programs are,” said Colley, who voted for Donald Trump in 2024. Among those half a million homes that HOME helped build, 84% were in districts that voted for him last year, the AP analysis found.\n“I understand we don’t want excessive spending and wasting taxpayer dollars,\" Colley said, \"but these proposed budget cuts across the board make me rethink the next time I go to the polls.”\nThe HOME program, started under President George H. W. Bush in the 1990s, survived years of budget battles but has been stretched thin by years of rising construction costs and stagnant funding. That's meant fewer units, including in some rural areas where home prices have grown faster than in cities.\nThe program has spent more than $38 billion nationwide since it began filling in funding gaps and attracting more investment to acquire, build and repair affordable homes, HUD data shows. Additional funding has gone toward projects that have yet to be finished and rental assistance.\nHOME's future is in political limbo\nTo account for the gap left by the proposed cuts, House Republicans want to draw on nearly $5 billion from a related pandemic-era fund that gave states until 2030 to spend on projects supporting people who are unhoused or facing homelessness.\nThat $5 billion, however, may be far less, since many projects haven’t yet been logged into the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's tracking system, according to state housing agencies and associations representing them.\nA spokesperson for HUD, which administers the program, said HOME isn't as effective as other programs where the money would be better spent.\nIn opposition to Trump, Senate Republicans have still included funding for HOME in their draft budget. In the coming negotiations, both chambers may compromise and reduce but not terminate HOME's funding, or extend last years’ overall budget.\nWhite House spokesperson Davis Ingle didn't respond to specific questions from the AP. Instead, Ingle said that Trump's commitment to cutting red tape is making housing more affordable.\nA bipartisan group of House lawmakers is working to reduce HOME’s notorious red tape that even proponents say slows construction.\nSome rural areas are more dependent on HOME\nIn Owsley County — one of the nation's poorest, located in the rural Kentucky hills — residents struggle in an economy blighted by coal mine closures and declining tobacco crop revenues.\nAffordable homes are needed there, but tough to build in a region that doesn't attract larger-scale rental developments that federal dollars typically go toward.\nThat’s where HOME comes in, said Cassie Hudson, who runs Partnership Housing in Owsley, which has relied on the program to build the majority of its affordable homes for at least a dozen years.\nA lack of additional funding for HOME has already made it hard to keep up with construction costs, Hudson said, and the organization builds a quarter of the single-family homes it used to.\n“Particularly for deeply rural places and persistent poverty counties, local housing developers are the only way homes and new rental housing gets built,” said Joshua Stewart of Fahe, a coalition of Appalachian nonprofits.\nThat's in part because investment is scant and HOME steps in when construction costs exceed what a home can be sold for — a common barrier in poor areas of Appalachia. Some developers use the profits to build more affordable units. Its loss would erode those nonprofits' ability to build affordable homes in years to come, Stewart said.\nOne of those nonprofits, Housing Development Alliance, helped Tiffany Mullins in Hazard, Kentucky, which was ravaged by floods. Mullins, a single mother of four who makes $14.30 an hour at Walmart, bought a house there thanks to HOME funding and moved in August.\nMullins sees the program as preserving a rural way of life, recalling when folks owned homes and land “with gardens, we had chickens, cows. Now you don’t see much of that.\"\nIt’s a long-term impact\nIn congressional budget negotiations, HOME is an easier target than programs such as vouchers because most people would not immediately lose their housing, said Tess Hembree, executive director of the Council of State Community Development Agencies.\nThe effect of any reduction would instead be felt in a fizzling of new affordable housing supply. When HOME funding was temporarily reduced to $900 million in 2015, “10 to 15 years later, we’re seeing the ramifications,\" Hembree said.\nThat includes affordable units built in cities. The biggest program that funds affordable rental housing nationwide, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, uses HOME grants for 12% of units, totaling 324,000 current individual units, according to soon-to-be-published Urban Institute research.\nTrump's spending bill that Republicans passed this summer increased LIHTC, but experts say further reducing or cutting HOME would make those credits less usable.\n“It's LITHC plus HOME, usually,” said Tim Thrasher, CEO of Community Action Partnership of North Alabama, which builds affordable apartments for some of the nation's poorest.\nIn the lush mountains of eastern West Virginia, Woodlands Development Group relies on HOME for its smaller rural projects. Because it helps people with a wider range of incomes, HOME is “one of the only programs available to us that allows us to develop true workforce housing,” said executive director Dave Clark.\nIt’s those workers — nurses, first responders, teachers — that nonprofits like east Tennessee’s Creative Compassion use HOME to build for. With the program in jeopardy, grant administrator Sarah Halcott said she fears for her clients battling rising housing costs.\n“This is just another nail in the coffin for rural areas,” Halcott said.\n___\nKramon reported from Atlanta.

The S&P 500 has averaged negative returns in September since 1928, making it the index's only consistently negative month. Bitcoin's track record is worse—the cryptocurrency has fallen an average of 3.77% each September since 2013, crashing eight times according to data from Coinglass.\n\"The pattern is predictable: negative social media chatter spikes around August 25, followed by increased Bitcoin deposits to exchanges within 48-72 hours,\" Yuri Berg, a consultant at the Swiss-based crypto liquidity provider FinchTrade, told Decrypt.\n\"Red September has gone from market anomaly to monthly psychology experiment. We're watching an entire market talk itself into a selloff based on history rather than current fundamentals.\"\nThe mechanics behind Red September trace back to structural market behaviors that converge each fall. Mutual funds close their fiscal years in September, triggering tax-loss harvesting and portfolio rebalancing that floods markets with sell orders. Summer vacation season ends, bringing traders back to desks where they reassess positions after months of thin liquidity. Bond issuances surge post-Labor Day, pulling capital from equities and risk assets as institutions rotate into fixed income.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee holds its September meeting, creating uncertainty that freezes buying until policy direction clarifies. In crypto, these pressures compound: Bitcoin's 24\/7 trading means no circuit breakers when selling accelerates, and a smaller market cap makes it vulnerable to whale movements seeking to rotate profits into altcoins.\n\"There are fundamental drivers, like rebalancing and liquidity, but psychology magnifies them,\" Bitso Product Group Manager Samer Rida told Decrypt. \"Once traders believe in a ‘Red September,’ they hedge or derisk ahead of time, and that self-fulfilling behavior reinforces the trend.\"\nThe cascade starts in traditional markets and spills into crypto within days. When the S&P 500 drops, institutional investors dump Bitcoin first to meet margin calls or reduce portfolio risk. Futures markets amplify the damage through liquidation cascades—a 5% spot move can trigger 20% in derivatives wipeouts. Social sentiment metrics turn negative by late August and traders sell preemptively to avoid expected losses. Options dealers hedge their exposure by selling spot Bitcoin as volatility rises, adding mechanical pressure regardless of fundamentals.\nAnd just like any other markets, some believe this becomes a pattern out of pure rational expectation, which is just another way to say self-fulfilling prophecy.\nThe numbers back up both Berg's and Rida's observations. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index has dropped from 74 out of 100 to 52, despite the global stock market showing a more optimistic view with 64 points. Borderline neutral but still in the “greed” zone.\nBut this September arrives with unusual crosscurrents. The Federal Reserve has shared positive statements, with the market pricing in another cut for the September 18 meeting. Core inflation remains stuck at 3.1%, while two active wars disrupt global supply chains. These conditions create what Daniel Keller, CEO of InFlux Technologies, sees as a perfect storm.\n\"We have two history-defining theaters of combat, one in Europe and one in the Middle East, which are disrupting critical supply chains,\" Keller told Decrypt. \"Additionally, the U.S. has initiated a global trade war against nearly all of its major allies. The contemporary state of global geopolitics perfectly positions BTC for a steep decline come September 2025.\"\nIn other words, right now markets don’t see Bitcoin as a hedge, which was the dominant pre-COVID narrative of BTC as an asset. Markets view it much more like a risk asset.\nTechnical indicators are starting to paint a scary picture for traders. Bitcoin broke below the critical $110,000 support level that has anchored the rally since May. The 50-day moving average sits at $114,000 and is now acting as resistance with the 200-day EMA providing support near the $103K price line.\nTechnical traders might be watching $105,000 as the line in the sand. On Myriad, a prediction market developed by Decrypt's parent company Dastan, traders currently place the odds of Bitcoin dipping back down to $105,000 at nearly 75%.\nA break below $105K would target sub-100K levels below the 200-day moving average. Hold above $110,000 through the first two weeks of September, and the seasonal curse might finally break.\nThe relative strength index reads 38, in oversold territory implying at least some Bitcoin investors are trying to get rid of their coins ASAP. Volume remains 30% below July averages, typical for late-summer trading but potentially problematic if volatility spikes.\nBut even if things seem like traders are preparing for history to repeat itself, some believe Bitcoin’s fundamentals are now stronger than ever, and that should be enough for the king of crypto to overcome this difficult month—or at least not crash like it has in the past.\n\"The idea of 'Red September' is more myth than math,\" Ben Kurland, CEO at crypto research platform DYOR, told Decrypt. \"Historically, September has looked weak because of portfolio rebalancing, fading retail momentum, and macro jitters, but those patterns mattered when Bitcoin was a smaller, thinner market.\"\nKurland points to liquidity as the real driver now. \"Inflation isn't gliding lower, it's proving sticky with core readings still creeping higher. But even with that headwind, the Fed is under pressure to ease as growth cools, and institutional inflows are deeper than ever.\"\nTraditional warning signs are already flashing. The FOMC meets September 17-18, with markets split on whether officials will hold rates or cut them.\nKeller advises watching fear and greed indices closely. \"Traders in the coming weeks should monitor fear and greed indices to determine the general market sentiment and whether it's better to hold in case prices jump or sell off as 'Red September' looms closer,\" he said.\nThe seasonal pattern may be weakening as crypto matures. Bitcoin's September losses have moderated from an average negative 6% in the 2010s to negative 2.55% over the past five years. Institutional adoption through ETFs and corporate treasuries has added stability. In fact, in the last two years, Bitcoin has registered positive gains in September.\nBerg sees the whole phenomenon as self-reinforcing psychology. \"After years of September selloffs, the crypto community has trained itself to expect weakness. This creates a cycle where fear of the dip becomes the dip itself,\" he said.\nIt the outlook seems bleak, don’t fret: After Red September comes October—or “Uptober”—which is historically Bitcoin’s best month of the year.\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication to include comments from Bitso's Samer Rida.\nThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.","content_hash":"b268214a73c6eeb2f10eeada0328d3d9","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":7248,"method_rank":0}

That number shows the resilience of the U.S. economy despite higher interest rates and global macroeconomic uncertainty.\nIn such an environment, investors can particularly benefit from putting their money into companies with scale, durable cash flows, and the ability to ride secular tailwinds.\nHere's why these two stocks fit the criteria, making them wise buy-and-hold choices for the long term.\n1. Nvidia\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has firmly established itself as the leading player in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, as it accounts for nearly 92% of the data center GPU market. That dominance has been the foundation of its robust financial performances of recent years. In its fiscal 2026 second quarter (which ended July 27), Nvidia reported revenues of $46.7 billion, up 56% year over year and exceeding guidance, while its GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) gross margin was 72.4%. Management now expects fiscal third-quarter revenue to reach $54 billion, plus or minus 2%, driven by increasing demand for its Blackwell-architecture GPUs.\nNvidia estimates that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be invested in AI infrastructure by the end of 2030. En route to that total, it expects hyperscalers and enterprises to invest nearly $600 billion in data center infrastructure and computational technologies in calendar 2025, nearly double the amount that was invested in 2023. Nvidia's Blackwell-based AI systems, such as the GB200 NVL System and GB300 platform, are increasingly being used by cloud service providers and consumer internet companies to train and power large AI models.\nNvidia's proprietary Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) software stack can be used to optimize its hardware for specific AI workloads. CUDA has become the industry standard, used by over 5 million developers. Nvidia has also strengthened its position in networking solutions, where its record quarterly revenue of $7.3 billion was driven by demand for Spectrum-X Ethernet, InfiniBand, and NVLink from customers building massive AI clusters. The company also highlighted that networking is now a $10 billion-plus annualized revenue business for it, underlining its importance as data centers evolve into AI factories.\nAlthough U.S. restrictions on exporting the highest-end GPUs to China have been a headwind for the company, Nvidia is responding by adapting versions of its Blackwell chips (B30A ) that adhere to the new regulations and seeking regulatory approvals for broader deployments. It has already done this with its previous Hopper architecture, creating the H20 for Chinese customers. The company estimates the Chinese market opportunity to be nearly $50 billion in 2025.\nNvidia has also continued to reward its investors. In its fiscal second quarter, it returned $10 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, and the board authorized an additional $60 billion stock repurchase program.\nTrading at about 39.5 times expected forward earnings, Nvidia's stock is quite expensive. However, that valuation seems justified considering its robust financials and unmatched AI ecosystem.\n2. Alphabet\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has firmly established itself as a dominant technology powerhouse, with a leadership position in digital advertising and rapidly expanding presences in cloud computing and artificial intelligence. In the second quarter, it reported revenues of $96.4 billion, up 14% year over year, and operating income of $31.2 billion. Those results underscore the scalability and profitability of its business model. The company also had $95 billion in cash and securities on its books at the end of the quarter, giving it the flexibility to keep investing in growth while returning capital to shareholders.\nAlphabet's core advertising businesses have demonstrated remarkable resilience. Google Search continues to provide more than half of total revenues, with AI-enhanced search features such as AI Overviews, AI Mode, and Lens offering new ways for users to access information. This has helped deepen user engagement and improve monetization. YouTube generated nearly $9.8 billion in advertising revenues in the second quarter, while subscriptions added another layer of recurring revenue streams.\nGoogle Cloud accounted for a 13% share of the global spending on cloud infrastructure services in the second quarter, up 1 percentage point year over year. Google Cloud is benefiting from a growing demand for AI infrastructure and generative AI services worldwide. Google Cloud revenues were up 32% to $13.6 billion.\nAlphabet has also successfully integrated advanced AI technologies across its entire ecosystem to improve productivity and efficiency, and create better user experiences. Its Gemini models are powering Search, Gmail, Workspace, and Maps. This is helping it hold onto its user base and improve avenues for monetization. Alphabet is also investing in other opportunities such as autonomous driving through its Waymo, healthcare, and quantum computing units -- giving investors exposure to next-generation technologies.\nIt has been returning significant capital to shareholders, including nearly $16.1 billion returned through share buybacks and dividends in the second quarter.\nDespite a resilient advertising business, a fast-growing cloud division, and deep AI integration, Alphabet trades at 18.3 times forward earnings, lower than its five-year average of 23.9.\nRisks such as increased regulatory scrutiny, a looming court ruling in a major anticompetition case, rising competition in digital advertising, and concerns about the long-term impact of AI on search monetization may be among the reasons why the stock trades at a discounted valuation. Yet this very discount provides investors with the opportunity to buy shares of a dominant, cash-rich business with an AI-enabled platform at a reasonable price.\nConsidering these factors, Alphabet stock looks like an attractive stock to buy now and hold for the foreseeable future.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The selloff was triggered by concerns over China's semiconductor ambitions, particularly reports that Alibaba (BABA) is developing its own AI chip, which sent Nvidia (NVDA) shares tumbling and pressured other AI infrastructure plays including AMD (AMD) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). Meanwhile, a federal appeals court ruling declaring most Trump-era tariffs illegal adds another layer of uncertainty, with the case expected to reach the Supreme Court and potentially requiring tens of billions in reimbursements to importers.\nThis week begins with markets closed Monday for Labor Day, creating a compressed four-day trading period that culminates in Friday's crucial August jobs report, which is the final major employment data before the Fed's September meeting.\nKey earnings from enterprise software leaders Zscaler (ZS), Salesforce (CRM), and semiconductor giant Broadcom (AVGO) will test whether technology's leadership can withstand mounting China concerns and broader market rotation pressures.\nHere are 5 things to watch this week in the Market.\nAI Infrastructure Under China Pressure\nThe week's most significant development centers on mounting pressure facing AI infrastructure stocks following reports that Alibaba (BABA) is developing proprietary AI chips, highlighting China's accelerating efforts to achieve semiconductor independence. Friday's selloff in Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) reflects growing investor concerns about potential market share erosion and reduced dependence on U.S. chip suppliers by Chinese technology giants. Thursday's Broadcom (AVGO) earnings will serve as a critical test for the semiconductor sector, with investors closely scrutinizing commentary about AI demand sustainability, competition from custom chips, and exposure to Chinese customers. The company's data center networking and AI accelerator businesses will be particularly important given recent volatility in the sector. Broadcom's results and guidance could either reinforce concerns about AI infrastructure headwinds or provide reassurance about the durability of current investment cycles, making this one of the week's most consequential earnings events.\nEmployment Data Before Fed Decision\nFriday's August jobs report at 8:30am represents the final major employment release before the Federal Reserve's September 17-18 meeting, taking on heightened significance as policymakers weigh the timing and magnitude of potential rate cuts. Nonfarm payrolls, unemployment rate, and average hourly earnings will be scrutinized for evidence supporting or contradicting recent dovish Fed commentary about labor market softening. Thursday's ADP employment report and initial jobless claims will provide additional context leading into Friday's comprehensive data. The employment picture becomes even more important given Wednesday's JOLTS job openings report, which will offer insights into labor demand and potential hiring trends. Any significant deviation from expectations could substantially influence September Fed meeting odds and impact rate-sensitive sectors, particularly as markets have already positioned for policy adjustments based on recent economic data.\nEnterprise Software Earnings Test\nTuesday's Zscaler (ZS) and Wednesday's Salesforce (CRM) earnings will provide crucial insights into enterprise software spending and cloud adoption trends amid ongoing questions about corporate IT budget priorities. Zscaler's results will offer perspective on cybersecurity demand and zero-trust network adoption, particularly important given increasing global cyber threats and regulatory compliance requirements. Salesforce's earnings will be closely watched for commentary on CRM software demand, AI integration progress, and customer spending patterns across different business segments. Both companies represent high-growth technology plays that have been sensitive to interest rate expectations and enterprise spending cycles, making their results particularly relevant following recent market volatility. The companies' guidance and commentary about customer behavior, deal pipeline, and spending prioritization will help determine whether enterprise software can maintain resilience amid broader economic uncertainties.\nManufacturing and Services Economic Pulse\nTuesday delivers a comprehensive view of manufacturing activity with the Manufacturing PMI at 9:45am and ISM Manufacturing PMI at 10:00am, providing timely insights into industrial conditions following recent mixed economic signals. Thursday's Services PMI and ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI will offer perspective on the larger services sector that drives most economic activity. These reports will be particularly important for assessing business confidence and spending intentions ahead of Friday's jobs report and the Fed's September meeting. The ISM prices components will provide additional insights into inflationary pressures at the business level, relevant for Fed policy considerations. The convergence of manufacturing and services data creates potential for significant market reactions if the reports collectively suggest strengthening or weakening business conditions, particularly given ongoing questions about economic momentum and the sustainability of recent growth trends.\nLegal and Geopolitical Market Undercurrents\nThe federal appeals court ruling declaring most Trump-era tariffs illegal creates significant legal and economic uncertainty, with the case expected to reach the Supreme Court and potentially requiring tens of billions in reimbursements to importers. This development adds complexity to trade policy expectations and could influence sectors with significant international exposure or those previously benefiting from trade protection. Companies in steel, aluminum, solar, and other previously tariff-protected industries may face questions about competitive positioning and future policy support. The ruling also creates potential fiscal implications if large-scale reimbursements are required, possibly affecting government spending priorities and deficit calculations. Meanwhile, Spirit Airlines' second Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing within a year has boosted rival carriers like Frontier Airlines, highlighting ongoing consolidation pressures in the airline industry and creating potential opportunities for surviving carriers to gain market share and improve pricing power.\nBest of luck this week and don't forget to check out my daily options article.\nOn the date of publication, Gavin McMaster had a position in: SPY, AVGO, NVDA.

Maybe even a seven-figure stash? Stocks are the answer, of course, although it's easier said than done. You need to find the right stocks at the right time and then stick with them long enough to achieve your goal. That can be a tall order.\nEnter BYD Company(OTC: BYDDY) -- one of a handful of names a growing number of investors are betting will get them to the seven-figure mark. But are they actually right about this stock's potential upside?\nWhat's BYD?\nNever heard of it? You might be more familiar with it than you think. Remember relatively recent headlines about Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) no longer being the world's biggest electric vehicle (EV) company? BYD's the outfit that eclipsed it.\nThat may be a bit tough to believe given that you've never actually seen a BYD-made EV on American roads. There's a perfectly good explanation: BYD doesn't sell its EVs in the U.S. Its core market remains its home country of China, although it's doing pretty well in the rest of the Pacific region as well as in Europe. All told, the company sold nearly 607,000 battery-powered EVs in the second quarter of this year versus Tesla's deliveries of only 373,728 automobiles.\nAnd that's just battery-only EVs. The company sold even more hybrids during this three-month stretch. The company also manufactures buses, high-speed trains, electronics components, and perhaps most notably, lithium batteries ... including for other carmakers' EVs.\nThat still doesn't tell the whole story. Unlike most other auto manufacturers, BYD is fiercely self-sufficient. It makes its own electronic components for its EVs, for example, and of course, its own EV batteries. It even owns seven of its own cargo ships, each of which is capable of delivering thousands of vehicles to overseas markets, providing the company with enormous flexibility rather than leaving it dependent on third-party maritime shipping services.\nOh, yeah ... BYD is profitable too, and pretty consistently so.\nBYD is in the right place, at the right time, with the right product(s)\nStill, given what we know of the United States' EV market, it would be easy to conclude millionaire-making gains aren't in the cards anytime soon, if ever. The American Automobile Association (which you know better as AAA or just Triple-A) says the number of Americans who are likely to buy an EV is steadily falling, from 2022's modest figure of 25% to only 16% this year; drivers are mostly worried about the complicated logistics of keeping their batteries charged away from home.\nMeanwhile, competition for this shrinking crowd of would-be EV owners is heating up. Although Tesla is still the leader of the U.S. EV market, recent entries into the race from Ford Motor Company, General Motors, and Hyundai (just to name a few) are forcing Tesla to discount its cars -- pinching profit margins as a result -- in order to maintain this market leadership. Moreover, Ford is investing $5 billion as part of an effort to introduce a $30,000 battery-powered pickup truck in the U.S., as well as make improvements to EV batteries that will alleviate some of consumers' top concerns.\nIn other words, it's an increasingly competitive and difficult market -- not the kind any newcomers' company would want to dive into.\nThe thing is, this dynamic is unique to America. Everywhere else, demand for EVs is on the rise. That's particularly true in and around China where BYD sells about three-fourths of its passenger vehicles. Data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers indicates sales of new energy vehicles (battery-only as well as hybrid-electric) have been breaking records all year long, with July's sales of 1.26 million cars up 27% year over year, mirroring the growth pace seen since 2021. In fact, new energy vehicles account for roughly half of China's sales of new cars, en route to an 80% share by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency.\nAnd BYD isn't just leading this important automobile market; it's dominating it. The company controls on the order of 30% of the country's EV business, according to numbers from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), versus next-nearest Geely's share of a little over 10%. The company's clearly positioned to win at least its fair share of whatever growth awaits in its core market.\nThat's just China's EV business. Again, BYD operates several others, including supplying rival EV companies with the lithium-based batteries required to power them. Let's also not look past the fact that BYD stands ready to enter the U.S. market if and when it makes sense to do so.\nIs BYD a millionaire-maker?\nBut the overarching question remains: Is BYD your ticket to becoming a millionaire? It certainly has the potential to help you become one. Just make sure your expectations are reasonable relative to the company's potential from here. It's unlikely a $10,000 investment today would be worth $1 million a year from now, for instance, or even 10 years from now.\nA $100,000 investment in this company today, however, could potentially turn into $1 million in 15 to 20 years' time. That would only require an average annual gain of between 12% to 16%, which is above the market's historical norm but not beyond the realm of plausibility given what BYD does, how well it does it, and the era in which it's doing it.\nOf course, as with other high-growth\/high-profile international stocks, you'll want to keep your finger on the pulse of any geopolitical rhetoric that could impact its growth or operations.\nShould you buy stock in BYD Company right now?\nBefore you buy stock in BYD Company, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and BYD Company wasn’t one of them.

And perhaps unsurprisingly, the sponsor behind the deal is none other than Chamath Palihapitiya -- often referred to as the \"SPAC King.\"\nWhile his early launches drew enormous hype, Palihapitiya's SPAC stocks have been anything but royal -- often leaving retail investors holding the bag. This track record has led some to question whether SPACs are good investments at all.\nStill, Palihapitiya is back in the arena -- this time with American Exceptionalism Acquisition Corp., a name as ambitious as the investor behind it. The question now is whether this latest venture signals a genuine comeback or simply another high-profile gamble in a market rife with wary investors.\nWill Palihapitiya's new SPAC succeed? Read on to explore what history shows and what it could mean for investors.\nWho is Chamath Palihapitiya?\nChamath Palihapitiya began his career in management roles at AOL and Facebook (now Meta Platforms). Outside of those corporate posts, he proved fortunate -- and shrewd -- in backing early-stage start-ups that ultimately found lucrative exits through acquisitions by larger companies.\nEventually, Palihapitiya left Facebook to pursue investing full-time -- launching his own venture capital firm, Social Capital.\nFast-forward to the SPAC boom between 2020 and 2021, and Palihapitiya instantly became one of the most vocal voices and recognizable personalities in the space.\nSome of his high-profile deals included SoFi Technologies(NASDAQ: SOFI), Virgin Galactic, MP Materials, Clover Health, and Opendoor Technologies.\nWhile admirers paint Palihapitiya as a bold contrarian investor willing to challenge Wall Street's status quo, the uneven performance of many of these SPACs has given critics plenty of ammunition.\nWhat is a SPAC?\nA SPAC, often referred to as a \"blank check company,\" is a shell entity that raises money from investors through a public offering with the sole purpose of merging with a private company. Once a target is identified, the SPAC combines with that company -- instantly taking it public without the lengthy, complex process of a traditional initial public offering (IPO).\nThe main difference between a SPAC and an IPO comes down to structure and timing. In an IPO, a company works with an investment bank to underwrite the deal -- a process that can take months as bankers conduct roadshows, pitch to accredited investors, and determine an appropriate valuation.\nBy contrast, a SPAC is already listed on an exchange, so merging with it allows a company to bypass much of the regulatory and logistical friction.\nFor companies, SPACs provide a quicker, simpler alternative to the traditional IPO process. For investors, they offer exposure to buzzy businesses -- often unicorns -- that might otherwise be off-limits before they go public.\nAre SPACs good investments?\nJust like traditional IPO stocks, determining whether a SPAC is a good investment ultimately comes down to \"it depends.\" While Palihapitiya's most recognizable SPACs are often cited, it's important to remember that he also backed some companies that later delisted or even went bankrupt. Taken as a whole, Palihapitiya's personal track record in the SPAC arena has been disappointing.\nThat said, not every SPAC has fared poorly. Some companies have managed to carve out a path to success.\nHims & Hers Health has become something of a darling among retail investors thanks to its bold entrance into the red-hot weight loss market, going toe-to-toe with GLP-1 juggernauts Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Moreover, AST Spacemobile and Rocket Lab have attracted speculative enthusiasm from investors captivated by the space exploration economy. Meanwhile, Vertiv has enjoyed tailwinds from the AI boom as its liquid cooling systems prove critical to ongoing data center infrastructure investment.\nThese examples come with important caveats. Winners like these tend to be outliers, often driven by retail hype or unique secular catalysts. A detailed study from the University of Florida underscores this point: Between 2012 and 2022 SPAC stocks delivered returns of negative 58% one year following their merger. Moreover, the median SPAC performance across industries from 2009 through 2025 has drastically trailed the broader market.\nIn other words, while some SPACs have thrived, these seem to be exceptions rather than the norm. American Exceptionalism Acquisition Corp. may succeed in capturing headlines, but for smart investors, it should be viewed as a speculative bet rather than a proven opportunity.\nConsidering both Palihapitiya's past ventures and the results of the broader SPAC landscape, history suggests caution is warranted.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

Many dividend stocks also lost their luster in 2022 and 2023 as rising interest rates made risk-free CDs and U.S. Treasury bills more appealing to income investors.\nBut as interest rates declined in 2024, many investors rotated back toward dividend stocks. The Federal Reserve is also expected to cut its rates at least one or two more times this year. As those rates come down, even more investors should rush back to high-yielding dividend stocks.\nLet's take a closer look at five reliable blue chip dividend stocks that are worth buying before that shift occurs: Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO), Altria Group(NYSE: MO), International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO), and Realty Income(NYSE: O).\nCoca-Cola\nCoca-Cola, the world's top beverage maker, sells sodas, bottled water, teas, fruit juices, sports drinks, energy drinks, coffee, and even alcoholic drinks. That diversification insulates it from slowing soda consumption, and it's been refreshing its core sodas with smaller serving sizes, healthier versions, and new flavors.\nCoca-Cola only sells the syrups and concentrates for its drinks, while its bottling partners actually produce, and sell the finished beverages. That capital-light model enabled the company to generate stable profits and raise its dividends annually for over six decades.\nThe stock currently pays a forward yield of 3% and looks reasonably valued at 23 times forward earnings, and this evergreen business should generate stable returns through bull and bear markets.\nAltria\nAltria, the largest tobacco company in the U.S., generates most of its revenue from its flagship Marlboro cigarette brand. But as smoking rates decline across the U.S., it's been rolling out more non-smokable products like snus, nicotine pouches, and e-cigarettes. It's also been raising its cigarette prices, cutting costs, and buying back shares to boost its EPS.\nThose strategies have enabled Altria to raise its dividends every year since it spun off its overseas business as Philip Morris International in 2008. The stock currently pays a forward yield of 6.4% and trades at just 12 times forward earnings.\nThe shares' upside potential should remain limited as Altria gradually diversifies its business away from its shrinking cigarette business, but its high yield and low multiple should also limit its downside potential.\nIBM\nIBM was once considered an aging tech giant with minimal growth prospects. But over the past five years, it divested its slow-growth infrastructure services segment as Kyndryl and focused on expanding its higher-growth hybrid cloud and AI businesses. Instead of going toe to toe against bigger public cloud companies, it wedged those analytics tools between its clients' on-site servers and public cloud services.\nThat strategy, which was largely driven by its open-source software subsidiary Red Hat, helped IBM grow again. Management has raised the dividend annually for 30 consecutive years, the stock pays a forward yield of 2.8%, and the shares still looks reasonably valued at 22 times forward earnings.\nCisco\nCisco, the world's largest networking company, struggled with a messy slowdown over the past few years as it slogged through its supply chain and inventory issues. The macro headwinds also drove many companies to rein in their spending on big infrastructure upgrades.\nBut as it worked through those issues, Cisco continued to expand its ecosystem with big acquisitions like ThousandEyes, Acacia Communications, and Splunk. It's also poised to benefit from a surge in infrastructure spending as more companies upgrade their networks to handle the latest AI applications.\nCisco has largely overcome its previous challenges, and it should grow at a slow but steady clip over the next few years. It pays a forward dividend yield of 2.4%, it has raised that payout annually for 13 consecutive years, and its stock looks like a bargain at 17 times forward earnings.\nRealty Income\nRealty Income is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that buys a lot of retail properties, rents them out to recession-resistant retailers like Dollar Tree and Walgreens, and splits that rental income with its investors. To maintain a favorable tax rate, it must pay out at least 90% of its taxable income as dividends.\nIt owns over 15,600 properties, and it has kept its occupancy rate above 96% ever since its public debut in 1994. As interest rates decline, it will become cheaper to expand that portfolio or gobble up its smaller industry peers.\nIt pays monthly dividends, has a forward yield of 5.6%, and has hiked its payout 131 times since its initial public offering. The stock trades at just 14 times its projected adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share this year. That low valuation makes it a great place to park your cash ahead of the Fed's next rate cuts.\nShould you buy stock in Coca-Cola right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

Yet the late-week wobble only offered a flicker of doubt in an otherwise resilient summer, with the S&P 500 notching a fourth straight monthly gain.\nRisk appetite continues to spill into nearly every corner of markets, from corporate bonds and cryptocurrencies to cyclical currencies. The rationale feels deceptively simple: the Fed looks poised to cut interest rates, the US consumer has so far proved the doubters wrong, and the artificial intelligence story still commands momentum.\nThat logic has proven resilient even in the face of mounting risks. Trade frictions, a cooling labor market and conflicting bond signals haven’t derailed the rally. If anything, they’ve hardened bets that monetary support is imminent — and that the expansion, while aging, still has legs.\nOne way to dissect the bullishness is a cross-asset momentum gauge maintained by Societe Generale SA. It blends 11 components, including copper versus gold, cyclical stocks versus defensive, crypto, high-yield bonds and more. It has flirted with the most bullish thresholds at least five times since the tariff-spurred fallout in April — including again this month.\n“Investors are realizing that the impact of tariffs is not as catastrophic as initially feared and that’s giving them more confidence — a confidence now underscored by solid fundamentals,” said Omar Aguilar, CEO of Charles Schwab Investment Management Inc.\nThen there’s volatility — or the lack of it. Short-term implied volatility across major assets has fallen below long-term averages, reaching levels not seen consistently in around four years, according to Cboe Global Markets. It’s a stretch of cross-asset calm that belies the disruption from the shock jobs report just weeks ago. With US growth revised up to 3.3% last quarter, investors have another reason to stay the course.\nFor Mandy Xu, this prevailing calm is rooted in the economic story.\n“Despite all the tariff chaos, the consumer has held up, inflation is still in check and the Fed is about to cut,” said Xu, Cboe’s head of derivatives market intelligence. “Until that narrative changes, I think volatility is likely to remain in check in the near-term.”\nEven a well-supported rally can start to look overconfident, as Friday’s stumble made clear. Still, the S&P 500 ended the week only 0.1% lower, for all the noise. Junk bonds extended gains for a fourth week, as 10-year Treasury yields advanced.\n“Having every asset decline simultaneously in terms of volatility is a sign of complacency,” said Peter van Dooijeweert, head of strategic investment partnerships at Capstone Investment Advisors. “The Fed appears to be under severe pressure from the administration and the economic impact of tariffs over the next 12 months is not clear yet. The market seems too relaxed given how much uncertainty remains ahead.”\nYet that caution hasn’t translated into investor retreat. Many see this not as ignorance, but a studied surrender to a market that has humbled skeptics all year. Calling it complacency is easy — stepping aside, harder.\nCase in point: Data from Barclays Research shows that institutional investors ramped up equity buying in August, led by hedge funds, commodity trading advisors and risk-control funds as volatility collapsed — dubbed an “unusual” re-risking that has pushed overall positioning to above-average levels.\n“The only way to spook the market is if interest rates go up or if tech stocks really show a decline in the rate of growth,” said Max Wasserman, co-founder and senior portfolio manager at Miramar Capital. “I am not optimistic about this overall market because it’s dominated by a handful of stocks.”\nA dividend-growth investor, Wasserman holds Microsoft Corp., Broadcom Inc. and Alphabet Inc., which together make up about 15% of his portfolio. While his other holdings have been “languishing,” he’s hedging with energy — which he expects to benefit from a weaker dollar — and healthcare.\nHis concern isn’t just valuations. It’s crowding.\nA similar caution can be heard among credit participants. James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management, said he’s holding positions where momentum still looks strong. But with long-term rates proving unpredictable, he’s wary of chasing further gains. “It’s a bad set up for risk taking right now, no matter where you look,” he said. For now, he’s focused on clipping steady income — and staying nimble if conditions shift.\nThe strongest and most consistent signals are coming from the riskier corners of credit and equity markets, according to Manish Kabra, chief US equity strategist at SocGen. Crypto assets and cyclical currencies like the Australian dollar and Swedish krona are also flashing green. Commodities — particularly the copper-to-gold ratio and oil — have delivered the most uneven readings.\nAgainst this backdrop, some investors are using the calm to rotate — quietly, deliberately — into less obvious corners of the market. At Schwab, Aguilar and his team recently rotated into small caps, betting the segment would benefit most from imminent Fed easing. Earlier this summer, they added exposure to the middle of the fixed-income curve to lock in yield before rates fall. At the start of the year, they shifted into international equities, looking for diversification and upside in regions less tethered to US policy.\n“Given that all the activity we have seen this summer, I think the rally is healthy,” he said. But “I would not be surprised if we see a pullback.”","content_hash":"b5271ba363c6d9620839c1d554f9b26c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5857,"method_rank":0}

The net supply change over the past week has been negative, with 669,500 ETH withdrawn from circulation, highlighting a tightening supply dynamic.\nThis concentration has nearly quadrupled since April, when reserves totaled around 3 million ETH.\nThe largest private accumulator is Bitmine Immersion Tech, which now holds 1.8 million ETH worth $7.75 billion after expanding its position by nearly 187% over the past month.\nSharpLink Gaming ranks second with 797,700 ETH, while The Ether Machine and the Ethereum Foundation hold 345,400 ETH and 231,600 ETH, respectively.\nThe data suggests private entities are matching the intensity of ETF demand, accelerating Ethereum’s institutionalization.\nThis dual engine of ETF flows and treasury accumulation has translated into strong price action.\nHistory Shows Ethereum’s Green Augusts Lead to Explosive Q4 Gains\nEthereum’s performance in August has historically carried strong implications for the months ahead, and this year is no exception. Data from CoinGlass shows that when Ether closes August in the green, subsequent months have delivered average gains of around 60%.\nSource: CoinGlass\nThe pattern was clear in 2017, when a 92.9% August surge set the stage for another 91% rally into year-end during the ICO boom. In 2020, Ethereum rose 25.3% in August and then soared 69% through December amid DeFi’s first major wave.\nEven in 2021, during an overheated bull market, ETH gained 35.6% in August and added another 17.8% in the fourth quarter.\nThe flip side is also clear: red August closes have historically led to year-end drawdowns averaging -14.1%. Analysts caution, however, that every bullish August has been followed by a negative September, with early pullbacks averaging 17% before strong Q4 rebounds.\nInstitutional flows appear to be reinforcing the cycle this time around. Blockchain firm Arkham reported that nine wallets acquiring $456.8 million in ETH this week, with an additional $164 million in purchases tracked through FalconX and Galaxy Digital.\nLong-term Bitcoin holders are also rotating into Ether. One 2013-era wallet moved $83 million to Binance, while another whale, holding over $5 billion in BTC, has been steadily buying billions in ETH through Hyperliquid.\nArkham confirmed that four whale addresses scooped up another $357 million worth of ETH between August 27 and 28 alone.\nTechnical analysts see striking similarities between ETH’s current market structure and its 2020–21 breakout. After consolidating for months between $1,000 and $2,000, Ether broke above $2,500 and is now testing higher levels near $4,800–$5,000.\nSource: Stripe.eth\nThis resistance zone, corresponding with its previous all-time high, has triggered a rejection, raising the possibility of a pullback to $3,600–$3,800 before any sustainable breakout. If the 2021 fractal repeats, ETH could be preparing for a parabolic run toward $6,000–$8,000.\nEthereum is currently trading at $4,332, down 4.1% in the past 24 hours and 6.1% on the week. Despite being 11% below its new all-time high of $4,946 set on August 24, the token remains up 16.6% over the past month and more than 73% in the last three months.","content_hash":"6a084d6d5669b46b0b49853814f7f29a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5804,"method_rank":0}

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\"With our newly achieved scale and market share, we are confident that we can achieve industry-leading efficiency in the long term,\" Wu said.\nHis assessment reflects how Taobao Instant Commerce, an initiative launched in April, strengthened Alibaba's domestic market position, as it met consumers' need for on-demand delivery across a wide range of product categories, including food, groceries, electronics and apparel. Alibaba owns the Post.\nJiang Fan, the head of Alibaba's E-commerce Business Group, said on Friday's earnings call that the company's foray into instant commerce would \"deliver positive economic benefits to the platform overall\", driven by increased efficiency and the high-frequency usage pattern in this segment.\nThe instant commerce operation contributed to a 25 per cent boost in monthly active consumers and a 20 per cent increase in daily active users on the Taobao app in the first three weeks of August.\n\"We expect that in the next three years, flash purchases and instant retail will generate an additional 1 trillion yuan (US$140 billion) in transactions for the platform,\" Jiang said, adding that this growth would create over 1 million jobs.\nAlibaba Group Holding CEO Eddie Wu Yongming.

Photo: Weibo>\nThe specific numbers reported by Alibaba executives on Friday - including peak daily orders of 120 million and 300 million monthly active consumers achieved by its instant commerce business - have helped boost investor confidence.\nThe 13 per cent surge in Alibaba's American Depositary Receipts (ADR) opened an arbitrage opportunity with its Hong Kong-listed counterparts. Investors who bought eight Alibaba H-shares at Friday's closing price of HK$115.70 each could convert them for one ADR valued at the US closing price of US$135, implying an upside of about 14 per cent. Alibaba also owns the Post.\nFor the quarter ended June 30, total group revenue rose 2 per cent to 247.7 billion yuan (US$34.6 billion), or 10 per cent on a like-for-like basis excluding disposals of Sun Art and Intime.\nSeveral brokerages - including HSBC, UBS and Jefferies - raised their respective target prices for Alibaba to above US$160.\n\"Alibaba is at the centre of the consumption-driven economy and online shopping, supported by its strong technological strength versus peers,\" Jefferies said in a note on Friday.\nAlibaba last month pledged to invest 50 billion yuan over the next 12 months in a subsidy programme for both consumers and merchants, as it competed against Meituan and JD.com in the fast-paced \"instant commerce\" arena. In April, Alibaba's instant commerce unit, Taobao Shangou, started taking on those two rivals in this segment.\nAlibaba China E-commerce group, the firm's domestic online retail business, saw its June quarter revenue rise 10 per cent from a year earlier to 140 billion yuan. Adjusted Ebita (earnings before interest, taxes and amortisation) declined 21 per cent to 38.4 billion yuan, weighed down by fresh investment in instant commerce.\nBy comparison, JD.com's second-quarter net income attributable to shareholders fell by half to 6.2 billion yuan, while Meituan's profit plunged 96.8 per cent to 365.3 million yuan.\nAn Ele.me delivery rider from Alibaba seen in Beijing.

AI-related product revenue also showed triple-digit growth for the eighth consecutive quarter.\nAlibaba expected its cloud computing business to remain on an upwards trajectory in the coming quarters, backed by the firm's three-year, 380 billion yuan AI and infrastructure capital spending plan announced earlier this year, according to Wu.\nHe also stressed that Alibaba had \"backup plans\" to secure AI chip supplies in spite of US trade restrictions and heightened geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington.\n\"Alibaba has multiple growth drivers for the years ahead,\" the Jefferies note said. \"In cloud computing, it has clear market leadership as the backbone of digitalisation across different industries.\"\nAlibaba International Digital Commerce Group saw 19 per cent revenue growth to 34.7 billion yuan, with adjusted Ebita losses narrowing 98 per cent to 59 million yuan, which was close to breakeven.\nAll other business segments - including logistics arm Cainiao, workplace collaboration tool DingTalk, Amap, gaming and entertainment - fell 28 per cent last quarter to 58.6 billion yuan, mainly due to disposals.","content_hash":"8aea7da5b330bde14f20e92424caa44e","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5645,"method_rank":0}

They operate mature businesses that produce significantly more profit than they need to support their continued expansion. That gives them lots of money to pay dividends.\nHere are four top money-printing dividend stocks.\nCoca-Cola\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) owns an iconic portfolio of soft drinks, water, teas, and other beverage brands that generate substantial cash. Last year, the company produced $10.8 billion in free cash flow, $8.5 billion of which it paid out in dividends. Over the last 15 years, it has distributed nearly $100 billion in cash dividends to shareholders.\nThe company's durable and growing cash flows have enabled it to steadily increase its dividend payment. Coca-Cola raised it by 5.2% earlier this year, the 63rd straight year it has increased its payout. That puts the beverage giant in the elite group of Dividend Kings, companies with at least 50 years of consecutive annual dividend increases.\nThe company expects to produce even more cash in the future. Its long-term target is to organically grow its revenue by 4% to 6% annually, which should drive annual growth in earnings per share in the mid to high single digits. Coca-Cola plans to convert 90% to 95% of its growing earnings into free cash flow, which should support continued dividend increases.\nExxonMobil\nExxonMobil(NYSE: XOM) runs a large-scale global energy business that consistently produces significant cash flows. Last year, Exxon generated $55 billion in cash flow from operations, marking its third-best year in a decade, even though oil and gas prices were around their historical averages.\nThe company produced $36.2 billion in free cash flow and returned $36 billion to shareholders via dividends ($16.7 billion) and share repurchases ($19.3 billion). Those cash returns led the oil sector and ranked as the fifth-highest among S&P 500 companies.\nThe oil giant expects to invest $165 billion into major growth projects and its Permian Basin development program through 2030. These high-return investments should grow its annualized cash flows by $30 billion by 2030, assuming stable oil prices.\nThat has it on pace to produce a huge gusher of $165 billion in cumulative surplus cash over the next five years, which should support continued payout increases. With 42 straight years of dividend growth, Exxon has reached a level that only 4% of companies in the S&P 500 have achieved.\nJohnson & Johnson\nJohnson & Johnson(NYSE: JNJ) is a global healthcare leader that produced $20 billion in free cash flow last year. That's after spending over $17 billion in research and development, which made it one of the world's top R&D investors.\nThe company used its free cash flow to pay $11.8 billion in dividends in 2024 and strengthen its fortresslike balance sheet (it's one of only two companies with a AAA credit rating). It has also deployed over $32 billion into strategic acquisitions over the past year and a half.\nHeavy investments should support continued earnings and cash flow growth. That should enable Johnson & Johnson to extend its streak of dividend increases. It matched Coca-Cola's 63rd annual dividend hike earlier this year, which also qualifies it as a Dividend King.\nKinder Morgan\nKinder Morgan(NYSE: KMI) owns extensive natural gas infrastructure assets that generate stable and predictable cash flow. Take-or-pay agreements and hedging contracts lock in 69% of its annual revenue, while fee-based frameworks provide income visibility for another 26% of earnings.\nThe pipeline company expects to produce $5.9 billion in cash flow from operations this year. That easily covers its anticipated dividend outlay of around $2.6 billion.\nThis will provide Kinder Morgan with added excess free cash flow to invest in its large expansion projects. The company currently has over $9.3 billion of growth capital projects in its backlog, which it expects to complete through 2030.\nThose projects will provide it with incremental sources of cash flow as they enter commercial service. That will give Kinder Morgan the fuel to continue increasing its dividend, which it has done for eight straight years.\nCash-producing machines\nCoca-Cola, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson, and Kinder Morgan all print tons of cash each year. That gives them the money to reinvest in growing their business while also paying attractive dividends that steadily grow. These cash machines are great foundational companies to anchor any portfolio.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

Investors can look beyond short-term fluctuations, however, and focus on buying stocks that can deliver attractive returns over the long term.\nWith their thorough research and in-depth analysis, top Wall Street analysts can help identify stocks with solid fundamentals and lucrative growth potential.\nHere are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.\nPalo Alto Networks\nCybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is this week's first stock pick. The company recently reported better-than-expected results for its fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. PANW also issued upbeat guidance for its fiscal first quarter and coming full year.\nFollowing the results, RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg reiterated a buy rating on Palo Alto with a 12-month price forecast of $232. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on PANW stock with a price target of $197.\n\"The punchline is that we believe the quarter and outlook demonstrate the proposed CyberArk acquisition is coming from a position of strength, debunking the organic weakness concern,\" said Hedberg.\nThe 5-star analyst highlighted that Palo Alto ended fiscal 2025 on a strong note, with results and outlook surpassing estimates across the board. Hedberg noted management's commentary about momentum being driven by strength in Palo Alto's XSIAM offering, AI demand driving software firewall needs and growth in Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) solutions.\nHedberg also cheered the company's Fiscal 2028 target to generate more than 40% in free cash flow margins for the combined Palo Alto\/CyberArk company. Overall, Hedberg finds the stock's risk\/reward attractive at current prices, especially as he sees PANW as an AI beneficiary and believes that it is insulated from broader risk around AI disruption in other software categories.\nHedberg ranks No. 94 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 65% of the time, delivering an average return of 19.2%. See Palo Alto Statistics on TipRanks.\nMongoDB\nThis week's next pick, database software maker MongoDB (MDB), rallied after reporting better-than-expected results for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 and giving a solid forecast.\nImpressed by the results, Stifel analyst Brad Reback reaffirmed a buy rating on MongoDB and raised his price target to $325 from $275, saying the company posted one of its strongest quarters ever. By comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has assigned a price target of $241 and an \"outperform\" rating on MDB stock.\nReback highlighted that MongoDB's Q2 FY26 revenue exceeded the consensus by about 7%, with upside coming from outperformance in both its cloud database service Atlas and Enterprise Advanced (EA)\/non-Atlas businesses. The analyst added that revenue upside and continued focus on operational efficiencies helped deliver Q2 FY26 operating profit margin of 14.7%, surpassing expectations by more than 4 percentage points.\nThe top-ranked analyst was mainly impressed by the growth in MongoDB's Atlas offering, driven by a healthy increase in consumption across its installed base, impressive new customer additions of 2,800 and emerging AI workload gains.\nOverall, Reback believes that \"Atlas is positioned to sustain 25%+ revenue growth,\" fueled by stabilizing consumption, enhanced sales execution and a growing set of core and emerging product drivers.\nReback ranks No. 760 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 52% of the time, delivering an average return of 10.2%. See MongoDB Ownership Structure on TipRanks.\nInternational Flavors & Fragrances\nFinally, we look at International Flavors & Fragrances (IFF), a company that provides flavors, scents and ingredients for industries including food, beverage and personal care. As part of its strategy of focusing on high-return businesses, IFF announced the divestiture of its soy crush, concentrate and lecithin business.\nIn a research note dated August 26, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth reiterated a buy rating on IFF with a price target of $105. However, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a \"neutral\" rating on IFF with a price objective of just $65.\nFeinseth discussed IFF's progress in its strategic initiatives, bolstered by a focus on innovation in high-margin products and efforts to optimize its product portfolio and balance sheet. The 5-star analyst highlighted the company's expanding profit margins and long-term revenue and cash flow growth potential.\nAdditionally, Feinseth believes that IFF is well-positioned to capitalize on secular, health-focused growth trends in food and nutrition, thanks to its \"robust pipeline of functional ingredients, expertise in sensory science and biotechnology, and deep relationships with global brands.\"\nThe analyst noted that through its strategic initiatives, IFF is creating significant shareholder value. Feinseth mentioned that IFF paid $102 million in dividends in Q2 2025 and announced a new $500 million share repurchase authorization.\nFeinseth ranks No. 205 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.9%.

So let's dive in and get up to speed with its place in the crypto ecosystem.\nScaling is this chain's superpower\nFor capturing value from everyday users and creating useful automated systems with smart contracts, even small values of time and money matter. When faced with choosing between two decentralized finance (DeFi) applications that do the same thing, people are going to go with the cheaper and faster version almost every time, especially when there's a big gap between the alternatives, like there is between decentralized applications (dApps) on Solana versus its biggest competitor, Ethereum.\nThis technology platform, which enables Solana to perform extremely quickly and extremely inexpensively relative to the competition, is thus the core element of why this company is worth investors knowing about. With its superior technology, its odds of outperforming those competitors are fairly high, as resources tend to flow toward where friction is the lowest.\nIn terms of the performance metrics, Solana routinely processes orders of magnitude more transactions per second than Ethereum's base layer. Solana routinely posts thousands of transactions per second (TPS) versus Ethereum in the tens. That means your token swaps or transfers take a moment or two on Solana, instead of between 10 and 30 seconds on Ethereum.\nUnder the hood, Solana executes its transactions in parallel, rather than queuing them serially. For users, the effect shows up as negligible fees and snappy confirmation. The chain's fee model starts with a tiny base fee, with optional priority fees for extra speed. In practice, transfers usually cost a fraction of a cent even without paying the priority fee. In contrast, Ethereum's gas fees are rarely beneath $1 per transaction, and they can balloon much higher during busy periods.\nSolana is thus the better chain to make applications that are intended for rapid throughput and global scale. Over time, that advantage is likely to pay off significantly for investors who buy the coin.\nWhy the edge matters\nIf a blockchain is fast and cheap, what becomes newly possible?\nThere are three segments in particular that benefit the most: AI agents, streaming payments, and decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN).\nAI agents and other automated systems need to pay other services per request, per file, or per millisecond of compute that they rent. That only works economically if fees are near zero and transaction confirmation times are near instant. Furthermore, such agents can transact with each other and with other platforms on blockchains, at a dramatically faster rate than what human operators could do. If the agents live on a blockchain like Solana, they aren't rate-limited by the capabilities of the chain, but rather by their own processing speed and their need to interact with services at any given moment.\nIn other words, Solana's speed and fee profile are a natural fit for that style of machine-to-machine commerce that's going to become a significantly larger proportion of transaction activity over time. The same economics also make it a lot easier to process human-initiated streaming payments for content, bandwidth, and access to microservices or APIs.\nSeparately, DePIN use cases are already on Solana. One project called Helium moved its wireless network protocol to Solana to tap cheaper, faster settlement times and a broader developer ecosystem. Another project called Hivemapper pays drivers to map the world with dashcams, and it chose Solana to keep tiny, frequent rewards economical. In each case, the unit economics would strain on a slower, costlier base layer.\nThe investment thesis for buying this coin is thus that a base layer that makes high-frequency, low-value payments trivial is a base layer that's going to be in demand as more and more diverse applications demand those characteristics.\nSolana already does that at scale today, and it's preparing for larger waves of traffic. Therefore, for long-term investors, knowing Solana and appreciating its powerful underlying technology is knowing where real-time crypto applications are most likely to live, and it's also knowing about the landscape that's currently taking shape.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Solana right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Solana, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Solana wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $664,110!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,104,355!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,069% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 186% for the S&P 500.

But if you do find yourself getting a big inheritance, winning the lotto or lucking out on an investment, you should make the right decisions to avoid losing your new wealth.\nKeeping your new wealth status secret for as long as you can is a smart move, though it’s more challenging if you had a public win advertised through the media. Otherwise, you risk people you know pressuring you for money or even strangers stealing from you.\nWhile suddenly quitting your job can seem tempting, Kamel recommended continuing to work while you figure out your next moves. A big lump-sum payout isn’t always possible, and you may need to work with monthly or annual payments.\nPlus, you’ll likely lose some of the cash to taxes.\nUse a High-Yield Savings Account\nOnce you get your money, a high-yield savings account is a safe temporary destination until you decide whether to invest it elsewhere or use it for another purpose.\nYou’ll also earn much higher than the 0.39% national average savings account rate that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reported on Aug. 18, 2025.\nSet Aside Tax Money\nYou likely won’t see the whole portion of your windfall due to income taxes due on the amount. That’s why it’s smart to consider taxes before spending anything.\n“If taxes aren’t taken out before you get the money, get with a tax pro to estimate how much you’ll owe the IRS come tax time,” Kamel said. “Then set that amount aside in a different account where you won’t accidentally spend it on a private jet.”\nKeep Your Existing Financial Advisor\nKamel recommended working with the trusted financial advisor you already have, as making the switch once you become rich can be risky. For example, the new advisor might not make decisions in your best interest, which could result in higher fees or even the loss of your money.\nLearn Money Management\nBeing careful with money might seem more important for the financially insecure, but it’s also essential once you have a large financial cushion you need to protect and make work for you.\nKamel discussed how a lottery winner called in to The Ramsey Show after losing his windfall due to gambling. A personal finance course can help you avoid such mistakes and wisely use your money to stay rich.\nGet Rid of All Debt\nA Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards survey found that around 83% of American households had debt in 2024. Now is the time to pay it all off and eliminate payments and interest charges. You should also aim not to find yourself in that place again.\n“Ditch debt for good and choose to opt out of the system that’s designed to make credit card companies and banks filthy rich,” Kamel said.\nWisely Invest\nWhile risky investments like crypto or trending stocks can tempt you with potentially high returns, Kamel recommended a more boring approach.\nThis includes making maximum contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, buying real estate with cash, and investing in index funds in a regular brokerage account. Kamel also encouraged understanding any investments first.\nPay Off Your Home or Buy One\nIf you haven’t paid off your home’s mortgage yet, you can do that now to save money on interest. Kamel explained that aspiring homeowners can also finally make the move to purchase a place fully in cash.\nBuy Umbrella Insurance\nSince you have a lot more to lose if you’re wealthy, you’ll need to consider the risk of liability lawsuits that your existing insurance policies won’t fully cover. That’s why Kamel recommended umbrella insurance for anybody with a net worth above $500,000.\nGet an Estate Plan\nTrust & Will’s 2025 Estate Planning Report found that only 45% of Americans have made estate plans. This can lead to confusion and tough decisions for your family should you die or become incapacitated.\nKamel recommended having a power of attorney and documents explaining who should get your assets and how to handle your affairs.\nCreate a Trust\nWhile Kamel said a will is usually enough for the average person, he explained that the wealthy should consider trusts. Otherwise, you risk your heirs misusing what you leave behind.\nTrusts are often complicated, so discuss your situation with a trusted attorney.\nGive Generously\n“The truth is giving is the most fun you can have with money, and what’s the point of having money if you’re not going to use it for good?” Kamel said.\nHe suggested a minimum 10% giving rate for the average person, which you could easily exceed if you’re rich. Consider options like donating to charities, family members or needy people in your community.\nDon’t Lend to Friends and Family\nWhen you let family members and friends borrow from you, it can easily make things awkward and cause arguments if they don’t repay you. Kamel suggested avoiding such conflicts by just giving them money when you want to help.\nEnjoy Your Wealth (Within Reason)\nKamel encouraged using your money in ways that you find enjoyable, such as going on your dream vacation or making a long-awaited major purchase.\nHowever, still keep the long term in mind and avoid making spending decisions that will eventually hurt you. That includes not falling into the lifestyle creep trap, which can even leave wealthy people struggling to pay the bills.","content_hash":"04f3182c85ce15ffa66defc271e2f150","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5399,"method_rank":0}

It's awesome. But the grass is green wherever you water it,\" consultant-turned-entrepreneur Alex Yale told Business Insider. \"It takes a lot of hard work, and it takes a lot of time and energy. You have to have a certain skillset and a certain appetite for risk.\"\nHe added that success is not guaranteed: \"There's a huge graveyard of failed entrepreneurs.\"\nYale has avoided that graveyard so far. After more than a decade of working in corporate America — he started his career as a consultant at Deloitte, spent years at Facebook in various roles, and joined Amazon aggregator Thrasio for a couple of years before the startup went sideways — Yale quit to work for himself in 2023.\nHe launched a cleaning brand, Uncle Todd's, and started selling products like septic pods and shoe deodorizers on Amazon. Shortly after, he acquired Flip-It! Cap, a company that sells bottle-emptying kits. Both brands do seven figures in annual revenue on Amazon, which BI verified by looking at screenshots of Yale's sales dashboards. His Uncle Todd's products are also in more than 3,000 retail stores, including Walmart, Home Depot, and Piggly Wiggly, and he plans to continue growing the retail side of his business.\nIn Yale's experience, there are major differences between working as an employee and working for yourself.\n\"As an entrepreneur, you take things really to heart. It's your product, your baby, your brand — and when something goes wrong, you lose sleep over it. You lose dollars over it,\" he said. \"In the corporate world, your boss might be upset or your performance review might not be stellar, but you're getting the same paycheck.\"\nDespite the challenges, Yale said he'd never discourage anyone from giving entrepreneurship a go and shared his top three pieces of advice for succeeding in business — specifically the e-commerce space — in 2025.\n1. Source domestically. \"Given the Trump administration, try to source domestically. Dealing with international trade is kind of a hot potato right now. It's on again, off again. It's 50% then it's 20% then it's 100%,\" he said, referring to tariffs. \"Starting a brand and a business is hard enough without a daily looking-over-your-shoulders, waiting for the shoe to drop on new tariffs or freight changes.\"\nYale said that Flip-It! Cap, which is currently 100% made in China, has been more affected by the tariffs than Uncle Todd's, which only has a couple of products produced in China. It helped that he anticipated a trade war: \"When Trump got elected, before he got inaugurated, I just knew that China was in his crosshairs.\"\nTo prepare for a potential trade dispute, \"I basically front-loaded a whole lot of inventory at the end of last year to buy myself at least time to resupply if these crazy tariffs moved in. So frankly, I never had to place a PO during the extreme 200% tariffs, and they've since abated, but I'm actually moving production for Flip-It! Cap to Providence, Rhode Island in January.\"\n2. Sell patentable products. A major problem for e-commerce entrepreneurs in 2025 is competing with Chinese sellers, Yale explained: \"A lot of Amazon e-commerce sellers are basically reselling products they get made in China. And, back in 2019, 2020, 2021, especially around the pandemic with the e-commerce boom, a lot of these factories that were making products for American brands said, 'Hey, why am I letting them make a profit off my product? Why don't I just set up an Amazon account, ship my goods over, sell directly, and I can be much more price competitive?'\"\nOne way to avoid the competition outright is to sell patented products that nobody can copy.\n\"Try for some IP advantage if you can,\" said Yale, whose Flip-It! Cap product is patent-protected. \"I stay away from any Chinese-sourced products that don't have a patent or any kind of IP protection, because within two months, if you see success on a product that you import from China, they'll be selling it for 20% to 30% less on Amazon and competing with you.\"\n3. Sell a high-quality product — ideally, a consumable — that solves a problem. At the end of the day, to succeed in e-commerce, you need a good product.\n\"A lot of e-comm entrepreneurs think so much is in the marketing and the advertising and the brand aesthetic that they forget about the core product performance — they almost overlook the quality of the product,\" said Yale. \"If your product quality is not there, you might hit it big on TikTok and see a whole bunch of sales, but then when people realize the product doesn't actually work or it doesn't solve a problem or it doesn't have the efficacy they're looking for, you're going to be as dead as quickly as you came alive.\"\nIdeally, you want to sell a consumable — or a product that people need to buy over and over again — like septic pods. That way, you don't have to continually acquire new customers.\nAnd make sure it solves a problem, Yale added: \"Necessity is the mother of invention — that's a real thing. People are looking for things to solve problems.\"","content_hash":"c5f193e4e9bdf5c7ee88a405f5315ee9","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5373,"method_rank":0}

Sure, Uber Technologies and Lyft -- and now Waymo -- have innovated in how we interact with cars, but people are still riding around in the same old type of vehicle (whether electric or internal combustion engine). Commercial planes were introduced after World War II, and the high-speed rail networks of Japan were actually invented in the 1960s.\nThis may all change with electric air taxis and companies like Archer Aviation(NYSE: ACHR). The upstart company is building electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles (eVTOLs) and plans to build an air taxi network to disrupt urban travel. In recent months, its stock has begun to dip, falling below its SPAC IPO price of $10.\nDoes all this mean investors should buy the dip on this transportation disruptor before it goes parabolic?\nDeveloping air taxi networks\nIn the early stages of development, Archer Aviation is planning to host point-to-point air taxi networks with its electric taxi vehicle called the Midnight. Think of the service as similar to helicopter pads in different areas across a city, allowing customers to bypass traffic and quickly get from point A to point B. Plans call for air taxi networks in cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Abu Dhabi within the next few years. In Los Angeles, the company is racing to be ready for the 2028 Summer Olympics.\nTo get there, the Midnight aircraft still needs certification from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which is taking a long time to inspect this new type of transportation vehicle. Midnight aircraft will be flying above residential and commercial areas in cities, so they need to be extremely safe and reliable.\nArcher Aviation management is hoping the vehicles get fully certified by the FAA shortly, but it is unclear what the exact timeline will be or if there will be any hiccups along the way. It is a huge roadblock in Archer Aviation's growth plans that investors should track closely.\nOnce the Midnight is certified, it will be ready to start scaling up production and getting these air taxi networks operational (and making money).\nHuge cash burn, necessary scale\nBuilding out an entirely new form of transportation is expensive, which you can see from Archer Aviation's financials. The company is scaling up manufacturing facilities around the United States, with plans to eventually hit a rate of 50 Midnight aircraft sold each year.\nWith zero revenue generated today, Archer is burning $477.5 million in free cash flow a year. In order to bridge the gap from start-up to certification and eventually operational taxi networks, the company has raised a lot of funds, including over $1 billion this year. It has $1.7 billion in liquidity as of the last earnings report, giving it many years of runway at its current burn rate.\nIn order to achieve profitability, Archer Aviation is going to need to scale up to many Midnight sales per year. It has current orders for hundreds of Midnights, with an estimated average price of $5 million each. Selling 50 of these a year would equate to $250 million in revenue, which does not cover the current burn rate.\nThere may be other revenue from operating the taxi networks as it is unclear exactly how revenue sharing will go with its aviation partners such as United Airlines, but what is clear is that Archer Aviation will need to reach manufacturing scale in order to generate a profit.\nIs Archer Aviation stock a buy?\nArcher Aviation has a promising new technology on its hands. However, that does not mean the stock is necessarily a buy at a market cap of $5.9 billion. The company is burning a ton of cash and has zero revenue today, with risks that the FAA will not even fully approve the new air taxi products if they do not pass safety inspections.\nIf Archer achieves its goal of 50 aircraft produced a year, it may still not be profitable. Manufacturing is a low-margin business, so in order to generate enough profits and cash flow to warrant a market cap approaching $6 billion, Archer Aviation is going to need to likely sell hundreds of aircraft annually. That scenario is many years away, if it ever happens.\nFor these reasons, investors should avoid buying the dip on Archer Aviation stock, even though it is below $10 a share.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Archer Aviation right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Archer Aviation, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Archer Aviation wasn’t one of them.

This consistent approach has helped me steadily grow my wealth.\nWhenever funds hit my account, I try to put at least some of the money to work right away by investing in new opportunities. Investing in a high-quality exchange-traded fund (ETF) allows me to deploy cash quickly.\nThis September, the two top ETFs I'm eager to buy more of are the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF(NYSEMKT: SCHD) and the JPMorgan NASDAQ Equity Premium Income ETF(NASDAQ: JEPQ). These funds not only generate passive income for me but also provide lower-risk exposure to the market's upside.\nAn easy way to invest in the top dividend stocks\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, which aims to measure the performance of 100 high-yielding dividend stocks with consistent records of paying dividends. It screens companies based on several dividend quality characteristics, including yield and five-year payment growth record. Its screens also weed out companies with weaker financial profiles. The index aims to track 100 high-quality, high-yielding dividend growth stocks.\nThe current 100 holdings have an average dividend yield approaching 4%. These companies have also increased their payments at a rate of more than 8% annually over the past five years.\nSeveral companies in the fund have maintained significantly longer periods of dividend growth. Take Chevron, for instance: The ETF's current top holding has increased its dividend for 38 straight years. Others in the top 10 have raised their payments for over half a century.\nThe ETF's combination of yield and growth provides me with strong total return potential. I should collect a lucrative and growing income stream as the underlying companies increase their dividends, enabling the fund to distribute a steadily rising amount of cash to investors:\nEarnings and dividend growth should also steadily increase the value of the underlying stocks held by the fund, which, in turn, should boost its overall value. Since its inception in 2011, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF has delivered an impressive 11.5% average annual total return. That's a great outcome from a lower-risk, income-focused investment.\nIncome plus lower volatility upside to the Nasdaq-100\nThe JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF follows a dual mandate: provide its investors with a monthly income stream and offer upside exposure to the Nasdaq-100 index with less volatility. The ETF's managers use a two-pronged strategy to achieve their return objectives:\nEquity portfolio: The managers construct an equity portfolio based primarily on companies in the Nasdaq-100 index by applying a data science approach to fundamental research.\nDisciplined options strategy: The ETF also writes out-of-the-money (above the current market price) call options on the Nasdaq-100 index. Options writers receive the premium (the value of the option) up front. The fund distributes the profits from these trades to investors each month.\nThe fund's options writing strategy can be very lucrative. Over the past 12 months, it has generated an income yield of more than 11%. That provides investors with a very tangible return, helping mute some market volatility.\nAdditionally, the fund's equity portfolio provides investors with upside to the growth of the Nasdaq-100. When combined with the options income, this portfolio growth enhances the fund's total returns. Since its inception in 2022, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF has delivered an average annual total return of 14.9%. This fund provides me with income and strong total return potential with less volatility, making it a lower-risk way to grow the value of my retirement account.\nIncome and growth\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF and the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF are ideal ways for me to quickly put cash to work this month. The Schwab ETF provides steady, growing dividend income from established companies, while the JPMorgan fund offers higher monthly income potential with less volatile exposure to the Nasdaq-100. Combining them provides both stability and upside, thereby enhancing my chances of achieving a financially secure retirement.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF wasn’t one of them.

Manufactured from agricultural palm waste—an abundant, underused resource in the region—PSB® offers a viable, research-backed solution to Saudi Arabia’s growing need for sustainable, regionally manufactured building materials.\nWith Saudi Arabia generating more than 300,000 tonnes of palm fronds annually, PSB® directly supports Vision 2030’s objectives to promote circular economy practices, localise manufacturing, and reduce environmental impact. DesertBoard’s entry into the Kingdom is more than a market move—it’s a commitment to unlocking economic and ecological value through innovation.\n“Palm waste presents a unique opportunity for the region,” said Kamal Farah, a Director at DesertBoard. “With PSB®, we are turning an overlooked material into a driver for low-carbon construction, local employment, and creative and environmentally sound design solutions across the Kingdom.”\nScientific Validation from Abu Dhabi University Research\nThe innovation behind PSB® is backed by the Palm Leaves Research Paper (July 2025), a collaborative study between DesertBoard and Abu Dhabi University. Led by Dr. Mai El-Basel, Research Lead (Interior Design), and Dr. Omar Chaalal, Professor of Chemical Engineering at Abu Dhabi University (ADU), in collaboration with Chemical Engineer Weam S K Abudaqqa, a former student at Abu Dhabi University. The paper is the region’s first dedicated academic study on engineered palm waste boards, and was supported by the leadership and guidance of Professor Ghassan Aouad, President of Abu Dhabi University, Professor Hamdi Mustafa Sheibani, Dean of the Department of Engineering, and Professor Osama Ahmed Mohamed, the Chair of the Department of Architecture and Design.\nThe study evaluated PSB® for its structural integrity, thermal resistance, environmental impact, and cultural suitability within desert climates.\n“We developed this research to assess both performance and potential. The results confirmed that PSB® meets and exceeds key benchmarks in durability, warping resistance, and critically, its moisture and heat resistance,” said Dr. Chaalal. “More importantly, it’s a material that speaks to our region’s identity and its urgent need for circular construction and design solutions.”\n“From an architectural, design, and civil engineering perspective, PSB® demonstrates excellent load-bearing stability and performs well in arid, high-temperature environments,” added Dr. Mai El-Basel. “It is a practical and scalable material that aligns perfectly with Vision 2030’s building goals.”\nKey findings from the research include:\nSuperior Strength: Withstands greater compressive force (16% reduction) than MDF (50%) or particleboard (44.5%).\nEnhanced Insulation: PSB® offers the best insulating properties for thermal conductivity in comparison to MDF and particleboard.\nIncreased Moisture Resistance: PSB® demonstrates higher contact angles (72°) in wettability tests, when compared with MDF (50.2°) and Plywood (65°).\nCulturally Relevant and Local: A cost-effective, locally sourced material aligned with regional heritage.\nAward-Winning Impact: On Weaving Pavilion\nDesertBoard’s relevance to the Kingdom is already tangible. The material played a central role in “On Weaving,” a modular prayer pavilion at the Western Hajj Terminal of Jeddah’s King Abdulaziz International Airport, which received the inaugural AlMusalla Prize from the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, a non-profit cultural organisation established by the Ministry of Culture.\nDesigned by East Architecture Studio with AKT II and artist Rayyane Tabet, and constructed with 1,316 PSB® panels, the structure combines woven palm fronds with DesertBoard’s modular, high-performance boards to create an expressive, culturally resonant space for prayer and reflection.\nThe pavilion debuted at the Islamic Arts Biennale 2025, Jeddah, and is now a benchmark for environmentally and culturally conscious architecture in the region.\n“This project exemplifies what DesertBoard makes possible—combining local materials, spiritual architecture, and sustainable principles in a way that feels both rooted and forward-looking,” added Farah.\nDesertBoard is now inviting collaboration with Saudi contractors, developers, and government entities seeking to adopt sustainable materials aligned with national development goals. Live demonstrations, technical samples, and expert briefings will be available throughout the Saudi Wood Expo, taking place from September 1 to 3, 2025, at the Riyadh International Convention & Exhibition Centre.\nVisit DesertBoard at Booth 1B100, Hall 1, 2nd row, at the Riyadh International Convention & Exhibition Center from 1–3 September 2025.\nAbout DesertBoard UAE DesertBoard UAE is dedicated to pioneering sustainable building materials that meet modern construction demands while minimising environmental impact.

What's significant is the tremendous cash position and 11 quarters of net selling. However, he and his team have found what to buy these days as well.\nThere's a clear pattern in what interests Buffett today, and based on his buying activity, I think Walmart(NYSE: WMT) would fit right in.\nNot Walmart's first rodeo\nBuffett actually did own Walmart for stock for about 13 years, from 2005 through 2018. It was one of Berkshire Hathaway's largest holdings at first, but he began selling it off in 2015, and he exited the position in 2018.\nAt the time, he praised Walmart, calling it \"a fabulous company,\" but he seemed to be worried about retail in light of Amazon's success with e-commerce. In fact, Berkshire Hathaway bought Amazon stock right after that, in 2019.\nHe wasn't wrong. Walmart was late to the e-commerce party, and it took time for the retail giant to really get into it. However, it's getting stronger and stronger, and e-commerce sales growth accelerated to 25% year over year in the 2025 fiscal second quarter (ended Aug. 1).\nHowever, since January 2019, somewhere in the middle of the Walmart stock sale and Amazon stock purchase, Walmart has outperformed Amazon.\nCutting the flowers\nDid Buffett make a mistake? He noted several years ago, \"Just as Walmart was once totally underestimated by the seers of its time, the idea some guy in Bentonville, Arkansas, would take them to the cleaners, that was the situation at first with traditional retailers, and Amazon. You want to be underestimated at first.\"\nIt seems like Buffett underestimated Walmart himself when he sold out of it. He has made the mistake that many investors say is their biggest: selling winners too soon. When he made his famous quote about his favorite holding time being \"forever,\" he referenced Peter Lynch as likening \"such behavior\" to holding on to losers in the hopes of a turnaround while selling winners \"to cutting the flowers and watering the weeds.\"\nBut there's a way back.\nFitting the Buffett model\nThere are specific criteria Buffett always talks about in a great stock: excellent management, an important role in the economy, commitment to shareholder value, and not needing to spend a lot of money to make a lot of money.\nInvestors often think of him as a value investor, but his focus is more on the underlying business than getting a bargain. He says he looks for \"a sensible price tag.\"\nThese days, there are some themes in the companies his team is choosing to invest in. One obvious feature is that they are predominantly, or even entirely, leaders in their fields. Consider Pool Corp, Domino's Pizza, and UnitedHealth Group. These are literally the largest companies in their respective industries.\nAnd while UnitedHealth looks like the kind of rare bargain opportunity Buffett pounces on, the others weren't necessarily so cheap when Buffett bought them. Consider their forward, one-year P\/E ratios and price-to-sales ratios.\nWhy Walmart today?\nHere's how Walmart fits in today. It's the largest retailer in the world, and despite slowing growth and the threat of Amazon, it has retained its status. Not only that, but it has the advantage of 4,600 domestic stores to use as distribution hubs, something Amazon can't match. Store deliveries increased 50% over last year in the second quarter, and they were fast -- a third were delivered in under three hours.\nWalmart is flexing its retail muscle, and it's absorbing some of the impact of tariffs so that it can still offer great value to its customers. Smaller outfits can't do that, at least to the extent Walmart can. Walmart is also a Dividend King, and it has raised its dividend for the past 52 years. That's commitment to creating shareholder value.\nFinally, if Buffett is beefing up positions in industry leaders while saving money for opportunities at a later point, it seems like he expects these stalwarts to manage through the dips and corrections that make those opportunities possible, anchoring the portfolio and minimizing potential losses.\nWith its essential products and discount prices, Walmart can gain market share in challenging times, and it shouldn't be underestimated again.\nShould you buy stock in Walmart right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walmart wasn’t one of them.

But that fear doesn’t reflect reality.\nAustin Hankwitz — a leading financial educator and content creator, known for his “Rate of Return” newsletter and his top-ranked Spotify podcast “Rich Habits” — wants you to know that successful investing doesn’t feel like a high-octane thriller. It can feel slow, methodical, and even a little, well, delightfully boring.\nAs part of GOBankingRates’ Top 100 Money Experts series, Hankwitz sat down with us to share why you don’t need a lot of money or a daredevil spirit to start investing — you just need a little common sense and a willingness to try.\nDon’t Make Things Harder Than They Have To Be\nIt’s all too easy to overthink financial decisions. The stakes feel incredibly high. But Hankwitz wants beginners to relax, take a breath, and start with some very simple math: How much can you afford to invest on a consistent monthly basis?\n“We love to see people investing 15% of their monthly take-home pay, but if you’re not there yet, that’s fine too,” he said. “What matters most is getting started with what you can afford.”\nOnce you’ve figured out how much you can invest consistently, keep your strategy simple. Many investors begin with broad-market exposure through an ETF that tracks the S&P 500 — a collection of America’s 500 largest and most profitable public companies.\nWhile some pundits argue that you should wait for the perfect time to enter the market, Hankwitz has a different take: It’s not about timing the market — it’s about giving yourself more time in the market to let your assets grow. Consistency, not cleverness, is what builds wealth.\nDon’t Worry About Not Investing Big Bucks Right Away\nYou might assume that to invest properly, you’ve got to have thousands of dollars up front. That’s a myth. Even small contributions, made consistently over time, can compound into meaningful returns.\nTo build a strong foundation, start with a small, manageable amount — one that won’t impact other financial goals and obligations — and stick to a schedule.\n“The ‘right’ amount of money to start investing with is the amount of money you can afford right now,” Hankwitz said. “For some of you, that’s $10. For others, it’s $1,000. What matters more than the amount you invest in the beginning is building the habit of investing in the first place.”\nWhatever You Do, Don’t Panic\nFor those still concerned about getting into the market at the wrong time, Hankwitz has a simple mantra: “When in doubt, zoom out.”\nHe reminds readers that 2025 started as one of the worst-performing stock market years in recent history, only for things to rebound by midyear. As of this writing, the S&P 500 has posted double-digit gains, with the Nasdaq-100 approaching 12% gains.\n“In the moment, every market-moving headline feels like the world is coming to an end — so you should sell your investments and run for the hills,” he said. “But the best-performing investors are those who stick to the plan and don’t get shaken out by volatility. The only people who get hurt on the rollercoaster are those who get off in the middle of the ride.”\nDiversify Wisely\n“Diversify” is a piece of advice new investors hear often — but rarely with the context to make it understandable and actionable. And sometimes, Hankwitz says, that vague advice can lead people astray.\nHe’s seen beginners with less than $100,000 invested spread themselves too thin: 30+ single stocks, a dozen ETFs, two dozen cryptocurrencies, some real estate, and maybe even precious metals.\nIf that sounds overwhelming, it is. And it’s not necessary.\n“There’s nothing wrong with diversifying your investments. However, in the beginning what’s most important is getting your first $100,000 invested into the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq-100,” he said. “Get six figures invested into broad market exposure that has historically trended higher over time. Once you’ve ‘built your base’ of $100,000, then you can start getting ‘fancy.'”\nBottom Line\nInvesting for the first time doesn’t have to be scary. With patience, realistic expectations and a focus on building good habits rather than chasing big wins, you can be more successful than you thought.\nThis article is part of GOBankingRates’ Top 100 Money Experts series, where we spotlight expert answers to the biggest financial questions Americans are asking.

(NYSE: CCL). The forced shutdown of the cruise industry during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the company losing its only significant revenue source for over a year. Even when Carnival ships could sail again, relaunching its ships and drawing back its customer base was a years-long process.\nToday, the environment is different. Not only are its ships full, but also, demand is such that it has had to build additional cruise ships. Amid that recovery, Carnival's stock price saw massive gains.\nThe question now for investors is whether they can still benefit from buying the stock, or have they missed the boat on significant gains?\nThe state of Carnival\nThe good news for Carnival Cruise Lines investors is that it remains the industry leader. Although numerous companies compete in this industry, Carnival and its multiple cruise brands (including Costa Cruises, Cunard Line, Holland America Line, and Princess Cruises) account for 42% of the industry's passenger count, according to Cruise Market Watch.\nMoreover, even though the state of the economy is uncertain, it is filling these ships. In the first six months of fiscal 2025 (ended May 31), the occupancy percentage stood at 104% (the industry defines 100% occupancy as two people in every cabin). This is critical, as it shows that concerns about an economic slowdown have not dampened demand for cruise vacations.\nAdditionally, bookings for 2026 match record levels. This means it is filling its cabins without having to offer as many discounts, thereby bolstering its top and bottom lines. With that, it is working to increase its capacity, planning for the launch of the Carnival Festivale in 2027 and the Carnival Tropicale in 2028.\nCarnival's financials\nAmid those improvements, revenue increased by 9% year over year to $12 billion for the first half of fiscal 2025. In contrast, Carnival limited cost and expense growth to 3%. Thus, the $486 million in net income for the first two quarters of 2025 was well above the $123 million loss in the same year-ago period.\nFurthermore, this occurred despite a $718 million interest expense for the period. The high interest costs are due to the aforementioned pandemic shutdown, which led the company to incur massive debts to stay in business. Despite efforts to pay it down, total debt stands at just over $27 billion, a heavy burden considering the $10 billion in book value.\nNonetheless, Carnival paid off $2 billion in debt over the last year. Since it has only about $2.1 billion due through the end of 2026, the company may be able to retire that debt without refinancing at higher interest rates. Moreover, since it refinanced $7 billion in debt over the past year at lower rates, it has created a virtuous cycle of lower debt and lower interest payments. Since it benefits from those improving finances and full ships, Carnival's stock price is up over 90% in the last 12 months.\nAdditionally, the stock trades at a P\/E ratio of 17, making it a less expensive stock than Royal Caribbean, fast-growing Viking Holdings, and even Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, which had expressed some concerns about its business earlier this year. That could mean its stock rally continues as full ships, an expanding fleet, and a falling debt burden keep Carnival sailing in smooth waters.\nIs it time to buy Carnival stock?\nGiven its current state, Carnival stock is a likely buy.\nAdmittedly, the stock has risen significantly, and the debt burden remains massive. Its fortunes could also turn negative if an uncertain economy leads to fewer bookings and an increased need to offer discounts.\nFortunately, the economy has not stopped Carnival from achieving record bookings. This indicates that the company has navigated past its struggles from the pandemic. It can also expand its fleet -- and likely its revenue and profits -- even as it services its considerable debts.\nDespite such attributes, the stock sells at a low valuation despite a significant increase. That indicates Carnival stock is likely not done rising, and investors still have time to benefit from Carnival's improved business and financial conditions.\nShould you buy stock in Carnival Corp. right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Carnival Corp., consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Carnival Corp. wasn’t one of them.

Pfizer","published_at":"2025-08-31T12:00:00.000Z","source_id":"gdelt_finance_yahoo_com","source_name":"finance.yahoo.com via GDELT","crawl_method":"gdelt","language":"en","paywall":false,"text":"Dividend stocks are a great way for investors to generate passive income that can be more reliable and predictable than investing in stocks for pure appreciation. While there are no guarantees in the stock market, investors who carefully analyze a company's cash flows and earnings should be able to get a pretty good idea of whether a company can keep paying its dividend, and if it is poised to gradually increase its quarterly dividend each year.\nBoth Realty Income(NYSE: O) and Pfizer(NYSE: PFE) are two companies with high-yielding dividends and that have paid dividends for many years. Let's take a look at each and see which one is the better dividend stock to own.\nPfizer: 6.90%\nThe large pharmaceutical companyPfizer(NYSE: PFE) is best known for its role during the pandemic when it helped produce vaccines to immunize people from COVID-19. During those years, the company and stock performed extraordinarily well. But in recent years, investors have been somewhat concerned about the company's future. The stock is down more than 30% during the past five years.\nPfizer acquired Seagen in late 2023 and has turned its attention to cancer treatment, promising to deliver several big drugs by 2030. The acquisition of Seagen and other smaller acquisitions are expected to increase annual revenue by $20 billion by 2030. However, over the next few years, several of Pfizer's big patents will expire, which management thinks could lower revenue by $17 billion to $18 billion between 2026 and 2028.\nSo where does the dividend stand? Well Pfizer has a pretty solid track record. The company has paid a dividend for 345 consecutive quarters and raised its dividend for the past 16 years. During the past year, Pfizer had a free cash flow yield of 8.75%, so it's able to cover the dividend yield right now. Through the first six months of the year, Pfizer's dividend payouts are equivalent to about 83% of earnings and half of its adjusted earnings.\nRealty Income: 5.50%\nKnown as \"The Monthly Dividend Company,\" Realty Income(NYSE: O) is a real estate investment trust (REIT). REITs are a type of corporate structure that avoids paying corporate taxes so long as they pay out 90% of taxable income through dividends and follow other conditions such as investing in and deriving significant income from real estate.\nRealty Income is a triple net lease operator, meaning it leases properties to tenants who are responsible for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. This is a good deal for Realty Income because it requires less work on its part, while tenants may be able to negotiate multi-year leases and lower rents for taking on the added responsibilities. Realty Income focuses on non-discretionary, low price point, and service-oriented customers like convenience and grocery stores, home improvement, and quick service restaurants. The company is also expanding in faster-growth sectors like gaming and data centers.\nThe dividend has been an area of strength for Realty Income. The company has paid monthly dividends for 30 consecutive years and had a 4.2% annual dividend growth rate in that time span. Realty Income also appears to be managing its dividend well. Through the first six months of the year, adjusted funds from operations (AFFO), which is essentially like free cash flow for a REIT, came in at $2.11, while dividend payouts per share were about $1.60.\nWhich is the better ultra high-yield dividend?\nBoth of these companies have high-yielding dividends and are poised to continue to pay and increase their dividends. However, I find Realty Income's to be more reliable right now, even if it doesn't yield as much as Pfizer's. Realty Income has a good operating model, a great track record on the dividend front, and looks like it can easily cover the dividend.\nAgain, I find Pfizer intriguing, but I think there is some uncertainty when you consider the patents that will expire. The potential $20 billion increase to annual revenue by 2030 is of course compelling, but if something were to go wrong, that could potentially affect the dividend, which is why more confidence behind the company's drug and revenue pipeline is needed for me to pick Pfizer over Realty Income.\nShould you buy stock in Realty Income right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Realty Income wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $664,110!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,104,355!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,069% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 186% for the S&P 500.

It was recently announced that the company will lay off nearly 1,000 corporate employees, citing plans to redirect some of its savings.\nOn the other hand, the company’s dividend remains stable and continues to grow. It is set to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share on Sept. 1, which is an increase over the previous quarterly rate of $0.32 per share. Its forward annual dividend of $1.40 yields 2.06% on current prices.\nAs KR stock comes down from its highs, should you consider investing in Kroger’s dip?\nAbout KR Stock\nKroger, founded in 1883 and headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, is one of the largest retail companies in the U.S. Operating thousands of supermarkets, multi-department stores, and convenience stores across the country, Kroger serves millions of customers each day.\nIts operations encompass a diverse range of retail formats, including traditional grocery stores and marketplace stores that offer a broad selection of general merchandise, apparel, and home goods.\nKroger also owns numerous private-label brands and operates its own manufacturing facilities for food products, enhancing supply chain efficiency and product consistency. In addition to in-store shopping, the company has expanded its digital presence with online ordering, curbside pickup, and home delivery services. The company has a market capitalization of $44.93 billion.\nOver the past 52 weeks, KR stock has gained 26.7%, while it has been up 10.3% year-to-date (YTD). The company’s shares reached a 52-week high of $74.90 on Aug. 11, but are down 9.8% from this high. Over the past five days, the stock has been down by 3%.\nThe company’s stock is currently trading cheap, with its price sitting at 18.69 times earnings, which is lower than the industry average of 22.79 times.\nKroger Reported Mixed Q1 Results\nOn June 20, Kroger reported its first-quarter results for fiscal 2025 (the quarter that ended on May 24). In that, the company reported a marginal year-over-year (YoY) drop in its sales to $45.12 billion. This figure fell short of the $45.38 billion that Wall Street analysts had predicted Kroger would report.\nOn the other hand, the company’s gross margin was 23%, compared to 22% for the same period in the previous year. The sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy primarily drove this margin expansion. However, the effect was offset by growth in pharmacy sales, which carry lower margins. Its adjusted EPS increased from $1.43 in Q1 FY2024 to $1.49 in Q1 FY2025. This was also higher than the $1.45 that Wall Street analysts were expecting.\nDuring the first quarter, Kroger reported a $100 million impairment charge related to its decision to close approximately 60 stores within the next 18 months. The company anticipates a slight financial gain from these closures. However, instead of retaining the savings, Kroger plans to reinvest them in improving the overall customer experience. For the fiscal year 2025, Kroger expects its adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.60 to $4.80.\nWall Street analysts are optimistic about Kroger’s future earnings. They expect the company’s EPS to climb by 7.5% YoY to $1.00 for Q2 FY2025 (which is set to be reported on Sep. 11). For the current fiscal year, EPS is projected to surge 6.5% annually to $4.76, followed by a 10.1% growth to $5.24 in the next fiscal year.\nWhat Do Analysts Think About Kroger Stock?\nAnalysts are still optimistic about Kroger’s stock. Analysts at Roth Capital raised the KR's stock price target from $58 to $66, while maintaining a “Neutral” rating on its shares. Roth Capital analysts posit that while the outlook is sound, inflation pass-throughs remain a headwind. Analysts at Evercore ISI are soundly bullish. Evercore analyst Michael Montani maintained a “Buy” rating on the stock, with a price target of $82.\nAnalysts at J.P. Morgan changed KR’s rating from “Overweight” to \"Neutral.\" J.P. Morgan analyst Thomas Palmer also cut the price target from $82 to $75, based on current market analysis.\nKR stock is still popular on Wall Street, with analysts awarding it a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating overall. Of the 21 analysts rating the stock, 10 analysts have rated it a “Strong Buy,” while 11 analysts are playing it safe with a “Hold” rating. The consensus price target of $77.26 represents a 13.7% upside from current levels. However, the Street-high price target of $85 indicates a 25% upside.\nWhile some tepid sentiments persist regarding the layoffs and closure of some of its stores, Kroger’s dividend and growing margins still appear attractive. Hence, investors might consider investing in it for the long term.\nOn the date of publication, Anushka Dutta did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

By midafternoon, the tins of matcha powder on her shelves are sold out, while a steady stream of mostly overseas customers is waiting to try her latest green concoctions.\nHer store, Atelier Matcha, is one of the lucky ones. Although matcha supplies are running low even in Japan due to a global craze, a partnership Nagao cultivated with Yamamasa Koyamaen, a tea producer in Kyoto, is paying off.\n\"When I heard that all their tea was sitting unsold in a warehouse during Covid, I wanted to do something,\" Nagao said. Four years later, she has two stores in Japan, one in Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City, and a new outlet that will soon open in Cebu City, Philippines.\nJapan has been consuming matcha since the 12th century, mostly in highly ritualized tea ceremonies that require only a speck of powder. Demand skyrocketed in recent years as matcha's reputation as an antioxidant-packed superfood spread over TikTok. A post-pandemic tourism boom has also pushed prices higher.\nAccording to Japan's Ministry of Finance, Japan exported 36.4 billion yen ($247 million) of green tea last year, four times more than a decade ago. Some 44% was bound for the U.S., mostly in powdered form, like matcha.\nIn an effort to address the strain on Japan's aging farming communities, the Japanese government is considering subsidizing farmers to encourage them to dedicate more fields to tencha, the type of tea used to make matcha.\nTencha yields are more lucrative but also more labor-intensive, as the buds need to be shielded from the sun to bring out their distinctive grassy flavor. There are not enough hands to harvest, steam and dry the leaves before milling them into powder, producers say.\nShops ration supply\nTencha prices at this spring auction in Kyoto jumped 170% from the year before to 8,235 yen per kilogram, the Global Japanese Tea Association said. That shattered the previous record of 4,862 yen per kilogram, set in 2016.\nMany retailers have also reported that matcha prices have doubled in the last year, and finding a small tin of the powder has become increasingly difficult, even in Tokyo.\nShops are placing purchase limits to make their stock last longer, discourage hoarding and fend off unauthorized resellers. However, matcha remains a popular souvenir for the record number of tourists visiting Japan.\nMany online stores sold out months ago as U.S. buyers rushed to stock up ahead of expected tariffs.\nKaminari Issa, which sells everything from matcha beer to matcha cream puffs at its four stores in Tokyo's Asakusa district, said receiving an email request for a ton of matcha is not unusual.\n\"We're happy,\" said Miku Sugawara, who manages one of the stores. \"But there's only so much we can sell.\"\nHer shop sells matcha milled from the very first harvest of the season, when the tea leaves are tender, which is considered the highest quality.\nLike many others in the trade, Sugawara worries that this summer's record heatwave could lower next year's tea harvest and push prices even higher.\nMatcha boom meets bottleneck\nCompetition to source and produce enough matcha is so intense that it forced Ito En, the world's largest seller of bottled green tea, to create a dedicated division in May.\nThe company forecasts group overseas sales to rise 11% this year and is raising prices by 50% to 100% on several products from September in the face of higher raw material and labor costs.\nIto En has dedicated contracts with farmers that supply it with 7,000 tons of regular green tea each year, but only about 600 tons of tencha.\nConvincing farmers to grow more tencha has been a challenge because many worry the current boom may wane, Ito En said.\n\"Matcha's popularity has been incredible. Our own factories and all our contractors are jam-packed,\" said Yasutaka Yokomichi, the manager of Ito En's new matcha division.\nHe said one of his priorities is to secure enough mills to grind the tencha leaves into powder and package it, which may include fresh investments to expand Ito En's own facilities. It can take one hour to mill just 40 grams of matcha, as the heat resulting from a faster process could degrade its quality.\nAtelier Matcha's Nagao said that educating consumers about the different grades of matcha may be the only viable option.\nAs a devotee of sado, or \"the way of tea,\" premium-grade powder isn't necessary to make a good matcha açai bowl, she said. As an entrepreneur, she also has her sights set on the next big thing.\n\"Hojicha,\" Nagao says, referring to another kind of tea with a nuttier profile and less caffeine. \"Look, I only have one left today.\"\nCorrection: This article has been updated to correct the company that Chitose Nagao is partnering with.","content_hash":"23ae562a28ae8d7416835bc0bc0afedc","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4863,"method_rank":0}

Sooknanan issued a temporary restraining order halting removal of the children, ages 10-17, for 14 days.\nSooknanan expanded the order to include any Guatemalan unaccompanied minors in the custody of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The complaint said this group could number hundreds of children.\nSooknanan told government attorneys to confirm by Sunday afternoon that the children had been removed from the planes. On Sunday evening, the judge said the government had not done so and ordered the government to explain why it had missed the deadline.\nPresident Donald Trump, a Republican, launched an immigration crackdown after returning to the White House in January, including an effort to track down and deport unaccompanied migrant children.\nHis administration struck an agreement with Guatemala that would allow unaccompanied children to be sent back to the country and planned to start deportations this weekend, one current and two former U.S. officials told Reuters. The plans were first reported by CNN on Friday.\nMigrant children who arrive at U.S. borders without a parent or guardian are classified as unaccompanied and sent to federal government-run shelters until they can be placed with a family member or foster home, a process outlined in federal law.\nGuatemalan President Bernardo Arevalo said in July that his government was working with the U.S. to repatriate unaccompanied children.\nDuring the emergency hearing on Sunday, Sooknanan pressed the Department of Justice for assurances that Guatemalan children had not been deported already.\n\"We're here to try to figure out as quickly as we can what is happening,\" said Sooknanan, an appointee of Trump's Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden.\nJustice Department attorney Drew Ensign said no children had been removed but that some had been loaded onto planes. Ensign said he believed one plane may have taken off but later returned under the judge's order.\nAn attorney with the National Immigration Law Center, Efren Olivares, told the judge that some children still appeared to be aboard planes in Harlingen and El Paso, Texas. Ensign said they would be moved back to HHS shelters.\nEnsign said all of the children's parents or guardians in Guatemala had requested their return via the Guatemalan government, although Olivares contested that.\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller criticized Sooknanan for blocking the deportations.\n\"The minors have all self-reported that their parents are back home in Guatemala,\" Miller wrote on X. \"But a Democrat judge is refusing to let them reunify with their parents.\"\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security, ICE's parent agency, and HHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Guatemala's foreign ministry declined to comment.\n'Clear violation'\nWithin the HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement, which cares for unaccompanied children until they can be placed with U.S. sponsors, signs of the new deportation effort emerged last week.\nMelissa Johnston, director of the HHS' unaccompanied children program, sent an email to staff prohibiting the U.S. release of Guatemalan children in federal custody except for those sponsored by parents or legal guardians in the country, according to a copy reviewed by Reuters.\nIn their complaint on Sunday, the National Immigration Law Center and Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights said the deportations would be a \"clear violation of the unambiguous protections that Congress has provided them as vulnerable children.\"\nThe complaint said that in Guatemala, the children \"may face abuse, neglect, persecution, or even torture, against their best interests.\"\nAmong the plaintiffs was a 10-year-old indigenous Guatemalan girl whose mother had died and who had suffered abuse and neglect from other caretakers, the complaint said. The girl was detained at a U.S. government shelter in South Texas, the complaint said.\nSeveral of the 10 plaintiffs had expressed fear of returning to Guatemala, the complaint said. The children have been in shelters or foster care in California, Texas, Pennsylvania and New York, it said.","content_hash":"d9a78be6630881c781e881e529cfa239","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4863,"method_rank":0}

During that time, they’ve raised my premiums 356%. It’s now $12,000 a year with no end in sight for future increases. The max they will pay at this point is about $750,000 over 5 years.\nI need to cut the cord with them and I’m sure they would also be delighted if I did. My adviser, who suggested this policy 15 years ago, is not too helpful (that’s another problem). They will give me a benefit equivalent to what I’ve paid into it over the past 15 years ($66,000) if I cancel now.\nI’m now over 70 and a widow, so this is something I need for peace of mind. I’ve been talking to an insurance broker who is suggesting a long-term-care\/life-insurance hybrid policy, which pays $365,000 paid over a 10-year period.\nYes, I would have to go through a medical approvals process for a new policy. Luckily, I’m pretty healthy. I don’t think there’s a chance of me ever qualifying for Medicaid. I don’t have anyone to bounce ideas off of right now. What should I do?\nIt’s kind of a lose-lose situation. Whether I keep my policy or self-fund my long-term care, what if I become cognitively impaired and need benefits for 15-20 years? Jeesh, no wonder my blood pressure is sky-high; at least it was at the doctor’s office today.\nIf you have paid $66,000 into this policy over the last 15 years, and the insurance company is willing to give you that back by canceling the policy now, it’s not so much a lose-lose as a return on your investment.\nGiven that you are in good health, in your 70s, there’s no guarantee that you will require long-term care, although being a widow, and with no mention of children, I understand that you are concerned about your future if and\/or when you become unable to live independently.\nFor that reason, I’m not sure a long-term-care\/life-insurance policy hybrid would be the answer. I can’t help feeling that your financial adviser talked you into the original policy, and now a broker is talking you into a new one. That’s their job, for better or for worse.\nA quick recap: Long-term-care insurance effectively doubles between your 60s and 70s. Most women at age 70 can expect to pay a premium of $662 a month (compared with $966 for someone 75 years old), according to this guide from SmartAsset.\nThe value of switching\nIt’s more expensive for women due to their longer life expectancy (it costs around $524 for a 65-year-old single woman versus $313 for a 65-year-old man). Medicare does not cover long-term-care insurance, and you don’t qualify for Medicaid.\nIf you do switch to a long-term-care and life-insurance hybrid policy, you will end up paying much more than what you are paying now. The death benefit may not be as advantageous to you as a widow with — I’m assuming you didn’t mention any — no children..\nIt’s hard to make a call on your behalf without a more detailed view of your finances. For that reason, I suggest you enlist independent third-party help: a fee-only fiduciary who can give you a bird’s eye view of your finances without the incentive to sell you another policy.\nThis may or may not help, but you are one of millions of people who face this same dilemma: how to fund a long-term-care situation, given that a room in a nursing home could cost $100,000 a year, or more in a high-cost-of-living metropolitan area.\nIf you do cancel this current policy because of the unpredictable and constant increases in your monthly premium along with the pressure on your monthly expenses, plan now for what you should do in a worst-case scenario.\nOther options for you include high-yield savings accounts, deferred long-term care annuities, and\/or a home equity conversion mortgage, a form of reverse mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration (you must be 62 and have a low or no mortgage balance).\nHealth takes priority\nOn a separate note, I’m not a doctor, a broker, a financial adviser, a lawyer or even a candlestick maker, but I would gently advise you to keep an eye on your blood pressure and have it checked again in a few weeks.\nYou may need medication to keep it under control and blood tests should give you an indication of whether there are any problems that could slow you down (such as high cholesterol) or lifestyle factors like stress, anxiety, lack of sleep or exercise, or genetics.\nNone of us wants to fiddle with our finances while neglecting our health. It’s so easily done when we’re thinking about external factors like retirement, housing, work and — last but not least — money.\nA vigilant Moneyist reader is, hopefully, a healthy Moneyist reader. Let’s hope that, in five years, we can talk again about a completely different situation (or the same one, if the fancy takes you). Long-term-care insurance is a good idea, but it’s also a balancing act.\nEnjoy the good years, in the meantime, while you have them.","content_hash":"8c2e0a2ac3db0fa512197b31f31239b9","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4847,"method_rank":0}

She also founded a venture capital firm, Backend Ventures, in 2019, which invests in early-stage tech startups.\nGuo's roots go back to Fremont, California, where she grew up with Chinese immigrant parents.\n\"I think my parents always emphasized the importance of education and money, so on the education side, I was definitely forced to have good academics. They threw me into Abacus competitions,\" Guo told CNBC Make It.\nThis led to her studying computer science and human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon University, but she dropped out after two years, to the dismay of her education-minded parents. She only had one year left to complete her degree.\n\"They [parents] sacrificed everything to immigrate from China to America to give their kids a better future, and because education gave them everything that they have in life, for their kids to suddenly let go of their education when they were almost done was like a slap in the face,\" she said.\nGuo instead decided to pursue the Thiel Fellowship, a program launched by the billionaire co-founder of PayPal, Peter Thiel, which offers young people $200,000 to build innovative companies.\n\"I think they [parents] viewed that as a sign that I didn't love them, and they weren't very happy with it, when it was just me making a bet on myself and choosing to optimize for what I thought would be a better future for myself.\"\nMaking money on the playground\nBecoming an entrepreneur was a natural path for Guo, who was already hustling in elementary school and searching for ways to make money. Her parents led 'a very frugal life,' she said.\n\"But they always emphasized that having money is important, so I would find ways to make money on the playground,\" Guo said. \"I would up trade Pokémon cards and then sell them. I would sell colored pencils, anything I could find.\"\nGuo's parents were strict and took her cash away if she wasn't behaving. So, in second grade, Guo went to Home Depot and got a debit card, opening a PayPal account to store her cash.\nHer money-making endeavors progressed as the years went on. A fan of the Neopets game, she took to forums to sell virtual Neopet creatures and in-game Neopoints currency.\n\"I would get rare pets, rare items, and resell them for actual cash,\" she said.\nWhen she discovered engineering and coding, she started making bots to cheat in a game and sell them.\n\"I then started finding other ways to make money on the internet from making websites using Google AdSense, then creating internet marketing tools...it just snowballed from there.\"\n'Only fun I could have was on a computer'\nGuo said that her success developed from a passion for video games, which fostered an interest in computer science.\n\"I think I'm a pretty social person, but because I wasn't really cool or allowed to be social, I pretty much spent all my time on computers growing up,\" Guo said. \"The only fun I could have was on a computer.\"\nShe said kids who spend time playing video games generally try to figure out how to be better at the game.\n\"Video games are why a lot of these students study computer science...the same happened for me, where I was like, 'How do I create my own game? How do I be[come] better at this game?'\"\nShe added: \"I think that if I were more cool in school and I was allowed to have sleepovers and allowed to hang out with friends and allowed to play sports, things would look different.\"\nGuo's entrepreneurial spirit instead brought her among Forbes' ranks of billionaires — although some of her ventures have drawn scrutiny.\nRecently, a class action lawsuit was brought against Guo and her company, Passes, claiming that she allegedly distributed child sexual abuse material on the platform to paying subscribers.\n\"As explained in the motion to dismiss filed on April 28, Ms. Guo and Passes categorically reject the baseless allegations made against them in the lawsuit, which was only filed against them after they rejected a $15 million payment demand,\" a spokesperson for Passes said in a statement.\nClark Smith Villazor, the New York-based litigation firm that filed the lawsuit against Passes, has yet to respond to CNBC's request for comment.","content_hash":"d0e0ac7b1a3cfe52ed64b479287352ad","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4676,"method_rank":0}

Portfolio managers at Lazard Asset Management are finding opportunities in several European and Asian banks, chipmakers and global gold miners. Investors this year have been diversifying their portfolios and rotating into international stocks as a hedge against volatility, geopolitical headwinds and risks tied to high U.S. valuations and a weaker dollar. The iShares MSCI ACWI ex US ETF has returned nearly 23% this year, more than double the 11% return in the SPDR S & P 500 ETF. CNBC spoke to a quantitative portfolio manager at Lazard Asset Management who has been active in international investing for nearly two decades. Paul Moghtader, managing director of the Lazard Advantage Team, is at the helm of the recently launched Lazard International Dynamic Equity ETF . The $422-million ETF, rated five stars at Morningstar, has an expense ratio of 0.40% and converted in May from the open-ended Lazard International Equity Advantage mutual fund. \"Markets are increasingly volatile and risky. We're seeing risk injected from many different sources, and an international exposure is getting more attractive relative to U.S. for many reasons, including the valuation, more shareholder focus,\" Moghtader told CNBC. Four categories Moghtader said the firm looks at stocks through four lenses to find those that have both a growth and a value tilt: valuation, growth, quality and sentiment. Specific signals range from a stock's price-to-earnings ratio to how the company is investing for growth to the stability of its balance sheet. One filter Lazard recently incorporated into its screening process looks at the beta of a stock relative to GDP growth, which Moghtader said helps tag the risk or opportunity in an individual stock to the macroeconomic environment. \"We have all these signals that tell us what stocks are attractive, and what we do is then combine this to build a portfolio that from a risk perspective ... things like country, industry, beta, market cap, all of those, we like to control relative to the benchmark,\" he said. Top holdings in the ETF, which trades under the ticker \"IEQ,\" include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , BNP Paribas , Novartis , Tencent Holdings and Samsung Electronics . Given the fund's quantitative stock selection process, the ETF includes stocks that match themes Lazard's proprietary models find attractive, such as Canadian gold miners and European financials. Overweight European financials For example, the ETF is overweight French bank BNP, Japan Post Bank , Novartis and State Bank of India compared to its benchmark MSCI ACWI ex-US Index. London-based Barclays and France's Societe Generale are other attractive financials in the ETF, Moghtader said. BNP, the second-largest stock in the portfolio after Taiwan Semi, at a little more 2%, displays \"very attractive growth in quality with reasonably attractive sentiment and value,\" Moghtader said. The bank has made notable investments to grow, he added, citing BNP's acquisition of AXA Investment Managers completed on June 30 that made the French bank the fifth-largest asset manager in Europe. BNP shares are up nearly 30% year to date in local currency terms. Other financials in the ETF have also outperformed. Shares of Societe General have almost doubled, rising 94% this year, while Barclays has jumped 34%. Japan Post is up 25. Societe General's robust gains were helped by strong second-quarter results, which saw a rebound in retail earnings that led the bank to raise its annual profit target. European banks have benefited from a rotation into undervalued financials, with bank stocks trading at lower valuations and paying above-average dividends. SCGLY 1Y mountain U.S.-listed shares of Societe General over the past year. Moghtader is also bullish on Canadian gold miners, which make up roughly 1% of the holdings in IEQ and include Barrick Mining , Kinross Gold and Torex Gold . Barrick shares in the U.S. have climbed 72% this year, while Kinross has soared 125%. The portfolio manager said Lazard has moved away from some software positions over the last month, reasoning that software development has become easier with the advent of artificial intelligence. The firm sold software stocks AppLovin , Gartner and Cadence Design Systems in August, and recently bought shares of Amphenol , Erickson , Western Digital and NetGear . Lazard as a whole managed roughly $231 billion in client assets as of April 30.","content_hash":"f53febe854a73b61f5de0b94cb8afe62","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4528,"method_rank":0}

Goodman and the 19-year-old suffered \"non-life-threatening injuries\" and were taken to hospitals for treatment, the agency added.\nState police said they are investigating the crash and no charges have been filed.\nGiuliani, President Donald Trump's former campaign lawyer, was taken to a nearby trauma center and diagnosed with a fractured thoracic vertebrae, multiple lacerations and contusions, and injuries to his left arm and lower leg, the statement said.\n\"He sustained injuries but is in good spirits and recovering tremendously,\" Ragusa said.\nState police said troopers were investigating a domestic violence report on the southbound Interstate 93 highway shortly before 10 p.m. ET and observed the crash, which occurred on the northbound lanes.

A coalition of major finance industry groups is calling for sweeping changes to upcoming banking regulations that they say would effectively lock traditional banks out of the booming cryptocurrency market.\nThe Battle Over Basel’s Crypto Standards\nAt the center of this dispute are new standards crafted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 2022, designed to govern how banks manage and disclose risks around cryptocurrency exposure. These rules, set to take effect in January , have drawn fierce criticism from industry heavyweights including the Global Financial Markets Association, the Institute of International Finance, and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.\nDon't Miss:\n-\nThe same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90\/share.\n-\nThey Sold Their Last Real Estate Company for Nearly $1B — Now They're Building the Future of U.S. Industrial Growth\nIn a strongly worded open letter to the committee, the groups argued that the proposed regulations are outdated and overly conservative, failing to account for how dramatically the crypto landscape has evolved since their creation.\n“The Cryptoasset Standard’s restrictive qualification standards, combined with otherwise punitive market and credit risk capital treatments, effectively make it uneconomical for banks to meaningfully participate in the cryptoasset market,” the letter stated.\nWhy This Matters for Crypto’s Future\nThe timing of this pushback is no coincidence. The cryptocurrency market has exploded in recent years, with digital asset prices reaching record highs and becoming increasingly integrated with traditional financial markets. While crypto remains a relatively small slice of the overall financial system, its rapid growth has caught the attention of institutional investors and major banks eager to capitalize on the trend.\nThe regulatory environment has also shifted dramatically, particularly in the U.S under President Donald Trump‘s pro-crypto administration. U.S. regulators have already made it easier for banks to engage in cryptocurrency-related activities this year, creating momentum for broader institutional adoption.\nTrending: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\nThe Stakes for Traditional Banking\nFor major banks, the current Basel standards represent a significant missed opportunity. The regulations would require such hefty capital reserves and risk management procedures that most institutions would find crypto operations unprofitable. This effectively sidelines some of the world’s largest financial institutions from a market that continues to grow and mature.","content_hash":"ea2171426cff94a6b4feceb92f8e1a09","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3092,"method_rank":0}

This investment will be the spark that helps business owners, especially our second-stage entrepreneurs, turn their dreams into sustainable, thriving realities,” MBBA President and CEO Charity Dean said, according to Crain’s Detroit Business.\n“These are the entrepreneurs who are ready to scale, hire, and expand their impact, and with this support, they will. We couldn’t be more excited to continue this journey together.”\nDean labels the Gilbert Family Foundation as “a pillar of support” that has been in place for a few years. The new investment surpasses the $1 million invested by the Foundation in 2023 as part of a wider 10-year pledge of $500 million with the Rocket Community Fund, aimed at strengthening Detroit neighborhoods.\nTo date, roughly $232 million has been committed.\nBefore that, in 2021, the Foundation assisted in the launch of Detroit’s Apple Developer Academy, a 10-month program created in partnership with tech conglomerate Apple and Michigan State University, at no cost. Recently, the program graduated over 125 students, equipping them with the real-world skills to excel in careers such as Swift coding, AI, UX design, marketing, and project management.\nRELATED CONTENT: Healing A Generation: The Intertwined Crisis Of Black Maternal Mental Health And Infant Well-Being","content_hash":"2f6495e091eaf82e4bf56c6a9562088d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3062,"method_rank":0}

Year to date, the stock has underperformed with a 23% loss.\nSalesforce did beat Wall Street estimates and show steady growth: Revenue climbed 9.7% year over year to $10.24 billion, slightly above analyst expectations for $10.13 billion. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.91 were also above estimates for earnings of $2.78 per share.\nFor the 2026 fiscal year, Salesforce initiated revenue guidance of $10.24 billion to $10.29 billion and raised the low end of its full-year revenue guidance, which now stands in a range of $41.1 billion to $41.3 billion. Both of those outlooks represent single-digit growth, which lags in comparison to other large-cap tech and AI players.\n“It’s not bad — no one is going to say these are bad numbers,” Jefferies senior analyst Brent Thill told Yahoo Finance in reaction to the results. “We’re just playing a relative game, where everyone else on a relative basis is way better.”\nThe cloud software provider also announced a $20 billion increase to its existing share buyback program, bringing the total to $50 billion.\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","content_hash":"1bf05900a46415256efe3ffacfb5c2e1","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3056,"method_rank":0}

Norfolk Southern Corporation (NASDAQ:NSC) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\nNorfolk Southern Corporation (NASDAQ:NSC)’s shares have been in the news lately due to its pending merger with railroad giant Union Pacific. Cramer’s co-host David Faber was the first to break the news of an impending merger in the railroad industry, but this news pushed Norfolk Southern Corporation (NASDAQ:NSC)’s shares down by 3% after it was officially confirmed. Overall, however, the shares have gained 19% which is in stark contrast to Union Pacific’s 2.7% drop. Cramer discussed a factor that might harm Norfolk Southern Corporation (NASDAQ:NSC)’s merger:\n“As Joe Hinrichs [CSX CEO] said to me last night on CSX, for the first time railroads are looking to work together. There is a up to a five day delay every time you get to Chicago because they don’t really, I mean we never really completed one. He’s saying you don’t need to merge, in order to make things more efficient. That would hurt the Norfolk Southern, Union Pacific merger.”\nPreviously, the CNBC TV host discussed Norfolk Southern Corporation (NASDAQ:NSC)’s merger with Union Pacific:\n“Well what’s incredible if you look at the actual rails, it makes so much sense. There’s so little overlap. You wanted East-West. It’s [inaudible] be great thing. There is tremendous congestion, where the two in the Midwest, in Chicago area, it’s so, I don’t see a lot of the overlap that would make you not like it. I think that, if you were a regulator in the previous regime, you might say, you know what, these two will never compete if we let them merge. So we can’t let them merge because now they won’t go against each other. But the fact is, they were never going to go against each other. That’s not, the rails, stop doing that years ago.\nCopyright: meinzahn \/ 123RF Stock Photo\n“This is a deal where you just would never have seen it. . .I think that they have a feeling that this one’s gonna go. Don’t matter what [inaudible] get it. And, I would argue that if you think there’s going to be big reindustrialization, Carl, you do want it. It makes sense to have this type of seamless rhythm. The rails are, look I think we all wish that we didn’t, that we had more rails in the country, they’re much cleaner, 400 miles to the diesel gallon. You could argue that other countries have them in a much more you, in a superb way, and we’re a little disjointed, This makes a lot of sense.”\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NSC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Then you have to keep track of the companies you've chosen to own to make sure that the reasons why you picked them continue to apply. However, dividend investors don't have to put in all of that work if they don't want to. All they have to do is buy the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEMKT: SCHD) and let this fairly complex fund do all the work for them. Here's what you need to know.\nWhat does the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF do?\nThe Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF is an index-tracking exchange-traded fund (ETF), so, technically, its managers don't actually do anything other than buy whatever stocks are included in the index it tracks: the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100. To understand the ETF, you really need to understand the index.\nThe Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 index starts its selection process by creating a list of stocks that have increased their dividends for at least 10 consecutive years. It removes real estate investment trusts (REITs) from that list to create a final pool from which to fish for investments. The real work here comes next, as the index creates a composite score for each stock in the selection pool.\nThe metrics that go into that composite score include the cash-flow-to-total-debt ratio, return on equity, dividend yield, and five-year dividend growth. The 100 companies with the highest scores get included in the index and the ETF, using a market-cap weighting methodology. The index's list of components is reviewed and updated annually.\nEach metric on that list serves a different purpose, but overall, the ultimate goal is to identify financially strong companies backed by well-run businesses. And, of course, the stocks that get selected for inclusion in the index also habitually reward their shareholders with generous and growing dividends. These are the types of features that most dividend investors would be looking for in a stock.\nIs the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF right for you?\nThere are clearly investors who won't find the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF appealing -- most notably, those who are only interested in growth or value investments. But for most other investors, there's a lot to like here, even though you can easily find ETFs with higher dividend yields than its roughly 3.9%. The most obvious benefit of buying it is that the fairly complex ETF is probably doing something similar to what you would do if you were to build your own portfolio of individual dividend stocks.","content_hash":"1256999d7a821db00e7cce135d4b9908","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2837,"method_rank":0}

As the best tool for building long-term wealth is time, the later you start, the bigger the mountain you’re going to have to climb – so there’s no time to lose.\nTry This: Here’s Why You Might Want To Invest Your Retirement Savings in a Roth 401(k)\nRead Next: 6 Big Shakeups Coming to Social Security in 2025\nBut this doesn’t mean that you can’t reach your goals, even if you start late. If you’re willing to do some heavy lifting, you may very well be able to catch up to where you should be. Just remember that the sooner you can start, the better.\nMax Out Your Retirement Contributions — Including Catch-Up Opportunities\nOne of the best ways to catch up on your savings is to boost your retirement plan contributions. Retirement plans offer a number of benefits that can help you reach your financial goals.\nIf you contribute to an IRA, you can usually take a tax deduction on the money you put in. With a 401(k), your contributions are made on a pre-tax basis. Meanwhile, your contributions and earnings grow tax-deferred until you withdraw them.\nIf you’re at least 50 years old, you can take advantage of catch-up contributions, one of the most beneficial features of retirement plans. For 2025, you can put an additional $1,000 into your IRA accounts, for a total maximum of $7,000. But the big opportunity comes with 401(k) plans, which allow catch-up contributions of $7,500 per year, for a total maximum contribution of $31,000.\nIf you’re able to sock away that amount of money, you can make up your retirement shortfall pretty quickly.\nBe Aware: I’m a Financial Expert — This Is the No. 1 Mistake Americans Make With Their 401(k)\nCut Your Spending\nAlthough there is a path to retirement prosperity even if you’re starting from behind, there’s no way around the fact that you’re going to have to make some sacrifices. If you plan to boost your retirement account contributions, for example, that money has to come from somewhere. In most cases, you’ll have to trim your expenses.\nDropping some of your streaming subscriptions, eating out less and cutting down on travel could save you thousands of dollars per year. Although your quality of life might temporarily suffer, it may be a sacrifice you may need to make to shore up your retirement security.\nDownsize\nIf you’re in your 40s or 50s and behind on your retirement savings, you might have an ace up your sleeve in the form of your home equity.\nImagine that you bought a home for $250,000 at age 30, for example.

The two government-sponsored enterprises provide stability and affordability in the housing market. However, the Trump administration has floated the idea of privatizing the enterprises. If that happens, it could change the cost and availability of your mortgage.\nSo, I asked ChatGPT to break down what borrowers like you should know if Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac goes public. Here’s what it said.\nCheck Out: 25 Places To Buy a Home If You Want It To Gain Value\nRead Next: 10 Cars That Outlast the Average Vehicle\nHousing Goals May Shift\nRight now, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac operate with affordable housing requirements set by the federal government. This mandate has helped expand access to homeownership for millions of Americans who might not otherwise qualify.\nAccording to ChatGPT, if the enterprises go public, those requirements could shrink or vanish altogether. Without government pressure to meet affordable housing benchmarks, the enterprises might choose to focus more on safer, higher-profit loans. That shift could mean fewer mortgage products for buyers with smaller down payments or lower credit scores.\nLearn More: Real Estate Agents Explain Why You Should Never Invest In These 7 Home Features\nLess Government Oversight\nSince the 2008 financial crisis, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have operated under strict government conservatorship. That oversight helps keep the mortgage market stable and prevent the kinds of risky lending that contributed to the housing crash.\nBut if the companies go public, shareholders would likely push for higher profits. That could mean tighter lending standards and higher fees, both of which could make mortgages more expensive or harder to get.\nHigher Fees and Reduced Access\nAnother potential shift involves the way mortgages are priced. Currently, the federal government’s involvement helps keep borrowing costs stable. Without the same level of federal backing, investors could demand higher returns on mortgage-backed securities. That cost would likely trickle down to borrowers in the form of higher interest rates and reduced access to credit for buyers with smaller down payments or less-than-perfect credit.\nThe Role of Tariffs and Global Capital\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac rely heavily on global investors to buy the mortgage-backed securities they issue. This international demand helps keep U.S. mortgage rates relatively low. If foreign demand weakens due to trade tensions or tariffs, mortgage rates in the U.S. could go up. That would affect borrowers directly, raising the cost of financing a home.","content_hash":"db698b411b967b7af1a3565d5f0bab40","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2797,"method_rank":0}

While profits actually went down, an acceleration of cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) revenue appear to be the most important data points.\nIn addition, the Wall Street Journal reported the Chinese tech giant has developed a new AI chip, which could take on importance since China recently issued an order discouraging the use of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) H20.\nAlibaba is becoming a top Chinese AI company\nIn its fiscal first quarter, Alibaba grew revenue just 2%, but revenue grew 10% outside of divestitures, which included the Sun Art and Intime businesses. Within that 10%, Alibaba's domestic e-commerce revenue grew 10%, international e-commerce grew 19%, and the cloud intelligence group accelerated to a 26% growth rate.\nOn the negative side, profits actually decreased, with adjusted non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) falling 11%. The company put big investments behind its Taobao Instant Commerce initiative, which aims to deliver packages within an hour, as well as associated marketing efforts. An overwhelming majority of Alibaba's business is still in a brutally competitive Chinese e-commerce industry, and at least in this quarter, we saw that competition in the form of lower margins.\nYet it appears the cloud revenue acceleration was exciting enough, especially as management noted that AI-related cloud revenue grew at a triple-digit rate for the eighth consecutive quarter.\nAI enthusiasm may have also been sparked by today's Wall Street Journal article highlighting Alibaba's new chipmaking efforts. Alibaba's prior efforts in this area had focused on application-specific chips, but the WSJ reported Alibaba's newest chip can achieve a broader range of AI inference tasks. Also embedded in the WSJ article is the fact that. unlike Huawei's AI chip, Alibaba's new chip will be software-compatible with Nvidia's, so developers won't have to reprogram their entire stack.\nAlibaba on the rebound?\nAlibaba has rebounded strongly off its lows of late 2022, more than doubling since then, but also sits about 63% below its all-time highs from late 2020. The stock trades for just 18 times earnings, which still seems cheap for a tech giant with an AI growth story.","content_hash":"bcef2cb4486d565bac45efec002de95c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2743,"method_rank":0}

If you’re nearing retirement age and have nothing to show for it, it can be extremely disheartening.\nFind Out: Avoid This Retirement Savings Mistake That’s Costing Americans Up To $300K\nRead Next: 8 Common Mistakes Retirees Make With Their Social Security Checks\nHowever, there are things you can do to prepare yourself for retirement with the time you have. These three are excellent places to start.\nAdjust Your Budget\nRetirement savings doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll need to make some changes to start building up some savings. If you already have a monthly budget, you’ll need to make some changes to it. If you don’t keep a monthly budget, you’ll need to start.\nThe best way to figure out where you can cut back is to track your spending for a month. Keep receipts and review your credit card bills to list all discretionary spending. When you have an idea of where your money is going, you can implement a budgeting strategy to help you put more toward savings. Here are some effective budgeting methods:\n-\n50\/30\/20 Budget: Put 50% of your income toward needs, 30% toward wants and 20% toward savings. Adjust these percentages as needed.\n-\nZero-Based Budget: Assign an expense to every single dollar of income at the beginning of the month and stick to your plan.\n-\nEnvelope Budget: Use envelopes and physical cash to sort out how much you can spend for each category. When the envelope is empty, you can’t spend on that category until the next month.\n-\nPay Yourself First Budget: Automate bank account transfers so that the day after you get a paycheck, set amounts go to savings and bills. You can then spend the rest of the money.\nWith a budget in place, you can funnel more money to savings accounts and invest it. This will accelerate your retirement savings.\nBe Aware: I’m a Financial Expert: This Is the No. 1 Mistake Americans Make With Their 401(k)\nOpen a Roth IRA\nRetirement funds like a Roth IRA and 401(k) allow you to save for retirement while getting tax breaks. While it’s true that the longer you have money invested, the more interest you’ll earn over time, it’s better to start late than never at all.\nRoth IRAs are funds to which you can contribute a limited amount of money that you’ve already paid taxes on each year. You can then invest your money within your Roth IRA and grow it without having to worry about capital gains tax. At the age of 59 1\/2, you can begin withdrawing your money and won’t have to pay any taxes on it.","content_hash":"7823bc793b4517e6aa77c1792641d3a4","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2722,"method_rank":0}

To start, set up transfers for small amounts, like $10 per week or $25 per month. Set automatic transfers to move those amounts into a separate account so that money is out of sight and out of mind.\n“Setting up automatic deposits takes the work out of saving and keeps you consistent,” Woroch explained. “Once you start seeing your balance building, you will feel motivated to keep working toward your goal.”\nAs you get used to automating your savings and become more comfortable with the transfer amounts, you can gradually increase them.

You can start simply by organizing your debts.\nCreate a list of due dates, minimum payments and interest rates. This will give you a clear picture of what you owe and help you prioritize which debt to pay off first, whether it’s a personal loan, credit card balance or just paying your bills each month. From there, you can prioritize paying off high-interest debt to save you money in the long run.\nPay With Cash\nWoroch advocated paying with cash, which can help you avoid making purchases you don’t need or didn’t plan to make. Since you can’t spend more cash than you have with you, cash payments can help keep your spending in check.\nShe explained that paying with cash doesn’t mean that you have to miss out on rewards.

The company is also facing competition from new companies entering the market, like smartphone company Xiaomi.\nThe electric vehicle market share in China has reached 51% year-to-date, with each of the last five months having a share above 50%, according to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.\nElectrek reported that battery electric vehicles (BEVs) account for 31% of China's market, with plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) making up the remaining 20%, bringing total EV share to 51%.\nChina is the largest electric vehicle market in the world based on the number of units produced, with around 12 million made in 2024. In 2024, China represented around 70% of the global EV market by units. The majority of the EVs produced in China were sold in the country, while around one million were exported to other countries in 2024.\nRead Also: Tesla Q2 Earnings Highlights: Revenue And Earnings Fall Short; New Models Still Set For 2025–2026\nWhy It's Important: Reaching a market share of over 50% could be considered a tipping point for China, according to the report.\nAccording to Electrek, Norway surpassed 50% EV market share in 2020 and today leads the world with over 90% of new vehicle sales being electric.\nWith China's large market share and dominance in the number of units, the country has become the key market for electric vehicles.\nWith Tesla losing sales momentum in the country, this marks a potential big miss for the EV giant and bad timing to miss out on the growth in China.\nEV market share in the United States remains minimal compared to China, with less than 10% of new cars sold in 2024 being electric vehicles. Without committing more to electric vehicle production like China has, EV market share could grow slower in the U.S. than it has in recent years.\nTSLA Price Action: Tesla stock was down 3.5% to $333.86 on Friday versus a 52-week trading range of $207.03 to $488.54. Tesla stock is down 12.5% year-to-date in 2025.\nRead Next:\nPhoto: humphery \/ Shutterstock.com\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

Investors are receiving pitches for a Dogecoin treasury company that will invest in the token, according to six sources, who declined to be named while talking about private business dealings. Three of the sources were pitched directly, and three heard about the deal from parties involved.\nThe company plans to raise at least $200 million, according to two of the sources. Details about the structure of the public vehicle or when it would launch were not immediately available.\nHouse of Doge, the official corporate entity behind the cryptocurrency, is said to have signed off on the treasury play as the “official” Dogecoin vehicle, per three sources—an approach that treasury companies have taken with other cryptocurrencies’ foundations to boost the projects’ legitimacy. Launched in early 2025 by the Dogecoin Foundation and headquartered in Miami, House of Doge is tasked with developing and promoting the popular memecoin.\nAnd Alex Spiro, a personal attorney for Musk, plans to be chairman of the public company, according to a pitch sent to a potential investor and five sources familiar with the matter.\nIt was not clear what role, if any, Musk would play in the new entity. A spokesperson for X, Musk’s social media network, did not respond. A spokesperson for House of Doge declined to comment. Spiro did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nDogecoin is the original “memecoin”—a cryptocurrency that references an online joke and doesn’t have any underlying utility. The value of a memecoin is often tied to its online popularity. Dogecoin refers to a popular meme featuring a picture of a Shiba Inu surrounded by absurdist text, like “so amaze,” in Comic Sans font.\nSince its launch in 2013, Dogecoin’s price movements have become increasingly correlated with public remarks from Musk, who has frequently referenced the memecoin, including during an appearance on Saturday Night Live in 2021. Often, when Musk posts about the meme or memecoin, the token has jumped in price. In fact, the world’s richest man has become so enamored with the Doge meme that he named his government-slashing initiative after it: the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\nMusk’s influence over the price of Dogecoin has been so extreme that some investors claimed in a lawsuit filed in 2022 that he was manipulating markets and cashing in on sales of the memecoin after he posted about it on social media. Spiro, a lawyer for not only Musk but other celebrities like Jay-Z and Alec Baldwin, defended the billionaire in court. And in August 2024, Spiro helped win dismissal of the lawsuit.","content_hash":"35c90b6391fa8f9ce5919306a9dc3751","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2710,"method_rank":0}

Welcome to our weekly market wrap, where we take a look back at the last five trading days with a focus on the market news, economic data, and headlines that have had the most impact on gold prices and other key correlated assets—and may continue to do so in the future.\nHere’s what you need to know:\n-\nGold rallied from $3,375 to $3,450 this week, fueled by dovish data and Fed expectations.\n-\nFriday’s PCE Index came in neutral, helping preserve the narrative for a potential rate cut.\n-\nThursday’s better-than-expected GDP revision (+3.3% QoQ) helped boost gold buying.\n-\nWith gold at new highs, next week’s Jobs Report could be the next catalyst—or headwind.\nSo, What Kind of a Week Has it Been?\nA confluence of mid-tier economic data emerged this week, amounting to one signal: the current moment is not “the wrong time” for the Fed to resume lowering interest rates. Which, for most of the market, seems just as good as saying “right now is the right time.” This is certainly borne out in the gold market, which marked new highs in spot price this week.\nGold Rallies as Data Aligns with Dovish Sentiment\nCoinciding with gold’s steepest climbs this week, which saw prices rally from $3,375\/oz to roughly $3,450, most of the relevant data printed on the back-end of the week.\nMost attention (ours included) leaned towards Friday’s PCE Price Index reporting, which includes, among other points, the Federal Reserve’s preferred metric for overall inflation in the US. Here, as expected, inflation pressures for July read as moderate but not alarming—well within “normal” range to some extent.\nAnd while a far cry from the slowdown that would say to the FOMC, “job done,” and force a September cut, in the wake of Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole address last week, opening the door wide for a cut next month, investors and traders were just looking for any PCE result that didn’t alter the narrative.\nThursday’s GDP Surprise Fuels Gold Momentum\nThe inflation data, not positive but comfortably neutral, has spurred more aggressive buying in gold to close out August. But the yellow metal’s move higher, somewhat surprisingly, kicked off on Thursday, thanks in part to a better-than-expected revision on the second tabulation of Q2 GDP growth in the US (adjusting to +3.3% QoQ).\nThis, in fact, more directly than the PCE data, also makes a strong case for the FOMC to lower rates in just a few weeks and has similarly encouraged flows into gold.\nWhat’s Next: Jobs Report on Deck\nLooking ahead to next week, with gold reaching new highs, the first question has to be what kind of headroom, if any, remains for the precious metal to climb higher absent a market-breaking, exogenous shock.","content_hash":"a86d9a2c639a26c57af4cc4c9811a56b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2706,"method_rank":0}

Reverse splits often mean a company's in trouble, and indeed, the stock price has fallen by more than 30% since the company announced the reverse split on July 17.\nBut with the stock now trading at its lowest levels ever, could there be an advantage to buying before the reverse split?\nHow the reverse split will work\nOften, a reverse split is used to keep a company's share price above the $1 minimum that the Nasdaq Stock Market requires for listing, but it doesn't seem like Lucid's shares are in any immediate danger of falling that low. Rather, the company says it's trying to stay above the internal minimums set by some institutional buyers.\nLucid's 1-for-10 reverse split won't affect the total value of an investor's stake. After the split, instead of having, say, 100 shares worth about $2 each (for a total value of about $200), a shareholder would have 10 shares worth about $20 each (for a total value of about $200). In theory, the company's market capitalization -- currently about $6.3 billion -- won't change, unless of course there's a flurry of buying or selling immediately after the reverse split.\nBut a flurry of selling may be exactly what will happen.\nA likely price drop\nResearch indicates that stocks that undergo a reverse split are likely to experience a drop in price, including a sharp drop when the reverse split occurs, and a further \"downward drift\" over the following months.\nThis may be a result of the liquidation of odd share lots. Because Lucid's reverse split involves trading one \"new\" share for 10 \"old\" shares, investors who hold fewer than 10 shares will have those odd shares automatically liquidated in exchange for cash. It's possible this liquidation sparks downward movement in the share price. Other research suggests that increased short-selling in the wake of the reverse split is to blame.\nRegardless of the cause, this is exactly what happened to Lucid's fellow EV company Canoo. Canoo -- which has since filed for bankruptcy -- did a 1-for-20 reverse split of its shares on Dec. 24, 2024. Its stock price fell 7% on the day of the reverse split, and drifted more than 20% further downward over the next few weeks.","content_hash":"f92b91f63f876bf1e2e8df4c337d5822","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2678,"method_rank":0}

Subscribe to our free daily Wealthmanagement newsletter.\n(Bloomberg) -- The dollar retreated in August after posting its best month this year as investors prepare for a weaker US economy and interest-rate cuts even as inflation continues to advance.\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index lost 1.7% this month, trimming its 2.7% advance in July, which was its first month of gains since President Donald Trump was sworn into office.\nWall Street expects the world’s reserve currency to extend its 8% decline this year as the economy shows some signs of slowing and the Federal Reserve looks set to start cutting rates again. On top of that backdrop, Trump is questioning the credibility of the central bank as well as the validity of economic data, further undermining the greenback’s appeal.\n“There are long-term implications from the US administration’s recent actions,” Jayati Bharadwaj, head of FX strategy at TD Securities, said in a Wednesday note. “This chips away at the USD’s safe haven status and risk premia should start to weigh it down.”\nConcerns over central bank independence have dented the dollar’s appeal. Trump moved earlier this week to oust Fed Governor Lisa Cook, who has vowed to stay on and fight. Cook sued the president Thursday kicking off what will likely be a lengthy process, starting with a hearing Friday.\nThere’s a “real risk” that multiple Fed district bank presidents get removed from office next year due to politically charged maneuvering from the White House, warned Lael Brainard, a former Fed vice chair.\nOn Friday, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed after the so-called core personal consumption expenditures price index, which excludes food and energy items and is favored by the Federal Reserve, matched month-on-month estimates, rising 0.3% in July from the previous month. Late in the session, short-term yields moved lower after the Fed’s San Francisco President Mary Daly signaled openness to cutting rates in September.\n“If Trump resets relations with the Fed, that resembles emerging-market dynamics we’ve seen elsewhere and they are hardly bullish for the currency,” said Sahil Mahtani, director at Ninety One Asset Management’s Investment Institute in London.\nTechnical analysis also points to a clear downtrend for the US currency. Traders now expect a slight decline of the greenback over the next three- to six-month horizon, options pricing as of Friday shows. The dollar gauge fell below its 100-day moving average in early March and has stayed there ever since. Two attempted breakouts failed this month, leaving the moving average a major resistance.","content_hash":"84578bfbd338b297e376d0695e084867","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2669,"method_rank":0}

On a new, not very encouraging revision of the impact of the levies on the industrial company's business, investors traded out of the stock on Friday.\nUltimately, it closed the day almost 4% lower in price, which didn't look good next to the S&P 500 index's relatively modest 0.6% slip.\nAn unhappy Cat\nAfter market close Thursday, Caterpillar divulged in a regulatory filing that it now expects to take a tariff-related hit to its fundamentals totaling $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion across this year. That means potentially several hundreds of millions of dollars more than the original forecast of $1.5 billion it provided within its second-quarter earnings report.\nBetween then and now, a set of modifications and new levies have been announced by the administration.

Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\nWalmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), America’s largest brick-and-mortar retailer, has seen its shares gain a modest 6.9% year-to-date. The modest gains are partly driven by a 6.3% dip in August. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)’s shares fell after the firm struggled with profitability during its second quarter. While its $177.4 billion revenue beat analyst estimates, earnings per share of $0.68 missed estimates of $0.74 by quite a hefty margin. During the earnings, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)’s CEO warned that as the firm ran through its inventories and started to order again, it might see the impact of tariffs. The tariff impact is likely to be felt on the bottom line. Cramer discussed Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in the context of tariffs as well:\n“People perceive them as not having a, of eating some, but not all of the tariffs. Now everybody else had the same thing, but somehow they got hit with that idea and I thought it wasn’t right.”\nHere are his previous thoughts about Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT):\n“Yeah and John David Rainey came over. Now John David, I’ve known him for many, many years. The CFO. And senior vice president. And I was concerned by the Walmart, their response about Amazon. Because Amazon, the Journal caught them raising prices. Now I’m trying to find out whether that’s [inaudible] but he said Walmart has not. And I think Walmart is, Walmart and Costco are the two great inflation fighters now. And I think that it’s, Walmart has a couple of, there was 200 million in shoppers.

Because they didn’t increase the prices.\nCopyright: TEA \/ 123RF Stock Photo\n“Well CPI is all these different element of food. And you know, I think it matters where you shop. If you shop at Walmart. . .Then you know that things didn’t go up. Look you’re eyes are not lying. So anyway I think it’s great to hear from John David Rainey that the largest chain that you buy food did not raise things. . . remember there’s a Walmart every two minutes away from you. So i salute Walmart and I think that this is terrific.”\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of WMT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

He isn't losing all hope for the company, however, as he left his hold recommendation unchanged.\nGengaro made his move in consideration of Lucid's second quarter results and update, according to reports. Although the company slightly edged past the analyst's estimate for revenue, the company's gross profit and non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) missed the mark.

In lieu of surprising or sudden income boosts, there are some very real moves you can make to maximize your existing paycheck, by stopping spending leaks and putting money away.\nFind Out: Here’s How to Fix Your Budgeting Problems, According to Kumiko Love\nRead Next: 10 Cars That Outlast the Average Vehicle\nFinancial expert Christopher Stroup, a CFP and the owner of Silicon Beach Financial, offered seven simple steps to maximize your paycheck right now.\nAutomate Into High-Yield Savings\nWhen that paycheck hits your account, it’s way too easy to spend it before you save. If you automate a portion of your paycheck into a high-yield savings account or retirement plan before it hits your checking account, you’ll be in much better shape, Stroup pointed out.\n“You won’t miss what you don’t see, and this forces better cash flow discipline while building long-term wealth,” Stroup said.\nLearn More: 3 Best Ways to Prioritize Your Savings Goals\nPlug Money Leaks\nWhile big bills are harder to cut back on, you can plug money leaks in the form of recurring subscriptions, unused memberships and convenience purchases, which Stroup said, “quietly chip away at income.”\nHe said it’s also important to review bank and credit card statements quarterly. “Cancel what doesn’t add value and replace impulse buys with planned spending. Small leaks may only cost $20 to $50 each, but together they can drain thousands annually.”\nAllocate Spending\nAnother way to stretch your paycheck is to automate any bills you can to avoid throwing money away in late fees, then allocate spending into three buckets: needs, wants and future savings, Stroup urged.\nEven a 5% to 10% trim from “wants” (such as takeout, streaming and ride shares) frees cash to cover essentials or boost savings, giving every dollar more impact, he said.\nAdjust Tax Withholding\nIf you routinely get a large tax refund, you may be over-withholding, Stroup said, which is essentially just loaning the IRS your money.\n“Updating your W-4 can increase monthly take-home pay by hundreds. The key is balance: Don’t under-withhold and owe at tax time but avoid letting the IRS hold your money interest-free all year.”\nTake Advantage of Tax Deductions\nMake sure you’re taking advantage of all possible tax deductions, including health insurance premiums, retirement contributions and flexible spending accounts or health savings accounts (FSAs or HSAs), Stroup said.\n“These can actually increase your effective paycheck value because they’re often pretax.”","content_hash":"4f353760e9a6595ff388cd56f1084b33","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2604,"method_rank":0}

That's because they were awfully happy about the specialty retailer's second-quarter earnings, published just after market close the previous day.

It was also a slightly higher figure than that predicted by analysts, who collectively were modeling $1.49 billion.\nThat dip was on the back of a 1.4% fall in comparable sales for the quarter.\nPetco's bottom line looked far better, as the company flipped to a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net profit of almost $14 million, or $0.05 per share, from the nearly $25 million loss it suffered in the same quarter of 2024. Analysts had far more modest expectations, as the average estimate for profitability was only $0.01 per share.\nIn the earnings release, Petco quoted CEO Joel Anderson as saying that the first half of this year \"established a solid foundation for our transformation as we continued to strengthen our economic model and improve retail operating fundamentals.\"\nA raise in EBITDA guidance\nIt was a beat-and-raise quarter for Petco, as it raised its guidance for non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the full year.

The biggest lenders, or so-called global systemically important banks, are also subject to a capital surcharge.\nThe Fed’s announcement comes as the industry awaits the outcome of the Fed’s planned changes to its stress-test process. In April, the agency unveiled a proposal to average results over two years when setting capital requirements. Michelle Bowman, the Fed’s vice chair for supervision, has said that potential changes would help the agency address the “excessive volatility in the stress-test results and corresponding capital requirements.”\n“The individual capital requirements announced today represent a period of transition,” Bowman said in the statement, adding that finalizing the April plan would be an important next step to reducing year-over-year volatility in bank capital requirements.","content_hash":"f4bfce8658fffd150d7615a723cd8ab0","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2574,"method_rank":0}

Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\nUnion Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) has been in the news lately, as far as the railroad industry is concerned. Cramer’s morning show has had a role to play in this trend as well. The shares have lost 2.7% year-to-date, hampered by broader industrial sluggishness and its bid to take over Norfolk Southern. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is currently in an era where railroads in the US are looking to join forces after Cramer’s co-host David Faber first broke the news on Squawk on the Street. In this appearance, Cramer outlined that CSX CEO Joseph Hinrichs’ belief that mergers aren’t really necessary for railroad efficiency could harm Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)’s Norfolk Southern merger:\n“As Joe Hinrichs said to me last night on CSX, for the first time railroads are looking to work together. There is a up to a five day delay every time you get to Chicago because they don’t really, I mean we never really completed one. He’s saying you don’t need to merge, in order to make things more efficient. That would hurt the Norfolk Southern, Union Pacific merger.”\nHere are Cramer’s earlier thoughts about Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP):\n“Well what’s incredible if you look at the actual rails, it makes so much sense. There’s so little overlap. You wanted East-West. It’s [inaudible] be great thing. There is tremendous congestion, where the two in the Midwest, in Chicago area, it’s so, I don’t see a lot of the overlap that would make you not like it. I think that, if you were a regulator in the previous regime, you might say, you know what, these two will never compete if we let them merge. So we can’t let them merge because now they won’t go against each other. But the fact is, they were never going to go against each other. That’s not, the rails, stop doing that years ago.\n“This is a deal where you just would never have seen it. . .I think that they have a feeling that this one’s gonna go. Don’t matter what [inaudible] get it. And, I would argue that if you think there’s going to be big reindustrialization, Carl, you do want it. It makes sense to have this type of seamless rhythm. The rails are, look I think we all wish that we didn’t, that we had more rails in the country, they’re much cleaner, 400 miles to the diesel gallon. You could argue that other countries have them in a much more you, in a superb way, and we’re a little disjointed, This makes a lot of sense.”","content_hash":"176aa3773356dacaef1663989fe6caf9","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2565,"method_rank":0}

Faced with a cash crunch, the company said last week it borrowed the entire $275 million available under its revolving credit facility.\nSpirit's Chapter 11 filing was widely expected after it issued a warning earlier this month that it might not continue to operate if its financial results failed to improve rapidly.\n\"Since emerging from our previous restructuring, which was targeted exclusively on reducing Spirit's funded debt and raising equity capital, it has become clear that there is much more work to be done and many more tools are available to best position Spirit for the future,\" said CEO Dave Davis.\nThe company made the Chapter 11 filing in bankruptcy court in the Southern District of New York. Spirit said it was working productively with its secured noteholders, including with respect to potential financing that may become necessary later in the proceedings.\nIndustry analysts and executives say Spirit's troubles stemmed from its failure to fix its bloated cost structure in the first bankruptcy. Its total operating expense in the latest quarter was $1.2 billion, which amounted to 118% of its quarterly revenue.\nSpirit is also locked in a dispute with aircraft lessor AerCap Holdings over a deal covering 36 Airbus planes due for delivery between 2027 and 2028.\nAs part of its restructuring, the airline said it would reduce its presence in certain markets. It will also cut its fleet to significantly lower its debt and lease obligations. It estimates that would generate hundreds of millions of dollars in annual operating savings.\nThe airline's struggles have created opportunities for rivals, with Frontier Airlines adding routes and eyeing further expansion. Analysts and industry executives say carriers such as Frontier, Southwest and United Airlines might be interested in picking up Spirit aircraft and other assets as it restructures.\nSpirit said wages and benefits will continue to be paid and honored for those employed by the airline, including contractors. It will also meet go-forward obligations to its vendors and suppliers throughout the bankruptcy process.","content_hash":"b151804f3f4e2e4bd0f99b49968177a1","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2556,"method_rank":0}

The company has moved beyond its initial focus of student loans and added a slew of new financial services over the past few years to attract customers.\nSoFi's growth has been tremendous recently, and its share price gains of more than 300% over the past three years have boosted many investors' portfolios. But after all of those gains, is SoFi stock still worth buying while it's under $30?\nHere's why investors should be optimistic about SoFi's future, and one word of caution if you buy the stock now.\nSoFi shows no signs of slowing down\nSoFi's second-quarter results showed the company's continued momentum, with revenue rising 44% from the year-ago quarter to $858 million, and earnings skyrocketing 700% to $0.08 per share. SoFi also added a record 850,000 new members in the quarter, a 34% increase, giving the company a total of 11.7 million members. All those members helped push fee-based revenue up by 72% to $378 million.\nThe quarter was so good, in fact, that management raised its full-year guidance. SoFi's management said that sales will be about $3.38 billion in 2025, and net income will reach around $370 million, up from its previous estimates of about $3.27 billion in sales and $325 million in net income. The company also estimates that it will add at least 3 million new members this year, a 30% increase from 2024.\nOne thing to keep in mind with SoFi stock\nSoFi is clearly offering services that its members want and is adept at finding new ways to grow. But I think it's worth pointing out that its quick share price gains over the past few years now make SoFi stock relatively expensive, with a price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 52. That's compared to the S&P 500's average P\/E multiple of about 30.\nLots of stocks look expensive right now, so that's not a huge red flag. But it's important to keep in mind, especially as there are some signs that the U.S. economy could be slowing down. The U.S. added just 73,000 jobs in July, and job growth was substantially revised downward for the previous two months.","content_hash":"2992b8a20ee3b782eb2c88bea1ba7be8","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2522,"method_rank":0}

While some believe that Palantir can keep those returns up, I'm a bit more skeptical, and I think several companies will outperform Palantir, most notably is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL).\nIt may seem a bit odd that I'm picking an established tech player to outperform one of the most exciting growth stocks over the next decade, but after digging into the numbers, it's clear that Alphabet has a strong chance.\nPalantir's growth case is more promising than Alphabet's\nPalantir provides AI-powered data analytics software to its clients that helps them make the best-informed decisions at all times. It also has tools to automate tasks through AI agents. Originally, this software was developed for government use, but it expanded to the commercial sector within the past decade. Palantir has seen monster growth over the past few quarters, with Q2 posting the fastest growth yet: 48% year over year to $1 billion.\nAlphabet is a legacy player and generates a ton of money from its Google family of products. While many are concerned that generative AI may replace Google Search, management has done a great job integrating AI with its AI search overviews, which provide a generative AI-powered summary of each search result. Google is still the dominant player in the search engine realm, and its Q2 revenue growth rate of 12% showcases this. Overall, Alphabet grew revenue at a 14% pace in Q2, which is far slower than Palantir.\nWith Alphabet's much slower growth rate, how can I expect it to outperform Palatnir over the next decade?\nStock valuation plays a huge role in investing\nGrowth isn't everything when investing. Even if it's the best company in the world, it can turn out to be an investing failure if you pay the wrong price for it. That's exactly where Palantir is right now, as it has unbelievable growth already baked into its stock price.\nPalantir trades for a jaw-dropping 245 times forward earnings and 117 times sales.\nCompared to Alphabet's 6.9 times sales and 21 times forward earnings, Palantir's stock looks far more expensive. However, the question here is whether Alphabet's solid, but slower growth, can outperform Palantir's rapid growth, but at an expensive price tag? Let's run the numbers.","content_hash":"00bdb4f51b1284eef9c6930f965394c7","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2511,"method_rank":0}

However, consumers may have a little bit of wiggle room on that time frame, according to a new document released by the Internal Revenue Service.\nThe tax credits, worth up to $7,500, were scrapped as part of a Republican tax and spending measure passed in July. The law says consumers don't qualify for a tax break if the EV is \"acquired after\" Sept. 30.\nSome observers initially thought that meant an EV had to be \"placed in service\" by that date — meaning that consumers had to be in physical possession of the car.\nHowever, the IRS clarified that's not the case.\nIf a taxpayer acquires an EV by having a \"written binding contract in place\" and makes a payment on or before Sept. 30, they'd be entitled to claim the federal tax credit when they eventually take possession of the vehicle — even if that's after Sept. 30, the IRS said in a set of answers to frequently asked questions issued Aug. 21.\n\"This means that if you can't drive off in the clean vehicle of your dreams by Sept. 30, there is still hope,\" said Ingrid Malmgren, senior policy director at Plug In America, a nonprofit advocating for a quicker transition to electric cars.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nWhat lower interest rates would mean for mortgage refinancing\nFew 401(k) savers use this option for tax-free growth\nWhy 'quiet cracking' at work is dangerous\nThe IRS update applies to used, new and leased EVs, according to the agency's document.

With a market capitalization of $18.8 billion, the company offers testing solutions for semiconductors and electronic products. Teradyne is an ATE partner for artificial intelligence (AI) device manufacturers. This means that global companies rely on Teradyne to ensure the quality and performance of their products. Teradyne’s advanced robotics segment offers mobile robots that help in manufacturing and warehouse operations.\nThe company’s stock has given up gains over the recent past due to its growth stalling. Over the past 52 weeks, the stock has declined by 11%. Teradyne’s shares reached a 52-week high of $144.61 on Jan. 7, but are now down 19% from this high. However, over the past three months, the stock has experienced a resurgence, rising by 45%.\nWhy Nvidia Could Be the Spark Teradyne Needs?\nUBS analysts, led by Timothy Arcuri, wrote in July that they believe Teradyne could see meaningful upside if it secures even a small slice of Nvidia’s business as a second-source testing supplier. The investment bank estimates that landing even a modest 10% share of Nvidia’s business could add several hundred million dollars in annual revenue, no small feat for a company looking to rebound.\nWhat adds to the opportunity is the increased complexity of Nvidia’s Blackwell chips. According to UBS, test times for Blackwell are significantly longer than for its predecessor, Hopper, thanks to its dual compute tile architecture. This means any incremental test wins could translate to even greater revenue potential for Teradyne.\nWhile Teradyne has long been linked to Apple (AAPL), UBS believes investors are beginning to recognize a “broader set of catalysts.” With Nvidia potentially in play, Teradyne could be entering a new phase of relevance in the semiconductor supply chain.","content_hash":"284335e90e39da16673447f59621ea11","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2487,"method_rank":0}

For profitability, we have announced inflation-based pricing actions related to the third quarter market, which we expect to partially benefit the fourth quarter and carry into 2026. As the fourth quarter has begun, counter to our expectations, commodity markets have remained elevated across a variety of inputs. With that, we’re assessing additional pricing actions. Our tariff estimate remains unchanged at a $0.01 to $0.02 EPS headwind for fiscal year 2025.

(NYSE:BRK).\nBuffett’s retirement decision has sparked debates about his reasons for working past the typical retirement age and his current choice to step aside.\nIndustry observers believe that Buffett’s work was intrinsically linked to his personal identity and gave him a sense of purpose.\nKerry Hannon, author of “Retirement Bites: A Gen X Guide to Securing Your Financial Future,” has told Insider in an interview that Buffett was “energized and empowered by the possibilities of his work.”\nDuring Buffett’s tenure as CEO, the company metamorphosed from a struggling textile mill into a global juggernaut boasting a $1 trillion market value, a $300 billion stock portfolio, and roughly 400,000 employees.\nAuthors Jeri Sedlar and Rick Miners, along with scholars Lawrence Cunningham and Steve Hanke, concurred that Buffett’s passion for his company and his work was a crucial determinant in his decision to work until his mid-90s.\nDespite his enormous wealth, Buffett is renowned for his philanthropic activities, having donated over $60 billion to charitable causes. He co-initiated the Giving Pledge in 2010, urging the ultra-rich to contribute a part of their wealth to charity.\nHowever, they also pointed out that the passing of Buffett’s long-time associate, Charlie Munger, in 2023, might have influenced his decision to retire. “In his gut, he just knows it’s time,” Sedlar and Miners commented.\nBuffett’s retirement marks the end of an era for Berkshire Hathaway, a company he steered to unprecedented heights. His departure raises questions about the company’s future direction and leadership.\nBuffett’s work ethic and philanthropy have set a high standard for his successor.\nHis retirement also underscores the changing dynamics in the corporate world, where CEOs are increasingly prioritizing work-life balance and considering retirement at a younger age.\nRead Next\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

Cryptocurrency explained\nThe Fed’s role extends beyond interest-rate policy and directly into banking access, McClurg noted. He pointed to the experience of Custodia Bank, led by Caitlin Long, which was denied membership in the Federal Reserve system.\n“Here in the U.S., when a lot of companies were being debanked, those orders were actually coming from the Fed and from the FDIC,” he explained. “They played a lot of dirty ball to get her out of there.”\nFor crypto firms, the consequences of that stance have been severe. Access to banking rails remains one of the biggest bottlenecks for digital-asset companies trying to operate in compliance with U.S. law.\nMore news:\nMcClurg argued that more executive and congressional oversight could force the Fed to take a more balanced approach.\n“I actually think that an investigation into the Fed is warranted and a lot more oversight is certainly necessary to really clean that organization,” he said\nCrypto sees opportunity as Fed independence faces new test\nMarkets are now left to consider how Trump’s challenge to Fed independence could reshape policy.\nTraditional investors will be watching interest-rate decisions, but digital-asset advocates see a chance for systemic change that could loosen the central bank’s grip over crypto banking.\nWhether this amounts to a political power play or a structural reset, McClurg’s view underscores that the outcome will reverberate across asset classes.\n“Oversight is extremely important,” he repeated, framing Trump’s maneuver as less about one governor and more about the balance of power between the Fed and the elected branches of government.\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Aug 29, 2025, where it first appeared in the Policy section.

In 2023, the Federal Election Commission dismissed a complaint from Republicans over Gmail’s spam filters, and a federal court also dismissed an RNC lawsuit with similar complaints.

It has also diversified its business to include software services for law enforcement. The shares have gained 25% year-to-date and are up by a whopping 791% over the past five years. No wonder Cramer called Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON) one of the best-performing stocks all time in these remarks. Previously, he has discussed the firm’s share price levels and advised viewers to gradually build a position. This time, he praised Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON)’s CEO:\n“Rick Smith at AXON, probably one of the best performing stocks of all time. That used to be Taser, but now it’s a software-as-a-service for the Justice Department.”\nalphaspirit\/Shutterstock.com\nHere’s how Cramer believes one should buy Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON)’s shares:\n“Look, I think Rick Smith is great. I have often thought about putting this on my, in the bullpen for this, for the Charitable Trust, but it just won’t quit. I think you have to buy. Look, if you want to buy a 100 shares, buy 25 [on] Monday, and then you gotta wait for it to come down. You can’t just buy it all right here because then I feel like that could be just… It would be just terrible if the stock came in, once again, all-time high today.”\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AXON as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.
