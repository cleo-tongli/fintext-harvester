But with both countries facing tariff heat from Washington, could economic challenges push Beijing and New Delhi toward reluctant cooperation, transforming their adversarial relationship?
That possibility will be tested over the weekend in Tianjin, where India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is due to meet China's President Xi Jinping for the 25th Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. It will be Modi's first visit to China in seven years, after the deadly Galwan Valley clashes between Indian and Chinese soldiers in 2020 soured relations.
New Delhi and Beijing could engage in talks in Tianjin, as India's foreign ministry has flagged the possibility of bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit.
India-China experts largely do not see the summit as the beginning of a long-lasting friendship between the two countries. ""The suspicion of China runs deep in India,"" said Amit Bhandari, senior fellow, energy, investments and connectivity, at think tank Gateway House. But in the face of U.S. tariffs and shifting supply chains, China and India find themselves edging toward each other.
During his two-day visit to Delhi, last week, Chinese Foreign minister Wang Yi said that India and China should view each other as ""partners"" rather than ""adversaries or threats.""
""It is unlikely that Chinese partnership will become like the one India has with Russia or U.S.,"" Bhandari said.
India enjoys a goods trade surplus with the U.S, standing at $45.8 billion as of 2024. On the other hand, it has a widening deficit with China, something it has been trying to curb but has been unable to do. India's trade deficit with China was $99.2 billion for the year ended March 2025, up from about $85 billion the year before, with total imports from Beijing touching an all-time high of $113.45 billion.
""Our trade deficit concerns are two pronged. One is the actual size of the deficit. Two is the fact that the imbalance has continuously been widening year after year,"" according to the Indian embassy in China. ""We continue to engage the Chinese side for addressing market access issues.""
China's close relationship with Pakistan is another sore point for India. According to a report from Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, China delivered major arms to 44 states in 2020–24, with nearly two-thirds of its arms exports, or 63%, going to Pakistan. China supplied 81% of Pakistan's arms imports from 2020 to 2024, compared with 74% between 2015 and 2019, the report said.
The SCO meeting is unlikely to resolve disputes or heal old wounds between the two neighbors, according to experts. But Modi's presence in Tianjin could be a signal of willingness to find common ground.
Economic necessity
New Delhi has sought to position itself as a manufacturing hub for global companies seeking to diversify supply chains away from China.
India, for instance, surpassed China as the top smartphone supplier to the U.S in the second quarter, while China's share of smartphone exports to the U.S. dropped to just 25% from 61% a year earlier, according to research firm Canalys.
Still, the country has not been able to fully capitalize on the ""China Plus One"" opportunity partly due to trade barriers between New Delhi and Beijing, said Priyanka Kishore, principal economist at Asian economy and policy-focused think tank Asia Decoded.
""Countries aspiring to be China+1 destinations need to get their raw materials or intermediate goods from China until the time they can develop their own capabilities at home. Domestically India is not in position to produce and provide all intermediate goods and raw materials,"" she said.
Several industries in India are highly reliant on China.
""For normal chemical-based APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredients), China supplies 70% of India's requirements while for biosimilar APIs it supplies almost 90%,"" said Ajay Srivastava head of the Global Trade Research Initiative, adding that China is India's key supplier of electronics, electricals, machinery and organic chemicals.
Electrical vehicles is another industry where India is highly reliant on Chinese supplies.
With a goal to curtail their crude import bill, the Indian government has set ambitious targets for adoption of electric vehicles. It aims EVs to account for 30% of new vehicle sales by 2030, up from 7.6% in 2024, according to data from the Indian government policy think tank Niti Aayog.
That's a tall ask given most Indian EV manufacturers rely on China for supply of key elements such as rare earth magnets. ""Our government has pushed the auto industry in a position where it relies on China for key components like rare earth magnets, lithium, cobalt ... So essentially a key manufacturing industry is vulnerable to disruption,"" Bhandari said.
Last week, during his visit to India, the Chinese foreign minister assured that his country will address the India's need for rare earths, tunnel boring machines and fertilizers.
China also stands to gain from strengthening trade ties with its neighbor. India has banned several Chinese businesses from operating in the country. The ban has affected a diverse range of firms from e-commerce companies such as Shein to social media platform TikTok.
Access to the Indian market can be a big boost for Chinese companies at a time when there's a slowdown in domestic consumption. India's EV market, for instance, offers room for Chinese companies to grow as they face intense competition at home.
""BYD would love to open a factory in India, now that Vietnam's VinFast has already been allowed. Chinese industries are dealing with overproduction and excess capacity and with the demand from US market shrinking they need other markets,"" said Kishore.
In further sign of warming ties, following Wang's visit, direct flights from India to mainland China, which had been suspended since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, are set to resume. Both sides have agreed to reopen border trade at three designated trading points.
Indian companies such as Reliance Industries and Adani Group are also pursuing partnerships with Chinese companies, The Economic Times reported in July.
While the signs are positive, long-held suspicions and border disputes make it difficult to see the two countries as close partners. The SCO meeting will offer greater clarity on how in-step will the elephant and dragon's tango will be — and for how long.",04fb16d506f91019e38020b48439b3fe,trafilatura

The S&P 500 closed Thursday at a fresh high, buoyed by signs that both Main Street and Wall Street are still buzzing with life.
Revised data showed U.S. gross domestic product grew at an annualized 3.3% in the quarter ending June, surpassing the consensus forecast of 3.1% by Dow Jones, as well as the Commerce Department's initial estimate of 3%.
A key measure called ""final sales to private domestic purchasers"" jumped to 1.9% from the previous figure of 1.2%, noted CNBC's Jeff Cox. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the figure tracks ""the sum of personal consumption expenditures and gross private fixed investment,"" or, in short, the economic health of consumers and corporations. By this criterion, both seem to be chugging along healthily even amid tariff uncertainty.
Shares of Nvidia, meanwhile, dipped 0.3%, despite reporting earnings that topped expectations. Investors appear to have wanted more, although the company's forecast of upbeat sales growth points to continued strength — suggesting the artificial intelligence boom will persist, which propped up stocks of other chipmakers such as Broadcom and Micron Technology.
Still, Nvidia's dependence on a handful of large customers — two of which made up a whopping 39% of its second-quarter revenue — has raised concerns about concentration risks.
September has historically been the weakest month for the S&P 500, based on data from the Stock Trader's Almanac. But with such fundamentals in place — and a likely rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve in the upcoming month — this year could be atypical for stocks.
What you need to know today
U.S. second-quarter GDP rose more than expected. On an annualized basis, the economy expanded 3.3%, according to the Commerce Department's second estimate — higher than the 3.0% initial estimate and the 3.1% Dow Jones consensus forecast.
Two customers made up 39% of Nvidia's second-quarter revenue. That's according to Nvidia's financial filing on Wednesday. They could either be cloud providers or manufacturers — but little else is known about the identity of those customers.
Tesla's July sales in Europe plunged. There were 8,837 new registrations of Tesla vehicles last month, down 40% year on year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. BYD, meanwhile, saw a 225% annual surge.
Another high for the S&P 500. The broad-based index added 0.32% Thursday and closed above the 6,500 level for the first time. The pan-European Stoxx 600 slipped 0.2% despite opening higher in early trade.
[PRO] A buying opportunity for Orsted shares? Shares of Orsted, one of the world's largest developers of offshore wind farms, plunged 40% in August amid a funding issue and a stop-work order on its project. But one analyst just upgraded its stock to a ""Buy.""
And finally...
India's three-way balancing act: Tariffs, oil, and uneasy handshakes
India's juggling act on the world stage has never looked more complicated, or more consequential. Washington is piling on tariffs, Moscow is supplying New Delhi with cheap oil, and Beijing is preparing to welcome Prime Minister Narendra Modi with open arms at the SCO summit in China this week.
Step back, and India's position looks clearer. The U.S. is its biggest customer but also its harshest critic. Russia keeps the lights on, but at a political cost. China is the rival next door, yet too big to ignore.

The companies had earlier reached a short-term extension to prevent disruptions for YouTube TV subscribers.
""We're pleased to have reached a deal that preserves the value of our service for our subscribers,"" YouTube said in a statement shared with CNBC. YouTube, owned by Alphabet, as well as Fox did not disclose the financial terms of the agreement.
YouTube had said Monday that Fox was asking for payments ""far higher than what partners with comparable content offerings receive.""
That comes after Fox launched Fox One, a standalone streaming service last week, costing $19.99 per month or $199.99 annually.
As a result of the standoff, YouTube had warned it may remove Fox Broadcast Network, Fox News and Fox Sports from its platform by 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday.
That could've seen YouTube TV subscribers miss out on a highly anticipated college football match between top-ranked Texas against reigning national champion and third-ranked Ohio State on Sunday, and possibly the start of the National Football League season early next month.
Brendan Carr, chair of the Federal Communications Commission, weighed in Friday, saying he was happy the two companies had reached a deal.
""This is great news for college football fans and avoids blackouts. Enjoy the games this weekend!"" he said in a post on X.
YouTube TV pays broadcasters such as Fox to stream their channels and has roughly 9.4 million subscribers.
In addition to American football, Fox hosts Major League Baseball games, as well as the World Series, which is scheduled to start in late October.
The base plan for YouTube TV costs $82.99 per month and includes over 100 live channels.
YouTube is America's leading media distributor in terms of audience engagement, capturing over 13% of TV watch-time in July, according to Nielsen.

Pulte said in a post on X that the new referral relates to her mortgage for a condominium in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and alleged misrepresentations about that condo and two homes she owns in government ethics filings during her time as a Fed governor.
""3 strikes and you're out,"" Pulte tweeted about his referral to the DOJ.
His post included images of his letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and top DOJ official Ed Martin, laying out the allegations about Cook.
The referral implicitly addresses arguments that Trump does not have the power to legally remove Cook from the board for cause because Pulte's first criminal referral relates to conduct that allegedly occurred before she joined the Fed.
Earlier Thursday, Cook sued Trump, asking a federal judge in Washington, D.C., to block the president from his unprecedented move to boot her from the central bank.
Cook's lawyer Abbe Lowell, in a statement on Friday morning, called Pulte's criminal referral ""an obvious smear campaign aimed at discrediting Gov. Cook by a political operative who has taken to social media more than 30 times in the last two days and demanded her removal before any review of the facts or evidence.""
""Nothing in these vague, unsubstantiated allegations has any relevance to Gov Cook's role at the Federal Reserve, and they in no way justify her removal from the Board,"" Lowell said.
A Fed spokesperson declined to comment.
Trump earlier in the week cited the first criminal referral Pulte made against Cook, which related to purported false claims on mortgage applications for two homes, in a letter notifying her that he was firing her.
Pulte, who was appointed to lead the FHFA by Trump, has acted as an attack dog on the president's behalf against the Fed, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Cook in recent weeks.
Trump for months has demanded, without success so far, that the central bank cut interest rates. Before saying he was firing Cook, Trump had seriously considered trying to fire Powell.
Pulte previously said that Cook signed mortgage documents for properties in Michigan and Georgia, which she claimed were each her primary residence, ""in order to potentially secure lower interest rates and more favorable loan terms.""
His earlier allegation led the DOJ to open a criminal investigation of Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor.
Pulte on Thursday said that in April 2021, ""Cook entered a 15-year mortgage for a condominium in [Cambridge], representing it as her 'Second Home.'""
""Only eight months later, on December 1, 2021, Cook signed an ethics form with the U.S. Government that this property was an 'investment/rental property,'"" Pulte wrote.
But ""in subsequent filings from 2022 to 2025, Cook consistently listed this property as an investment/rental property, not a second home,"" he wrote.
""Representing the property as a second home may have allowed Cook to secure a lower 'Second Home' mortgage down payment and rates, as investment properties typically carry higher down payments and higher rates due to increased risk,"" Pulte wrote.
He said that Cook allegedly misrepresented her property in Atlanta, which was a subject of the first criminal referral, on disclosure forms from 2022 through 2025 ""as her residence, despite evidence suggesting it was being rented out to tenants.""
""Similarly, Cook declared in a 2025 government filing that her Ann Arbor, [Michigan] property was her personal residence, however, we have reason to believe that as of 2025, the Ann Arbor property is being used as a rental property, not a personal residence,"" Pulte tweeted.
""These inconsistencies appear Cook made additional, multiple false representations, including to the U.S. Government, regarding the status of her mortgages and properties.""",fcb01f548e45984893e01884ddc8898c,trafilatura

She was indicted for amassing over 1 billion won (about $720,000) in criminal proceeds, violating several laws of the country, including capital market and financial investment business, and political funds act, according to a statement in Korean from special counsel Min Joong-ki's team, translated by CNBC.
This includes a stock manipulation scheme between 2010 and 2012, resulting in illicit profits of over 810 million won.
Kim is the wife of former President Yoon Suk Yeol whose short-lived martial law in December 2024 led to his impeachment and removal from office earlier this year. He was arrested and faces charges of insurrection over his martial law bid, which carries a maximum penalty of death.
Kim allegedly also conspired with Yoon to receive 270 million won worth of opinion polls data for free from around June 2021 to around March 2022, according to the authorities. She also is accused of obtaining 80 million won in bribes and valuables from the Unification Church in 2022, in return for her support for the organization.
Separately, ex-prime minister Han Duck-soo was indicted for abetting the short-lived martial law bid by Yoon. South Korean media outlet Yonhap said Han's charges include ""abetting the ringleader of an insurrection, perjury, falsifying and destroying official documents, and other offenses.""
These charges come as President Lee Jae Myung reportedly approved legislation back in June for investigations into Yoon's martial law bid, as well as probes into Kim and other allegations against Yoon's administration.
Yoon had previously vetoed these investigations while in office, according to domestic media.
These probes had reportedly led to raids on a church in South Korea and into Osan Air Base, a joint base operated by both the U.S. and South Korean air forces.
U.S. President Donald Trump had referenced these raids ahead of his meeting with South Korea's Lee on Monday stateside, saying that there were ""very vicious raids on churches"" and ""that they even went into a military base and got information.""
Before his meeting with Lee, Trump had posted on Truth Social, saying ""WHAT IS GOING ON IN SOUTH KOREA? Seems like a Purge or Revolution. We can't have that and do business there,"" although he did not reference any specific event.
The U.S. president later softened his stance during the meeting with Lee, saying that ""I'm sure it's a misunderstanding.""

Overview: Made in Russia
Smartphone enthusiasts can pick up fresh gear nearly every year — rocket aficionados usually face a longer wait.
For watchers of Russia-made launch vehicles, the clock's now ticking down until December, when Moscow-headquartered state space agency Roscosmos still intends to carry out its first test launch of the Soyuz-5 rocket.
""Yes, we have plans for December, everything remains in force,"" the Roscosmos Head Dmitry Bakanov said Aug. 22, according to Russian state news agency Tass.
The rocket, which is expected to become fully operational in 2028, is unlikely to shock by way of novelty. A decade in the making under the development name ""Feniks"" and popularly known as Irtysh, the Soyuz-5 is widely viewed as a medium-class launch vehicle that reincarnates the Ukraine-manufactured Zenit-2 rocket.
Moscow plans for the all-Russian Soyuz-5 to be the latest member of Russia's workhorse Soyuz rocket family. It will be equipped with RD-171MV engines built by NPO Energomash, which former Roscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin praised as having ""no equals in the world in terms of power"" back in 2019. Powered by kerosene and liquid oxygen, the Soyuz-5 will be able to balance a roughly 17-ton payload.
If it meets the December deadline, the Soyuz-5 test launch will be no small feat for Roscosmos, which has faced funding shortages since the February 2022 start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The space agency had lost 180 billion rubles ($2.24 billion) by August 2024 and planned to put up non-core assets worth more than 11.4 billion rubles up for sale to shore up its activities.
The war in Ukraine marked a turning point for Russia's space sector. The European Space Agency severed ties with Roscosmos in 2022, ending the two institutions' partnership over the ExoMars rover mission and further lunar ventures. The breaking of ties also initially raised question marks over Moscow's continued cooperation to maintain the International Space Station. Critically for the Soyuz line, the dissolution of this relationship also saw Roscosmos pull out from the ESA space center in Kourou, French Guiana — the pad for 27 Soyuz launches, which carried the likes of OneWeb and Galileo satellites between 2011-2022.
Since then, Roscosmos has switched gears and is looking to launch the Soyuz-5 from Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome, which Astana is trying to leverage to kick start its own space industry and attract foreign operators and investment. The Russian space agency, which has been using the Baikonur facility since shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union, is paying Kazakhstan $115 million annually to lease the complex until 2050.
Getting a new rocket model to the launch pad and off the ground is no easy feat. The heavily mediatized successes and explosive failures of SpaceX's test flights of its giant Starship — which pulled off a successful 10th trial launch this week, after a series of fiery setbacks earlier in the year — show as much. Chinese firm Landspace is also targeting an orbital debut for the Zhuque-3 by the end of the year.
Russia itself test launched its first post-Soviet era rocket model, the Angara-A5, in June last year, following two aborted launch attempts. But as the space industry increasingly progresses toward more cost-effective reusable rockets, the real test for Russian innovation will come once Moscow completes development of the Soyuz-7, known as the Amur-SPG — a methane-fueled launch vehicle, intended as a more cost-effective substitute to Russia's workhorse rocket Soyuz-2. Its first stage is designed to be reused up to 50 times. As of January, Roscosmos is expected to finalize the rocket by 2030, with its launch site under construction at Russia's Vostochny Cosmodrome.

Denmark has recorded strong annual growth in recent years, with its economy expanding 3.7% last year after getting a major boost from pharmaceutical exports.
Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk makes blockbuster weight management drugs Ozempic and Wegovy.
The economy ministry noted that Denmark's U.S. exports fell significantly in early 2025 after a huge spike in late 2024, due to both inventory build-up and increased competition in the weight loss drug market, which has seen Novo lose market share. Generic medicines are also squeezing its sales opportunities in the U.S., the ministry said.
Pharmaceuticals are now expected to contribute just 1.3 percentage points to Denmark's goods exports growth this year, down from 8.1 percentage points in 2024. Total goods export growth is projected to fall to 2.7% in 2025 from 10.5% the previous year.
Europe's pharmaceutical sector has been rocked this year by the threat of sky-high U.S. tariffs, though some certainty has now been provided by the EU-U.S. trade deal.
The Danish economy ministry said U.S. tariffs had weighed on its growth forecast, while a statistical revision showed that real GDP expanded less in 2021-2024 than previously calculated.
""Growth in the first quarter of 2025 has also been weaker than previously expected. Together with the American tariff increases and downwardly adjusted expectations for the pharmaceutical industry, this has given rise to a significant downward adjustment of the estimate for GDP growth in 2025,"" it said in a statement, according to Google Translate.
It added that despite the Brussels-Washington trade deal, there remained a ""significant degree of unpredictability linked to the U.S. administration's policy,"" which was adding to uncertainty around conditions for Danish exporters, potentially weighing on business investments and activity. Households, meanwhile, remain concerned about global events and high food prices, it said.
The ministry stressed, however, that despite the lower 2025 growth forecast, its economy remains strong overall, with high employment and inflation expected to be below 2% on an annual basis.
It revised its growth forecast for 2026 higher, to 2.1% from 1.4%, on expectations for higher private and public consumption.
Novo woes
Two years ago, a boom in weight loss drugs led Novo Nordisk to overtake luxury giant LVMH as Europe's most valuable company.
It has since slipped down that table following share price falls of over 10% in 2024 and more than 40% in the year to date.

The companies had earlier reached a short-term extension to prevent disruptions for YouTube TV subscribers.
""We're pleased to have reached a deal that preserves the value of our service for our subscribers,"" YouTube said in a statement shared with CNBC. YouTube, owned by Alphabet, as well as Fox did not disclose the financial terms of the agreement.
YouTube had said Monday that Fox was asking for payments ""far higher than what partners with comparable content offerings receive.""
That comes after Fox launched Fox One, a standalone streaming service last week, costing $19.99 per month or $199.99 annually.
As a result of the standoff, YouTube had warned it may remove Fox Broadcast Network, Fox News and Fox Sports from its platform by 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday.
That could've seen YouTube TV subscribers miss out on a highly anticipated college football match between top-ranked Texas against reigning national champion and third-ranked Ohio State on Sunday, and possibly the start of the National Football League season early next month.
Brendan Carr, chair of the Federal Communications Commission, weighed in Friday, saying he was happy the two companies had reached a deal.
""This is great news for college football fans and avoids blackouts. Enjoy the games this weekend!"" he said in a post on X.
YouTube TV pays broadcasters such as Fox to stream their channels and has roughly 9.4 million subscribers.
In addition to American football, Fox hosts Major League Baseball games, as well as the World Series, which is scheduled to start in late October.
The base plan for YouTube TV costs $82.99 per month and includes over 100 live channels.
YouTube is America's leading media distributor in terms of audience engagement, capturing over 13% of TV watch-time in July, according to Nielsen.

Any imported goods sent through the international postal network that are valued at or under $800 will now be subject to applicable duties. While the winners and losers on the retail landscape and among consumers are debated, customs experts are warning the troubles facing small to medium-sized businesses that relied on the duty-free exemption are just beginning, and will be significant.
""When I think about the de minimis change, the message is clear: tariffs are now universal, regardless of value,"" said Nunzio De Filippis, licensed customs broker and co-CEO of CargoTrans. ""Every package counts. That's a major change in how global e-commerce has operated for the last decade.""
The postal carrier or ""qualified party"" (e.g., USPS, Royal Mail, La Poste) that decides how duties are collected on packages moving through the postal stream must collect those duties from shippers or recipients and remit them to U.S. Customs.
The carriers have two methods to choose from — either a percentage of the country's tariff rate (ad valorem) or a flat per-package fee, De Filippis explained. With the flat rate, there are three tiers: $80 if the IEEPA tariff rate — the trade duties put into effect by Trump using emergency economic powers — is under 16% (such as EU goods at 15%); $160 if it's between 16% and 25% (such as Vietnam at 20%); and $200 if it's above 25% (such as India at 50% or China at 30%). After a six-month transition period, the flat fee option goes away and all packages will be subject to the percentage tariff rate only.
According to Marianne Rowden, trade attorney and CEO of the E-Merchants Trade Council, which represents e-sellers and companies that support e-commerce, the total increase in cost to be paid by small and medium-sized businesses may reach over $71 billion, calculations that she said are based on an average value per package of $48 and data from the U.S Customs and Border Protection for fiscal year 2025.
Availability of air freight for U.S. shippers will also change.
The number of government postal offices shutting the door on shipments bound for the U.S. has grown to include Swiss Post, Japan Post and postal services in Australia, India, New Zealand, the U.K. and other parts of Europe that announced they are suspending shipments.
Deutsche Post and DHL Parcel Germany, both divisions of DHL, stopped U.S.-bound shipments on August 25.
""For shippers, this brings increased costs, complexity, and the need to adapt shipping setups to comply with new customs requirements. They may also face longer processing times and additional administrative steps when importing lower-value goods,"" said Andrew Williams, CEO for DHL Express Americas, who told CNBC it will continue to process inbound shipments to the United States in accordance with the applicable customs rules and regulations. ""Our main priority remains to protect our core service commitment to customers and to minimize any disruption that arises from changes in tariff and trade policy, while remaining compliant with applicable customs rules and regulations,"" Williams said.
Ryan Elliott, chief operating officer at Everstream Analytics, said these global postal changes may catch smaller businesses by surprise. ""We've already seen a number of countries, especially in the EU, pause deliveries to the U.S., explaining that they need more time to work through how they'll collect and transit duties and data,"" said Elliott. ""Small businesses may not be aware of the changes, and many will be caught off guard. But, when the dust settles, my best guess is that many will struggle to comply as they simply don't have the resources to manage through customs requirements,"" he said.
Josh Teitelbaum, an international trade expert at Akin and former U.S. Commerce official, said the way this new tariff change is being implemented is leading to global confusion. ""With many of the world's postal services temporarily suspending service to the U.S., ultimately, consumers and small businesses will be the ones that see increased costs or shipping delays as we undergo more changes to trade policy,"" he said.
Ronald Kleijwegt, CEO at Vinturas, a global supply chain collaboration network serving global manufacturers and OEMs like Mitsubishi and The Association of European Vehicle Logistics, said small businesses will feel the most pain. ""What was once a straightforward cross-border trade is now full of uncertainty,"" he said. ""Larger companies may have the resources to adapt by absorbing costs, rerouting logistics, or investing in compliance. Smaller businesses often do not, which can limit their opportunities, slow innovation, and reduce consumer choice.""
Concerns about the financial health of small businesses are growing. Jacob Bennett, co-founder of small business banking consultant Crux Analytics, said the conversations it is having with banks and credit unions are about the impact of the trade volatility on U.S. small businesses. ""We are trying to help them navigate all of these changes,"" said Bennett. ""So many small and medium-sized businesses operate on such thin margins and don't have the pools of capital that they can fall back on and extend their runway, so many small businesses will unfortunately suffer because of these changes.""
In its explanation for the de minimis elimination, the White House has stressed that over the past decade, the volume of de minimis shipments to the United States exploded, growing from 134 million shipments in 2015 to over 1.36 billion shipments in 2024. Low-cost Asian retail e-commerce companies have been among the major beneficiaries of that boom, such as Shein and Temu. In addition, the Trump administration says de minimis shipments accounted for 90% of all cargo seizures in fiscal year 2024. ""These shipments often broke the law, with 98% of narcotics seized from cargo falling under the de minimis exemption, as well as 97% of counterfeit items seized,"" it stated in a document on the new trade policy.
But for small businesses, the primary fear is that the additional duties will eat into their already thin margins and potentially force them to raise prices.
Shippers that have leveraged de minimis will not have all of the tariff mitigation strategies available that bulk importers have, according to Brian Bourke, chief commercial officer at SEKO Logistics, and he says its elimination will create two likely impacts for consumers: higher prices and less reliable delivery. Bourke said businesses will likely pass on new duty costs for the low-value goods that transit into the United States, and the increased data requirements for the postal channels may lead to delays depending on how the other countries' postal operators are able to handle and manage these new requirements.
""Large businesses that rely on small businesses should immediately get to work figuring out which suppliers they rely on for what and do what they can to either help them comply or find alternative suppliers,"" said Elliott.
Ultimately, the impact of the end of the de minimis exemption will extend beyond U.S. businesses, according to Kleijwegt. ""With de minimis scrapped, EU exporters now face tariffs on low-value items, added customs paperwork, and higher shipping costs when selling to the US. U.S. small businesses now lose out on cheaper European sourcing, while smaller EU firms lose easy duty-free access, which has huge implications for market access on both sides of the Atlantic,"" he said.",9de16623bed5a8d2d88f56d56d738423,trafilatura

With the heirs in disagreement over the homestead's future, Reynolds Ranch is now on the market for $30.7 million.
""It's so hard to make decisions together as a family about the ranch,"" Davis told CNBC. ""If I had the cash, I would buy the whole thing right now and cash everybody out and start over and take the title in a LLC.""
It's a common predicament for family trees that have too many branches, said Davis, who runs the property. Her mother, who died last December, was the last family member who grew up on Reynolds Ranch. Now the family is scattered across the country and some of her relatives live overseas. Some family members who can only visit once or twice a year would rather cash out.
Families like Davis' are increasingly choosing to sell these long-held properties, high-end ranch brokers told CNBC.
The legacy properties are in big demand — even if not at pandemic highs — as deep-pocketed buyers crave wide open skies and a slower pace of life. The so-called ""Yellowstone"" effect also remains in full force, with fans of the Paramount show seeking sprawling properties in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and other Western states.
""All I know is whoever buys this property, when they sit on the porch in the afternoon, sipping their margarita or iced tea, they will think they landed in paradise,"" Davis said.
'Nothing quite like it'
Ranch brokerage Live Water Properties currently has $700 million in listing inventory, up from under $200 million in May 2024, according to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, broker Latham Jenkins. Many of these properties are legacy ranches that are on the market for the first time in generations, he said.
One such listing is Antlers Ranch in Meeteetse, Wyoming, which spans 40,000 acres — nearly three times the size of Manhattan — and is priced at $85 million. Antlers Ranch is on the market for the first time in five generations.
""Large historic properties are less common as many have been broken up and sold off,"" Jenkins said. ""Those that remain are highly desirable.""
These legacy ranches can demand a premium for reasons other than acreage, he said. Many historic ranches — like another one of his listings, Red Hills Ranch, a 190-acre property asking for $65 million — are surrounded by public lands that cannot be developed. Buyers are drawn to that privacy, as well as the ability to hike and fish nearby and see wildlife up close.
""When you sit next to a running river, watching sunrises and sunsets, seeing an elk calf be born, there's nothing quite like it,"" Jenkins said.
Families usually come to him when the next generation has little interest in taking over the ranch, or when the heirs can't come to an agreement. He described it as ""bittersweet"" when these one-of-a-kind properties become available for the first time in generations.
""That's the thing with real estate. The land is perpetual, but the ownership is not,"" he said.
Bill McDavid, a broker at Hall and Hall, represents Rocking Chair Ranch, a 7,200-acre Montana ranch that has been in the same family for more than seven decades.
""The adult children just got to the point where they realized, 'No, it's time for this family to move on and do something else,'"" he said of the sellers behind the property, which is listed at $21.7 million.
Generational transfer of wealth
As ranching has been on the decline for decades, many multigenerational ranches have already changed hands, according to McDavid, who is based in Missoula, Montana. However, McDavid said he is also seeing a rise in families looking to sell ranches they bought 20 to 30 years ago. The owners typically don't have family ties to ranching and decided to buy trophy properties after making their fortune in tech or finance.
""For the buyer who made their money in the dot-com era, they had a grand idea about a family legacy, or whatever,"" he said. ""And then their kids got older, and they didn't move to the ranch because nobody ever moved to the ranch. I mean, the dot-com guy, he came out and visited for at most the summer.""
For the heirs, ""it was never in the cards for them to take over the ranch,"" he said.
Davis said she hopes a local ranching family will buy her California property, which has abundant grazing pastures and water sources. However, she said it's likely that a buyer from Silicon Valley will snap up Reynolds Ranch, which is only a 90-minute drive from San Jose and can accommodate a landing strip for a private plane.
John Onderdonk, who advises on agricultural properties for wealth manager Northern Trust, said the generational transfer of wealth is shaping the market. He is also a fourth-generation cattle rancher and said he is fortunate that his brothers agree on keeping their central California ranch in the family. However, he said many of the families he works with that choose to sell do so because of finances rather than disinterest.
""Real estate is a capital-intensive asset class, and if there isn't liquidity in the portfolio, and the rest of the family isn't able to support that, tough decisions come into play,"" he said.
Legacy ranches, which may come with livestock and cropland, are attractive but require due diligence, according to Ken Mirr of Mirr Ranch Group. For instance, these ranches are usually run by long-tenured managers who might leave when the property is sold and are hard to replace, said the Denver-based broker. If they stay, they might have a rough time adjusting to new ownership, Mirr added.
""Those managers who have been here a long time start thinking that they own the place, right?"" he said. ""Sometimes that's not the best person to be managing the ranch.""
Buyers expecting complete privacy can also get a rude awakening. For example, Mirr said, the previous family could have a longstanding verbal agreement with a neighbor allowing them to cross through their property. Depending on the state, members of the public may also be allowed to fish or wade in rivers located on private property, he said.
McDavid said buyers with deep pockets can have unrealistic expectations, wanting a rural property without sacrificing convenience. For instance, many want to live within a 30-minute drive of a major airport. Buyers also prefer move-in-ready properties, and multigenerational ranches may lack modern amenities.
As for the sellers, they get a windfall but aren't able to replicate the lifestyle that comes with a legacy ranch.
""It's just kind of a unique thing when you're sitting on your porch and you look around and you own everything as far as your eyes can see,"" Davis said. ""It's extremely difficult, the concept of losing the place, but on the other hand it's going to make the next family very happy.""",dc8d183432d92941a81b943a237d637d,trafilatura

Higher-income households had the highest percentage of retail refunds, at 5.3% of their purchases in 2025, according to a recent report by the Bank of America Institute that compared higher-, middle- and lower-income shopper return behavior. The analysis is based on aggregated, anonymous transaction data from U.S. debit and credit card holders who made at least five transactions per month.
Lower-income households had the smallest percentage of retail refunds at around 3.7% of their purchases, according to the report.
Higher-income shoppers are less cash-strapped than lower earners, the report notes, so they are more likely to ""buy items speculatively,"" especially if they know they can ""return it later if they decide it's not right for them.""
This behavior is similar to what shopping experts call ""bracketing,"" or the act of ordering multiple products in different sizes, colors or variations with the intention of keeping a few and returning the rest.
""That's likely to be somewhat easier for someone who has a higher income to do,"" said David Tinsley, lead author of the report and senior economist at the Bank of America Institute.

Bracketing is not really new, said Edgar Dworsky, a consumer advocate and founder of ConsumerWorld.org.
""It's really been around as long as the internet has been around,"" Dworsky said. ""Unlike walking into a department store — going into Macy's and trying on something there, or seeing things in person — you're buying much more blindly online.""
More shoppers are making more frequent returns. Nearly half, or 46%, of consumers return purchased items multiple times a month, according to a 2024 report by Optoro, a returns solutions company. That's a 29% jump from 2023.
While consumers value the ability to return products, experts say retailers have been tightening their return policies in recent years to mitigate the high costs.
Why return policies are tightening
The ability to return unwanted purchases is important for consumers.
About 76% of surveyed respondents consider free returns important when deciding where to shop, per a 2024 report by the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns, a returns shipping company.
Nearly as many respondents, 67%, stated that a negative return experience would deter them from shopping with a retailer again.
The survey polled more than 2,000 consumers who had returned at least one online purchase in 2024, and 249 e-commerce and finance professionals from retailers with at least $500 million in revenue.
Despite shoppers' desires, returns can be costly for retailers. In 2024, retailers expected that about 16.9% of their annual sales would be returned, reaching a total cost of $890 billion for the industry, according to the report.
""Retailers themselves say it's a very expensive business,"" Tinsley said.
To offset the costs, companies have tightened their return policies in recent years. NRF and Happy Returns found that about 66% of retailers began charging for one or more return methods in 2024.
Another way for businesses to cut back on costs is by shortening the window consumers have to make returns, said Dworsky.
""We've generally seen this over the years,"" he said. ""I think back to the old days when you bought something ... and you had maybe 180 days or maybe no return limit.""
As tariffs, or taxes on imported goods, increase the cost of products, companies may look for ways to tighten return policies even further to cut down on expenses, Dworsky said.
""One of the ways of cutting expenses is to cut back on the length of return periods,"" he said.
What to consider before you go shopping
To avoid going through the hassle of returning a product, Dworksy said it's important to understand what you're buying ahead of time.
One way to do that is by checking online reviews from customers who recently purchased the item. Some retailers, like Amazon, will flag whether shoppers tend to keep or return certain products, which can help a prospective buyer gauge the quality of the piece.
Dworksy recommended checking a retailer's return policy before making a purchase, especially if you think there's a chance you won't keep the item. Also look for businesses that offer more flexible terms, he said.
A 2024 report by GoDaddy found that 77% of shoppers check the return policy before making a purchase. The site polled 1,500 consumers last September.
For additional protections, it can be helpful to use a credit card for the transaction, said Dworsky.
Credit cards can offer several kinds of return protections that help cardholders in different ways, such as extending the time a consumer has to return an item or providing the opportunity to dispute charges and get a refund, per Bankrate.
However, make sure to review the fine print on your card and what terms may apply.
""Credit card return protection is a notoriously fickle credit card perk that's increasingly rare,"" notes the Bankrate report.

Speaking at an annual shareholders' meeting on Friday, Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani also disclosed ambitions to list Reliance Jio, India's largest mobile network, in the first half of 2026.
""A decade ago, digital services became a new growth engine for Reliance — the opportunity before us with AI is just as large, if not larger,"" Ambani said, as he revealed a new fully owned subsidiary called Reliance Intelligence.
In a pre-recorded video played during the AGM, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that Reliance would leverage the internet giant's AI and cloud computing capabilities to boost innovation across sectors like energy, retail, telecommunications and financial services.
The pair will establish a dedicated cloud region in India, powered by clean energy provided by Reliance Industries and connected through Jio's network.
Separately, Ambani also announced a new joint venture with Meta to make use of the tech group's open-source AI models and deliver ""sovereign, enterprise-ready AI for India.""
Under the new venture, Reliance Industries and Meta have committed an initial investment of $100 million to capitalize the unit in a ratio of 70% and 30% respectively, the two companies said in a joint statement Friday.
Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg hailed the partnership as ""a key step forward towards ensuring that everyone has access to AI and eventually super intelligence.""
The partnerships signal a deeper push from U.S. tech names into India at a time when the country is seeing significant economic growth. It is not the first time that either Google and Meta has shown an interest in Reliance.
In 2020, Meta invested $5.7 billion into Jio Platforms, which is the parent company of Reliance Jio. Google separately announced a $4.5 billion investment in Jio Platforms that same year.
Jio Platforms owns a number of brands, including its telecommunications business Reliance Jio, which has grown rapidly over the past decade thanks to competitive pricing.

While the United States leans heavily on voluntary 401(k)-style savings plans, other nations rely on mandatory contributions or more traditional pensions to ensure broad coverage and steady income.
Mercer CFA Institute Global Pension Index takes these structural differences into consideration when ranking some of the world's biggest retirement systems.
""We do it because we want to give a picture of the retirement landscape,"" said Christine Mahoney, global pensions leader at Mercer, a consulting firm. ""We try to look at what the public systems are, what the private systems are, and look at how people will fare in retirement across all of those.""
The U.S. retirement system received a C+ rating from the Mercer CFA Institute Global Pension Index in 2024. It ranked 29 out of 48 global pension systems assessed.
""It means that the system is solid, designed well, but there is a significant risk,"" said Mahoney. ""And if we don't clear that risk up, the system could be in some jeopardy.""
How the U.S. could 'significantly' improve its C+ grade
Countries around the world are raising their retirement ages, as well as requiring mandatory contributions into personal retirement savings, according to research from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Experts suggest this can help address modern problems such as people living longer and fewer workers paying into the system.
""For the U.S. system, the thing that could change that grade significantly, the most important is actually coverage,"" Mahoney said. ""Our 401(k) plans are voluntary.""
The Netherlands is frequently given a top score in the index. Mahoney says one of the key features that makes the Dutch system stand out is mandatory contributions.
There are two broad models for retirement plans, and they function very differently:
- A defined contribution plan, such as a 401(k) or individual retirement account, works like a bucket. Workers decide how much to put in, how to invest it and, in some cases, employers add to the bucket as well. The balance at retirement depends on contributions and investment returns, leaving the final outcome uncertain. In the United States, participation in these plans is voluntary, and workers typically must choose to opt in.
- A defined benefit plan resembles a faucet. Programs like Social Security or employer-sponsored pensions in the U.S. promise a steady stream of income in retirement, often based on salary and years of service. It's frequently required that the worker fund the program, either through taxes or as grounds for employment. Employers or governments manage the funding and investment risk, while retirees receive predictable monthly payments, typically for life.
What countries like the Netherlands and Australia do differently from the U.S. is require workers to pay into defined contribution plans.
""In the Netherlands ... there's a mandatory contribution made,"" Mahoney said. ""You can't opt out of it either as an employer or as an employee. So getting money [into defined contribution accounts] in the U.S. is a real challenge because it is a voluntary system. If we're going to stay voluntary, then getting it easier to launch a plan and join a plan is the critical thing for [the U.S.] to focus on.""

Speaking at Hong Kong's Bitcoin Asia 2025 conference, Eric Trump discussed his strong involvement in the crypto space.
""I really believe in the next several years, Bitcoin hits a million dollars. There's no question,"" he said, adding that 90% of his time is now spent with the crypto community.
During his panel, the American businessman and former reality TV presenter also showered praise on Simon Gerovich, president and CEO of Japanese Bitcoin treasury company Metaplanet. Eric joined the Tokyo-listed company's board of advisors earlier this year.
Bitcoin's price has risen about 86% in the last 12 months amid buoyant investor sentiment surrounding President's Trump's election victory and a more positive U.S. regulatory environment on crypto. However, it's worth noting that cryptocurrencies generally can be highly volatile and the space has been shrouded in the past by illicit activity and corporate scandals. In 2022, bitcoin and other digital currencies slumped sharply after a slew of major crypto companies went bankrupt.
Asia push
Eric Trump, along with his brother Donald Trump Jr, have become major players in the Trump family's growing crypto empire. The two are co-founders of the bitcoin-mining venture American Bitcoin and also help manage the Trump family-backed project World Liberty Financial.
Now the brothers are broadening their push into digital assets to Asia. Soon after his Hong Kong visit, Eric Trump is reportedly headed to Japan to attend a shareholder meeting of Metaplanet, according to a recent report from Bloomberg News.
Later in September, both Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are expected to speak at a South Korean crypto conference, and the pair is slated to appear as key speakers at Singapore's Token 2049, one of the world's largest crypto events.
Once a skeptic of cryptocurrencies, President Trump has also embraced the crypto industry, branding himself as the first ""crypto president.""
""The Bitcoin community embraced my father unlike anything I had ever seen before,"" Eric Trump said Friday adding: ""And I hope that's paid off in spades.""
The Trump administration has launched a number of executive orders and backed policies welcomed by the digital asset industry and has filled his cabinet with crypto advocates like David Sacks, the White House's AI and crypto czar.
Trump has also been involved in crypto business ventures, including World Liberty Financial and his $TRUMP meme coin, leading to accusations of corruption and self-dealing from opposition lawmakers, as well as calls for ethics investigations.
Given the shared interests between the American president and his son's crypto activities, market watchers will be monitoring how the two brothers are received by government officials during their Asia tour.
The visits come against the backdrop of President Trump's ongoing global trade war, which has made Asia a major target.
A Hong Kong official and a lawmaker withdrew from a Bitcoin Asia conference in the city following advice not to engage with Eric Trump, the South China Morning Post reported Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.
An archived version of the event webpage confirmed that Eric Yip, executive director at the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), and lawmaker Johnny Ng had previously been on the list of speakers for the event, before being removed.
The SFC told CNBC that Yip was unable to attend the event because of a business trip, while the South China Morning Post reported that Ng said he withdrew for family reasons.
The Hong Kong legislative council did not respond to a request for comment from CNBC.

Annual manufacturing and services growth were at 7.7% and 9.3%, respectively, with the construction sector expanding by 7.6%.
While the overall gross domestic product print for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2026 came in higher than the 6.7% expansion forecast by economists in a Reuters poll, economists pointed to signs of a slowdown.
India's nominal GDP — which does not account for inflation or deflation — fell to 8.8% over April-June, compared to 10.8% in the previous quarter.
""Nominal GDP growth is lower than previous quarters but because the deflator is so soft that the real GDP looks extremely strong,"" says Anubhuti Sahay, head of Indian economic research at Standard Chartered.
A deflator measures the amount by which total output is reduced by inflation.
While the deflator has played a major role in making the real GDP growth look better, Sahay says on the manufacturing front corporate sector earnings have done well.
Outlook
The U.S.' 50% tariffs on Indian imports came into effect on Wednesday, with most economists seeing the trade measure playing into softening growth for India's economy in the coming quarters.
The Indian rupee fell to record lows on Friday, breaching the 88-per-dollar mark for the first time over concerns that steep U.S. tariffs could hurt growth and further hit portfolio flows.
Even so, ""the surprise acceleration in India's GDP growth in Q2 means that the economy is still on course to expand by a world-beating 7% this year, despite the upcoming hit from punitive US tariffs,"" said Joe Maher, assistant economist at Capital Economics.
To curb the impact of US tariff's India's central bank cut policy rate to 5.5%, lowering it by 50 basis point, in June. While the central bank maintained the status quo in its August policy, there are indications that it may cut rates once again in the second half of the year if growth slows down.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose more than 2 basis points to 4.23%, while the 30-year bond yield climbed more than 5 basis points to 4.926%.
One basis point is equal to 0.01%, and yields move inversely to prices.
The personal consumption expenditures price index rose 2.6% in July on a year-over-year basis, matching a Dow Jones estimate. Core PCE, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.9%, matching economists' expectations but a slight acceleration from June — signaling inflation may not be trending in the right direction.
""The consensus core PCE print will do nothing to detract the focus from next week's payroll data,"" Greg Wilensky, head of U.S. fixed income at Janus Henderson Investors, said in a note. ""Unless we see a strong bounce back in the headline payroll number, the path to a 25 basis point cut at the September meeting will be very clear.""
Investors are also keeping an eye on the Trump-Cook fight. A hearing on Cook's request to block Trump from firing her ended Friday without a ruling, indicating her fate is still uncertain.
Trump early Friday asked a judge to deny a request by Cook to issue an injunction barring the president from firing her, while the Fed in a separate court filing took no position on the merits of Cook's lawsuit challenging her termination but asked the judge to issue a ""prompt ruling"" to resolve the dispute.
Cook's removal would give Trump the opportunity to create a board of governors at the Fed who are more open to lower interest rates.
Trump first announced his plans to remove Cook in a letter posted on social media on Monday, referencing allegations made by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte that Cook made false statements on applications for one or more of her home mortgages.
Cook filed a lawsuit to challenge the decision on Thursday, which was then followed by Pulte sending another criminal referral regarding the Fed official and some of her properties.

German inflation rose by a higher-than-expected 2.1% in August, preliminary data showed Friday, exceeding the 2% expectations of analysts polled by Reuters. Inflation, which is harmonized for comparability across the euro zone, had risen by a cooler-than-expected 1.8% in July.
Germany's core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, was unchanged from the previous month at 2.7% in August, the country's statistics office Destatis said.
Yields on German government bonds, known as Bunds, were little changed shortly after the data release, which came on the same day that labor office figures showed the number of unemployed people jumped to 3.025 million in August, to a rate of 6.4%.
The broader euro zone inflation reading, due Tuesday, will offer further insight into the economic impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies, which have hit various European sectors in recent months.
The U.S. and EU struck a trade agreement in July, including a 15% tariff rate on many EU goods exported to the U.S. Fresh details released earlier this month suggested that this blanket rate will also be applied to some hotly contested sectors like pharmaceuticals — but crucial questions still remain unanswered, leaving businesses on edge.
The tariffs are widely expected to drive prices higher in the U.S., but their effect on costs elsewhere is less clear.
Germany's highly export-driven economy has long been hovering near the flatline. The country's gross domestic product expanded by 0.3% in the first quarter, before contracting by 0.3% in the following period, according to the latest data from Destatis.
""It remains to be seen how European and US companies will react to US tariffs. While one scenario could see prices falling in the eurozone due to overcapacity and weaker sales in the US, globally operating companies might try to actually increase prices in Europe in order to offset profit-squeezing in the US,"" said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, in a note.
""A rather domestic theme will be the cooling of the German labour market, which should take away wage pressures and consequently inflationary pressures,"" he added, noting that the inflationary hike in Germany now weakens the case for the European Central Bank to press ahead with an interest rate cut at its September meeting.

For nearly a decade, shipments valued under $800 were allowed to enter the country virtually duty-free and with less oversight. Now, those shipments from the likes of Tapestry, Lululemon and just about any other retailer with an online presence will be tariffed and processed in the same way that larger packages are handled.
In May, Trump ended the exemption for goods coming from China and Hong Kong, and on July 30 he expanded the rollback to all countries, calling it a ""catastrophic loophole"" that's been used to evade tariffs and get ""unsafe or below-market"" products into the U.S.
The de minimis exemption had previously been slated to end in July 2027 as part of sweeping legislation passed by Congress, but Trump's executive order eliminated the provision much sooner, giving businesses, customs officials and postal services less time to prepare.
""The ending of that under-$800-per-person-per-day rule, from a global perspective, is about to probably cause a bit of pandemonium,"" said Lynlee Brown, a partner in the global trade division at accounting firm EY. ""There's a financial implication, there's an operational implication, and then there's pure compliance, right? Like, these have all been informal entries. No one's really looked at them.""
Already, the sudden change has snarled supply chains from France to Singapore and led post offices across the world to temporarily suspend shipments to the U.S. so they can ensure their systems are updated and able to comply with the new regulations.
It's forced businesses both large and small to rethink not just their supply chains, but their overall business models, because of the impact the change could have on their bottom lines – setting off a panic in boardrooms across the country, logistics experts said.
""Obviously it's a big change for operating models for companies, not just the Sheins and the Temus, but for companies that have historically had e-com and brick-and-mortar stores,"" Brown said.
The change also means consumers, already are under pressure from persistent inflation and high interest rates, could now see even higher prices on a wide range of goods, from Colombian bathing suits to specialty ramen subscription boxes shipped straight from Japan.
The end of de minimis could cost U.S. consumers at least $10.9 billion, or $136 per family, according to a 2025 paper by Pablo Fajgelbaum and Amit Khandelwal for the National Bureau of Economic Research. The research found low-income and minority consumers would feel the biggest impact as they rely more on the cheaper, imported purchases.
Tailoring supply chains
Popularized by Chinese e-tailers Shein and Temu, use of the de minimis exemption has exploded in the last decade, ballooning from 134 million shipments in 2015 to more than 1.36 billion in 2024. Before the recent change to limit its use, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it was processing more than 4 million de minimis shipments into the country each day.
A 2023 House report found more than 60% of de minimis shipments in 2021 came from China, but because the packages require less information than larger containers, very little information is known about their origins and the types of goods they contain. That opacity is one of the key reasons why both former President Joe Biden and Trump sought to curtail or end the exemption.
Both administrations have said that the exemption was overused and abused and that it's made it difficult for CBP officials to target and block illegal or unsafe shipments coming into the U.S. because the packages aren't subject to the same level of scrutiny as larger containers.
""We didn't have any compliance information … on those shipments, and then that is where the danger of drugs and whatnot being in those shipments"" comes in, said Irina Vaysfeld, a principal in KPMG's trade and customs practice.
The Biden administration particularly focused on how the exemption allowed goods made with forced labor to make it into the country in violation of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. Meanwhile, Trump has said the exemption has been used to ship fentanyl and other synthetic opioids into the U.S. In a fact sheet published on July 30, the White House said 90% of all cargo seizures in fiscal 2024, including 98% of narcotics seizures and 97% of intellectual property rights seizures, originated as de minimis shipments.
Across the globe, it's common for countries to allow low-value shipments to be imported duty-free as a means to streamline and facilitate global trade, but typically, it's for packages valued around $200, not $800, said EY's Brown.
Until 2016, the U.S. threshold for low-value shipments was also $200, but it was changed to $800 when Congress passed the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act, which sought to benefit businesses, U.S. consumers and the overall U.S. economy, according to the Congressional Research Service. It said higher thresholds provide a ""significant economic benefit"" to both business and shoppers and thus, the overall economy.
While well intentioned, the law came with unintended consequences, said Brown.
The ""rise in value, from $200 to $800, just made it kind of like a free for all to say, 'OK, everything come in,'"" she said.
Eventually companies designed supply chains around the exemption: They set up bonded warehouses, where duties can be deferred prior to export, in places like Canada and Mexico and then imported goods in bulk to those regions before sending them across the border one by one, duty-free, as customer orders rolled in, said Brown.
""Companies have really laid out their supply chain in a very specific way [around de minimis] and that's really the crux of the issue,"" said KPMG's Vaysfeld. ""The way that the supply chain has been laid out now may need to change.""
The impact on the retail industry
Until the rise of Shein and Temu, the de minimis exemption was rarely discussed in retail circles. Soon, the e-commerce behemoths began facing widespread criticism for their use of what many called a loophole.
In 2023, the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party released a report on Shein and Temu and said the two companies were ""likely responsible for more than 30 percent of all packages shipped to the United States daily under the de minimis provision, and likely nearly half of all de minimis shipments to the U.S. from China.""
The revelation sparked widespread consternation among retail executives, lobbyists and government officials who said the companies' use of the exemption was unfair competition.
However, behind closed doors, companies large and small began mimicking the same model after realizing how it could reduce the steep costs that come along with selling goods online.
Direct-to-consumer companies that only have online presences have relied on it more heavily, so much so that their businesses may not work without it, said Vaysfeld.
""Some of the companies we've spoken to, they've modeled out, if the tariffs continue for one year, for two years, how does that impact their profitability, and they know how long they can last,"" said Vaysfeld. ""These aren't the huge companies, right? These are the smaller companies. … Depending on what country they're sourcing from or where they're manufacturing, it could really impact their profitability that they can't stay in business for the long term.""
On Friday, a federal appeals court ruled that most of Trump's steep tariffs, including his so-called ""reciprocal tariffs"" were illegal, leaving the toll on companies even more uncertain.
While smaller, digital companies are more exposed, ""pretty much most companies that you can think of"" had been using the exemption in some form before it ended, said Vaysfeld.
Take Coach and Kate Spade's parent company Tapestry: About 13% to 14% of the company's sales were previously covered under de minimis and will now be subject to a 30% tariff, according to an estimate by equity research firm Barclays.
On the company's earnings call earlier this month, Chief Financial Officer Scott Roe said tariffs will hit its profits by a total of $160 million this year, including the impact of the end of de minimis. That amounts to about 2.3% of margin headwind, he said.
Shares of the company fell nearly 16% the day that Tapestry reported the profit hit.
In a statement, Roe said Tapestry used de minimis to help support its strong online business, adding it is a practice that ""many companies with sophisticated supply chains have been doing for years.""
To help offset its termination, he said Tapestry is looking for ways to reduce costs and is leaning on its manufacturing footprint across many different countries.
Canadian retailer Lululemon is another company that uses de minimis, according to Wells Fargo. Last week, the bank cut its price target on the company's stock from $225 to $205, citing the end of de minimis. In the note, Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow said the equity research firm sees a potential 90 cent to $1.10 headwind to Lululemon's earnings per share from the de minimis elimination.
Lululemon declined to comment, citing the company's quiet period ahead of its reporting earnings.
The National Retail Federation, the industry's largest trade organization, has not taken a position in favor of or against the exemption. It has members who both supported and opposed the policy, said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at NRF.
Retailers of all sizes, including independent sellers with digital storefronts, have used the approach as ""a convenient way to get products to the consumer"" for less, Gold said.
""Their costs are going to go up and those costs could be passed on to the consumer at the end of the day,"" Gold said.
Marketplace impact
The most acute impact of the end of de minimis is expected to be felt on online marketplaces where millions of small businesses sell goods like Etsy, eBay and Shopify and used de minimis to defray costs when sending online orders from other parts of the globe to the U.S.
American shoppers have gotten used to buying artwork, coffee mugs, T-shirts and other items from merchants outside the country without paying duties. With that tariff exemption gone, consumers could face higher costs and a more limited selection of items to choose from.
Etsy, eBay and some other retailers sought to defend the loophole prior to its removal, submitting public comments on proposed de minimis regulation by the CBP. An eBay public policy executive said the company was concerned that restrictions to de minimis ""would impose significant burdens on American consumers and importers.""
Etsy's head of public policy, Jeffrey Zubricki, said the artisan marketplace supports ""smart U.S. de minimis reform,"" but that it was wary of changes that could ""disproportionately affect small American sellers.""
""These exemptions are a powerful tool that help small creators, artisans and makers participate in and navigate cross-border trade,"" Zubricki wrote in a March letter to CBP.
An Etsy spokesperson declined to comment on the policy change. Etsy CFO Lanny Baker said at a Bernstein conference in May that transactions between U.S. buyers and European sellers make up about 25% of the company's gross merchandise sales.
EBay didn't immediately provide a comment in response to a request from CNBC. The company warned in its latest earnings report that the end of de minimis outside of China could impact its guidance, though CEO Jamie Iannone told CNBC in July that he believes eBay is generally ""well suited"" to navigate the shifting trade environment.
Some eBay and Etsy sellers based in the U.K., Canada and other countries are temporarily closing off their businesses to the U.S. as they work out a plan to navigate the higher tariffs. Blair Nadeau, who owns a Canadian bridal accessories company, was forced to take that step this week.
""This is devastating on so many levels and millions of small businesses worldwide are now having their careers, passions and livelihoods threatened,"" Nadeau wrote in an Instagram post on Tuesday. ""Just this past hour I have had to turn away two U.S. customers and it broke my heart.""
Nadeau sells her bespoke wedding veils, jewelry and hair adornments through her own website and on Etsy, where 70% of her customer base is in the U.S. The de minimis provision had been a ""lifeline"" for many Canadian businesses to get their products in the hands of American consumers, Nadeau said in an interview.
""This is really hitting me,"" Nadeau said. ""It's like all of a sudden 70% of your salary has been removed overnight.""
In the absence of de minimis, online merchants are faced with either paying import charges upfront and potentially passing those costs on to shoppers through price hikes, or shipping products ""delivery duty unpaid,"" in which case it's the customer's responsibility to pay any duties upon arrival.
Alexandra Birchmore, an artist based in the Cotswolds region of England, said she expects to raise the price of her oil paintings on Etsy by 10% as a result of paying the duties upfront.
""At the moment every small business forum I am on is in chaos about this,"" Birchmore said. ""It looks to me to be a disaster where no one benefits.""
Market share shifts
The disruption could end up being a boon for the likes of Amazon and Walmart. U.S. consumers may turn to major retailers if they face steeper prices elsewhere, as well as potential shipping delays due to backlogs or other issues at the border.
Amazon, in particular, has already proven resilient after the U.S. axed the de minimis provision for shipments from China and Hong Kong in May. The company's sales increased 13% in the three-month period that ended June 30, compared with 10% growth in the prior quarter. Amazon's unit sales grew 12%, an acceleration from the first quarter.
Both Amazon and Walmart have fulfillment operations in the U.S. that allow overseas businesses to ship items in bulk and store them in the companies' warehouses before they're dispatched to shoppers. Shein and Temu largely eschewed the model in the past in favor of the de minimis exception, but they've since moved to open more warehouses in the U.S. in the wake of rising tariffs.
Since the exemption ended on Chinese imports in May, the impact on Shein and Temu has been swift. Temu was forced to change its business model in the U.S. and stop shipping products to American consumers from Chinese factories.
The end of de minimis, as well as Trump's new tariffs on Chinese imports, also forced Temu to raise prices, rein in its aggressive online advertising push and adjust which goods were available to American shoppers.
The Financial Times reported on Tuesday that Temu has resumed shipping goods to the U.S. from Chinese factories and will also increase its advertising spend following what it called a ""truce"" between Washington and Beijing.
Temu didn't return a request for comment.
Meanwhile, Shein has been forced to raise prices and daily active users on both platforms in the U.S. have fallen since the de minimis loophole was closed, CNBC previously reported.

Cook's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, at that hearing blasted the Department of Justice's argument that Trump had legal cause to remove Cook because of suggestions by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte that she committed mortgage fraud in documents for two properties in Atlanta and Ann Arbor, Michigan, before joining the Fed.
""You can't have Director Pulte's crazy midnight tweets be the cause,"" Lowell told Judge Jia Cobb in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.
Pulte, who was appointed by Trump, has served as an attack dog for the president in his efforts to pressure the Fed to cut interest rates.
Cook, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other members of the seven-seat Fed board so far have resisted that pressure.
Powell asked Cobb to keep in place the ""status quo"" — Cook remaining in her job — for now, until a final decision by the judge on whether Trump has grounds to fire her.
That could keep Cook on the board for its upcoming meetings on whether to hold interest rates steady or cut them.
A DOJ lawyer told Cobb that it is up to Trump's ""discretion"" to determine if he has cause to fire a Fed governor.
The Federal Reserve Act says a president can only remove a Fed governor for cause.
Cook's lawsuit against Trump challenging her removal could end with the Supreme Court determining if Trump had cause in her case, and potentially set the standard for what constitutes cause for future presidents.
Cobb said at the beginning of the hearing, ""This case obviously raises some important questions that may be of first impression, particularly as it applies to this board.""
If Trump succeeds in firing Cook, he would be on track to have nominated a majority the Fed board.
Cobb ended the hearing after two hours of arguments without ruling on Cook's request for a temporary restraining order that would keep her in her Senate-confirmed position indefinitely. Cook, whose term ends in January 2038, became the first Black woman to serve on the Fed board after she was nominated by then-President Joe Biden in 2022.
It is not clear when Cobb will issue a decision on Cook's request for a TRO.
The judge suggested that the attorneys for both sides confer and determine whether they want her to first rule on the restraining order request, or whether they want her to issue a decision on potential requests for a preliminary injunction or summary judgment to restrict Trump from booting her from the Fed.
Cobb also said she was giving the parties more time to supplement in writing the arguments they made in open court on Friday.
The Fed, in a court filing before the hearing, said it would not make arguments on the merits of Cook's request for a temporary restraining order.
But the central bank also asked Cobb to issue a ""prompt ruling"" on her motion.
The Fed also told Cobb that it intends ""to follow any order this Court issues.""
The Fed Board of Governors and Powell were named as co-defendants Thursday in Cook's suit against Trump challenging the legality of his purported firing of her.
Powell and the Fed board were sued only to the extent that at some point they might execute Trump's wishes.
Trump has said he wants to fire Cook because of FHFA chief Pulte's prior allegations that she potentially committed mortgage fraud in statements she made on documents related to the properties in Atlanta and Ann Arbor.
On Thursday night, Pulte said he had filed a second criminal referral against Cook with the Department of Justice related to a mortgage for a condominium in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and alleged misrepresentations she made about that condo and the two other homes in government ethics filings during her time as a Fed governor.
Lowell on Friday called Pulte's new referral ""an obvious smear campaign aimed at discrediting Gov. Cook by a political operative who has taken to social media more than 30 times in the last two days and demanded her removal before any review of the facts or evidence.""
""Nothing in these vague, unsubstantiated allegations has any relevance to Gov Cook's role at the Federal Reserve, and they in no way justify her removal from the Board,"" Lowell said.",2a9c076d292be65988a612adc43e3a58,trafilatura

CEO Max Levchin told CNBC on ""Money Movers"" Friday that the company is ""firing on all pistons.""
Earnings came in at 20 cents a share and nearly doubled analyst expectations, with revenue also topping estimates at $876 million, up 33% from a year earlier.
Net income was $69.2 million for the quarter, compared with a loss of $45.1 million in the same period last year.
""You can see that consumers are transacting more and more frequently,"" Levchin told CNBC. ""The consumer growth itself, the merchant growth, all these things compound to just drive usage more and more.""
The firm also offered higher guidance for fiscal 2026 and upbeat guidance for the current quarter.
Levchin noted strength in the consumer and momentum in the U.S. on an investor call Thursday.
""We feel quite excellent about our ability to get paid back on time,"" he said.
Going into the print, the big question was whether losing Walmart to rival Klarna would drag on results. Instead, Affirm's key volume metric jumped 44% from the year-ago quarter and beat the street by nearly a billion dollars, helped by its partnerships with Shopify and Amazon.
Affirm, which went public in 2021, faces intensifying competition in e-commerce as Klarna gains share and prepares for an IPO — even as Affirm deepens ties with major retailers, including a deal with Apple last year.
Affirm's business is closely tied to consumer spending, with its online loans popular among sellers of electronics, apparel and travel.
After contracting in the first quarter on an import surge ahead of President Donald Trump's April tariffs, the U.S. economy expanded 3.3% in the second quarter, stronger than initially estimated, as consumers and businesses held up despite tariff volatility.
The company has also been making a big push to win share at the point of sale with the Affirm Card — its biggest bet for driving broader usage.
That strategy is gaining traction: card GMV grew 132% to $1.2 billion, active cardholders nearly doubled to 2.3 million, and in-store spend surged 187%. Zero-percent APR loans more than tripled and now account for about 14% of card volume.
Levchin downplayed concerns about 0% APR loans, with 50% of new users entering the Affirm ecosystem through the ""compelling"" rate.
""These 0% deals are still underwritten every time,"" he told CNBC on Friday. ""If we think the person cannot afford to borrow money, we will very sadly and compassionately tell them, 'Hey, this isn't for you. It's not going to work out.' ""
Levchin also highlighted artificial intelligence as a bright spot, noting that early deployments of Affirm's new AdaptAI system have already delivered an average 5% lift in merchant volume — underscoring the company's long-standing use of machine learning to power credit scoring and checkout optimization.

After years of high-profile romances and breakups, in the fall of 2023, Swift attended her first Kansas City Chiefs NFL game where tight end Travis Kelce was playing. In December of that year, she spoke about their relationship publicly in a Time Magazine article, confirming they'd started dating that summer.
And on Tuesday, the 35-year-old announced that she and Kelce were engaged.
Despite the ups and downs of Swift's romantic life, this relationship is ""a recipe for resilience, not just a tabloid fling,"" said psychologist and relationship expert at My Thriving Mind Veronica West via email.
Here's why.
They were private first
To begin with, Swift and Kelce began dating in private.
""We actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew,"" Swift said in the Time article about the beginning of their courtship, ""which I'm grateful for, because we got to get to know each other.""
That time away from the spotlight is ""like secret rehearsal time before the big stage show,"" said West. And it lays a strong foundation.
""Couples who get that 'quiet build-up' tend to last longer because they've tested the connection without all the noise of public opinion.""
They cheer each other on
The two are very supportive of each other.
Swift has been at numerous of Kelce's games, and Kelce has been at multiple of Swift's concerts. In a 2025 GQ interview, Kelce gushed about her performance prowess. ""She is so good at mesmerizing everybody and making everybody feel like it's an intimate situation,"" he said.
""It's basically a public pep rally for each other,"" says West of this mutual support. ""When your partner is your loudest cheerleader, you don't just feel supported, you feel celebrated. That turns love into a team sport, and it's hard to beat that kind of energy.""
They're playful
Their relationship seems playful.
The two started dating after Kelce admitted on his podcast, ""New Heights,"" that he'd attended a show on Swift's Eras tour and hoped to give her a friendship bracelet with his number on it. ""I was disappointed that she doesn't talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice,"" he said.
Swift recently appeared on ""New Heights,"" saying, ""this podcast got me a boyfriend, ever since Travis decided to use it as his personal dating app.""
When announcing on Instagram that the two were engaged, Swift also referred to them as ""your English teacher and your gym teacher.""
""Those aren't PR props, they're genuine signs of two people who can still be silly together,"" said West. And those fun moments can really hold keep a relationship together.
""The couples who last aren't the ones staging grand gestures every week, they're the ones laughing over burnt pasta or sending silly memes,"" she said.
They set healthy boundaries
Finally, the couple appears to set boundaries. Though they're supportive, ""they're not glued at the hip,"" said West.
""Taylor isn't at every game,"" she said. ""Travis isn't popping up at every tour stop. That balance is gold: It's togetherness without losing individuality, and that's what makes a couple strong long-term.""
As far as lessons to take away from the relationship, ""cheer each other on, keep part of your world private, laugh often, and don't be afraid of giving each other breathing space,"" said West.
""It's not the fireworks that keep love alive — it's the little daily rituals that make your partner feel like both your best friend and biggest fan.""

""The Vice President is grateful to the United States Secret Service for their professionalism, dedication, and unwavering commitment to safety,"" the adviser said.
A senior White House official confirmed Friday that Trump had revoked Harris' Secret Service detail, adding that vice presidents typically only get six months of protection when they leave office.
Congress passed legislation in 2008 that authorized the Secret Service to protect former vice presidents, their spouses and their children under 16 years old for up to six months after the end of a vice president's term.
Read more from NBC News:
A Secret Service official told NBC that while that's true, then-President Joe Biden signed an executive memorandum in January extending Harris' protection to 18 months.
Aides to the former president didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
The decision, first reported by CNN, is among a number of actions Trump and his administration have taken to target people who worked for the Biden administration. Some have included removing privileges like security clearances for former intelligence officials. During his second term so far, Trump has also taken aim at some of his own former officials, including removing the security details for former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former national security adviser John Bolton.
The change was relayed Thursday from the White House to the Department of Homeland Security to the Secret Service, a federal official said, and the protection for Harris will end Sept. 1.
Harris' detail will move to an assignment in New York to work on the United Nations General Assembly, where significant preparation is already underway for that event next month. The detail will later be reassigned.
Earlier this year, Trump announced that he was terminating Secret Service protection for Biden's two adult children, Hunter Biden and Ashley Biden, whose protection their father had extended. Biden had also extended protection to former Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas due to threats, but Trump revoked that as well.
Federal law requires that the Secret Service provide protection to former presidents and their spouses for the rest of their lives unless they decline it. The agency is also authorized to protect former presidents' children until age 16.
Harris revealed in July that she had decided not to run for governor of California next year, and it's not yet clear if she plans to run for president again in 2028.
""For now, my leadership — and public service — will not be in elected office,"" she continued. ""I look forward to getting back out and listening to the American people, helping elect Democrats across the nation who will fight fearlessly, and sharing more details in the months ahead about my own plans.""
Like Trump, Biden and other officials, Harris faced a spate of threats as vice president, as threats to public officials in general have intensified.
This comes less than a month before Harris is scheduled to launch her 15-city book tour promoting her memoir ""107 days"" about her very short presidential run against Trump last year after Biden dropped out of the race.",98f41463081b7206e6fa8a9c8cd65f35,trafilatura

Gold is viewed by investors as a safe-haven asset during times of financial and geopolitical instability. Trump's repeated attacks on the Federal Reserve are raising concern in some corners of the market that the U.S. central bank's capacity to make independent monetary decisions is at risk. Gold futures have been on a tear this year, gaining about 31% to recently trade at about $3,473. ""In our view, conditions that have led to recent strength in gold prices look likely to persist,"" Bank of America analysts led Jason Fairclough told clients.

He is the first president to attempt to oust a Fed governor, in a move that Wall Street largely views as an attempt to gain control over the central bank. If Trump is successful and moves quickly to name a Cook replacement, he would have a path to consolidate a majority on the Fed board. This would potentially give him the ability to reshape the Federal Open Market Committee and gain more influence over interest rate decisions. Trump's pick to fill a vacancy on the Fed board, Stephen Miran, is scheduled for a hearing before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Sept. 4.

Ambarella, which is known for its system-on-chip semiconductors and software used for edge artificial intelligence, said it expects fiscal third-quarter revenue between $100 million and $108 million, beating the LSEG estimate of $91 million.
The company boosted its fiscal-year revenue growth outlook to a range of 31%-35%, to $379 million at the midpoint, which topped the $350 million expected by LSEG.

The company had net income of $194.8 million, or 22 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $193.3 million, a loss of 22 cents per share, during the same period last year.
For the fiscal third quarter, the company called for revenue to be $2.06 billion, plus or minus 5%. That was slightly below the $2.11 billion forecast by analysts, according to LSEG.
Marvell is known for creating customized chips and hardware, which it offers to cloud providers such as Amazon and Microsoft.
Sales in its data center segment reached $1.49 billion during the quarter, which fell short of Wall Street's projected $1.51 billion, according to StreetAccount.
On a conference call with investors on Thursday, Murphy said the company expects ""overall data center revenue in Q3 to be flat sequentially,"" which he attributed to nonlinear growth in its custom AI chips business. Fourth-quarter growth is expected to be ""substantially stronger"" than the third quarter, Murphy said.
He added that ""lumpiness"" of the guidance is normal as large hyperscalers build out infrastructure.
Still, some investors were hoping for greater clarity on the company's pipeline of new customers.
""Without this, we find it very difficult underwriting the company's 20% data center market share target,"" Cantor analysts wrote in a Thursday note to clients. ""Thus, we wait for more bottoms up granularity before potentially turning more positive.""
Analysts at Bank of America downgraded Marvell's stock to neutral from buy on Friday and lowered their price target to $78 per share from $90, partly on concerns around the company's AI growth prospects ""in the near/medium term.""",5a72db7ced2920ca09b79c1ca7c6e84d,trafilatura

The wind industry has been in Trump's crosshairs since his first day in office, when he halted new leases for offshore wind projects. But his administration has escalated its attacks in recent days.
""Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America's maritime industry,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. The funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, according to the department.
Many of the projects affected by the funding cancellation are staging areas that would be used to build offshore wind turbines. The single biggest pledge that was canceled is Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind in northern California, with about $427 million in federal support withdrawn.
Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind is a planned marine terminal that would be used to launch and assemble turbines in support of California's goal of building 25 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2045.
New England halt
The Department of the Interior last week ordered Denmark's Orsted A/S to halt work on the Revolution Wind project off the coast of New England. The fully permitted project is 80% complete. Orsted shares tumbled to a record low on Monday in the aftermath of the work stoppage.
Trump said last week that his administration will not approve solar or wind projects in the U.S. Renewable executives are warning that the president's campaign against renewable energy will lead to a spike in power prices.
Funds for the following projects have been withdrawn:
- Sparrows Point Steel Marshalling Port project in Baltimore, Maryland ($47,392,500)
- Bridgeport Port Authority Operations and Maintenance Wind Port project in Connecticut ($10,530,000)
- Wind Port at Paulsboro in New Jersey ($20,494,025)
- Arthur Kill Terminal in Staten Island, New York ($48,008,231)
- Gateway upgrades for access, resiliency and development at the Port of Davisville project in Rhode Island ($11,250,000)
- Norfolk Offshore Wind Logistics Port in Virginia ($39,265,000)
- Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind in California ($426,719,810)

Last year, some 4.8% of plan participants took hardship withdrawals from 401(k) plans, according to Vanguard, up from 3.6% in 2023.
As Vanguard researchers note, the prevalence of automatic enrollment means that more workers than ever now have workplace plans — especially those with inconsistent or unreliable income. And legislative changes have made it easier than ever to make a hardship withdrawal, which allows investors to take money out of retirement accounts penalty-free provided its used for an ""immediate and heavy"" financial need.
If something like that comes up, it can be tempting to look toward the (hopefully) big pile of money you have saved for retirement to see you through it. But generally speaking, you should look elsewhere, says Paul Brahim, a certified financial planner and president of the Financial Planning Association.
""It should really only be a last resort,"" he says.
Avoid withdrawing money early from retirement accounts
If you need money in a pinch, your retirement account is a bad choice for a couple reasons, Brahim says.
For one thing, any money that you take out of a traditional 401(k) before age 59 ½ is subject to income tax. Plus if the money isn't taken out to deal with a hardship, such as medical or funeral expenses, you'll owe an extra 10% penalty.
Help us help you: Take our survey on work, money and life goals
Plus, he says ""the amount you took out is no longer compounding toward your retirement,"" he says. It doesn't take too long playing around with a compound interest calculator to see that any dollar you take out now is going to be worth much more to you by the time you're ready to retire.
""It's a very, very expensive way to access money,"" Brahim says.
So what are the alternatives?
Ideally, it's your emergency fund. Financial pros generally recommend stashing three to six months' worth of expenses in cash for when pressing money situations arise. That way, you don't have to derail your other plans to come up with the cash.
If putting aside that much cash sounds daunting, even a relatively modest cash cushion can help. Plan participants with $2,000 set aside tended to contribute more to retirement accounts and were far less likely to make early withdrawals, according to recent research from Vanguard.
If an emergency fund isn't an option though, there are still other moves to consider before tapping your retirement funds, experts say.
401(k) loan
Rules vary from employer to employer, but many will allow you to take a loan from your 401(k) plan. You can typically borrow the lesser of $50,000 or 50% of the vested balance of your account. From there, you'll generally have five years to pay the loan back, with interest — generally at a rate of 1% to 2% plus the prime rate, currently about 7.5%.
The upside here is that you can access some money now without a major tax implication and pay yourself back over time.
There are some drawbacks. Leave your company and your entire balance comes due at once. If you can't come up with the cash to pay it off, the amount you owe is treated as a withdrawal — subject to tax and a 10% penalty. The same thing happens if you miss the 5-year deadline.
And while the money you put into your account is tax-exempt, you pay back your loan with post-tax dollars. Then you pay tax when you eventually withdraw the money.
""That money is essentially double-taxed at retirement,"" Brahim says.
Tapping home equity
If you own a home, you may be able to tap your equity — the difference between your home's market value and the balance on your mortgage, or, more simply, the portion of your house you own outright — for cash.
A home equity loan is essentially a second mortgage borrowed against your property. You can generally receive between 80% to 85% of your home's value to be paid back to your lender at a fixed rate — currently 8.22%, on average, according to Bankrate.
""It's a quick way to get cash without a tax implication,"" says Eric Bond, president of Octave Wealth Management. ""You don't have to sell anything, and it's cheaper than using a credit card."" (The average interest rate on credit cards is more than 20%, according to Bankrate.)
While a home equity loan provides a lump sum to be paid back at a fixed rate, a similar vehicle known as a home equity line of credit (HELOC) comes with a variable rate and behaves more like a credit card, with an available amount of credit that replenishes when you make monthly payments.
Whether one or the other makes sense for you depends on the nature of your emergency, says Bond.
As with any loan, home equity products come with risks, such as damage to your credit or even losing your home if you fail to pay them back on time.
Absent an emergency fund, you'll be left with unattractive options if you find yourself in a tricky financial situation, says Brahim. That's why it's important to plan and save for these scenarios, he says.
""That way, you can let your retirement plan do what it's supposed to do,"" he says.

https://www.cnbc.com/select/endurance-extended-car-warranty/,10e4fa04b51e66948c4832b56b09ae29,Endurance Extended Car Warranty Review 2025,Endurance Extended Car Warranty Review 2025,2025-08-29 16:30:00+00:00,gdelt_cnbc_com,cnbc.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Endurance has been in the extended car warranty space since 2006. Unlike most providers, which are brokers for third parties, it administers its own contracts. That makes it a lot easier to file claims and get questions answered — and earned it a spot on CNBC Select's best extended car warranties list.
The company's six plans go from bare-bones to bumper-to-bumper, with options for high-mileage vehicles and benefits that cover routine maintenance like oil changes and brake pad replacements.
Quality costs, however, and we found Endurance's rates were somewhat higher than many competitors.
Endurance Extended Car Warranty
Policy highlights
Six tiers of coverage with no mileage restrictions. Benefits include coverage for tire and windshield (from road hazards), key fob replacement, roadside assistance and 30-day cancellation policy. Advantage plan covers maintenance, which is typically excluded.
Eligibility
Up to 20 years old with no mileage cap
Coverage terms
Covers up to 8 years or 200,000 miles
Choose your garage?
Yes
Availability
Endurance offers car warranties in all U.S. states except Massachusetts. In California, policies are sold as mechanical breakdown insurance.
Pros
- No mileage cap for approval
- Administers its own plans and claims
- Covers tire damage from road hazards
- Advantage plan includes maintenance (oil change, brake pad replacements)
- Plans are transferable if you sell your vehicle.
Cons
- Higher premiums than some competitors
Endurance extended car warranty review
Endurance pros and cons
Key benefits and drawbacks.
Pros
- No mileage maximum
- Can go to any ASE-licensed mechanic or dealership for repairs
- Direct-to-consumer company that processes its own claims
- Policies are transferable if you sell the vehicle while it's still covered
Cons
- Premiums are higher than some competitors.
- Some customers report difficulties with denied claims
Endurance plans
Endurance offers vehicle protection plans in all U.S. states except Massachusetts.
SecurePlus: Geared toward older vehicles, this plan covers your engine, transmission, brakes, steering, drive axle and A/C.
Superior: All the components under the Secure Plus plan are covered, with the addition of your suspension, cooling and fuel systems.
Supreme: The most comprehensive plan, Supreme is closest to a manufacturer's warranty. It covers all of the systems in the Secure Plus and Superior plans and adds seals and gaskets. The Supreme for Highline plan covers luxury vehicles that have under 80,000 miles and are less than 8 years old.
Secure: Budget-friendly powertrain coverage.
Premier: A plan for high-mileage autos (up to 150,000 miles) that covers the engine, transmission and drive axle.
Advantage: Mechanical breakdown protection, plus coverage for routine maintenance and one-time brake pad and battery replacement.
- Advantage Preferred: Comprehensive plan for vehicles up to 10 years old with up to 150,000 miles.
- Advantage Plus: High-level stated component contract that covers many parts of most systems of the vehicle. Cars up to 15 years old with up to 200,000 miles are eligible.
- Advantage Prime: Stated component contract that covers critical systems. Vehicles up to 20 years old are eligible with no mileage restriction.
All plans come with 24/7 roadside assistance, rental car reimbursement, trip interruption coverage and a year of Endurance Elite benefits.
Endurance Elite benefits
Endurance Elite Benefits are free for one year. Primary features include tire repair or replacement due to road hazards, $500 toward windshield repair or replacement due to road hazards, key fob replacement and a collision discount of $500 per accident.
Mechanical breakdown insurance
In California, Endurance offers mechanical breakdown insurance in place of an extended car warranty. There are three plans, Standard, Premium and Elite Plus, with coverage varying to fit the state's unique insurance requirements.
Endurance price quote
We requested a price quote from Endurance for a 2021 Ford Escape with 50,000 miles. Supreme coverage was $126 a month for 24 months (or $3,024) for four years or 54,000 additional miles, whichever comes first.
Endurance offers a variety of discounts, including for paying in full up front, for being a first-time caller, a senior, military personnel or government employee. Contact Endurance and ask about available discounts and offers when you request a quote
Endurance requirements
You'll need detailed information on the make and model of your car to apply, the vehicle ID number (or VIN) and the current mileage.
Age and mileage limits
Vehicles must be less than 20 years old but there's no maximum mileage cap for vehicles, which is unusual for extended auto warranties.
Waiting period
Extended warranty companies impose waiting periods to ensure your vehicle is in good working order. It also gives you a chance to cancel your policy. Endurance requires a standard waiting period of 30 days and an additional 1,000 miles on the vehicle before the warranty takes effect.
Claims process
Unlike most providers, Endurance is a direct provider and not a broker. So, it handles claims itself and policyholders can get repairs done at one of more than 3,500 garages and dealerships affiliated with Automotive Service Excellence (ASE).
After you present your info to the repair shop, it will obtain authorization from Endurance and begin work on the vehicle. There is a standard $100 deductible for all repairs, but Endurance also offers deductibles of $0, $50 and $200 on some plans.
Endurance makes payments directly to the garage.
How does Endurance compare?
Here's how Endurance stacks up against two leaders in the extended car warranty space.
Endurance vs. CarChex
Carchex Extended Car Warranty
Policy highlights
Five plans, all with a 30-day money-back guarantee, towing, rental car reimbursement and trip interruption benefits. Contracts administered by Allegiance, American Auto Shield and others
Eligibility
Up to 20 years old or 250,000 miles
Coverage terms
Up to 10 years or 250,000 miles.
Choose your garage?
Yes.
Availability
CarChex plans are available in all 50 U.S. states and Washington, D.C.
Pros
- Outstanding industry reputation
- 30-day money-back guarantee
- Positive customer reviews
- Rental car benefits include rideshare services
Cons
- No RV or motorcycle coverage
In a head-to-head with CarChex, Endurance comes out on top: It issues plans directly to the consumer, while CarChex serves as a broker for American Auto Shield, Allegiance, Assurant and others. That means CarChex has more choices, but it can make claims and customer service more confusing.
Endurance covers cars as old as 20 years with no mileage restrictions, compared to CarChex's 10-year, 250,000-mile caps.
Both companies offer roadside assistance and rental car coverage. But Endurance offers Elite benefits for the first year of coverage, with perks like key fob replacement and repairs for high-end electronics.
Endurance vs. CarShield
CarShield Extended Car Warranty
Policy highlights
CarShield offers seven warranties, including bumper-to-bumper, powertrain, electrical systems, motorcycles and EVs. Contracts are administered by American Auto Shield.
Eligibility
Up to 300,000 miles with no age limit
Coverage terms
Not disclosed
Choose your garage?
Yes, any certified National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence shop.
Availability
CarShield coverage is available in all U.S. states except California.
Pros
- Wide range of plans
- Affordable rates
- No age restriction for acceptance
Cons
- Not available in California
- Not all plans are transferable
- $10 million settlement with the FTC over deceptive advertising practices
Endurance has more flexibility than CarShield, with a range of options from simple powertrain coverage to bumper-to-bumper plans, including a maintenance-inclusive tier, Endurance Advantage. CarShield provides 4 standard tiers, plus options for high-tech car systems, motorcycles, ATVs and EVs.
Like CarChex, CarShield is a broker. It sells plans from American Auto Shield and Interstate National Dealer Services, which have the final say on approving claims.
CarShield may be a better option if you have a vintage ride, though. While Endurance hits the brakes on cars over 20 years old, CarShield approves vehicles up to 25 years old.
How do I buy an Endurance extended car warranty?
You can buy a plan from Endurance online by entering basic information about your car, including the make, model and the vehicle ID number (VIN)
You can also call the sales line at 800-506-4640, and a service agent will explain the available coverage options for your vehicle.
Is Endurance right for me?
If you have an older car with higher mileage, Endurance is a good option for an extended car warranty. It has a wide variety of plans, few restrictions for vehicles up to 20 years old and no mileage cap.
By administering its own contracts and claims, Endurance has a leg up on the competition. For many customers, that more than outweighs higher-than-average rates.
Endurance FAQs
Does Endurance have a deductible?
Endurance has a standard deductible of $100 that must be paid up front before any repairs. But, depending on your coverage and options, deductibles can range from $0 to $200
How do I cancel my Endurance extended car warranty?
You can call Endurance's customer line to cancel. If you're within the first 30 days, you will get a full refund. If you're past the 30 days, you must submit a request in writing and you'll receive a prorated refund, minus administration costs and any claims already paid.
Does Endurance provide a rental car during repairs?
All Endurance plans include rental car coverage as part of roadside assistance, which is part of its Elite benefits provided to all members for free in the first year of coverage. If you have a covered breakdown repair, Eudurance will reimburse you for expenses to rent a car: The daily maximum is $30, and the overall maximum is $150 per breakdown.

Markets: The S & P 500 sold off from its record high on Friday, and the Nasdaq and 30-stock Dow were also lower. The AI trade led to the downside after earnings from server maker Dell and custom-chip provider Marvell Technology disappointed, while Club name Nvidia continued it post-earnings volatility with a more than 3% decline. Softer than expected consumer sentiment data at 10 a.m. ET added to the market's losses, although one-year inflation expectations came down too. Deals: Dupont announced Friday that it has reached an agreement with Arclin — owned by the private-equity firm TJC — to sell its Aramids business in a deal that valued at $1.8 billion. The Aramids business is home to the synthetic fiber brands Kevlar and Nomex that specialize in fields like heat resistance and personal protection. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, at which DuPont will receive pretax cash proceeds of $1.2 billion, a note receivable of $300 million, and a non-controlling common equity interest in the future Arclin company, currently valued at $325 million. DuPont has been rumored to sell this business for months and at a reported valuation of $2 billion. DuPont CEO Lori Koch said in the transaction press release that the cash proceeds ""will be re-deployed to further drive value creation."" We take that to believe DuPont will use this extra cash from selling a slow-growing, low-margin unit to acquire water and healthcare-related assets to boost the secular growth prospects and attractiveness of the remaining Dupont following the Nov. 1 spinoff of its electronics business, now called Qnity. Analysts at Mizuho raised their price target on DuPont to $90 from $85 after the news to reflect what they said was an updated sum-of-the-parts valuation. GMS green light: Club name Home Depot moved one step closer to finalizing its $4.3 billion acquisition of the specialty building products distributor GMS Inc. On Friday, Home Depot announced the Canadian Competition Bureau cleared the takeover. This was the last antitrust regulator that needed to sign off on the transaction. This deal was previously announced on June 30 and will increase Home Depot's share of wallet with professional contractors (also known as Pro customer.) GMS distributes specialty building products like drywall, ceilings, and steel framing. GMS would become part of Home Depot's SRS Distribution division, which was purchased in an over $18 billion deal that closed in June 2024. SRS is also a supplier of building products. In a piece earlier Friday, we spotlighted Home Depot as one of seven portfolio stocks that stand to benefit most from Federal Reserve rate cuts. Next week: It's a holiday-shortened week, with the U.S. stock market closed on Monday in observance of Labor Day. Five companies in the S & P 500 are scheduled to report, including two in the portfolio: Salesforce and Broadcom . They report Wednesday and Thursday after the closing bell, respectively. On the data side, its job week, meaning the nonfarm payroll report for August is scheduled for Friday. With the Fed's heightened focus on labor market weakness, the upcoming jobs report will likely play a major role in shaping expectations for rate cuts at the final three Fed policy meetings of the year.

Then a 30-year-old software engineer, her only experience running a company came at the helm of ""a small, marginal project"" called Happening, an events-focused social platform she founded in 2019, she tells CNBC Make It. Her pathway to her current job was unconventional: She was originally hired by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey to run an internal research project called Bluesky.
The vision, essentially, was an open-source, ""decentralized"" version of Twitter where individual moderators, unaffiliated with either company, could host their own versions of the social media platform — each with their own rules around content moderation, data privacy and censorship.
Graber, now 34, officially became a CEO by spinning Bluesky off into its own company in October 2021, explaining later that the project needed less bureaucratic oversight to quickly grow. Bluesky and Twitter remained close until April 2022, when billionaire Elon Musk bought Twitter, renamed it X and severed all ties with Bluesky.
As rival platforms jumped to poach ex-Twitter users, Graber decided to join the fray and launch Bluesky as its own social media platform. Since then, it's grown where multiple other so-called Twitter alternatives have shuttered or stagnated. It now has an estimated 38-plus million registered users, up from roughly 13 million in October 2024, according to Bcounter, a website that tracks the app's users. (A Bluesky spokesperson declined to comment on traffic numbers.)
Help us help you: Take our survey on work, money and life goals
Bluesky is still small compared to X and Meta-owned Threads, which each have at least 115 million daily active users, according to a TechCrunch report on data from market intelligence firm Similarweb. And much of its recent growth is inescapably tied to the most recent U.S. presidential election, which Donald Trump won with Musk's support, leading some politically liberal accounts to flee X.
The platform has a reputation for being a politically left-leaning alternative to X, a characterization that Graber pushes back against, saying she sees a wide variety of ""communities"" on the platform. The point of Bluesky is to ""create any sort of community, find any sort of interest you want,"" she says.
Regardless, the past four years have been some combination of exciting and terrifying for Graber and Bluesky's small team of 20-plus employees, she says.
Here, Graber discusses the hectic weeks after Musk's Twitter takeover, the challenges of running a fast-growing social app amid fierce competition and why her ultimate vision for Bluesky's success extends beyond its user count.
CNBC Make It: When Musk bought Twitter, what was your initial reaction?
Graber: It was very confusing to navigate. Because we were outside [Twitter], we didn't get internal company memos, and so we had to read the press to keep up with what was going on. And then our contacts within Twitter started to drop off, one by one. Some were let go. Some left on their own.
I had a bi-weekly standing call with a large rotating group of people [inside Twitter]. One week after the acquisition, I showed up to the call and nobody came. I showed up the next week, and nobody came. I realized that nobody had cleared off their calendars or deactivated their Twitter accounts. They were just ghost accounts, and everyone was gone.
We were like, ""Well, what do we do next? Let's go ahead and build the app.""
As ex-Twitter users joined Bluesky, did you worry that your company didn't have the manpower or experience to handle the sudden traffic and attention?
It was definitely a lot of excitement, as well as nervousness, about what this meant. We weren't sure what it meant. We'd been very technology-focused up until then, and our guess was: This wasn't a million people very excited about the [open-source, decentralized] protocol.
And honestly, we simply weren't equipped to handle this influx of users. We were suddenly scaling up the production database to [accommodate] 100,000 more users, and fixing protocol bugs on the fly.
People were excited about having a new social app to go to. But what were their expectations versus what were we trying to build? There was always a bit of a mismatch there. We were actually trying to structurally change the nature of social media, rather than just build a Twitter clone. This was hard to get across.
Early on, people expected this to be a one-to-one Twitter replacement. And we looked very similar, [but] we kept trying to communicate all of these features we were building that were very different: This is federated. This has custom feeds [and] lets you bring your own domain name.
What have been your biggest challenges since launching Bluesky's platform?
Scaling a rapidly growing, viral social app while also building a new, untested open-source technology is a very challenging problem. I think we were all scared that the app was going to fall over, the technology was going to break.
It's been really about empowering every person on the team — because it's been a very small team — to rise to meet the challenge and do what needs to be done in order to get us to the next stage.
Something I've told the team many times, when it felt like the challenges were just too big for us to meet: 'This is how everyone else has done it in the past. It's just the people you have in the room. You haven't done it before, but here's your chance. Be the hero you want to see. Nobody's coming to save us.'
Do you have any personal traits that, in your opinion, make you an effective CEO?
I think I'm very persistent when I care about something, and I'm very clear about the things that I care about.
I spent a lot of time early in my career figuring out what I most wanted to pursue, and then I pursued them. When I got into programming, I wrote down ""expand empowerment tech"" in a notebook for myself, and then everything I've done has fallen under that category.
We've gotten further than [other] decentralized social attempts and Twitter alternative attempts. Succeeding on both fronts has been tricky, but I'm proud of what we've done so far. We've achieved what a lot of people said was impossible early on, and made a usable, scalable, open, decentralized app.
On the other hand, Bluesky hasn't replaced all the ways that we use social. Long-term, our vision of success is for our protocol to be the foundation for the social web, where every social app builds on an open-source protocol.
I think when you're focused in what you want, and you stay persistent about it, you can get a lot further than if you scatter your interests a lot.

Privia now expects adjusted EBITDA of $113 million to $116 million, up from a previous range of $104 million to $110 million. Iren — The vertically integrated data center business rallied 19% after winning Nvidia ""Preferred Partner"" status, obtaining nearly $100 million in financing to buy Nvidia GB300 equipment, and fiscal fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA topped Street estimates, according to FactSet. Alibaba — The Chinese e-ecommerce giant saw shares rising more than 13% after the firm created a more advanced chip as it looks to fill the gap left by Nvidia running into issues around selling its chips in China. Nvidia shares fell more than 3%. Caterpillar — The industrial giant's shares lost 4% after the company warned it could take a $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion hit this year due to tariffs. Dell Technologies — The tech stock slipped nearly 8% after the company gave third-quarter earnings per share guidance that was below Wall Street's expectations. Dell still beat on its top and bottom lines for the latest quarter, however. Ulta Beauty — The cosmetics and beauty products retailer surged more than 6% after raising its full-year earnings and revenue forecast. Ulta expects full-year revenue of $12 billion to $12.1 billion, above the $11.7 billion estimate from analysts polled by LSEG. Ulta expects full-year earnings of $23.85 to $24.30 per share, while analysts were expecting $23.65. Affirm Holdings — The buy now, pay later fintech provider rallied 11% after fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue beat analysts' estimates.

Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, plans to announce that she will not run for re-election next year, according to a person familiar with her decision.
The move, first reported by CBS News, would open up another potentially competitive race in Iowa, months after GOP Gov. Kim Reynolds announced she wouldn't run for re-election either. But while Democrats have been eyeing underdog bids in both races, they've struggled in recent statewide elections and haven't won a Senate race in the state since 2008.
Ernst did not respond to a request for comment.
Ernst won re-election by more than six points in 2020. President Donald Trump carried the state by double-digits in 2024, although Democratic President Barack Obama won the state both in 2012 and 2008.
Multiple Democrats have already jumped into the race against Ernst, including state Rep. Josh Turke, state Sen. Zach Wahls, Des Moines School Board Chairwoman Jackie Norris and Nathan Sage, a Marine and Army veteran.
And the high-profile opening in the red state will undoubtedly draw interest among Republicans — all four congressional seats are currently represented by the GOP. While Rep. Randy Feenstra is running for governor, Reps. Ashley Hinson, Zach Nunn and Mariannette Miller-Meeks so far have signaled they're running for re-election to the House. But some Republicans had suggested Hinson could be well-positioned to run if Ernst decided not to, and a source familiar with her thinking said Friday she would consider running if Ernst does drop out.
NATO Ambassador Matt Whitaker would also consider running for the seat if Ernst declines to seek re-election, according to a source familiar with Whitaker's thinking.
The 55-year-old Ernst took office after her victory in 2014, when the then-state senator defeated Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley. Running as a Washington outsider, Ernst ran a memorable ad where she played up her experience castrating pigs and promised to ""make 'em squeal"" in Washington if elected.

While Ernst had previously promised to serve only two six-year Senate terms, she's popular among Republicans in Washington who had hoped she would run again.
But she's faced pressure from her party's right flank, most recently during her public wavering over whether to back Trump's pick to lead the Defense Department, Pete Hegseth. Hegseth faced allegations of sexual assault and that he had issues with alcohol, which he vehemently denied. Ernst, who has made combatting sexual assault in the military a key priority during her time in office, ultimately decided to vote for Hegseth.
And she drew national attention in May when she pushed back on a participant at a town hall meeting in Iowa who criticized Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" that included cuts to Medicaid funding and work requirements.
After the questioner asserted that people would die because of the legislation, Ernst replied: ""People are not — well, we all are going to die, so, for heaven's sakes.""
While Washington has been waiting for Ernst to announce her plans — she had hired a campaign manager but delayed her annual ""Roast and Ride"" event amid questions about her political future — she fundraised less last quarter ($722,000) than in any quarter during her 2020 bid.",0802f2a95a862dc47468b45c52737eef,trafilatura

Musk's company said in the complaint filed on Thursday in California federal court that Xuechen Li stole confidential information related to ""cutting-edge AI technologies with features superior to those offered by ChatGPT"" to bring to his new job at OpenAI earlier this month.
Li, representatives of OpenAI and attorneys and spokespersons for xAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday. OpenAI is not a defendant.
The complaint underscores the rivalry between Musk's company and OpenAI and a fierce battle among tech companies for AI talent.
Musk, an OpenAI co-founder, has separately sued the company and its CEO, Sam Altman, for allegedly deviating from its original mission to benefit humanity. OpenAI countersued Musk in April for harassment.
Musk's xAI filed another lawsuit against OpenAI and Apple in Texas on Monday for allegedly monopolizing the market for AI chatbots on Apple devices.
The new lawsuit said Li began working as an engineer for xAI last year, where he helped train and develop Grok. The company said Li took its trade secrets in July, shortly after accepting a job from OpenAI and selling $7 million in xAI stock.
Musk's startup said that the secrets could allow OpenAI to bolster ChatGPT with xAI's ""more innovative AI and imaginative features.""
The lawsuit said Li admitted to stealing company files and ""covering his tracks"" during a meeting on August 14, and that the company later found additional stolen material on his devices that he had not disclosed.
Musk's AI company asked the court for an unspecified amount of monetary damages and a restraining order blocking Li's move to OpenAI.",14b9f211b5d84a28448029a8ee3ccdf0,trafilatura

The social media giant is now training its AI chatbots so that they do not generate responses to teenagers about subjects like self-harm, suicide, disordered eating and avoid potentially inappropriate romantic conversations, a Meta spokesperson confirmed.
The company said AI chatbots will instead point teenagers to expert resources when appropriate.
""As our community grows and technology evolves, we're continually learning about how young people may interact with these tools and strengthening our protections accordingly,"" the company said in a statement.
Additionally, teenage users of Meta apps like Facebook and Instagram will only be able to access certain AI chatbots intended for educational and skill-development purposes.
The company said it's unclear how long these temporary modifications will last, but they will begin rolling out over the next few weeks across the company's apps in English-speaking countries. The ""interim changes"" are part of the company's longer-term measures over teen safety.
TechCrunch was first to report the change.
Last week, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said that he was launching an investigation into Meta following a Reuters report about the company permitting its AI chatbots to engage in ""romantic"" and ""sensual"" conversations with teens and children.
The Reuters report described an internal Meta document that detailed permissible AI chatbot behaviors that staff and contract workers should take into account when developing and training the software.
In one example, the document cited by Reuters said that a chatbot would be allowed to have a romantic conversation with an eight-year-old and could tell the minor that ""every inch of you is a masterpiece – a treasure I cherish deeply.""
A Meta spokesperson told Reuters at the time that ""The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed.""
Most recently, the nonprofit advocacy group Common Sense Media released a risk assessment of Meta AI on Thursday and said that it should not be used by anyone under the age of 18, because the ""system actively participates in planning dangerous activities, while dismissing legitimate requests for support,"" the nonprofit said in a statement.
""This is not a system that needs improvement. It's a system that needs to be completely rebuilt with safety as the number-one priority, not an afterthought,"" said Common Sense Media CEO James Steyer in a statement. ""No teen should use Meta AI until its fundamental safety failures are addressed.""
A separate Reuters report published on Friday found ""dozens"" of flirty AI chatbots based on celebrities like Taylor Swift, Scarlett Johansson, Anne Hathaway and Selena Gomez on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.
The report said that when prompted, the AI chatbots would generate ""photorealistic images of their namesakes posing in bathtubs or dressed in lingerie with their legs spread.""
A Meta spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that ""the AI-generated imagery of public figures in compromising poses violates our rules.""
""Like others, we permit the generation of images containing public figures, but our policies are intended to prohibit nude, intimate or sexually suggestive imagery,"" the Meta spokesperson said. ""Meta's AI Studio rules prohibit the direct impersonation of public figures.""

Looking closer, the barcode scanner maker stock has also underperformed the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's (XLK) return of 18.9% over the past 52 weeks.
Shares of Zebra Technologies tumbled 11.4% on Aug. 5 despite Q2 2025 adjusted EPS of $3.61 beating estimates and rising 13.5% year-over-year, and revenue of $1.3 billion topping forecasts and growing 6.2%. Investors reacted negatively to weaker segmental performance in Asset Intelligence & Tracking, where revenues of $418 million missed the consensus, and to margin pressure as cost of sales rose 7.8% to $677 million.
For the fiscal year ending in December 2025, analysts expect ZBRA's EPS to grow 8.2% year-over-year to $12.81. The company's earnings surprise history is mixed. It beat the consensus estimates in three of the last four quarters while missing on another occasion.
Among the 17 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on nine “Strong Buys,” one “Moderate Buy” rating, and seven “Holds.”
This configuration is slightly more bullish than three months ago, with eight “Strong Buy” ratings on the stock.
On Aug. 6, Needham raised its price target on Zebra Technologies to $345 while maintaining a “Buy” rating.
The mean price target of $362.50 represents a 13.1% premium to ZBRA’s current price levels. The Street-high price target of $421 suggests a 31.3% potential upside.

Dive Brief:

As Kohl’s continued its turnaround efforts in Q2, net sales fell 5.1% year over year to $3.3 billion and comparable sales fell 4.2%.
-
Gross margin expanded by 28 basis points to 39.9%. Net income more than doubled, reaching $153 million from $66 million a year ago. That includes $129 million from the settlement of a credit card interchange fee lawsuit; excluding that, net income tumbled over 60%.
-
Kohl’s executives singled out private label as most important to the retailer’s strategy, one of many initiatives from ex-CEO Tom Kingsbury. Its owned brands outperformed the company overall, improving 500 basis points from Q1, and the retailer plans to introduce more.
Dive Insight:
Despite being buffeted by outside forces beyond its control, Kohl’s said its Q2 results surpassed its expectations.
“Although we are encouraged by our second quarter results and the improved sales trend we saw throughout the quarter, we also recognize that consumers continue to be pressured and are being choiceful with their purchases,” Interim CEO Michael Bender told analysts Wednesday. “Specifically, our lower- to middle-income customers remain the most challenged, while our higher income customers have proven to be more resilient.”
That has many Kohl’s customers gravitating toward lower opening price points, and a few of the retailer’s tactics cater to that, he said. This includes growing its suite of owned brands — a win-win given their higher margins — and expanding coupon discounts to apply to more name brand products, executives said.
Standout private labels in the period included Tek Gear, Simply Vera Vera Wang, Lauren Conrad and FLX. The retailer recently introduced new ones, including Miryana, Hotelier and Mingle & Co., and plans to expand FLX to children’s, which will be available online and in 300 stores.
Despite the expectations beat and improved margins, the leadership turnovers of recent months plus stumbles in execution have hobbled Kohl’s comeback, so revenue declines are likely to continue this year, according to Fitch Ratings Senior Director David Silverman. The chief executive who arrived in January, Ashley Buchanan, was out by May due to conflicts of interest.
Still, Kohl’s has scale on its side, along with “its reasonably positioned store base and digital infrastructure, and its ability to invest $400 million in capital expenses this year,” Silverman said in emailed comments.",cf4a97809214dde5e95727017447f2a3,trafilatura

-
The market reaction to Nvidia's latest earnings report was lukewarm.
-
The stock is down after the report as investors respond to what they view as a tepid sales forecast.
-
But Wall Street sees a lot to like, with many firms raising their price targets on the stock.
For a company like Nvidia, which is used to blowing the doors off earnings reports, Wednesday wasn't the best day.
While the chipmaking giant beat second-quarter revenue and earnings, the vibes were lukewarm at best, and the move in the stock price showed it.
Shares quickly slid as much as 4% in the after-market before recovering a bit. They remained about 1% lower in regular Thursday trading.
But if there's anything to worry about, analysts are shrugging it off. The broad consensus across Wall Street is that Nvidia's earnings report was good enough to unlock further stock upside in the future.
Below is a sampling of this bullish push — five banks that raised their price targets in the immediate aftermath of Nvidia earnings, and why they did so.
JPMorgan: 18% upside
Rating: Overweight
New price target: $215 (up from $170)
Reasoning: JPMorgan sees enough demand for Nvidia's Blackwell products to support the company's revenue guidance of $54 billion for the following quarter.
Demand for Nvidia's H20 chip, meanwhile, could provide as much as $2 billion to $5 billion in extra revenue for the following quarter, analysts estimated, despite uncertainty surrounding US trade restrictions with China.
""Overall, we believe NVIDIA's 12-month forward order book continues to outstrip supply,"" the bank wrote in a client note. ""All in, the playbook remains the same here for NVDA - a solid beat and raise with multiple levers at play to drive upside, against the backdrop of a multi-year runway of growth for AI infrastructure spending, with NVDA in our view continuing to capture a significant majority of the incremental spend,"" it added.
DA Davidson: 7% upside
Rating: Neutral
New price target: $195 (up from $135)
Reasoning: DA Davidson, which once said it believed 2025 would be a ""peak year"" in the AI cycle, said it no longer believed that to be the case.
""While we are maintaining our Neutral rating we would like to highlight our perspective on NVDA has shifted quite a bit over the last 6 months,"" analysts wrote in a note on Thursday. ""We now believe demand growth for inference will sustain for the foreseeable future,"" it added, pointing to progress made on AI models over the last year.

The model showed the digital asset demonstrating textbook institutional accumulation behavior, initially testing support at $3.81 before executing a measured advance to $4.02 accompanied by substantial volume of 4.6 million units.
Trading volumes exceeding 320,000 units during the initial decline phase indicate institutional repositioning rather than retail panic, with subsequent buying interest establishing clear support levels around $3.90-$3.91, according to the model.
The move higher in Polkadot reversed though, with the price slipping back to that $3.90 support.
On the news front, the Republic of Paraguay has committed $6 million to a Polkadot-based tokenization initiative, according to a post on X , a landmark government endorsement of blockchain technology for sovereign infrastructure development.

-

The partnership aims to streamline autonomous vehicle adoption for carriers through software integrations. The integration connects Aurora’s app directly with McLeod’s TMS platform, allowing carriers to manage autonomous trucks alongside their traditional fleets.
The integration will support fleet management functions, including load scheduling, dispatch, visibility and invoicing. One goal is to create a seamless operational experience for carriers adopting autonomous technology.
“We want this to be plug-and-play for customers. They’re going to get this truck that drives itself and we want the way that they use that to reflect the way that they operate trucks in their network today,” said Zac Andreoni, vice president of business development at Aurora, in an interview with FreightWaves. “So we want to meet our customers where they are.”
While Aurora has partnered with some of the largest carriers in the industry, this integration specifically targets midsized fleets that typically rely on McLeod’s TMS. These carriers, operating between 100 and 1,000 trucks, represent a significant market segment that has previously faced barriers to autonomous technology adoption.
“For McLeod, this allows them to be on the cutting edge and to help their carriers adopt this new technology, should they choose,” Andreoni said. “For us, McLeod is a company with well over 1,000 customers. It’s a great way for us to be able to sort of co-market, or use them as a sales channel.”
The integration addresses operational challenges unique to autonomous trucking networks, such as managing terminal-to-terminal movements and coordinating first-mile and last-mile connections with human drivers. It also provides carriers with financial visibility tools to calculate and compare costs between autonomous and traditional trucking operations effectively.
“Integrating Aurora’s autonomous capabilities into our TMS platform provides our customers with a pathway to adopt autonomous tractors within their operations,” said Tom McLeod, founder and CEO of McLeod Software, in a press release. “This collaboration underscores our dedication to providing cutting-edge technology for our customers, empowering them to optimize their operations and embrace innovation with confidence.”
Aurora will showcase the integration at the McLeod user conference from Sept. 21-23, where interested carriers can learn more about implementing the technology within their existing operations.",92bcd64ebba0dbd45cc52802e4032c76,trafilatura

In a statement, the global food and beverage major said it had made a ""multi-million-dollar investment"", which includes a 48,000 square-foot facility expansion, a new production line and upgrades to existing lines.
It will bring 30 new full-time jobs to the region.
The expanded capacity at Minster intendeds to address consumer demand, Danone said, noting that the yogurt category was seeing “explosive growth”, driven by consumers looking for “more nutrient-dense foods that are high in protein” and “rich in nutrients and probiotic benefits”.
To meet increasing demand, Danone added that it plans to buy 60% more milk for the Minster facility over the next two years, by working with existing producer partners to increase their production and onboarding new local farms.
Commenting on the news, Dan Magliocco, the president of Danone's North America business, said: “Our commitment to American manufacturing runs deep, with 90% of our ingredients and packaging materials bought here.”
He added: “Fulfilling our mission to bring health through food to as many people as possible, means producing nutrient-rich foods with US ingredients in American factories that are benefiting local communities.""
In its second quarter ended, Danone saw sales grow 2.3% on a like-for-like basis to €1.6bn. Sales were also up 3% to €3.3bn in the first half of its fiscal year.
Speaking to analysts in a results call at the end of July, CFO Juergen Esser noted that high-protein yogurt ""continued to lead the growth"" in its Essential Dairy and Plant-Based (EDP) division in North America.
On the call, Danone management was asked by a UBS analyst whether Danone's management was ""satisfied"" with its ""market share development in yogurt for the region"".
In response, CEO Antoine de Saint-Affrique said Danone was ""going in the right direction"" but the business was ""not fixed yet"".
He pointed to the growth of the company's higher-protein products but added: ""I mean, we still need to do better from a share standpoint. We have a unique portfolio in the US that covers all offerings and, for the moment, only [high] protein is driving. We are not leveraging the full might of our portfolio.""

Warren Buffett’s investment writings frequently connect operating reality with investor behavior, and one of his most concise observations appears in Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK.B) (BRK.A) 1983 annual report, in the appendix on goodwill: “During inflation, Goodwill is the gift that keeps giving.”
The remark was made as part of a broader technical discussion that separated accounting treatment from economic substance, using plain-language examples to show why certain businesses can protect, and even expand, owner value when general price levels rise. Rather than a slogan, the line functioned as a policy explainer for how Berkshire evaluates businesses whose primary advantages are intangible, such as brand reputation, distribution power, or regulatory franchises — advantages that can translate into pricing power without commensurate increases in capital employed.

Tilray’s Stock Price Is Growing Like a Weed. Here’s Why, and What Comes Next.
The context for the statement included Buffett’s distinction between “accounting goodwill” recorded on balance sheets and “economic goodwill,” which he defined in practice as the capitalized value of returns that exceed normal rates on tangible assets. In the same appendix, he walked through a side-by-side scenario: a high-return, asset-light franchise versus a more “mundane” asset-heavy operation. When inflation doubles nominal sales, both firms typically must commit more cash to receivables, inventory, and fixed assets just to stand still. But the asset-light franchise needs far less incremental capital to support the same nominal revenue, so more of its inflation-boosted dollars remain available for owners or reinvestment. That asymmetry is the economic logic behind Buffett’s memorable quote.
Buffett’s authority on the subject derives from his decades of experience allocating capital across businesses with differing economics, and notably Berkshire’s controlling stake in See’s Candies, which he often cited as a prototype of economic goodwill. In the 1983 appendix, he explained that See’s relatively modest tangible asset base supported returns well above market rates because loyal customers valued the brand and product, enabling pricing decisions driven by perceived value rather than production cost. During inflationary periods, that kind of customer franchise tends to maintain or widen margins with comparatively small additions to working and fixed capital, validating the idea that real-world goodwill can be an inflation ally.",7cb3366a741c3c838ad257c57f6c2db7,trafilatura

Kohl’s in May fired then-CEO Ashley Buchanan for funneling business to a romantic partner. The retailer still hasn’t named a permanent chief to succeed him. Michael Bender, Kohl’s interim CEO, said the company lowered its expenses and expanded its gross margins in the latest quarter.
Bender said Kohl’s is making progress on its turnaround plans. “However, these efforts will continue to take time and we are focused on showing progressive improvement each quarter,” he said on a call with analysts Wednesday.
Kohl’s shares have risen more than 150% since their low in April—in part because the company has been the beneficiary of meme-stock attention, social media chatter that can lift a struggling stock. The company’s stock is still down roughly 75% since its high in 2022.
The retailer’s comparable sales, those from stores and digital channels in operation for at least 12 months, fell 4.2% in the latest quarter ended Aug. 2. that is better than the 5.1% drop expected by analysts, according to FactSet.
Kohl’s also raised the lower end of its guidance for the year. The company now expects its sales to fall 4% to 5% this year, compared with its previous forecast of a decline of 4% to 6%. Some of Kohl’s rivals are faring much better. Large retailers including Walmart, Amazon and Costco have reported strong sales gains recently. Abercrombie & Fitch Wednesday said its comparable sales rose 3% in the most recent quarter.

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.
Planning for the future can feel overwhelming, especially when it involves making sure a loved one will be cared for after you're gone. On a recent episode of her ""Women & Money"" podcast, financial expert Suze Orman responded to a listener named Henry who shared his concern for his wife's well-being.
Henry, age 56, explained that his 46-year-old wife has a disability that prevents her from working. Since the couple is renting an apartment, his biggest worry is making sure she will always have a place to live if something were to happen to him.
Orman praised his question, saying, ""That's sweet,"" and offered several ways he could start preparing now.

Consider Term Life Insurance
Orman suggested that Henry look into term life insurance. ""If I were you, I would look into a 10-year term life insurance policy for a significant amount of money in case something happened to you within the next 10 years,"" she said.
Whole life insurance, which provides coverage for a lifetime, can be prohibitively expensive at Henry's age. For that reason, Orman steered him toward term insurance combined with disciplined saving and investing.
Build Savings and Investments
Beyond insurance, Orman emphasized the importance of saving and investing aggressively. She encouraged Henry to put away as much as possible so that assets could be passed directly to his wife. This strategy not only helps secure her financial stability but also provides resources she could use for housing or other needs.

Orman also raised a point many couples overlook: what if Henry were the one to become disabled? She suggested that he explore his own disability insurance to ensure income protection in case he is unable to work.
Explore Housing Options Early
Since Henry and his wife are renting, Orman and her co-host KT advised thinking beyond temporary housing. One option is to buy into an independent living facility that offers different levels of care as residents age.
""There’s lots of great independent living facilities, and I think that is the key here,"" KT said. ""If they’re renting, why not put that money towards that investment, right?""",c499fdd2d6ca05514d2d650e934551db,trafilatura

The legislation also simplified 45Z requirements by removing mandates tied to climate-smart farming practices. Also, thanks to the legislation, lean fuels produced with feedstock sourced outside the US, Mexico, or Canada will not be eligible for the 45Z credit pending final treasury guidelines. This supports our business as well as that of our farmer partners.
As of today, the EPA estimates that our Class VI injection well permit application will be finalized in March 2026, which has been moved forward from April 2026 as per the EPA website. REX remains in active communication with the EPA on our application, and we look forward to the final approval of this permit. As of the end of the second quarter, we have invested a total of approximately $126.7 million in carbon capture and ethanol expansion projects. We remain within our revised combined budget range of $220 million to $230 million for both projects. I will now hand the call over to Doug Bruggeman to discuss our financial results.
Doug Bruggeman: Thanks, Zafar. During 2025, our ethanol sales volumes reached 70.6 million gallons compared to 65.1 million gallons in Q2 2024. The average selling price for ethanol was $1.75 per gallon during the quarter versus $1.79 in the prior year. Dry distiller grain sales volumes were approximately 148,000 tons for Q2 with an average selling price of $143.63 per ton compared to approximately 133,000 tons at a price of $164.45 per ton in the prior year. Modified distillers grain volumes totaled 19,000 tons with an average selling price of $64.41 per ton. Corn oil sales volumes were approximately 23.1 million pounds during the quarter with an average selling price of $0.54 per pound.
Compared to the prior year, we sold approximately 14% more pounds in the second quarter and also experienced approximately a 26% increase in prices, which led to approximately a 46% increase in sales dollars. Gross profit for the second quarter was $14.3 million compared to $19.8 million in Q2 2024. This primarily reflects lower sales prices for dried distiller grains as the average price dropped from $164.45 to $143.63. We also paid higher shipping costs, which is recorded as cost of goods sold and impacts gross profit but does not impact sales. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were approximately $6.2 million for the quarter, compared to $6.4 million in Q2 2024.
Interest and other income totaled $3.1 million for the quarter compared to $4.4 million in Q2 2024, reflecting lower rates and lower investments. Income before taxes and noncontrolling interest was approximately $12.1 million compared to $19.5 million in Q2 2024. Net income attributable to REX shareholders was $7.1 million or $0.43 per diluted share compared to $12.4 million or $0.70 per diluted share in Q2 2024. We ended the first quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $310.5 million. REX continues to maintain a strong financial position with no bank debt. I will now turn things back to Zafar.
Zafar Rizvi: Thanks, Doug. Our strategy continues to be guided by the three P's: Profit, Position, and Policy. Profit: Our dedicated team has delivered 20 consecutive quarters of profitability, reflecting strength, discipline, and commitment. Our third quarter for 2025 is on pace to outperform the second quarter, but will not be as strong as our last year's third quarter, which was our second-best quarter on record. I am particularly pleased with the increased yield of corn oil production, which reflects the consistent and efficient operation of the overall plants. This improvement demonstrates not only the effectiveness of our process but also the dedication of the team in maintaining high standards of performance.
Position: Ethanol expansion and carbon capture initiatives remain moving forward and within budget, positioning REX for sustainable long-term organic growth. The 45Q tax credit and extension of the 45Z tax credit through February 2029 enhance the economics of our operation and strengthen future earning potential. Looking ahead, REX anticipates better performance in 2025 compared to the first two quarters of the year, aided by favorable corn supply trends and steady demand, particularly from rising ethanol exports. Exports are running about 10% ahead of 2024 levels through June, according to the Renewable Fuels Association, with 2024 already a record year. REX expects 2025 to set a new export record.
As far as feedstock supply, early estimates also suggest the US corn crop is on track for a potential record harvest, which should further benefit REX. We believe this favorable market dynamic supports margin expansion through year-end with additional export upside once tariff-related trade issues are resolved. REX remains confident in the outlook for its core business, and we are committed to executing our growth strategy while continuing to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. Now I would like to open things up for questions. Operator?

For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Our first question comes from Peter Dastreich with Water Tower Research. Please proceed with your question.
Peter Dastreich: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. For starters, congratulations on the results and another consecutive quarter of profitability. I have said it before, but that is something that has eluded pretty much all of your peers. So congratulations on that. It is also great to see the regulatory tailwinds that are coming through in your favor. Just a few questions for me. The first one is just regarding an event that you held this summer at your One Earth Energy facility. It looks like it was very well attended with a couple hundred people.
Could you talk about who turned up for that event and any implications for your state and local support for your growth projects, particularly for CCS?
Stuart Rose: I was at the event, so I guess I will answer that. This is Stuart. People that turned up were mostly local people, and it was the first time we did it at the One Earth facility. And it was, again, we are doing our best to be a good citizen in the community, and almost all the local or many local officials turned up, as well as many shareholders. We only own 75% of One Earth, so many shareholders turned up. A few government officials, state representatives, and people like that showed up. Overall, it was a big success.
I think we accomplished what we were trying to do, which is to get some gratitude and have more favor in the local community. I think we are already a major citizen of Gibson City, but this just made us a little bit better.
Peter Dastreich: Okay. Thank you. Just in relation to the CDTS component of the Earth Energy project, something that came up toward the end of last year was an issue with interconnection from the local utility. I may have missed the update, but can you just confirm whether that was resolved?
Zafar Rizvi: Yes. That is resolved, and now we are able to get the utility directly from Ameren, and it is no problem anymore.
Peter Dastreich: Okay. That is great. Thank you. So, you know, thanks for the update in terms of the ethanol margins. It looks like we are in a better place today versus earlier this year. But, you know, going into the second half, it would be great to hear your thoughts on the outlook for your co-products, as well. Thank you.
Zafar Rizvi: As you know, I already mentioned that we believe that our third quarter will be better than the second quarter. But it will not be as good as last year because last year was our second-best quarter. But as we also see the bumper crops, not only in South Dakota but also pretty good crops in Illinois, particularly in McLean County, which is the record corn this year in Illinois, and we see that will be very beneficial to both of our locations. We also see a bumper crop in Iowa, where we have a minority shareholder company, Big River, in which we own approximately 10%. So they also have record crops this year.
So we certainly see that there are going to be plenty of feedstock available. And, also, as you know, the export is increasing of ethanol, and we are very pleased with that. Not only Britain is planning to buy ethanol from the US, but also Japan plans to buy this year. Also, due to the tariff negotiation, we certainly see that if this continues, we will be in pretty good shape in our core business.
Stuart Rose: In terms of the byproducts, corn oil continues to be very strong. DDG is a little weak relative to corn prices. And with the bumper crop, I do not know if that is going to continue or not, but DDG has not been as strong relative to corn prices as it has in the past. Hopefully, that will turn around.
Zafar Rizvi: Yeah. I think that is correct, Stuart, because I think the export of DDG has dropped compared to last year. So that is one of the things we can see. Even Mexico is buying less than last year in the first six months. So that is certainly some concern.
Peter Dastreich: Okay. That is great. Thank you very much. Congratulations again, and I will get back in the queue. Our next question comes from Jared Edeling with South Dakota Investment Office. Please proceed with your question.
Jared Edeling: Hey, guys. Thanks very much for the opportunity to ask a question and great quarter. Just wanted to see if you could comment on the overall CI score of your two main plants given the change in the recent legislation relating to 45Z and if you would qualify for any credits without a carbon pipeline.
Zafar Rizvi: So do you want me to take that?
Stuart Rose: Yeah. Why do not you take it, Zafar?
Zafar Rizvi: Yeah. I think we have not really compared to other few companies that have declared their CI score. As you know, there is no clear guideline at this time. So that is one of the reasons we have not really discussed publicly what exactly is our CI score at this time until we have a clear guideline on what will be our CI score.
But we are certainly very happy to see that Smart Farming is no longer part of the calculation, and that will give us four to six points, and that could help us to really be able to go below 50 or close to that number where we could be able to get some CI score reduction without CI score and will be beneficial to us.
Stuart Rose: Also, as part of the One Earth project, we are doing things to make our plant more energy efficient, which should help our CI score. And there is a chance even without carbon capture, but like Zafar said, we cannot get we do not know the guidelines, so we are not going to say that it is going to happen. But there is a chance we could get some tax credits even without carbon capture, even before our carbon capture project is ready to go, but we do not feel we are in a position to say anything about that right now.
Jared Edeling: Excellent. Thank you. And given the Illinois moratorium on carbon pipelines, which appears to expire in July, if your Class VI well is approved, would you believe that you would be able to build that soon after that expiration?
Zafar Rizvi: That is what our goal is. But as you know, we still have after that is approved, we plan to get from the local county special use permit, and then we also have to have an IEPA permit. And we have discussions with the Illinois EPA, and we also have discussions with the ICC, Illinois Commerce Commission. They are also working on legislation or the guidelines, whichever they want us to follow. We certainly, if those guidelines are issued and all those approvals are received, then we certainly will be able to operate in February 2026, but, naturally, this depends on all of those permits once we receive those.
Jared Edeling: Excellent. And my final question is related to the short distance that the pipeline is. What is the build time once approvals come to first carbon injection?
Zafar Rizvi: I think once we receive, we have to apply. It is less than six and a half miles pipeline. The owner's answer is we build that pipeline. The reason is because from the very beginning, we wanted to make sure that we are away from the aquifer. Otherwise, we could have built that well right next to our ethanol facility, but we decided we want to be away from the aquifer so that way, in the future, there is no concern about the drinking water. And that is what exactly happened later on. The legislation was issued that there should not be any over or under that carbon sequestration where the aquifer is.
So we are six and a half miles away from the aquifer, and that is what the that. So it depends on how quickly we can get permission from ICC. Once we receive the permission from ICC, that takes about a couple of months to build the pipeline.
Jared Edeling: Great. Thanks so much, guys. Thank you.
Operator: We have reached the end of the question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Stuart Rose for closing comments.
Stuart Rose: I would like to thank everyone for listening. Again, we outperformed most in the industry this quarter, and we currently expect an even better quarter next quarter. It is all due to having great locations for our plants, great plants, and most importantly, the top people in the industry. And that goes from our CEO all the way to all the teams in our plants. That is really what makes us special and what makes us outperform the industry quarter after quarter. We look forward to talking to everyone after the end of our next quarter, and thank you again for listening.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And we thank you for your participation.
The Motley Fool’s analysts are tracking a massive shift in U.S. tech. Over $1.5 trillion is already flowing into infrastructure, AI, and advanced manufacturing… and the number keeps climbing.
Following a major tariff policy shift, a new AI Gold Rush is taking shape, and we think the real winner is a company 1/100th the size of NVIDIA.
It builds the tech infrastructure that Apple, OpenAI, and others suddenly can’t live without. We just released a full write-up on this under-the-radar stock — and why now might be the exact moment to move.

Nasdaq’s Market Surveillance platform, which covers a dozen asset classes, including digital assets and prediction markets, represents a significant upgrade, the CFTC said, as it moves to replace its “‘90s-era legacy system” for detecting illicit behavior among market participants.
Prediction markets have been buzzy, with the president's son joining Polymarket's advisory board on Tuesday.
Still, a Nasdaq spokesperson told Decrypt that prediction markets mirror derivatives that the CFTC has regulated since the agency was established in 1974.
“Prediction markets operate in the same way as most derivative markets, with similar potential for market abuse and manipulation,” the spokesperson said. “The technology can therefore be adapted to serve almost all forms of event-based markets.”
At the same time, the CFTC acknowledged that markets have changed rapidly in recent years, with digital infrastructure providing round-the-clock trading.
“The growth in both traditional and new markets and products, combined with innovations in market structure, such as the launch of continuous trading hours, require increasingly sophisticated tools to prevent and detect potential market abuse,” the CFTC said.
The shift also comes as U.S. lawmakers mull the CLARITY Act, a comprehensive piece of crypto legislation that would establish jurisdiction between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the CFTC.
The bill was passed in the U.S. House of Representatives last month, and under its current text, most cryptocurrencies would fall under the classification of a commodity, as opposed to a security, removing them from the SEC’s regulatory remit.
The CFTC noted that Nasdaq’s Market Surveillance platform is already used by 50 exchanges, as well as nearly two dozen international regulators. A regulatory guide for crypto that was recently released by Nasdaq notes that the CFTC has been “exploring blockchain technology applications to strengthen regulatory surveillance capabilities.”
The Commission said it's in the midst of a “crypto sprint,” moving quickly to implement recommendations from a sweeping White House crypto report released recently, which may end up putting new obligations on the intermediaries that it covers.
Unicoin Will Move to Dismiss SEC Fraud Case, Says CEO
The 166-page report recommended that “venues for non-security digital assets should be required to report market data, subject to reporting obligations established by the CFTC,” such as crypto exchanges and prediction markets.",5585968d004015150fbd13c7b4440923,trafilatura

Cracker Barrel CEO Julie Felss Masino joined the restaurant chain as CEO in July 2023 and the company's board of directors several months later.
Corporate documents show Masino received a base salary of $1 million in 2024, in addition to other bonuses or awards based on incentive targets.
The company has struggled in recent years, with its stock price down about 55% over the past five years despite having risen about 52% in the last year.
Conservatives Declare Victory As Cracker Barrel Ditches New Logo
Steak 'n Shake CEO Sardar Biglari, who is also one of the largest investors in Cracker Barrel, criticized the proposed rebrand and said that Masino and the board ignored his suggestion that the rebranding was ""obvious folly"" and was dismissed as an activist investor.
Steak 'n Shake released an image on social media Tuesday of a MAGA-style red hat with the script, ""Fire Cracker Barrel CEO.""
Cracker Barrel Scraps New Logo Design, Keeps 'Old Timer' After Listening To Customers
Cracker Barrel announced Tuesday night that it was backing off the rebranding push in response to the public's support for the old corporate logo.
""We thank our guests for sharing your voices and love for Cracker Barrel. We said we would listen, and we have. Our new logo is going away and our 'Old Timer' will remain,"" the company said in a post on social media.
""At Cracker Barrel, it's always been – and always will be – about serving up delicious food, warm welcomes, and the kind of country hospitality that feels like family.

Tesla Options Volume Is Surging – Here Are 3 Long Calls For Maximum Gains
The semiconductor stock has averaged a 4.72% move following earnings over the past four quarters. Heading into its Q2 print, Nvidia stock is up more than 100% versus its year-to-date low set in April.
Why Nvidia Stock Could Pull Back After Q2 Earnings
Nvidia stock has pulled back following three of its last four earnings events, and the Q2 release today may not be any different, says Tom Sosnoff, the co-founder of Tastytrade.
According to him, the semiconductor stock is significantly overvalued and due for a breather heading into the quarterly update.
However, there are reasons beyond valuation that could weigh on NVDA shares after the financial release.
For one, management could guide cautiously amidst geopolitical risks to its China business, which could disappoint investors and trigger a meaningful selloff in the AI stock after the earnings release.
Tom Lee Says ‘Buy’ if NVDA Shares Retreat After Earnings
If Nvidia shares do indeed retreat following the quarterly update, long-term investors should treat it as an opportunity to load up on them, says Tom Lee, the head of research at Fundstrat Global.
In a recent CNBC interview, Lee said AI remains a strong wind at NVDA’s back, adding it’s “one of the most important companies in the middle of the biggest structural change in the world economy.”
According to him, the artificial intelligence trade is still in its early innings only, especially since “there’s such a limited number of stocks that represent a direct play on AI.”
Wall Street Remains Bullish on Nvidia Heading into the Q2 Print
Despite NVDA shares’ blockbuster performance over the past four months, Wall Street analysts remain bullish as ever on the AI chips giant.

The move strengthens DHL’s position as a leader in healthcare logistics, while also addressing rising demand for temperature-sensitive pharmaceutical transportation across the region.
The 38,000-square-foot site is the first within KLIA’s Free Commercial Zone certified for both 15–25°C and 2–8°C storage, adding a new layer of flexibility for manufacturers and distributors of pharmaceuticals, biologics, and vaccines. The hub carries both IATA CEIV Pharma certification and DHL’s Air GxP certification, underscoring compliance with the industry’s most stringent standards.
A Cold Chain Facility Designed for Growth
The KLIA facility represents a significant step in DHL’s push to expand its pharma supply chain infrastructure. Features include dedicated cold rooms, secure storage cages with restricted access, automated environmental monitoring, and reefer truck transfers to maintain integrity from pickup to delivery.
DHL officials say the site is designed to reduce turnaround time, minimize third-party handling, and ensure compliance with Good Distribution Practice (GDP) standards. It also incorporates sustainability measures such as energy-efficient compressors and refrigerants with lower environmental impact.
“Malaysia is strategically located to serve as a regional hub for global medical technology companies, and the fast-growing market is expected to reach a value of $4.5 billion by 2028,” said Praveen Gregory, Managing Director for Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei at DHL Global Forwarding. “Our cold chain infrastructure in KLIA has consistently delivered high standards in pharmaceutical logistics since 2023, and as demand across Asia Pacific accelerates, we are ready to lead with best-in-class facilities and expertise.”
Asia Pacific Healthcare Logistics on the Rise
The expansion comes as Asia Pacific’s healthcare logistics market continues to surge. A Data Bridge Market Research report projects that the sector will grow from $17.6 billion in 2022 to $29.5 billion by 2030, a compound annual growth rate of 7.1%. That growth is being fueled by aging populations, rising chronic disease prevalence, and increasing demand for vaccines and biologics.
DHL is positioning itself at the center of this trend. The company currently operates 37 Air GxP-certified stations and 12 IATA CEIV Pharma-certified facilities across the region, including hubs in Singapore, Tokyo, Seoul, Sydney, and Shanghai. The new KLIA hub further solidifies Malaysia’s role as a strategic node in the global healthcare supply chain.",0c9b54877a23e0ad14c94f4ea91b0597,trafilatura

In remarks released by the central bank on Wednesday, Gomes said the institution ""plays the role of a neutral agent, providing a public digital infrastructure that allows the market to develop more efficiently, inclusively and competitively.""
Pix is among the Brazilian trade practices under formal investigation by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration in a case opened by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), which views the system as potentially unfair.
Launched in late 2020, Pix quickly became Brazil's most used payment method, sharply eroding the share of cash, cards, checks, bank slips and other forms of payment in Latin America's largest economy.
By cutting out intermediaries, Pix has squeezed revenue from card networks such as Visa and Mastercard, card processors including Cielo, StoneCo, PagBank and Getnet, and banks that once charged more for traditional transfers.
Gomes said Pix helped bring 80 million individuals into the financial system until 2023, driving rapid digitalization of the financial and payments industry, which he stressed benefits everyone.
""After Pix was implemented, the use of payment cards has continued to grow,"" he said.
According to the director, relying on the private sector to build essential payments infrastructure had failed in Brazil, prompting the central bank to begin this project in 2018 after repeated industry attempts fell short.
""The market is good for competition and innovation, but less effective when the goal is to provide a public good through private effort,"" he noted, emphasizing that the market tends to undersupply interoperability, resulting in concentration, low innovation and high prices.
""As the central bank's mandate is to ensure safety, competitiveness and efficiency in payments, and not to profit from Pix, there are no pecuniary interests that could create conflicts,"" Gomes said.

Tilray’s Stock Price Is Growing Like a Weed. Here’s Why, and What Comes Next.
AJG stock has delivered a 6.1% year-to-date (YTD) return and rose 3.9% over the past 52 weeks, underperforming the broader S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) gains of 9.9% on a YTD basis and 15.1% returns over the past year.
Narrowing the focus to the broader insurance sector, AJG edged past the SPDR S&P Insurance ETF’s (KIE) 5% YTD return, but is trailing the ETF’s 7.2% gains over the past year.
In 2025, AJG stock’s trajectory closely mirrored its quarterly results. On July 31, the company released its Q2 earnings, showcasing solid top-line momentum with 16% year-over-year revenue growth and 5.4% organic gains, supported by strong adjusted EBITDAC margins and strategic progress from acquisitions and tech investments.
Yet investor enthusiasm was tempered as Q2 adjusted EPS came in at $2.33, slightly below expectations, highlighting modest earnings and revenue misses despite the company’s growth initiatives.
For the current fiscal year, ending in December 2025, analysts expect Arthur J. Gallagher to report EPS growth of 8.8% YoY to $10.98, on a diluted basis. The company has a mixed earnings surprise history overall. While it surpassed or matched the Street’s bottom-line projections in three of the four quarters, it missed the estimates in one other occasion.
Among the 21 analysts covering AJG stock, the consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on 10 “Strong Buys,” 10 “Holds,” and one “Strong Sell” rating.
The configuration has stayed mostly steady in recent months, but sentiment is tilting bullish. “Strong Buy” ratings have edged up slightly, rising from nine to 10 over the past month, reflecting growing analyst confidence.",fe69c10c98a2159cc9034e25e32d070c,trafilatura

The project adds another step in the company's effort to modernize and expand its North American logistics footprint.
The company said it will build a 422,000-square-foot Mopar Parts Distribution Center in Forsyth, Georgia, located roughly an hour south of Atlanta.
The facility will serve dealers and customers across the Southeastern United States, streamlining operations with faster shipping and new automation tools.
The Georgia center is expected to support about 90 union-represented positions tied to the United Auto Workers.
Darren Bradshaw, senior vice president of Mopar North America, called the facility ""a critical investment in Mopar's long-term growth strategy,"" noting it will give employees advanced technology and a more sustainable work environment.
A key feature of the site will be a 16,000-square-foot AutoStore system, a highly automated storage and retrieval platform.
The technology deploys 66 robots that move parts from a dense grid of bins to workstations, where employees prepare shipments.
The system is designed to accelerate fulfillment, improve accuracy and optimize warehouse space.
The Forsyth project will integrate energy-saving equipment and green building practices, aligning with Stellantis' broader commitment to lowering its environmental impact.
Mopar, the company's service and parts brand with an 88-year history, will manage the site as part of its network serving Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Alfa Romeo and Fiat vehicles.
The announcement follows Stellantis' July commitment of $388 million to establish a massive Mopar Megahub in Metro Detroit and the recent opening of a $64 million center in East Fishkill, New York.
Together, the projects push Stellantis' distribution investments in North America to nearly $500 million this year.

Looking closer, Williams-Sonoma stock has outpaced the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLY) 25.6% return over the past 52 weeks.
Williams-Sonoma shares fell marginally on Aug. 27 despite reporting better-than-expected Q2 2025 EPS of $2 and revenue of $1.8 billion. The company disclosed merchandise inventories up 17.7% year-over-year to $1.4 billion from a strategic pull-forward to offset tariffs, highlighting exposure to significant incremental tariff costs.
For the fiscal year ending in January 2026, analysts expect WSM’s EPS to decrease 2.8% year-over-year to $8.54. However, the company's earnings surprise history is promising. It beat the consensus estimates in the last four quarters.
Among the 19 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on five “Strong Buy” ratings, one “Moderate Buy,” and 13 “Holds.”
On Aug. 25, KeyBanc analyst Bradley Thomas raised Williams-Sonoma’s price target to $230 while maintaining an “Overweight” rating.
The mean price target of $196.88 represents a marginal premium to WSM’s current price levels. The Street-high price target of $230 suggests a 17.3% potential upside.

Few large retailers have been through the wringer as much as Kohl’s over the past few years. Most dramatically, in April, it fired its CEO for trying to steer company business to his girlfriend, precipitating its third CEO transition in as many years. But more important, Kohl’s has been losing sales for years, with one turnaround attempt after another falling short of restoring a once-beloved retailer.
So on Wednesday, shares shot up 20% when Kohl’s had a rare piece of good news to share with Wall Street: a much better than expected adjusted profit, thanks to cost discipline and leaner inventory, that led it to raise its full-year forecast. Clearly investors will take victories where they can find them, because victories have been few and far between for the chain. (Shares have recovered only slightly from 30-year lows hit this spring.)
What’s more, the big stock pop is in large part the result of one-third of Kohl’s shares being held short; the stock was also a meme recently, making it highly susceptible to speculative trading.
The fact remains that Kohl’s is struggling: Net sales fell 5.1% in the quarter ended Aug. 2 and are still expected to fall for the year between 5% and 6%, slightly less awful than the 5% to 7% range in its previous forecast. Kohl’s has lost millions of customers, and its business is 20% smaller than it was in 2019, while T.J. Maxx, Walmart, and Target are much larger now. Last year, Kohl’s saw sales in every category, except for the Sephora shops, fall by a double-digit percentage.
Interim CEO Michael Bender, a Kohl’s director, took the reins in May after Ashley Buchanan was ousted three months into the job. (It won’t be surprising if Kohl’s drops the “interim” soon, assuming Bender wants the job permanently; it seems unlikely the company wants to carry out yet another CEO search.)
Bender has his work cut out for him. The cost cuts and tight inventory, which protect margins against having to discount merchandise Kohl’s doesn’t end up selling, are giving Kohl’s breathing room financially to take another stab at turning itself around. But some of the moves Kohl’s has made to protect profits can in fact hurt sales. Lower inventory helps margins by reducing how much merchandise gets discounted if it’s not catching on with shoppers, but it can also mean lost sales and visually unappealing empty shelves. Leaner staffing means lower costs but can also mean messier stores, and a long wait to check out that can frustrate a shopper and foment low morale among employees.
“It’s not that that management lacks the will to improve or the desire for change. The challenge lies in an inability to execute at an operational level,” says GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders.",4be7fcbba0fff174dd3e4d0f7f2eb66a,trafilatura

The move will see Linklogis deploy its trade finance application on XRPL’s mainnet, a step aimed at scaling blockchain adoption for cross-border settlements.
The collaboration is designed to unlock faster circulation of digital assets tied to international trade flows. Linklogis intends to simplify settlement for exporters, importers, and financiers by linking its financial infrastructure with XRPL.
Beyond the initial rollout, both sides have committed to developing new products on XRPL.
These include stablecoin-based settlement systems and smart contract platforms that can bring supply chain real-world assets (RWAs) into tokenized form.
Linklogis also signaled that it will explore using artificial intelligence with blockchain to improve trade finance efficiency.
According to the firm, its “Go Early” and “Go Deep” business programs processed more than RMB 20.7 billion (about $2.8 billion) in cross-border assets last year. By anchoring those flows to XRPL, Linklogis aims to extend efficiency and transparency across global supply chains.
XRPL’s expanding RWA footprint
The integration comes as XRPL accelerates its adoption across RWA sectors.
Data from RWA.xyz shows the network’s tokenized RWA volume climbed 22.81% in the past month, reaching roughly $305.8 million. That growth has positioned XRPL as the ninth-largest blockchain by RWA value, supported by its expanding roster of enterprise partners.
Notably, XRPL’s recent global partnerships highlight its growing relevance in tokenization.
The Dubai Land Department adopted the ledger to power its real estate tokenization program earlier this year in May. A month later, RWA platform Ondo Finance launched tokenized US Treasuries on the network.
Momentum has also spread to Latin America. Brazilian securitization firm VERT issued a 700 million real ($130 million) Agribusiness Receivables Certificate on XRPL through a blockchain-based private credit platform.
Around the same time, exchange Mercado Bitcoin disclosed plans to tokenize more than $200 million in fixed-income and equity products on the ledger.

While insurance companies don’t use credit the same way lenders do, having poor credit could still increase your insurance costs, and good credit could save you money on insurance premiums.

Does your credit score affect car insurance?
In states that allow it, many major car insurance companies review credit history to make coverage decisions and set auto insurance rates. They do this because they believe credit history can predict the likelihood you’ll file a claim. The higher your claim risk, the more you will pay for auto insurance.
Some of the car insurance companies that check your credit are Allstate, GEICO, Nationwide, and Progressive.
Credit scores and credit-based insurance scores
Your credit score represents how financially responsible you are with money or how you manage money you borrow. Lenders use your credit score to check your eligibility for loans and set your interest rates.
Though insurance companies don’t use your credit score directly, they have their own measure called the credit-based insurance score (CBIS), or insurance score. The table below highlights the differences between a standard credit score and the credit-based insurance score.
Why insurance companies use credit-based insurance scores
According to the Insurance Information Institute, studies have linked debt management skills with the likelihood of filing insurance claims. In other words, people with better credit often file fewer auto insurance claims. Conversely, individuals with poor credit tend to file more claims.
People who file more claims cost more to insure because each claim represents a loss to the insurance company. It’s in an insurance company’s best interest to set rates based on a driver’s loss potential. This translates to lower premiums for drivers with good credit and higher premiums for those with bad credit.
How credit affects insurance rates
A 2023 study by Consumer Federation of America (CFA) reports these data points on car insurance rates for drivers with different credit scores:
-
Annual rates for drivers with clean driving records range from $470 to $1,012 due to credit score differences
-
Drivers with fair credit pay 49% more than drivers with excellent credit
-
Drivers with poor credit pay 115% more than drivers with excellent credit and 44% more than drivers with fair credit
What this means: If you have bad credit, it could double the cost of your car insurance. Make a plan to improve your score and lower your premium.
State regulations on using credit scores for auto insurance
Where you live can have an impact on how auto insurance companies use credit information in setting insurance rates. In California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, and Michigan, there are laws prohibiting insurance companies from using credit as a determining factor in the underwriting process.
Some other states have laws that limit how credit is used by insurers. For example, in Maryland, auto insurance companies are allowed to use credit history to determine rates, but they can’t deny or cancel a policy due to your credit.
Auto insurance companies that don’t check credit history
There are some smaller insurers that don’t use insurance scores to set your rates, even in states that allow it, such as:
-
Dillo Insurance in Texas
-
Cure Auto Insurance in Michigan
Pay-per-mile insurance provider Root announced in 2020 that it would phase out credit reviews for insurance applications by 2025, but it has not yet fulfilled that promise.
What factors influence your insurance score?
Each insurance company has its own criteria for factoring credit into the underwriting process. The weight given to various components that make up an individual’s creditworthiness — such as payment history, amount of outstanding debt, and length of credit history — can vary from one auto insurer to the next.
Typically, these factors will lower your CBIS:
-
Late payments
-
Accounts in collection
-
Limited credit history
-
High debt utilization (using a large percentage of your available credit)
-
Many recent credit inquiries (indicates you’re applying for new debt, like a credit card)
On the flipside, these factors could raise your score:
-
A long history of credit management
-
All open accounts current and in good standing
Does good credit automatically mean better insurance premiums?
Credit history is not the only thing insurance companies are looking at when determining insurance rates. Driving record, where you live, what car you drive, your age, and other factors apply, as well.
A person with great credit but who has a history of multiple car accidents and lives in a city with high occurrences of auto theft might end up having a higher insurance premium than someone with a subpar credit history but who has never filed a car insurance claim in 25 years and lives in a town with a low crime rate.
4 ways to improve your credit score for lower car insurance costs
Improving your credit doesn’t happen overnight, but following these tips could demonstrate responsible use of credit and lower your car insurance rates.
1. Review your credit report periodically
An annual review of your credit report can help you spot errors and mistakes. When looking through your credit report, check carefully for errors — such as an account in collections that you paid off or new accounts open that you never authorized. You can send a dispute letter to the credit reporting agency if you spot any errors.
Get a copy of your credit report from the three major credit reporting bureaus — Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. You can access a free copy of your credit report each year through AnnualCreditReport.com.
2. Pay bills on time
A history of on-time payments is favorable to both lenders and insurers. If you struggle with remembering to pay your bills on time, put your bills on auto-draft so you don’t have to worry about missing payments. Open a separate bank account just for your monthly bill payments so you don’t wind up spending your bill money on other expenses.
3. Lower your overall debt
Creating a budget that focuses on the essentials and limits other spending can help you free up money in order to pay down your debt. You may want to tackle your lowest balances first for the motivation boost of paying off an account quickly. Or you might choose to pay down your accounts with the highest interest rates first, so you end up paying less in interest over time.
4. Keep credit utilization low
Many personal finance experts say you should try to keep your credit utilization under 30%. If you can get it lower than that, even better. Paying more than your minimum payment or making additional debt payments throughout the month can help you bring down your credit utilization. Asking creditors for a credit limit increase is another way to lower your credit utilization.

Other options for finding the best insurance rate
Aside from improving your credit, there are other steps you can take to get the cheapest car insurance.
1. Compare quotes from multiple insurance providers
Never settle for the first car insurance quote you receive. Seek out quotes from multiple insurance companies to nail down the best offerings available to you. Likewise, you can take advantage of online tools that will show you rates from multiple companies in a side-by-side comparison.

2. Explore what discounts may be available to you
You can shave dollars off your insurance premiums thanks to special incentives and discounts that insurance providers offer. These cost savings may not be applied automatically, so it’s essential to ask which discounts are available to you.
Some common insurance discounts include:
-
Safe driver discounts
-
Low mileage discounts
-
Bundling discounts
-
Military discounts
-
Paperless billing discounts
-
Autopay discounts
-
Discounts for paying your insurance premium annually rather than monthly

3. Evaluate the amount of coverage you truly need
While auto liability insurance is mandatory in most areas of the country when you register a vehicle, you can choose to opt out of other car insurance coverage, such as collision insurance or comprehensive insurance. If you drive an older vehicle that’s paid in full and already has some cosmetic damage, you could save money by opting out of carrying additional insurance coverage — especially if you have enough savings to fix or replace your car in the event of an accident.
Learn more: How much car insurance do I need?
4. Look into adjusting your deductible amount
Your car insurance deductible is the amount of money that you would pay out of pocket before your insurance coverage kicks in after filing a claim.
By opting to go with a higher deductible, you can lower your premiums. Before going this route, however, you should have a healthy emergency fund and be confident that you’ll have the money to cover your deductible should the need arise.
Credit score and insurance frequently asked questions
The connection between credit and car insurance can seem complex. The answers to the following questions should shed additional light on the matter.
Does credit score affect car insurance rates?
Your typical credit score, or FICO score, doesn’t directly affect car insurance rates. However, auto insurance companies use a similar evaluating method called credit-based insurance scores or CBIS. These “insurance credit scores” are used to predict the likelihood of an individual filing insurance claims. It’s just one factor in determining car insurance rates, but if you want the most ideal rates, work on improving your credit.
Why do car insurance companies check your credit?
Studies have shown that an individual’s likelihood of filing auto insurance claims is related to their creditworthiness. People with good credit tend to file fewer insurance claims, while people with poor credit tend to file more claims. Insurance companies want to minimize their risks, so they typically issue higher insurance rates to people with poor credit to hedge against the possibility that they’ll have to pay out more money than for customers with better credit. Insurance companies may pull your credit report to help determine insurance premiums, but it would be a soft inquiry that would not affect your credit score.
Can you be turned down for insurance because of your credit score?
While some states — such as California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, and Michigan — have laws that stipulate credit cannot be a factor when issuing auto insurance, many states do look at an individual’s creditworthiness during the underwriting process. While having bad credit typically means you’ll just pay more in insurance premiums, there is a possibility that certain insurance companies could deny covering you, because they view you as too risky based on your financial history.
Does having a high credit score mean you will have lower insurance rates?
Credit is just one factor insurers analyze when issuing you an insurance policy. Companies also look at other criteria, including driving history, location, and type of car you drive. A high credit score could mean you’d pay less in insurance premiums. However, if you have a history of getting into multiple car accidents or you live in a city with high auto theft, your high credit score may not help you get lower insurance rates.
Does paying car insurance build credit?
Paying your car insurance bills on time typically does not improve your credit. However, having missed payments can cause your creditworthiness to decline. Make sure you pay your car insurance bills in full and on time to avoid affecting your credit.

(NYSE: CRCL), a stablecoin firm, to allow banks to integrate USDC settlement into cross-border payment flows.
In an announcement, the firm explains that this initiative will use Finastra’s payment hub solutions, including Global PAYplus (GPP), marking the first time Finastra will connect financial institutions to Circle’s payment infrastructure.
The companies said the partnership will also allow for faster international transfers by combining Finastra’s banking network’s scalability with USDC’s stability and transparency.
USDC Settlement Option
Through this collaboration, Finastra’s GPP customers—already processing over $5 trillion in cross-border transactions daily—will be able to settle transactions in USDC, even when underlying payment instructions remain denominated in fiat currencies.
This new option reduces reliance on traditional correspondent banking networks, allowing banks to accelerate settlement times without compromising compliance requirements or foreign exchange processes.
Empowering Banks With New Options
“This collaboration is about giving banks the tools they need to innovate in cross-border payments without having to build a standalone payment processing infrastructure,” said Chris Walters, CEO of Finastra.
He explained that by linking Finastra’s payment hub to Circle’s blockchain-based settlement infrastructure, banks can explore payment models while maintaining operational continuity.
Expanding USDC’s Global Role
“Finastra’s reach and expertise in powering the payments infrastructure for leading banks worldwide makes them a natural choice to further expand USDC settlement in cross-border flows,” said Jeremy Allaire, co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Circle.
With stablecoin adoption gaining momentum, the Finastra-Circle partnership represents a major move in reshaping international payments.
Circle Debuts Layer-1 Blockchain Arc Using USDC for Native Gas
Earlier this month, Circle unveiled Arc, an open Layer-1 blockchain designed specifically for stablecoin finance. This marks what the company calls a “defining moment” as it moves toward developing a full-stack internet financial platform.
The announcement came alongside Circle’s fiscal Q2 2025 results, which showed substantial growth in its core business. Circle reported that USDC in circulation surged 90% year-over-year to $61.3 billion, reaching $65.2 billion as of August 10, 2025. Total revenue and reserve income grew 53% to $658 million, while adjusted EBITDA climbed 52% to $126 million.",1dc7c3e45c93859cfa3b30ffd98454d4,trafilatura

Analysts believe that the recent pullback in the shares offer a more compelling setup into earnings. July quarter results for enterprise hardware are expected to modestly outperform expectations driven by robust artificial intelligence spend and solid PCs in Q2.

According to Morgan Stanley, Dell is the leading OEM for AI compute, gaining share with key customers xAI and CRVV. Several other catalysts are working in favor of the stock, which is why the firm likes its long-term story.
“We continue to like DELL’s long-term story — the company is the clear leading OEM for AI compute and is gaining share with key customers xAI and CRVV, is back to gaining share in enterprise storage markets, is performing decently in traditional servers, and is in the middle innings of a company-wide cost efficiency program that we see driving 10%+ EPS growth over the next 3 years (vs. mgmt’s stated goal of 8%+). At $128, or ~10% lower than a week ago, DELL is trading at 11.3x our FY27/CY26 EPS, which is 5% above Consensus, and thus we see an opportunity for both multiple expansion and positive EPS revisions from here. That said, we see less upside to DELL vs. HPE over the next 12 months given DELL’s current valuation premium, unless we gain confidence that DELL Storage can be a secular grower (aided by AI attach), which is incorporated into our $196 bull case valuation. DELL’s October 7 Analyst Day will be the next major catalyst after F2Q earnings.”

Fujifilm Group Celebrates 60 Years of Innovation as a Strategic Regional Hub in Singapore
PR Newswire
6 min read
Six decades of innovation, supporting over 1,100 employees across five Singapore entities and serving more than 14 Asia Pacific markets
SINGAPORE, Aug. 29, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- As Singapore commemorates its 60th year of independence, the Fujifilm Group of companies in Singapore proudly marks six decades of partnership, progress, and innovation with the nation. To mark this milestone, Fujifilm employees participated in the heartfelt ""Thanks Smile Shot"" initiative, which reflects the Fujifilm Group Purpose of ""Giving our world more smiles"". Through this initiative, employees shared moments of joy and connection, celebrating Fujifilm's journey alongside Singapore's own story of growth.
Singapore as a Strategic Hub for Innovation and Growth
Over the years, Fujifilm has continuously evolved its businesses, transitioning from its early days in photographic devices and film to diversifying into healthcare, semiconductor materials and digital transformation. This development has advanced alongside Singapore's growth, positioning Fujifilm as a leader across various key industries.
Today, Singapore serves as a critical hub for Fujifilm, hosting five group companies and functioning as the regional headquarters for core business segments[1] – healthcare, electronics, business innovation and imaging. With over 1,100 employees locally, Fujifilm supports customers across more than 14 Asia Pacific markets, cementing Singapore's role as a key driver of its regional presence.
Haruto Iwata, Managing Director of FUJIFILM Asia Pacific, said, ""Singapore has been at the heart of Fujifilm's growth in Asia Pacific for the past six decades and its role will be just as vital in the decades to come. Its strategic location, skilled talent pool, and stable economy continue to empower us to be a market leader in healthcare, electronics, business innovation and imaging. Singapore plays an important role in our business expansion and remains a key launchpad for future-ready solutions that shape industries and improve lives across the region.""
In line with this vision, the group established FUJIFILM Electronic Materials (Singapore) this year, further strengthening Singapore's role as a key supply chain hub for semiconductor manufacturers across the region. FUJIFILM Electronic Materials (Singapore) also serves as the company's first and only semiconductor materials manufacturing site in Southeast Asia. In 2022, FUJIFILM Healthcare Asia Pacific was also established to serve the healthcare needs in this region, providing advanced medical imaging and diagnostic solutions to healthcare providers. This expansion reinforces Fujifilm's commitment to supporting Singapore's healthcare ecosystem, enhancing patient care and contributing to the ongoing development of medical solutions across the region.
Mr Lim Wey-Len, Executive Vice President, Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) said: ""Fujifilm has been a longstanding partner to Singapore for over 60 years, reflecting strong confidence in Singapore as its regional hub to access Asia Pacific markets. The group continues to use Singapore as a base in its digitisation push and move into new areas of growth. Its investments here foster collaborative R&D and create high-quality jobs for Singaporeans across imaging, information solutions, semiconductors, and healthcare sectors. We look forward to strengthening this partnership as Fujifilm builds on Singapore's innovation ecosystem to seize new opportunities and stay competitive.""
Powering Smart, Sustainable Growth from Singapore
FUJIFILM Business Innovation Asia Pacific is at the forefront of empowering businesses to thrive in the digital era, combining intelligent automation with circular innovation to drive sustainable transformation across Asia Pacific. From its strategic hub in Singapore, the group reimagines workflows and infrastructure so that organizations can unlock greater agility, efficiency, and competitive advantage.
Strengthening Singapore's Smart Nation ambitions, the company leads regional digital transformation initiatives from Singapore to deliver tools across diverse industries – such as cloud-native workflow automation, smart office platform and AI-driven analytics, helping customers improve operations, elevate employee experience, and accelerate data-driven decision-making while reducing environmental impact.
Masatsugu Naito, President of FUJIFILM Business Innovation Asia Pacific, stated, ""Our rebranding to FUJIFILM Business Innovation was a declaration of intent. Asia Pacific's digital acceleration demands more than incremental change - it requires rethinking how technology, sustainability, and human collaboration converge. While the printing sector faces challenges, we see growing opportunities in digital transformation (DX), AI, and integrated solutions. We must be ready to adapt and embrace new business models to drive more efficient process automation in Singapore. I have already seen tangible use cases and look forward to opportunities that will be developed through collaboration with customers, partners, and the broader innovation ecosystem here.""
Fujifilm is poised to drive Singapore's progress in key strategic areas, leveraging its advanced manufacturing capabilities, transformative healthcare technologies, and innovative digital solutions to support the nation's vision for sustainable economic growth and industry leadership.
Celebrating SG60 Through Smiles
To honour Singapore's 60th year of independence, Fujifilm hosted a special commemorative event with its employees and esteemed guests, including representatives from the Singapore Economic Development Board. As part of the celebration, a collaborative Instax photo installation was unveiled, representing the people and places that inspire Fujifilm's ongoing commitment to innovation, nation-building, and smiles.
Wee Tee Hsien, CEO of FUJIFILM Business Innovation Singapore, said, ""Celebrating our 60 years journey alongside Singapore is incredibly meaningful. We have grown with Singapore through every phase of economic transformation, from industrialization to today's digital economy. Looking ahead, we remain committed to empowering Singapore businesses with innovative solutions that help them reimagine how they work, boost productivity and thrive in the digital age.""
In the lead-up to the event, Fujifilm employees across its five entities contributed over 720 Instax photos, capturing meaningful moments of joy, teamwork, and connection. These photos were thoughtfully curated into three striking panels featuring iconic symbols of Singapore, namely Changi Airport Control Tower, Vanda Miss Joaquim, also known as the Singapore orchid, and the Lion Head Symbol. (See Annex A for photos and captions.)
This employee-driven initiative embodies Fujifilm's corporate purpose and celebrates Singapore's journey from independence to a global city-state. As the nation enters its next chapter of growth, Fujifilm remains committed to empowering the next generation through cutting-edge technology, strong partnerships, and a shared mission: Giving our world more smiles.

The price target cut reflects the challenges Baidu is facing in its core advertising business, witnessing a 15% year-over-year revenue decline in the second quarter of 2025. With GenAI search monetization still in early stages, the second-quarter ad outlook was “muted”.
On the other hand, the company’s non-advertising revenue continues to gain traction, accounting for an estimated 40% Baidu Core. This is driven by strong AI Cloud growth, which expanded 34% year-over-year in the first half of 2025, as well as subscription-based revenue for improved stability.
The firm also talked about the company’s autonomous driving service, Apollo Go, which is demonstrating strong performance.
“Apollo Go adds further depth, with fully driverless rides up 148% y/y and global expansion gaining pace through partnerships with Uber and Lyft. While the combination of soft ad trends and continued AI investment may weigh on margins near term, management’s focus on cost efficiency and disciplined execution should help to mitigate the impacts. We believe that the upcoming launch of ERNIE 5.0 and rising engagement with AI-powered search reinforce Baidu’s pivot toward a more diversified, innovation-led model, though execution remains key in this evolving landscape.”

As the world's most valuable company, a big post-earnings move in Nvidia's value would have a broader market impact.
Nvidia (NVDA), the AI chipmaker at the heart of the artificial intelligence boom, is set to release its second-quarter earnings after markets close later today, in what could prove to be a market-moving event.
Shares were little changed near $182 in recent trading ahead of the results, though the stock has added more than a third of its value in 2025 as demand for its AI hardware surged.
Analysts expect the chipmaker's sales could reach another quarterly record, estimates compiled by Visible Alpha show, despite an anticipated hit from China export curbs, with Nvidia's position as the world's largest AI chipmaker making it a bellwether for the industry.
After Nvidia recently struck a revenue-sharing agreement with the Trump administration in exchange for licenses to resume sales of key AI chips to China, investors will likely be watching closely for what CEO Jensen Huang has to say about the company's outlook, as well as any updates on its next-generation product pipeline.
Recent options pricing suggests traders anticipate Nvidia's stock could stand to move more than 6% by the end of the week, in what would be its biggest post-earnings move in more than a year. And as the world's most valuable company, Nvidia commands more influence over the S&P 500 than any other, with a reaction in its stock likely to have a broader market impact.
The benchmark index edged 0.2% higher in recent trading ahead of the results, hovering just under its intraday highs and on track to close at a record if those gains hold. (Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here.)

As a result of those negotiations, Spinnova signed a non-binding term sheet in June to secure full ownership of the Woodspin demo plant.
“This grants Spinnova full ownership of the producer and distributor Woodspin, as well as the provider of raw material, Suzano Finland Oy, for manufacturing wood-based Spinnova fiber,” Spinnova said in a statement. “These transactions, subject to customary closing terms, are expected to close within the next couple of weeks.”
To that end, Suzano will make a capital contribution of roughly $5.8 million to Woodspin and Suzano Finland as well.
Per the agreement, Spinnova now has full ownership of the only large facility—the Woodspin demo plant—with the needed infrastructure and utilities in place to produce Spinnova fiber from pulp to bale. However, operations at Woodspin have ceased until further notice while alternatives for continued operations are being sought. But, with the joint venture agreement between Spinnova and Suzano now terminated, Spinnova can license its technology freely.
As Spinnova stated in June, the acquisitions won’t have an adverse cash flow effect in the short term.
“Spinnova has recognized an impairment loss on Woodspin, which will negatively impact Spinnova’s results in 2025,” the company said, noting the impact of the impairment will be communicated in the half-year report for January-June 2025.
Also, as previously stated, Spinnova hasn’t given financial guidance for 2025.",7284b3709d1a15505bc39edc9476a6f3,trafilatura

The company expects the tariffs currently in place to have an overall net negative impact on earnings in 2025, including an approximately $70 million unmitigated impact to earnings before interest and taxes or approximately $1.15 per share compared to previous guidance of $65 million and $1.05 per share.

“We expect to mitigate some of these costs through strategic actions in the second half of the year and fully mitigate the impact over time. But for this year, some we will need to absorb. The net impact of the tariffs and these mitigation actions are embedded within our guidance,” Zac Coughlin, chief financial officer of PVH, said during a call with analysts.
At the same time, he provided an update on mitigation efforts.
“We’d previously communicated that we’d mitigate approximately 50 percent of the costs of the prior cost in 2025, with more over time. With the newly announced rates coming in for Q4 for us so around 2 times higher than we previously had talked about, we do see that mitigation costs being a little bit lower for 2025,” he said. “But most importantly, we expect to continue to expand on our mitigation efforts through the strategic actions throughout 2026.”
“Just like all of our competitors, we are working through how to best mitigate the tariffs in a way that keeps our competitive positioning,” added Stefan Larsson, CEO of PVH, on the call.
“We assess every part of the value chain and it’s still early, but we are well-positioned to work through this in a competitive way.”
On Tuesday, PVH Corp. said it expects fiscal 2025 revenue to increase slightly by low-single digits compared to flat to increase slightly previously, while adjusted profits per share for this year are still expected to come in at $10.75 to $11.
It reaffirmed its full-year outlook for operating margins at 8.5 percent, down from 10 percent last year.
Its stock closed Wednesday down 0.92 percent at $81.73.

Sugar prices posted modest gains on Wednesday on positive carryover from Tuesday when Conab, Brazil's government crop forecasting agency, cut its Brazil 2025/26 production estimate by -3.1% to 44.5 MMT from a previous estimate of 45.9 MMT.
Sugar prices have been under pressure over the past two weeks, posting 2-week lows last Monday due to the outlook for lower sugar production in Brazil. Last Monday, Covrig Analytics reported that Brazil's sugar mills are prioritizing sugar production over ethanol, crushing more cane for sugar. This trend is expected to continue as harvesting peaks, driven by drier cane crops that prompt mills to produce more sugar.
Sugar prices have some support from signs of stronger global sugar demand. China's July sugar imports surged +76% to 740,000 MT, and Pakistan recently tendered for 200,000 MT of refined sugar.
On August 12, NY sugar rallied to a 2.5-month high on concerns over weaker cane yields in Brazil. On August 15, Unica reported that Brazil's Center-South sugar output in the second half of July fell by -0.8% y/y to 3,614 MT, and the 2025-26 Center-South sugar output through July fell -7.8% y/y to 19,268 MT. However, the percentage of sugarcane crushed for sugar by Brazil's sugar mills in the second half of July increased to 54.10% from 50.32% the same time last year. Also, Conab said last month that 2024/25 Brazil sugar production fell by -3.4% y/y to 44.118 MMT, citing lower sugarcane yields due to drought and excessive heat.
The outlook for higher sugar exports from India is negative for sugar prices after Bloomberg reported that India may permit local sugar mills to export sugar in the next season, which starts in October, as abundant monsoon rains may produce a bumper sugar crop. India's Meteorological Department reported last Friday that cumulative monsoon rain in India was 650.3 mm as of August 22, or 2% above normal. Also, the Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association recently said that it will seek permission to export 2 MMT of sugar in 2025/26.
The outlook for higher sugar production in India, the world's second-largest producer, is bearish for prices. On June 2, India's National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories projected that India's 2025/26 sugar production would climb +19% y/y to 35 MMT, citing larger planted cane acreage. That would follow a -17.5% y/y decline in India's sugar production in 2024/25 to a 5-year low of 26.2 MMT, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).
Sugar prices retreated through early July, with NY sugar falling to a 4.25-year low and London sugar sliding to a 4-year low, driven by expectations of a sugar surplus in the 2025/26 season. On June 30, commodities trader Czarnikow projected a 7.5 MMT global sugar surplus for the 2025/26 season, the largest surplus in 8 years. On May 22, the USDA, in its biannual report, projected that global 2025/26 sugar production would increase by +4.7% y/y to a record 189.318 MMT, with global sugar ending stocks at 41.188 MMT, up 7.5% y/y.
The outlook for higher sugar production in Thailand is bearish for sugar prices. On May 2, Thailand's Office of the Cane and Sugar Board reported that Thailand's 2024/25 sugar production rose +14% y/y to 10.00 MMT. Thailand is the world's third-largest sugar producer and the second-largest exporter of sugar.
The International Sugar Organization (ISO) raised its 2024/25 global sugar deficit forecast to a 9-year high of -5.47 MMT on May 15, up from a February forecast of -4.88 MMT. This indicates a tightening market following the 2023/24 global sugar surplus of 1.31 MMT. ISO also cut its 2024/25 global sugar production forecast to 174.8 MMT from a February forecast of 175.5 MMT.
The USDA, in its bi-annual report released May 22, projected that global 2025/26 sugar production would climb +4.7% y/y to a record 189.318 MMT and that global 2025/26 human sugar consumption would increase +1.4% y/y to a record 177.921 MMT. The USDA also forecasted that 2025/26 global sugar ending stocks would climb +7.5% y/y to 41.188 MMT. The USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) predicted that Brazil's 2025/26 sugar production would rise +2.3% y/y to a record 44.7 MMT FAS predicted that India's 2025/26 sugar production would rise +25% y/y to 35.3 MMT due to favorable monsoon rains and increased sugar acreage. FAS predicted that Thailand's 2025/26 sugar production will climb +2% y/y to 10.3 MMT.

By comparison, the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) rose 2.89% and the total crypto market cap gained just 1.6% during the same period.
Analysts said Solana’s strong performance reflects a combination of technical momentum and structural demand.
Scott Melker, a trader known as the “Wolf of All Streets,” argued that Solana is now at a critical level against bitcoin. He said a breakout here could make SOL the “darling” of the next altcoin cycle. His chart showed SOL pressing into resistance against BTC, a pairing that often signals whether a token can outperform the broader market.
Another analyst, Lark Davis, was more direct, calling Solana the “catch-up trade” for investors who missed ether’s (ETH) breakout from $1,400 during the last cycle.
Davis cited three drivers: the rise of SOL-based treasury companies modeled on bitcoin accumulation firms, the prospect of a spot SOL ETF getting approved in the near future by the U.S. SEC and growing institutional interest. These factors could push billions of dollars into SOL, he noted.
However, Altcoin Sherpa, another widely followed analyst on X, cautioned against chasing the rally. He described SOL's strength as unusual but advised traders to consider taking profits between $205 and $215 or waiting for more clarity before entering. His view reflects the risk that weekend or short-term rallies often retrace once liquidity normalizes.
Meanwhile, DeFi asset management firm Sentora added another perspective, noting that more than $820 million in SOL is already held in corporate treasuries. The number is worth noting as ETH treasury holdings stood at a similar level in April before expanding to nearly $20 billion. The firm said that the SOL corporate holding trajectory suggests the token could follow a similar path if adoption accelerates.
Adding to the positive sentiments of some analysts, Solana is also seeing institutional adoption grow. Earlier today, staking service provider Chorus One announced the launch of a new Solana validator in partnership with Delphi Consulting, part of Delphi Digital.
The firms said the move reflects a belief that institutions should contribute not just capital but also infrastructure to the networks they back. Chorus One described the validator as institutional-grade infrastructure, positioning it as part of Solana’s growing base of serious, long-term participants.
Technical Analysis Highlights
-
According to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model, between Aug. 26 at 15:00 UTC and Aug. 27 at 14:00 UTC, SOL rose from $191.67 to $204.62, a 7% gain, with a trading range of $190.11–$205.65.
-
Heavy volume at $193.92 during the early rebound (986,571 tokens traded) established this level as strong support.
-
Resistance formed near $205.65, with repeated rejections around that corridor. Sustained price action above $202.00 suggests institutional buying.

The department store chain’s shares surged on Wednesday as the company raised its full-year financial outlook and topped expectations despite a sales decline.
The company’s shares saw an uptick in mid-July as it caught the attention of the r/wallstreetbets Reddit thread, doubling the stock price and joining the meme stock rally that month. Following Wednesday’s earnings announcement, Kohl’s shares jumped by 27% in premarket trading and are up 17% at the time of publishing.
Kohl’s beat its quarterly earnings estimate, coming out at $0.56—in contrast to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.33. Additionally, the company saw a slight uptick in revenue, coming out at $3.35 billion, compared with the $3.32 billion estimate by London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) analysts.
Despite the favorable outlook, Kohl’s still saw a decrease in sales, with a 5.1% year-over-year decline.
“Our team remains focused on delivering progressive improvement throughout the remainder of the year against a challenging economic backdrop,” Kohl’s interim CEO Michael Bender said in the earnings report.
Getting back on their feet
The company’s solid quarter can be largely attributed to its turnaround efforts and major cost-cutting measures, including store closures and workforce reductions.
Earlier this year, the department store chain closed 27 stores across the country and saw a 10% reduction of its corporate workforce.
The company’s turnaround efforts include a reassessment of its assortment of products, as well as introducing more coupons for branded items.
“We were able to expand our gross margins, reduce our inventory, and lower our expenses, leading to solid second-quarter earnings,” Bender said.
Bender’s leadership followed the termination of former Kohl’s CEO Ashley Buchanan earlier this year. Buchanan, the company’s third CEO in three years, lasted four months on the job, stepping down due to involvement in an investigation surrounding vendor transactions with undisclosed conflicts of interest.
“Kohl’s second-quarter performance is a testament to the progress we are making against our 2025 initiatives,” Bender said. “This resulted in sales performance that came in ahead of our expectations.”

However, the special session got off to a rocky start: The state Senate met as scheduled at 9 a.m., but the state House failed to reach the two-thirds quorum required to conduct business, leaving the session in limbo as of late Friday afternoon.
Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers' jobs are at risk, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.
Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.
The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.
“This is a pretty major change,” said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts’ state fiscal policy team, noting “the challenge in enacting something that’s dramatically different for most drivers.”
Oregon's transportation woes
Oregon's transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.
Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.
Kotek's proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state's gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.
The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn't have to pay supplemental registration fees.
Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle's telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state's decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.",75184b221d4b1f6481fc5f5afb8bc041,trafilatura

The company, led by Georgetown Law Professor Chris Brummer, estimates that phony tokens are causing crypto users at least $1.6 billion in losses each year. The company’s solution aims to reduce that sum by linking issuers’ credentials to assets on-chain.
“The question of counterfeit tokens is more than just a retail investor issue, although it's an obvious one,” he said. “If you create a token, and someone’s creating a counterfeit version, it can be very hard to do your business because someone is undermining your brand.”
Bluprynt’s solution represents a crypto-native riff on KYB, or Know Your Business. The due diligence process is used to verify the legal status of a business, and its compliance with anti-money laundering rules, while establishing so-called verified identities.
Under Know Your Issuer, or KYI, verified identities are attached to the digital asset itself. Although the technology could be integrated into digital wallets and infrastructure as a way to help retail investors, the product is also aimed at institutions, Brummer said.
“Instead of using a TradFi accounting system, or some kind of Web2-based system, we’re able to create, in essence, a verifiable digital identity at the point of issuance,” he said.
The pilot’s completion comes as the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issues new guidance for banks on safeguarding digital assets. Signaling a broader regulatory shift, it reaffirmed national banks’ authority to manage and outsource crypto services in May.
“Bluprynt’s KYI framework is a breakthrough for digital asset integrity,” Christopher Giancarlo, a Paxos board member and former CFTC chair, said in a statement.
Institutions have compliance needs, but they can be in conflict with the permissionless ethos of decentralized finance, or DeFi, in some ways. Some crypto advocates feel that abiding by regulations inevitably requires some degree of centralization, in order to be effective.
“Institutional DeFi can seem like an oxymoron,” Brummer said. “But you’re going to need to figure out something that keeps the integrity of the DeFi system but doesn’t morph or change the market structure in such a way that lends towards or accelerates centralization.”

Here are its top 2 recommendations for avoiding the fallout.
-
GMO says investor excitement in AI has inflated stock valuations, making future returns unattractive.
-
The firm, which oversees $64 billion, says US stock valuations are in the 90th percentile compared to history.
-
GMO likes international and deep value stocks as alternatives to broad US indexes.
GMO's John Pease doesn't love what the massive rally in AI stocks has done to broader market conditions.
While he stops short of calling it a full-fledged bubble, he did tell Business Insider in a recent interview that excitement around the technology has bid up broad stock-market valuations to levels that make future returns unattractive.
In GMO's quarterly letter published last week, Pease and his colleague Ben Inker pointed out that US stock valuations are in the 90th percentile compared to history. Relative to risk-free Treasurys, they're even more expensive, the duo said.
Eventually, they see this reality weighing on forward returns.
""Valuations could become more stretched, of course, but it pays to remember that higher valuations always beggar future returns,"" the pair wrote in the letter.
They have a particular focus on the so-called ""Magnificent Six"" — the moniker that Pease and Inker use for the Magnificent Seven stocks, minus Tesla — which they say trade at an average of 30 times earnings. That implies very lofty future expectations. It also increases the risk that earnings will underperform forecasts, especially as these firms spend big on a pivot from software to AI infrastructure.
""They're shifting toward physical investment, which is very different, and they're making that shift in a remarkably quick way,"" Pease told Business Insider.
He continued: ""Maybe they'll continue to do something amazing, but historically, when we've looked at companies and we've looked at sectors that have invested a ton in physical capital expenditures over time, that's accrued to huge technological advances in society, to huge benefits to consumers, not huge benefits to shareholders.""
Where else to look
With ""disappointing"" returns likely ahead for the S&P 500, Pease highlighted a couple of investments he's bullish on at the moment.
One is international stocks broadly. While investors haven't been high on ex-US stocks due to low growth, that could be changing, Pease said.
""We are sanguine that, much like with Japan, international equities will return to a path of normal growth,"" he wrote in the letter.

On August 21, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring upgraded the stock from Equalweight to Overweight with a price target of $28.00 (from $22.00).
The firm’s rating affirmation reflects increased corporate spending on HPE’s artificial intelligence (AI) and other products.
The analysts noted that their “checks signaled healthy enterprise spending across the board in the quarter, led by anything AI compute or networking related, followed by client devices (strong PC refresh), and then servers/storage, with networking growth inflecting positively for the first time in several quarters.”
The firm looks forward to HPE’s Analyst Day on October 15, as the most important upcoming catalyst for the company.
“We are upgrading HPE to Overweight (from Equal-Weight) with a new $28 price target, or 11x our new FY26 EPS of $2.51. Our thesis is straight-forward – with the closure of JNPR, we see 18% upside to FY26 Consensus EPS, with EPS growing to $2.70-3.00 in FY27, and believe that as the market comes to better understand nearly half of HPE’s business is networking, inclusive of more AI exposure (JNPR in xAI cluster), HPE’s multiple will re-rate above the current 8x multiple. Our 11x target P/E multiple doesn’t even assume HPE garners a peer average multiple, and yet we still see 33% upside to shares from here. The biggest risks to our call are (1) execution — deals always look better on paper than in real-life and the risk here is that this deal is no different / the synergies mgmt outlined don’t materialize as expected, (2) JNPR/Aruba underperforms outside of the xAI exposure as competition is intense in networking and campus upgrade exposure is relatively limited (with risk of JNPR CEO leaving eventually), and (3) FCF and/or capital returns continue to disappoint vs. expectations.”
Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE), an American multinational technology company, provides high-performance computing systems, AI software, and data storage solutions for running complex AI workloads.

On August 25, Bernstein SocGen Group analyst Stacy Rasgon reiterated a Market Perform rating on the stock with a $21.00 price target.
The rating follows the US government and Intel’s joint announcement that U.S. government will purchase $8.9 billion in Intel’s common stock under an agreement with the Trump Administration.
Stacy Rasgon recommends an “avoidance of Intel’s shares.”
The company is issuing ~520M new shares—including 433M to the U.S. government at $20.47 each and 87M to SoftBank at $23. This will dilute existing shareholders by ~11%, with the U.S. becoming Intel’s largest shareholder.

Rasgon believed that the news may limit short-term downside. However, structural issues remain that will keep Intel unattractive over the long-term.
“At this point we continue to recommend avoidance of Intel’s shares. They feel like a tough short given this kind of newsflow in the short term, but the structural issues still feel massive keeping us away from the long side. We make no changes to our model at this time. We rate Intel’s stock Market-Perform, $21 PT.”

City National, which is based in Los Angeles, reported net income of $114 million between May and July — its best bottom-line result in more than three years — as its credit outlook improved.
""City National is now on its front foot and recruiting commercial bankers, recruiting private bankers, adding clients,"" RBC CEO Dave McKay told analysts Wednesday. ""So we feel very, very good about some of the potential to build the pipelines there and to see good overall loan growth and deposit growth in the franchise.""
And there's another reason that RBC executives are expressing optimism about City National's outlook: After the bank invested significant financial resources into what executives describe as ""remediation"" at City National, they say those costs have started to fall.
""And we're expecting to see that continue as we progress into 2026,"" Chief Financial Officer Katherine Gibson told analysts.
City National, which reported $94 billion of assets at the end of June, was among the banks that took a major hit from rising interest rates in 2023. Its deposit costs rose, and it recorded large unrealized losses on underwater securities.
The Los Angeles-based bank was also hit by a pair of regulatory problems in January 2023 and February 2024. In the latter case, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency imposed a $65 million fine in connection with what it characterized as systemic deficiencies in the bank's risk management practices.
The Canadian parent company has also been looking for ways to cut costs at City National, and to achieve greater integration between the U.S. banking unit, which RBC acquired in 2015, and the rest of the company.

During the quarter that ended on July 31, RBC recorded an 81.5% efficiency ratio in its U.S. operations — which is still relatively high, but was 6.6 percentage points lower than the company reported during the same period last year. Banks strive for lower efficiency ratios, which measure noninterest expenses as a percentage of revenue.
""While there's still work to be done, we are seeing early signs of success as we continue to build a more cohesive U.S. operating model,"" McKay said Wednesday during the company's earnings call.
Following a leadership shake-up at City National that started in 2023, the U.S. banking unit is being led by former executives at Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bancorp. Their current focus is not just on cost cutting. The bank is also growing its business organically in the Southeast U.S. That's the result of client demand, particularly in the commercial banking sector, a company spokesperson said Wednesday.",64094bf0aeff058a0b15b0779f179bd2,trafilatura

The New York Times,2025-08-29 06:00:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"The media sector offers some distinctly different investment options. Newsmax(NYSE: NMAX) entered the stock market as recently as March 2025, and the largely digital provider of conservative news coverage has only one quarterly earnings report under its belt. By contrast, The New York Times Company(NYSE: NYT) was founded in 1851 and entered the public stock market 56 years ago.
You can look at this matchup as a political struggle, but I'm more interested in their business models. Which media stock operates from the stronger financial foundation, setting shareholders up for better long-term returns?
Newsmax and The New York Times, by the numbers
Both companies recently published their results for the period ending on June 30, 2025. Let's see how they stack up.
Newsmax posted strong top-line growth. Its second-quarter sales rose 18.4% year over year, landing at $46.4 million. The company reached 26 million cable news viewers in this quarter.
With $198 million of cash equivalents and no long-term debt to speak of, Newsmax's balance sheet looks robust at first glance. However, its bottom-line profits are consistently negative, and the cash balance was built on $426.6 million of additional paid-in capital -- financial backing provided by founder Christopher Ruddy and the stock offering in March.
Investors should watch how this shareholder-backed company manages its return on equity in the long run. It's a negative number for now, even if you back out a $68.4 million legal expense from Newsmax's expenses.
New York Times saw a slower 9.7% revenue increase in the same reporting period, as expected from a more mature company. Revenue landed at $685.9 million, with 51% coming from digital-only subscription sales. Net income rose 26.6% to $82.9 million, while free cash flow fell 30% year over year to $72.6 million.
New York Times' cash balance stood at $951.5 million by the end of June. Like Newsmax, this company doesn't carry any long-term debt. Once again, return on equity is an important financial metric to watch, with the current value perched at 17.1%.
Long story short, The New York Times is an older and larger business with slower growth but robust profits. The return-on-equity figures weigh heavily in the larger company's favor at this point, due to Newsmax's unprofitable operations.
The stock performance scorecard
That brings me over from financial statements to the stocks themselves.
Newsmax shares are trading 94% below their all-time high, which was set amid the frenzied market action on the IPO date. Skipping ahead to calmer times, the three-month return as of August 26 is a negative 29.7%.
Profit-based valuation metrics don't make sense for this stock yet, and Newsmax hasn't reported a full year of revenue figures, so it's hard to pin a reasonable market value on the stock. For what it's worth, Newsmax trades at 18.5x the company's book value and 10x its net cash balance.
New York Times investors pocketed a 7.8% total return in the last three months and a market-beating 92.5% in three years. Neither a market darling nor a bargain, the stock trades at a modest 30.7x trailing earnings and 21.3x free cash flow.
It's a mixed bag if you compare the two stocks on the metrics that actually apply to Newsmax. The New York Times stock trades at 5x book value and 18x its cash reserves.
Boring beats volatile in this media matchup
Newsmax is still finding its bearings on the public market. The stock has been volatile in the first few months, and the company's main revenue source is the unpredictable flow of advertising sales.
The New York Times has been around forever and runs a more robust business model with more subscription revenue than ad sales. The stock isn't exactly cheap, but its valuation isn't terribly lofty, either.
For better or worse, many people might pick either one of these stocks to match their political leanings. That's fine, as long as you keep the investment on the small side.
Emotional investing is rarely a recipe for strong returns. If you turn down the adrenaline spigot, The New York Times looks like a modestly priced value stock, while Newsmax seems too hot to handle in 2025.

Weekly expansions in stablecoin market capitalization have dropped to around $1.1 billion. This is in stark contrast to the $4–8 billion weekly inflows observed in late 2024, which were instrumental in supporting Bitcoin’s sharp upward momentum.
Tether’s USDT, the dominant stablecoin, has also seen its 60-day growth moderate, holding at roughly $10 billion compared with peaks above $21 billion earlier in the cycle. While the figures remain in positive territory, they indicate a cooling trend in capital inflows.
Signs of Liquidity Moderation
The data suggests a broader moderation in crypto liquidity. Both aggregate stablecoin market cap growth and USDT issuance are slipping slightly below their moving-average trends, showing that new inflows of capital into the digital asset space are slowing.
This slowdown does not necessarily point to outflows or contraction, but it does show that the rapid pace of new issuance seen earlier in the year has subsided.
For traders and investors, this shift suggests that while liquidity conditions remain supportive, the market may not enjoy the same acceleration that drove previous bullish phases.
Exchange Reserves Reach Record High
Despite the moderation in issuance, exchange reserves tell a different story. The total value of stablecoin holdings on exchanges reached a new all-time high of $68 billion on August 22, surpassing the previous record set in February 2022, reports CryptoQuant.
This shows the substantial dry powder available for market activity. Tether’s USDT dominates exchange balances, accounting for $53 billion, while USD Coin (USDC) follows with $13 billion.
The elevated reserve levels suggest that traders and institutions continue to keep liquidity on hand, potentially positioning themselves for opportunistic market moves, reports CryptoQuant.
Binance Leads in Altcoin and Stablecoin Deposits
Binance continues to assert itself as the top exchange for altcoin trading, leading the market in altcoin deposit activity.
At the peak of last year’s November–December altcoin rally, Binance handled as many as 59,000 deposits in a single day—more than double Coinbase’s roughly 26,000 and far above the 24,000 total going to all other exchanges combined.
Even in calmer market conditions, Binance maintains its lead, averaging about 13,000 altcoin inflow transactions per day. In contrast, Coinbase averages 6,000, and other platforms average about 10,000.",074f4502be94fcde3adaafed2d18a16a,trafilatura

Sep nat-gas prices on Wednesday rallied sharply to a 1-week high on anticipation that Thursday's weekly storage report will show a lower-than-normal build in nat-gas inventories. The consensus is that EIA nat-gas inventories rose +27 bcf for the week ended August 22, below the five-year average for this time of year of +38 bcf. Thin trading conditions exacerbated gains in nat-gas prices as Wednesday was the last trading day for the September nat-gas futures contract.
More News from Barchart
Natural gas prices have been under pressure over the past 2.5 months, dropping to a 9.5-month low in nearest-futures prices on Monday, as forecasts for cooler late-summer weather emerged. Forecaster Vaisala said it expects lower-than-normal temperatures to blanket the US from North Carolina to Northern California from September 4-8, which will reduce demand for natural gas to run air conditioning.
Ramped-up US nat-gas production is another bearish factor for prices. On August 12, the EIA raised its forecast for 2025 US nat-gas production by +0.5% to 106.44 bcf/day from July's estimate of 105.9 bcf/day. The EIA raised its forecast for 2026 US nat-gas production by +0.7% to 106.09 from July's 105.4 bcf/day forecast. US nat-gas production is currently near a record high, with active US nat-gas rigs recently posting a 2-year high.
US (lower-48) dry gas production on Wednesday was 107.7 bcf/day (+4.5% y/y), according to BNEF. Lower-48 state gas demand on Wednesday was 72.4 bcf/day (-15.2% y/y), according to BNEF. Estimated LNG net flows to US LNG export terminals on Wednesday were 15.5 bcf/day (+11.7% w/w), according to BNEF.
As a supportive factor for gas prices, the Edison Electric Institute reported Wednesday that US (lower-48) electricity output in the week ended August 23 rose +7.7% y/y to 95,130 GWh (gigawatt hours), and US electricity output in the 52-week period ending August 23 rose +3.1% y/y to 4,270,960 GWh.
Last Thursday's weekly EIA report was bullish for nat-gas prices since nat-gas inventories for the week ended August 15 rose +13 bcf, below the consensus of +18 bcf and well below the 5-year weekly average of +35 bcf. As of August 15, nat-gas inventories were down -3.0% y/y, but were +5.8% above their 5-year seasonal average, signaling adequate nat-gas supplies. As of August 24, gas storage in Europe was 76% full, compared to the 5-year seasonal average of 84% full for this time of year.",71875768b1163351add7cf643fcadef8,trafilatura

A financial advisor discussing the latest trends in IT consulting with a client.
“while a successful Samsung qualification will likely impact Micron’s market share position, we continue to believe that Samsung’s gains will largely come at the expense of Hynix. With regards to tailwinds, we see large hurdles in Samsung’s ability to overcome technological challenges including acceptable and thermal/power issues as well as poor yields derived from issues with dicing, sawing and laser ablation as well as delamination and cracking. Additionally, the HBM roadmap will only get more difficult as stacks get higher and customized logic base dies come into play in the HBM4E timeframe.

On August 25, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee upgraded the stock from Neutral to Overweight with a price target of $345.00 (from $318.00).
The firm has upgraded the stock citing robust “longer-term drivers for optical companies with leverage to multi-faceted investment.” Analysts are also optimistic that the recent shares pull-back offers a lucrative opportunity for investors to “participate in the upside.”
The stock experienced a pull-back because of investors hoping for faster growth with customers, but short term supply shortages slowed things down. However, the firm highlighted several catalysts that are working in favor of the stock, such as program ramps with customers such as Nvidia’s 1.6T opportunity, Ciena’s modem opportunity, and Amazon’s HPC opportunity.
“Following the recent pull-back, Fabrinet shares are now trading closer to ~24x NTM consensus earnings, which is significantly lower than the nearly 30x it was trading at prior to the latest earnings report, and the market is now underappreciating the proximity of large concurrent program ramps with prominent customers, including: 1) Nvidia: The 1.6T opportunity is forecasted to represent a $1.5 bn market opportunity in CY26 and could double thereafter; 2) Ciena: The modem opportunity is expected to start generating material revenue in CY26 and we estimate should exceed the historical revenue of Infinera at full run- rate, given its at least 2x greater scale (Infinera revenue recently reached ~$330 mn in FY23);""",25d2041ef3b79d3453019f99f10662c2,trafilatura

On August 25, KeyBanc analyst John Vinh reiterated a Sector Weight rating on the stock citing positive implications from the US and Softbank Equity Stake in Intel.
Intel is issuing 433M new shares of common stock to the US government for 10% equity stake. The firm discussed the funding breakdown, past support, and the “passive” role of the US government in Intel.
“On August 22, 2025, Intel announced that it will issue 433M new shares of common stock to the U.S. government, giving Washington a 10% equity stake in the Company. The $8.9B investment will be funded by $5.7B of CHIPS Act grants previously awarded but not yet disbursed and $3.2B from the Secure Enclave program, with Intel continuing to meet its defense-related obligations. Including the $2.2B in grants already received, the total government support rises to $11.1B. Additionally, the government’s investment in INTC will be a passive ownership, with no Board representation or other governance or information rights. The government also agrees to vote with the Company’s Board of Directors on matters requiring shareholder approval, with limited exceptions. ""

""Finally, the existing claw-back and profit-sharing provisions associated with the government’s previously dispersed $2.2 billion grant to Intel under the CHIPS Act will be eliminated to create permanency of capital as the Company advances its U.S. investment plans. We see positive implications associated with this transaction as we were previously concerned that the U.S. government’s equity stake would likely have other INTC obligations with a potentially activist ownership role. Additionally, with the removal of the clawback on the previous CHIPS Act grant and announced equity transaction, uncertainty associated with whether INTC’s Chips Act funding would be reneged is off the table.”
KeyBanc also highlighted Intel’s investment from SoftBank, stating that the combined transactions of US government and SoftBank will have a modest dilutive impact of $0.07 on their FY26 EPS estimate of $0.67. Despite the positive developments, the firm maintains a Sector Weight rating on the stock.

On Wednesday, the Canton, Mass.-based men’s big and tall retailer slipped into the red in the second quarter and its game plan is to de-emphasize national brands in favor of its lower-priced private label to turn the tide.

Furniture Stocks Likely to Extend Losses After Trump Threatens New Tariff Rate on Sector
In the period, Destination XL Group posted a net loss of $265,000 compared to net income of $2.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Total sales were also down, falling 7.5 percent to $115.5 million from $124.8 million the prior year. Comparable-store sales were down 9.2 percent overall — 7.1 percent in stores and 14.4 percent in the company’s direct-to-consumer business.
By month, comps fell 10.4 percent in May, 9.6 percent in June and 7 percent in July and the company said store traffic is “showing modest improvement” in August, with comps trending “slightly better” than in July.
Harvey Kanter, president and chief executive officer, said the results reflected continued softness in the big and tall sector, exacerbated by “the macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical environment affecting consumer discretionary spending. Over the past year, our customer has been gravitating more toward lower-priced goods and select promotions, signaling a consumer who is carefully choosing where and how he spends his money.”
In response, Kanter said, DXL will put more focus on its private brands with their lower price points. “We are extending our core assortment to provide breadth and depth to our private brand mix,” he detailed. “We own our private brands; we own the product, we own the design, and we own the supply chain execution, which enables us to better control the margins than with our national designer brands.”
Among its largest private brands are Harbor Bay, Oak Hill and True Nation.
The company said over the next two years, DXL will reduce the number of underperforming national brands and grow its private label penetration from 56.5 percent today to 60 percent by 2026 and more than 65 percent by 2027. Margins on national brands average in the low 50s but on private labels are in the upper 60s to mid 70s.
“We are confident that with the strength of our assortment, enhanced storytelling and strategic marketing efforts, we can drive greater customer loyalty and position our private brands as a primary reason customers choose DXL,” Kanter said during a morning conference call. “To support this initiative, we are reducing the space and investment allocated to national brands that have experienced declining customer demand and underwhelming sales performance. We will continue to rigorously evaluate our national brand portfolio, eliminating those that no longer resonate with our customer.”
He stressed that national brands “will remain a key lever for customer acquisition, but we are strategically evaluating their performance to determine future eliminations.”
He pointed to the recent addition of TravisMathew as a win for the company and said the company will “continue to add national brands on a selective basis when they address a gap in the assortment. But we’re going to see more leverage on the private brand side as we review opportunities that create the same draw and loyalty once delivered by national designer brands. One example here is athleisure, where we believe there are opportunities to bolster our assortment with new product lines by intentionally shifting toward private brands.”
He added that the big and tall space is becoming more competitive as other men’s retailers expand their assortment to attract this customer.
“As the macro environment is also difficult for apparel retailers who trade in traditional sizing, more competitors are dipping their toe into the big and tall space,” he said. “Expanding into extended sizes is an easy modification for traditional size retailers, with customers having more choices across different price points and different styles. We are seeing increased competition from mass and general retailers competing on price while direct-to-consumer brands attract customers with fresh marketing and storytelling. Off-price and warehouse [stores] are also in the mix competing on convenience and value. The increase in competition is further fragmenting customer loyalty and possibly contributing to some of the decline we are seeing in our business.”
To fight back, Kanter said the company is leaning into its Fitmap, a digital sizing technology it can offer exclusively for the big and tall market until 2030. To date, it has scanned more than 23,000 people in 62 stores and DXL will roll out the program to 86 units by the holiday season.
In addition, the company will revamp its promotional strategy, Kanter said, to “prioritize relevance, competitiveness, and a stronger perception of value. Programs such as our newly launched Fit Exchange program, Heroes Discount for first responders and teachers, and enhanced loyalty are all examples contributing to this effort.”
Looking ahead, Kanter said there remains a “significant amount of volatility in the market,” particularly around tariffs and their expected impact on “an already concerned consumer.” The company is working with its vendors and suppliers to mitigate the impact; however, there is expected to be “further uncertainty ahead.”
He said if the current tariff situation remains the same, it will cost the company just under $4 million for this fiscal year, resulting in price increases to consumers for the remainder of 2025 and into 2026.
Destination XL operates a total of 294 full-price and outlet stores under the DXL and Casual Male nameplates. The company expects to open two additional DXL stores this fiscal year. However, Kanter said the new stores — by the end of this year, the company will have opened 18 units in 24 months — are performing below plan due to weak demand for apparel and the macroeconomy. As a result, future store openings are on hold until conditions improve.
The company did not provide guidance for the remainder of the year but on the conference call, Kanter presented a positive spin: “Despite the difficult sales environment we posted in the second quarter, I must say we remain optimistic for our business with a strong conviction for upside when the current down cycle begins to turn.”

(NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the AI Stocks Analysts Say You Shouldn’t Ignore. On August 25, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri raised the price target on the stock to $345.00 (from $290.00) while maintaining a Buy rating. The rating affirmation reflects the firm’s optimism regarding Broadcom’s artificial intelligence momentum as it heads into fiscal third-quarter earnings.
Set to report on September 4th, Wall Street analysts anticipate the semiconductor and software giant to report earnings of $1.66 in Q3, compared to $1.24 in the same quarter last year. Its revenue for Q3 is also expected to rise 21% year-over-year to $15.82 billion.
Arcuri has particularly noted in-line results for AVGO but expects the company to raise guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. Google’s newest AI chip, the TPUv6p, which rely on Broadcom’s custom silicon, are ramping up and notably the cause for the expected raised guidance.
It is also anticipated that TPUv6p will witness a sharp acceleration in the second half of 2025, extending into 2026. Wafer requirements for these chips are also likely to increase by 51% year-over-year, with overall momentum translating to a 60% year-over-year increase in the company’s AI revenue for 2025.
Meanwhile, AI-related networking will potentially ramp-up in fiscal 2026 as Ethernet architecture deployment increases. Arcuri also believes that Broadcom will reaffirm a $60 to $90 billion serviceable addressable market for custom chips.
Broadcom is a technology company uniquely positioned in the AI revolution owing to its custom chip offerings and networking assets.

Tens of thousands of properties were coated in jet fuel when a Delta flight bound for Shanghai dumped about 15,000 pounds of fuel at low altitude shortly after losing engine thrust on takeoff from LAX. More than 50 people, including schoolchildren, were treated for minor skin and breathing irritation.
Residents argued the crew could have released the fuel over the Pacific or at higher altitude, where it would have dissipated, per court filings . Delta denied wrongdoing, saying its pilots ""did exactly what federal regulations and their FAA-approved training required them to do to respond to that in-flight emergency and ensure the safety of the passengers, crew, and people on the ground.""
The airline also said a Federal Aviation Administration investigation later cleared the pilots of wrongdoing.
The agreement, filed this week in federal court and awaiting a judge’s approval, sets aside about a third for attorneys’ fees and costs, with the remainder to be distributed among roughly 38,000 property owners and residents. If everyone files a claim, payouts would average $889 per household and $104 per resident.
Part of the case centered on whether the fuel left lasting damage. A lab study found no petroleum hydrocarbons in soil after a week, undermining contamination claims. Delta also pointed to home sales data showing no fall in property values. Lawyers for residents nonetheless argued families deserved compensation for the disruption, calling the settlement a “fair and reasonable” outcome.
The deal caps more than five years of litigation and consolidates multiple lawsuits, including claims from local teachers. For affected communities in southeast LA, attorneys said, it marked the first meaningful recovery since the day jet fuel unexpectedly rained from the sky.
In a written statement, plaintiffs’ attorney Filippo Marchino of the X-Law Group said: “We are especially pleased to obtain this result for residents of the southeast LA communities, comprised of hard-working families who asked only for respect and just treatment and rightly deserve this result.”
Delta declined to comment but directed Quartz to its position in the settlement document in which it denied wrongdoing.
The statement said the company had decided to settle ""without any admission of liability to resolve the uncertainty involved in the litigation"".
It said this would also ""avoid the significant legal expenses that it would incur by litigating the case through trial and any subsequent appeal, and eliminate the distraction and other burdens this litigation has caused to Delta’s business.""",888bef2238878bf1955c08562c8383ad,trafilatura

Most crypto experts believe that the cryptocurrency is yet to achieve its full potential and have offered extremely bullish price predictions so far.
Whether it's the crypto index fund manager Bitwise’s CIO Matt Hougan or the Bitcoin mining firm Bitdeer's (Nasdaq: BTDR) Head of Capital Markets and Strategic Initiatives Jeff LaBerge, each expert thinks Bitcoin will hit $200,000 in 2025. It doesn't seem like a herculean task for BTC, given the fact that it has surged 80% within a year.
However, not everyone seems to be in agreement.
$200K target 'extremely difficult'
It will be ""extremely difficult"" for Bitcoin to reach anything close to $200,000 this year, the analysts at 10x Research wrote in a report on Aug. 26.

The analysts said the gap between expectations and insights from data is widening, and the following factors are in play:
-
Fund inflows are declining.
-
Bitcoin miners are under pressure.
-
Seasonal patterns are resurfacing just as traders turn complacent.
54% chance of Bitcoin hitting $140K
It is obvious that 10x Research analysts are not as bullish as other prominent analysts on Bitcoin. However, they estimated that Bitcoin hitting $140,000 by the end of the year also carries only a 54% probability.
Though the above target is only 12% lower than the king coin's record high and 25% lower than its current price, the analysts at 10x Research aren't bullish.
""Although we briefly engaged with the breakout attempt in mid-August, our Bitcoin trend model has since turned bearish.""
Launched in 2009, Bitcoin is the world's largest cryptocurrency, which has a market cap of $2.23 trillion, even surpassing that of the tech giant Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META).

Claire's Holdings LLC, which announced on Aug. 20 it had sold its North American business to private equity firm Ames Watson for $104 million, listed more than 290 stores it planned to close in a court filing on Monday, Aug. 25.
Stores to be closed include 235 Claire's locations in the U.S. and 56 Icing stores. The filing also listed 830 stores – 785 Claire's locations and 45 Icing locations – not expected to close immediately.
The move comes after the company, which filed for bankruptcy earlier this month, noted in a subsequent court filing days later it would likely need to close more than 1,100 stores if it didn't find a buyer.

Store closing sales could continue at the locations set to close, while closing sales at some other locations were discontinued, according to the filing. Dates of expected store closings were not disclosed, but they are expected to happen on a rolling basis, the company confirmed to USA TODAY.
At the time of the sale, Ames Watson, which has offices in New York City and Columbia, Maryland, said it planned to preserve the retail chain in a downsized form.

Medicare Advantage is the private health-insurance version of traditional Medicare, which is run by the federal government.

The CMS rule, which was issued in April 2024 but never implemented, had sought to classify administrative payments to agents and brokers as compensation and cap them at a fixed fee of $100, rather than allowing them to be paid at fair market value.
Two industry trade groups — Americans for Beneficiary Choice and the Council for Medicare Choice — filed lawsuits against the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS challenging the new rules.
O’Connor ruled that the CMS rules were an overreach of the agency’s authority under the Administrative Procedure Act.
“CMS may only regulate how compensation is used, not engage in ratemaking,” the judge wrote in his ruling.
The price cap paid to agents and brokers for new Medicare Advantage enrollees was $611 in 2024. Medicare Advantage companies can also reimburse third-party firms for administrative services — which is what CMS was trying to cap.
“The amount that plans are willing to pay brokers is an indicator of the major role brokers play,” said Matthew Fiedler, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Center on Health Policy at the Brookings Institution. “Rolling it back could have mattered quite a bit. We would see a pretty big change in the market. We’d see fewer commercials. If plans aren’t spending money on broker fees, they could be spending that money on healthcare services.”
In 2024, 32.8 million people were enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan, accounting for 54% of the eligible Medicare population, according to KFF. Medicare Advantage has been generally lucrative for the companies that provide it, but it costs the government more than traditional Medicare. Medicare Advantage costs the government and taxpayers an extra 22% per enrollee, or approximately an additional $83 billion a year, according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission.",13856b9e0e68a892b6fcf5d878090146,trafilatura

The company now expects earnings after interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to be between 900 million and 940 million euros ($1.10 billion) from its previous forecast of between 975 million and 1,025 million, while lowering its free cash flow forecast by about 40% to more than 120 million euros.
GMV, a common metric for delivery firms measuring the total value of all goods sold, is expected to grow at the upper end of the range of 8% to 10% for the year, the company said.
The company in April confirmed its 2025 outlook, but a slip in growth in its crucial Asian market led investors and analysts to question the upbeat narrative for the region.
In the core Asian market, the company's GMV fell to 5.4 billion euros in the first quarter from 6.1 billion euros a year earlier and slightly missed consensus expectations.
Delivery Hero is present in more than 70 countries worldwide, including 16 in Europe.

On August 26, researchers at Stanford University published what they’re calling the “largest scale, most real-time effort” to calculate that impact—and it includes some bad news for Gen Zers.
The study was conducted by Erik Brynjolfsson, Bharat Chandar, and Ruyu Chen, all researchers at Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered AI. They used an administrative dataset from ADP, the largest payroll software provider in the U.S., to track monthly payroll records across tens of thousands of firms from late 2022 to July 2025.
That data was supplemented by a calculation of “occupational AI exposure” in a diverse array of fields—essentially using data from prior studies (see here and here) to categorize how much various professions are being impacted by AI technology.
Based on this analysis, the researchers reached six key conclusions on how AI is changing the workforce. Here are the most important findings for employees to understand.
Bad news for Gen Zers in AI-exposed fields
The study shows that, for some early career professionals, AI may indeed be making it harder to find a job—despite the fact that, overall, employment “continues to grow robustly.”
Among workers ages 22 to 25, the researchers uncovered a 13% decline in employment in occupations most exposed to AI, like software developers and customer service representatives, even after controlling for firm-level impacts. For example, by July 2025, employment for software developers ages 22 to 25 had declined by nearly 20% compared with its peak in late 2022.
In an interview with Fast Company, Brynjolfsson clarified that his team can’t necessarily draw a hard causal line between companies’ AI exposure and this decline in employment. However, he says, the pattern did remain consistent even when testing against a range of variables, which suggests a likely connection.
“We didn’t do an experiment where we gave some companies LLMs and not other companies, so we’re just observing what happened,” Brynjolfsson says. “But we could rule out some of the main alternative hypotheses. Even if you take out the entire tech industry, for instance, you still see this phenomenon. It’s something going on beyond just tech. Or if you take away all remote work and just look at jobs that are not remote, you see the same thing.”",12942bd512cbcf2be31240af0700c21b,trafilatura

According to data shared by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, investment advisor firms control $1.35 billion in Ethereum ETF exposure, representing 539,757 ETH and capturing 219,668 ETH in net additions during the past quarter.
Invest in Gold
Investment advisors dwarf other institutional segments, with hedge fund managers ranking second at $687 million in exposure. Their holdings are equivalent to 274,757 ETH, representing a 104% increase from the first quarter.
Growing institutional adoption
Goldman Sachs leads individual institutional holders with $721.8 million in Ethereum ETF positions, equivalent to 288,294 ETH exposure.
Jane Street Group follows at $190.4 million, while Millennium Management commands $186.9 million in ETF shares.
The concentration among top-tier Wall Street firms demonstrates institutional acceptance of Ethereum as a legitimate asset class within traditional portfolios.
Brokerage firms generated the third-largest exposure category at $253 million, adding 13,525 ETH (15.4%) positions during the quarter.
Private equity and holding companies contributed $62.2 million and $60.6 million, respectively, while pension funds and banks reduced their hands on Ethereum exposure.
Total institutional exposure across all categories tracked by Bloomberg Intelligence reached $2.44 billion by the end of the second quarter, representing 975,650 ETH in combined holdings.
The third quarter could also potentially show substantial increases in institutional participation based on the numbers so far.
Data from Farside Investors shows Ethereum ETF inflows surged from $4.2 billion on June 30 to $13.3 billion by Aug. 26, marking an over threefold increase and a new all-time high in cumulative inflows. August alone generated approximately $3.7 billion in additional flows.
The acceleration follows the continued adoption of Ethereum as a corporate treasury asset. Data compiled by the Strategic ETH Reserve shows that 17 publicly listed companies hold 3.4 million ETH, worth nearly $15.7 billion.
SharpLink registered the latest acquisition on Aug. 26, adding 56,533 ETH to its treasury, bringing its total to 797,704 ETH. However, it remains significantly lower than BitMine’s 1,713,899 ETH hoard, worth nearly $8 billion.

Bitcoin and Ethereum, the leading crypto assets by market capitalization, have experienced marginal gains of roughly 2% each, helping to boost the overall market above $3.9 trillion once again. But Solana is leading the charge among crypto majors, up a sizable 8% in the last 24 hours, currently trading above $209. Can SOL sustain this momentum?
The crypto market bounce comes as traditional markets find their footing, with the S&P 500 climbing 0.69% to 6,481 points and the tech-heavy Nasdaq advancing 0.4% to 21,544. Risk appetite among investors is increasing in almost every direction, with Brent crude oil edging up 0.94% to $67.85 per barrel while gold (usually considered a hedge against risk) slightly retreats, down 0.18%, to $3,383 per ounce.
This broad-based market bounce could suggest renewed investor confidence following a period of consolidation, though the varying strength across different assets hints at a potential rotation into select altcoins. It’s possible, then, that Solana is the next trade that traders are eyeing.
Do market indicators support the view? Let’s dive into the numbers.
Solana (SOL) price: Slowly but surely
Solana's rally from an opening price of $195 to a high of $209.33 could be viewed as just another day in the volatile crypto market among experienced traders. The coin has been slowly trending up since April, and it’s now testing a strong resistance level at today’s highs.
But even with a challenging goal ahead, the technical picture still shows some strength.
The Average Directional Index, or ADX, is currently at 28 for Solana. This reading confirms what traders are seeing on their screens—a strong, but slow trending environment. The ADX measures trend strength on a scale from 0 to 100, where readings above 25 indicate an established trend. At 28, Solana's ADX suggests this isn't just noise but genuine directional movement that trend-following traders typically seek.
The Relative Strength Index, or RSI, is at 60, which sits in what traders would consider a bullish zone without reaching “overhyped” territory. RSI measures momentum between 0 and 100, with readings above 70 typically signalling overbought market conditions and triggering profit-taking. At 60, SOL has room to run before algorithmic selling kicks in, suggesting another 10-15% upside is possible before hitting resistance. This is crucial for momentum traders who rely on these levels to time entries and exits.
The Squeeze Momentum Indicator shows that traders are struggling to push prices beyond the resistance, and there may be some price compression ahead. If the bullish indicators remain valid, then the market could be poised to break out of its consolidation phase, often leading to multi-day or multi-week moves.
Traders use exponential moving averages to gauge price supports and resistances, with EMAs taking the average price of a given asset over a set period of time. Solana’s 50-day exponential moving average, the average price of the last 50 days, provides support below current prices. The 200-day EMA is even lower, providing further support, and pointing at another bullish scenario for traders. In other words, the current price of SOL is higher right now than its average price in the short-term and in the longer term, and that’s a good thing if you’re a Solana bull.
The small gap between these EMAs is a sign that the price of SOL, though going up, is moving up very slowly, which is not the case for other coins that are simply cooling down. This configuration typically occurs in strong uptrends and gives buyers multiple opportunities to enter on dips, which is why many traders view it as a sign of underlying strength.
It’s no wonder, then, why traders on prediction markets are beginning to swing bullish on Solana. On Myriad, a prediction market developed by Decrypt’s parent company Dastan, the odds of Solana hitting a new all-time high price over $294 are beginning to tick up today. Just two days ago, bears were in control, placing odds of a new SOL all-time high this year at just 34%. Today, those odds have skyrocketed to just above 50%.
Myriad traders are currently calling it a coin flip, but the trend—over the last two days, at least—is clear.
A separate market asks Myriad users to predict which comes first: Solana pumping to $250, or dumping to $130? On this market, the bulls are leading the way by a wide margin. Traders currently place the odds of SOL hitting $250 before dropping to $130 at 71%.
Key Levels:
Immediate support: $200 (psychological level and breakout point)
Strong support: $180 (50-day EMA zone)
Immediate resistance: $210 (today's high)
Strong resistance: $220-240 (technical target from measured move)
Bitcoin (BTC) price: A green candle in scary territory
When weighing the potential trajectory of an altcoin, it’s helpful to measure it against the market leader in Bitcoin.
Bitcoin's journey today from an opening of $111,789, then rising to $112,646 before settling at $112,173—a modest 0.34% gain—tells a story of consolidation rather than conviction. Today's candlestick formation looks poised to post a gain and erase yesterday’s losses, but the technical indicators suggest the king of crypto is still catching its breath.
The way the Bitcoin market is currently behaving has been enough to flip the odds on one of Myriad’s most active prediction markets. Two weeks ago, Myriad’s “Bitcoin’s next hit” market, which asks traders to predict if BTC moons to $125K or dips to $105K, placed odds on the moon scenario at above 90%. Now, those odds have been turned upside down, with 60% favoring the dip scenario that sends BTC down to $105K.
In other words, Bitcoin bulls have been increasingly losing confidence over the last two weeks. Again, looking at the charts, it’s not hard to see why.
Bitcoin’s ADX at 17 shows a market without clear direction. This indicator, which measures trend strength regardless of direction, suggests readings below 20 indicate no trend and choppy, directionless trading. At 17, Bitcoin's ADX is telling traders we're in no man's land—the hype is fading and neither bulls nor bears have control. This typically means range-bound trading where buying support and selling resistance creates a sideways grind that frustrates trend followers but rewards patient range traders.
The RSI at 43 paints a slightly bearish but not dire picture. Think of RSI as a speedometer for price momentum. Readings below 50 indicate selling pressure outweighs buying. At 43, Bitcoin is like a car running on low fuel but not quite empty. Contrarian traders often view these levels as potential buying opportunities, betting on a bounce. But, for most traders, it’s not a good signal to see such a low number. We're approaching but haven't quite reached the danger zone where capitulation typically occurs.
The Squeeze Momentum Indicator creates an interesting divergence with the weak trend readings. Bitcoin’s reading suggests volatility is compressing—imagine a spring being wound tighter. When combined with low ADX readings, this often precedes violent moves in either direction, with the configuration suggesting a probability of a longer bearish correction rather than an explosion to the upside if the 50-day EMA consolidates as a resistance.
All that is to say, if you’re currently banking on a thesis of “Bitcoin money rotating into alts” (like Solana), the data currently appears to bear that out.

Following today’s surge, MongoDB stock is trading more than 100% above its April low but is still down slightly versus its year-to-date high of about $299.
Management’s Remarks Suggest Further Upside in MongoDB Stock
Despite an explosive rally in MDB stock since early April, management remains bullish on what the future holds for the Nasdaq-listed firm.
“The opportunity in front of us is massive,” CEO Dev Ittycheria told CNBC in a post-earnings interview, adding the company currently owns just 2% of what is an estimated $100 billion total addressable market (TAM).
Additionally, the chief executive also cited artificial intelligence (AI) tailwinds, which may help the MongoDB share price rip higher from here in the second half of 2025.
Note that Atlas, the firm’s fully managed, cloud-based database service, jumped another 29% year-over-year in Q2.
The MDB Share Price Rally May Have Gone a Bit Too Far
While the numbers MongoDB reported for its second quarter sure were “encouraging,” Macquarie analysts maintained their “Neutral” rating on the database company today.
In its research note, the investment firm lauded MDB’s strategic shift in its go-to-market approach, but cited valuation concerns for its cautious view.
Macquarie raised its price target on MDB shares following the earnings release to $265 but that still represents potential downside of 10% from current levels.
Wall Street Rates MongoDB Shares at ‘Strong Buy’
Other Wall Street firms also agree with Macquarie’s cautious view and recommend waiting for a dip before initiating a new position in MDB shares.
While the consensus rating on MongoDB stock remains at “Strong Buy,” the mean target of roughly $279 suggests potential downside of some 6% from here.
However, some analysts may soon revise their estimates upwardly following today’s blockbuster earnings release.

Also, optimism that Nvidia will report stellar earnings results after Wednesday's close boosted stocks. Over the last five years, Nvidia has only missed on earnings in one quarter. With a $4.4 trillion market capitalization, Nvidia has an 8.1% weighting in the S&P 500, giving it significant power to impact the index.
Stocks extended their gains Wednesday afternoon after bond yields gave up an early advance and turned lower on expectations that the Fed would cut interest rates as soon as next month. The 10-year T-note yield fell -2 bp to 4.24%.
Comments today from New York Fed President Williams were neutral to slightly dovish, as he stated that the US economy is slowing, not stalling, and he remains optimistic about the economy's direction. He added that every FOMC meeting is ""live"" for interest rates and that at some point, it will be appropriate for us to adjust rates downward as we remain in a ""modestly restrictive"" stance on policy.
US MBA mortgage applications fell -0.5% in the week ended August 22, with the purchase mortgage sub-index up +2.2% and the refinancing mortgage sub-index down -3.5%. The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage rose +1 bp to 6.69% from 6.68% in the prior week.
Regarding tariffs, President Trump late Monday threatened to impose new tariffs and export restrictions on advanced technology and semiconductors in retaliation against other nations' digital services taxes that hit American companies. Last week, Mr. Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware. The change went into effect last Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit.
In other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump on August 13 extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil. According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.
The markets this week will focus on any fresh tariff news or developments on ending the Ukraine-Russian war. On Thursday, Q2 GDP is expected to be revised upward by +0.1 to 3.1% (q/q annualized). Also, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to fall by -5,000 to 230,000. On Friday, July personal spending is expected to climb +0.3% m/m, and July personal income is expected to rise +0.4% m/m. Also, the July core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, is expected to climb +0.2% m/m and +2.9% y/y. In addition, the Aug MNI Chicago PMI is expected to fall -0.6 to 46.5. Finally, the University of Michigan's final-Aug US consumer sentiment index is expected to be unrevised at 58.6.
Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 88% at the next FOMC meeting on September 16-17. The markets are discounting the chances at 51% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.
Earnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With Q2 earnings season winding down, over 95% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates.
Overseas stock markets on Wednesday settled mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 rebounded from a 2-week low and closed up +0.17%. China's Shanghai Composite closed down -1.76%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.30%.
Interest Rates
September 10-year T-notes (ZNU5) on Wednesday closed up +6.5 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield fell -2.4 bp to 4.238%.
T-notes recovered from early losses on Wednesday and rallied to a 1.5-week high, and the 10-year T-note yield fell to a 1.5-week low of 4.234%. Short covering emerged in T-notes to push prices higher after New York Fed President Williams said that at some point, it will be appropriate for us to move rates down, as we are still in a ""modestly restrictive"" stance on policy.
T-notes initially moved lower on Wednesday due to rising inflation expectations, following the 10-year breakeven inflation expectations rate's rise to a 6-month high of 2.456%. Weak demand for the Treasury's $70 billion auction of 5-year T-notes on Wednesday was also bearish for prices, as the auction had a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.36, below the 10-auction average of 2.38. In addition, T-notes are under pressure due to President Trump's move to fire Fed Governor Cook, which exacerbates investor concerns about the Fed's independence and fuels inflation fears if politics forces interest rates below the neutral rate.
European government bond yields on Wednesday moved lower. The 10-year German bund yield fell to a 1.5-week low of 2.686% and finished down -2.3 bp to 2.700%. 10-year UK gilt yield fell -0.5 bp to 4.736%.
The German Sep GfK consumer confidence survey unexpectedly fell -1.9 to a 5-month low of -23.6, weaker than expectations of no change at -21.5.
Swaps are discounting the chances at 3% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.

Most Read from Bloomberg
Investors should add “a small position” in Citigroup’s existing wager that 30-year interest-rate forwards will trail five-year tenors, steepening the yield curve as the gap between the two widens, strategists including Adam Pickett and Dirk Willer, wrote in a note Wednesday. They also recommend buying the euro against the dollar via derivatives.
“Fears of a weakening of the Fed’s independence has two main market release valves in our view: weaker USD and steeper curve,” the strategists wrote in a note.
The strategists initiated the trade — known as curve steepener – in May on anticipation that Trump’s tax-cut law would swell the government’s debt, putting pressure on longer-maturity Treasuries.
Trump’s push to oust a Fed governor — and potentially exert influence through regional bank branches — is giving added impetus to the trade by raising the risk that his intervention will prop up longer-term yields by jeopardizing the central bank’s inflation-fighting credibility.
On Wednesday, the yield gap between 30- and five-year Treasuries widened to the most since 2001 after Trump said he was firing Governor Lisa Cook, who is challenging it on the grounds that he lacks the authority to do so. The unprecedented move by the president, who has attempted to cajole Chair Jerome Powell into lowering interest rates, ramped up worries that the bank will face pressure to lower interest rates for political reasons, fueling future inflation risks.
Citigroup’s strategists said they were surprised that the dollar didn’t weaken even more on the “reconfiguration risks” to the Fed’s decision-making body.
The resilience was probably due to the renewed fiscal concerns in France, a development the strategists said is unlikely to “materially undermine appetite for the euro.”

The results underscore the chipmaker’s role at the center of the AI boom, as demand for its high-powered processors showed little sign of slowing.
Shares of the company fell 1.7% in after-hours trading, with some noting data center revenue as a bit soft at $41.1 billion against estimates of $41.29 billion.
AI-linked tokens such as Internet Computer (ICP), NEAR Protocol, and Bittensor (TAO) showed little reaction to the news, trading roughly flat from prior to the results.
Bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and XRP (XRP) knee-jerked lower on the news, but quickly retraced those losses, showing roughly no net movement from prior to the earnings.
Wall Street will parse Nvidia’s commentary closely, especially for signs that hyperscalers like Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon are still ramping up chip orders. Analysts are also looking for updates on the company’s work to develop more advanced chips for China, a market where U.S. export restrictions complicate sales.

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.
Television host Jim Cramer is once again reiterating his bullish stance on Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR), tying the stock’s potential and his latest price target to the recent surge in MongoDB Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB).
‘Bears Didn’t See Mongo Coming’
On Tuesday, in a post on X, the host of CNBC’s Mad Money suggested that MongoDB's earnings momentum could spill over into Palantir, framing the software company as the next big beneficiary in the data and AI sector. “You know they are going to buy Palantir off of MongoDB,” he said.
Cramer drew parallels between Palantir’s Ontology platform, which is used for organizing enterprise data, and MongoDB, which is a database management solution.
Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.
The strong demand and momentum seen with the latter could very well be reflected in the performance of the former, leading both stocks to move in tandem.
Following MongoDB’s second-quarter results on Tuesday, when the company beat consensus estimates on revenue and earnings, while raising its guidance for the rest of the year, the stock rallied 30.51% in after-hours trading.
Once again emphasizing the impact of MongoDB’s earnings beat on Palantir, Cramer says, “Bears didn’t see Mongo coming!” He also reiterated his price target for Palantir at $200 a share, around 24% upside from current levels. “You think this stock isn’t headed to $200 anymore? Think again.”

Palantir Facing Selling Pressure
Shares of Palantir have been under pressure over the past week, with the stock dropping from its 52-week high of $189.46 early this month to $160.87.
This comes after Citron Research’s Andrew Left announced a short position against the company, saying that the stock was “beyond overvalued.” Comparing the company to OpenAI, which is valued at 17 times sales, is already “extreme” according to Left. Palantir at $40 a share, or 70% below its current levels, “would still be expensive,” he says.",f94578e2172fc4e72cce5e095f1c1381,trafilatura

According to an Aug. 27 report by Glassnode, BTC faces immediate resistance at $113,700, which aligns with the three-month cost basis of recent investors.
Potential sell pressure
Any bounce attempt will likely encounter selling pressure from short-term holders seeking breakeven exits after being pushed into unrealized losses. The one-month cost basis sits higher at $115,600, creating an additional resistance layer that could cap recovery attempts.
More concerning for bulls, the critical support level rests at $107,000, representing the six-month cost basis threshold. As of press time, Bitcoin is priced at $112,206.57.
A sustained breakdown below this zone risks triggering fear among newer market participants and could accelerate downside momentum toward the $95,000-$93,000 region, where historical analysis suggests potential bottom formation.
The Cost Basis Distribution Heatmap reveals a thick cluster of supply between $93,000 and $110,000 that has been forming since December 2024. This accumulation zone has provided resilience above $110,000 but also represents the logical target area should selling pressure intensify.
Statistical analysis of four-year bands indicates prior bearish drawdowns typically found lows around one standard deviation beneath short-term holders’ cost basis, supporting the $95,100 projection.
Investors show indecision
The current market structure indicates that Bitcoin has experienced an 11.4% drawdown from its peak, which remains modest compared to historical mid-cycle corrections that typically exceed 25%.
The Relative Unrealized Loss stands at just 0.5%, far below the 30% levels typically associated with deep bear phases. This metric suggests that the broader market has yet to experience severe stress.
However, sentiment indicators point to mounting pressure. The Spent Output Profit Ratio hovers near neutral at 1.0, indicating that investors are neither realizing significant gains nor losses.
Perpetual futures markets have shifted decidedly bearish since July, with Cumulative Volume Delta showing sustained sell pressure across major exchanges, including Binance and Bybit.
Spot market sentiment has shifted from the strong buying pressure observed in April, which fueled the rebound from $72,000. Funding rates remain near 0.01% across exchanges, indicating a fragile equilibrium where even modest sell pressure could quickly shift sentiment bearish.",749bba237c22a81277d598b8b3d1fa24,trafilatura

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's biggest non-food retailer Wesfarmers said consumer demand was beginning to recover due to easing inflation and interest rates after reporting a higher annual profit and proposing a A$1.7 billion ($1.10 billion) capital return.
The conglomerate, which owns Australia's most popular hardware chain Bunnings, and discount retailer Kmart, posted on Thursday a net profit of A$2.65 billion for the 12 months ended June 30, up 3.8% from a year earlier.
Wesfarmers CEO Rob Scott said the result, in line with estimates, was driven by strong performances at its retail businesses as shoppers began to loosen their wallets.
""We have seen a modest improvement in consumer demand and confidence in recent months, and the easing of interest rates is expected to provide some further relief,"" he said.
The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut rates three times this year, bringing the official interest rate to 3.6% at its last meeting in August as inflation returned to its target range of 2% to 3%.
While geopolitical uncertainty and U.S. tariffs posed risks to growth, Scott said he was confident the company would be able to adapt given the sophistication of its supply chain capabilities and its teams.
""These are just risk factors that all businesses have to manage,"" he said.
Earnings before tax for Kmart jumped 9.2% to A$1.1 billion, which Scott attributed to ""good growth"" in transactions and customer numbers.
Scott said consumers were ""resonating really well"" with its in-house brand, Anko, and there was more appetite for premium product offerings at higher price points.
""Consumers are feeling a bit more confidence to invest a bit more ... but also it recognises the quality of the Anko product and the fact that the Anko product is now starting to resonate with higher income families and customers,"" Scott told reporters.
""It's pleasing to see customers prepared to spend a bit more.""
Bunnings, the group's biggest division, reported a 3.8% rise in earnings before tax to A$2.34 billion. Sales growth was driven by strong demand for home repair and necessity products, Wesfarmers said.
""Bunnings and Kmart remain the growth engines ... as households traded down to value but kept spending on home improvement and essentials,"" said Farhan Badami, a market analyst at eToro.
Shares in Wesfarmers were flat in morning trade, but are up more than 28% this year.
The company proposed a capital return of A$1.50 per share, or A$1.7 billion, subject to shareholder approval at its annual meeting in October. It is expected to comprise a capital component of A$1.10 per share and a fully-franked special dividend of A$0.40 per share.",09ec5c7b924fee83f4fb1932a53ddedb,trafilatura

NMR was up more than 100% over the past 24 hours to trade near $23, according to crypto markets data provider CoinGecko.
The AI-token sector rose 5.8% in 24 hours, reaching a total market cap of $29.4 billion, according to CoinGecko. The rally came even after Nvidia, whose hardware underpins much of the artificial intelligence boom, reported weaker-than-expected second-quarter earnings.
Among the 24-hour gainers, Near Protocol (NEAR) climbed 1.5%, the token of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) added 1.3%, and Internet Computer (ICP) rose 1%.
Founded in 2015, Numerai crowdsources market forecasts from data scientists, rewarding top models with its NMR token. It began with an encrypted online tournament where participants competed to predict stock prices.
In hedge fund terms, “capacity” means an investor has locked in the option to allocate a set amount of money to a fund, ensuring access even if the fund later limits new investments. It signals a reserved allocation, not an immediate transfer of funds. Numerai has attracted high-profile early backers over the years, including Paul Tudor Jones, Naval Ravikant, and Renaissance Technologies co-founder Howard Morgan.
The Numerai deal marks another pivot for JPMorgan, whose CEO Jamie Dimon has long been a vocal crypto skeptic. Dimon once called Bitcoin a “fraud” and likened digital assets to “decentralized Ponzi schemes.”

But Dimon has softened his stance. At a May investor day, Dimon said that while he still doesn’t support Bitcoin personally, JP Morgan would allow clients to buy it. In June, the bank said it was exploring crypto‑backed lending and offering loans backed by clients’ digital‑asset holdings.

The company's stock price fell less than 1% on Thursday after data center revenue fell short of estimates, despite Nvidia beating estimates on the top and bottom lines once again. Nvidia also projected Q3 revenue of $54 billion, plus or minus 2%.
Investors were keen to see if there was any fallout from the Trump administration's moves on Nvidia's H20 chip business in China. In Q1, Nvidia estimated it would take an $8 billion hit if those restrictions were kept in place. Trump has since revoked his prior ban on the sale of some of Nvidia's chips to China, but will now require the AI giant to pay the government a 15% cut of sales into the country.

(NYSE:GDDY) is one of the 10 Most Promising Technology Stocks to Invest In. On August 21, GoDaddy Inc. (NYSE:GDDY) introduced GoDaddy Capital, a merchant cash advance program that offers $1 million in the hands of SMEs.
GoDaddy has spotted the gap, and a recent survey of approximately 2,100 U.S. small businesses from the GoDaddy Small Business Research Lab found that SMEs need access to capital. Almost 51% of the businesses said they operate with limited cash flow, and they consider this to be their biggest financial barrier to growth. Through GoDaddy Capital, these small businesses will have access to around $1 million in as little as 24 hours.
“In today’s AI-driven, agentic world—where SMBs expect fast, intuitive, and seamless experiences—the standard banking loan process is surprisingly archaic. To make financing simple and intuitive for small businesses, we built GoDaddy Capital right into the GoDaddy dashboard. GoDaddy Capital provides quick, variable-size funding and gives businesses the ability to adjust payments on the cash advance based on their success,” said Kasturi Mudulodu, president of Commerce at GoDaddy.
GoDaddy Capital will only be available to the company’s payment users, which will help attract more businesses to the company. The new offering will allow small businesses to pay down the advance through a fixed percentage of each day’s sales, providing them with one streamlined platform to take payments, manage cash flow, and secure working capital.

Nvidia posted record results for the second quarter of 2025, exceeding analysts’ expectations on both revenue and profit, yet shares slipped modestly in after-hours trading as its crucial data center division narrowly missed Wall Street forecasts.
Nvidia reported revenue of $46.7 billion for the second quarter, marking a 56% increase compared to the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per share reached $1.05, beating analyst estimates by $0.04. Investors had extremely high expectations for Nvidia’s data center division, with forecasts set at $41.3 billion. The reported figure was $41.1 billion, a 56% increase year-over-year but just below consensus, raising concerns about whether the pace of AI-driven growth is peaking or facing headwinds, leading to a roughly 3% drop in shares after the report. Investors could also be reacting to the fact that Nvidia’s sales gain was the smallest percentage in over two years and the forecast showed that it continues to expect a slowdown in growth.
Market context & AI impact
Nvidia remains the world’s most valuable company, with a market capitalization above $4 trillion, reflecting investor optimism about its dominant role in AI infrastructure. Tech giants including Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet continue to invest heavily in Nvidia-powered data centers, sustaining high demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs). The company’s Blackwell chip line remains in high demand, though CEO Jensen Huang acknowledged production capacity constraints rather than lack of customer interest.
Nvidia projected third-quarter revenue of $54 billion, plus or minus 2%, not assuming any future sales of its H20 AI chips to China, which have been affected by recent export restrictions and U.S. policy shifts. The company also announced an aggressive $60 billion stock repurchase program, underscoring management’s confidence in continued growth and cash generation.
Jittery markets
Nvidia remains the top-performing stock among mega-cap technology names in 2025, rising over 30% year-to-date. Most Wall Street analysts maintain a buy rating, citing Nvidia’s outsized share of the fast-growing AI chip market and confidence in its next-generation product launches.
The market is slightly on edge due to increasing talk of an AI bubble, including from the mouth of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman himself. A report in The New York Times suggested that Meta may be restructuring its superintelligence division and a widely read MIT report found that 95% of generative AI pilots in the corporate sector were failing, with zero return on investment. The resulting sell-off wiped out Palantir’s gains in the weeks since its own blowout earnings report.",7683e23c00aef2f6470007833ad5b26c,trafilatura

Cybersecurity is more than just software, says George Kurtz, cofounder and CEO of CrowdStrike.
“What we do at CrowdStrike is as old as time,” he told Fortune. “It’s good versus evil. It’s a human nature story embodied in technology.”
It’s a battle that’s more urgent and complex than ever, as the rise of AI has ballooned the number of cyber threats and cyber criminals. This makes M&A—a long-standing feature of the cybersecurity sector—more high-stakes than ever. To be sure, some of the biggest deals of 2025 have been in cyber, from Palo Alto Networks’ $25 billion acquisition of CyberArk to Google’s proposed $32 billion acquisition of Wiz.
CrowdStrike, which went public in 2019, is also a longtime acquirer, and today announced its acquisition of data observability startup Onum for about $290 million. CrowdStrike also announced today its Q2 2025 earnings, beating expectations but offering a softer than expected revenue outlook sending its shares down roughly 4% in after-hours trading.
Kurtz spoke to Fortune exclusively about the Onum deal and CrowdStrike’s M&A strategy going forward.
“We like to get things at the right stage,” he said. “When you look at some of these other acquisitions, like CyberArk, you’re talking about a 20-year-old technology company with a lot of integration risk. These are big companies, and I’ve seen the movie before. When I was at McAfee, we acquired 21 companies, and never quite got them integrated … So, when it comes down to it, we’re maniacally focused on the customer experience, on making sure we’re disciplined enough to get this stuff integrated. We have a great track record of doing that.”
Onum marks one of CrowdStrike’s early deals since last year’s much-publicized IT outage, which Kurtz says didn’t derail its M&A efforts, but offered a pause. In the aftermath, CrowdStrike set a high bar and refrained from closing any deals, while continuing to talk to companies, entrepreneurs, and VCs, keeping the M&A pipeline active, said Kurtz. The Onum deal ultimately came together in three months. The Madrid-based startup, which counts Dawn Capital and Insight Partners among its VC backers, was especially compelling to CrowdStrike for its real-time pipeline detection—the ability to analyze and detect threats or anomalies in data as it is being ingested into a company’s systems.
“If you think about the data we have, we started becoming the Reddit of security data for all these AI models,” said Kurtz. “The more data we get in, the larger the moat we actually have, and the greater the opportunity we have to solve bigger and broader problems from an AI perspective. That’s really driving our vision for AI-native SOC [security operations center]. It’s a natural extension.”",166a25c7880d0e2e942878ea2c389103,trafilatura

Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets:
Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.
China’s growing focus on stablecoins is less about embracing crypto and more about defending its currency from U.S. dollar dominance, says Dr. Vera Yuen of Hong Kong University's Business School, who argues the shift highlights offshore opportunities but also deep domestic limits.
Beijing's shift comes as Washington moved first to create a regulatory framework for the stablecoin industry in the U.S. Reuters recently reported that China's State Council is reviewing a roadmap for yuan-backed stablecoins later this month, with Hong Kong and Shanghai expected to fast-track adoption.
In an earlier interview, Animoca Group president Evan Auyang told CoinDesk the trigger was the U.S. GENIUS Act, which cements dollar-pegged tokens as part of global finance.
He said the law is “pressuring China to act a lot faster,” pushing Beijing to consider stablecoins not as speculative instruments, as once described by the People's Bank of China, but as necessary infrastructure to keep pace in global trade and settlement.
Yuen said the government first prioritized the e-CNY, its Central Bank Digital Currency, because it offered control, traceability, and seigniorage profits — features that regulators valued over those of privately issued tokens. But she noted that stablecoins have a clear edge in international use.
“Many CBDCs are developed for domestic use, so for international use of CBDCs, there is a big problem of interoperability of different systems. Stablecoins are designed to be used internationally, so it can be a better option for cross-border transactions,” she told CoinDesk.
""Focusing on stablecoins allows China to respond proactively to global regulatory debates and technological advances, ensuring it remains competitive and prepared as the digital currency landscape evolves,"" Yuen continued.
Capital controls still mean any yuan token will stay offshore, with Hong Kong’s new regime providing the testing ground. However, limited CNH liquidity underscores how narrow the runway is for China’s internationalization push.
""This would limit the issuance of offshore renminbi stablecoins, constraining its attractiveness as a means of payment,"" Yuen said.
China is also not moving in isolation.

Tech stocks are pulling back after Nvidia released earnings that any other CEO would probably kill for.
The chip designer and AI bellwether reported a beat to analysts' estimates and forecast Q3 revenue that was higher than Wall Street estimates. But a miss on data centre revenue and questions over China forecasts sent its shares sliding more than 3% in after-hours trading.
""Nvidia's results had to be blemish free and, despite being objectively good, they weren't perfect,"" said Kyle Rodda, senior market analyst at Capital.com. ""With the stock trading at such a high valuation, any bad news was going to be punished.""
Following two days of gain that have pushed U.S. markets to a record high, S&P 500 e-mini futures fell 0.1% and Nasdaq futures tumbled 0.2% after Nvidia's results. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan swung between gain and loss, and was last down 0.3%.
SPILLOVER
The chill was felt across the Asian tech sector, as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co tumbled 1.7% and Samsung Electronics slipped 0.7%, hinting at what may be in store for Dutch chipmaker ASML in the European session.
Nvidia's Chinese competitors surged, with SMIC gaining 8.3% and Cambricon Technologies - whose shares have almost tripled since mid-July - adding another 7.1% after the company on Wednesday said it had swung into profit. The two chipmakers pushed the STAR 50 Index of Chinese growth stocks to a gain of as much as 5%.
REINING IN EXPECTATIONS
French bonds steadied, with the yield on 30-year bonds pulling back from the highest level since November 2011 on Wednesday as traders dialled back expectations of the hit to government borrowing costs from the country's political crisis.
In trade news, Japanese stocks fluctuated between gain and loss, with the Nikkei 225 last up 0.6%, after Kyodo news agency reported on Thursday that Japan's top trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa cancelled a planned visit to the United States, where he was set to iron out details of a trade deal agreed last month.

The move comes amid Beijing’s broader push to build a self-sufficient AI supply chain as U.S. restrictions continue to limit China’s access to Nvidia’s most advanced chips.
Alibaba’s U.S.-listed shares rose 1.5% in premarket trading.
Once a major Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) customer, Alibaba and other Chinese firms are now turning to homegrown designs after Washington curbed exports. President Trump temporarily allowed Nvidia to resume shipments of its H20 processor, but Beijing soon told companies to avoid the product, citing security concerns.
Unlike earlier Alibaba chips fabricated by Taiwan’s TSMC, the new processor is manufactured in China. It is aimed at AI inference—the process of applying trained models—rather than training, which still requires top-end Nvidia hardware.
Chinese factories, constrained by older equipment and U.S. restrictions on advanced tools, face limits on boosting output, the WSJ report said, citing industry insiders.
Other Chinese firms are also filling the gap. Shanghai startup MetaX launched a chip in July positioned as an H20 substitute, using older technology and combining two smaller chips to improve performance, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.
It offers more memory but consumes more power, and the company is preparing for mass production.
Beijing is backing the push with heavy investment, including an $8.4 billion AI fund announced in January. Huawei has taken a leading role, showcasing its Ascend chips in systems that some analysts say outperform Nvidia’s top Blackwell setup on certain metrics, though with far higher energy use.
China’s biggest weakness remains training AI models, which depend on Nvidia’s most advanced chips. Alibaba’s new processor is focused on inference, not training, the report said.
Chinese engineers say domestic chips, including Huawei’s, often struggle with training runs, overheating or breaking down mid-process.
Meanwhile, DeepSeek, a startup challenging OpenAI, recently fueled a stock rally in China after hinting on social media that its software breakthroughs could pair with improved local chips to train some AI models.

While digitization has transformed banking for Indian consumers, corporate banking has been left in the slow lane — still relying heavily on clunky infrastructure, paper trails, and spreadsheet-heavy workflows. TransBnk wants to address that gap, and Bessemer Venture Partners has invested in the 3-year-old startup in a $25 million round to accelerate its progress.
Over the past decade, India has experienced a significant boom in consumer fintech, driven by transformative shifts such as the rise of digital payments through the government-backed Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and the proliferation of payment aggregators.
However, these innovations have done little to enhance the experience for businesses, especially in transaction banking, where payments, collections, and even account statements still rely on manual processes. Business customers often juggle multiple internet banking portals and rely on spreadsheets for reconciliation. This gap persists despite India being the world’s largest small and medium enterprise (SME) market, with nearly 75 million SMEs — all of which would benefit from more modern financial infrastructure.
The untapped potential in corporate banking represents a lucrative opportunity. India’s B2B fintech industry is projected to reach a market size of $20 billion by 2030, according to a February 2024 report by Chiratae Ventures and The Digital Fifth. The country is already home to 26 fintech unicorns with a combined market value of $90 billion, per data analyzed by JM Financial last year. However, most of these startups have focused primarily on innovations in payments and lending rather than core banking infrastructure.
Mumbai-based TransBnk, co-founded by former bankers Vaibhav Tambe, Lavin Kotian, Pulak Jain, and Sachin Gupta, positions itself in this space with what it calls a “common operating system” — a single window through which businesses can access the banking ecosystem. It offers a foundational layer of microservices, enabling use cases such as treasury, liquidity, and escrow management to be built upon.
“During our banking days, we always got a lot of customers asking us for a single, consolidated platform for transaction banking or corporate banking on a single particular stack,” said Tambe, co-founder and CEO, in an interview. “And we thought, let’s take up this challenge … The idea was that can we consolidate and integrate with multiple banks and then create a single platform, be it in the form factors, like the web interface or mobile app, or maybe SDKs, or API?”

Yet shares tumbled in extended trading after the company confirmed that it sold no H20 chips to China during the period, reviving concerns over export restrictions and geopolitical risk.
The disclosure sent Nvidia’s shares down 3.4% to $176 in after-hours trading, as investors weighed the near-term impact of the regulatory backdrop on one of its key markets.
Revenue for the three months ended July 27 rose to $46.7 billion, Nvidia reported, up 6% from the prior quarter and 56% higher than a year earlier. Analysts had expected roughly $46 billion.
Net income surged to $26.4 billion, or $1.08 per diluted share, while adjusted earnings reached $1.05 a share, exceeding a $1.02 consensus.
Data center sales, which accounted for 88% of total revenue, hit $41.1 billion, boosted by a 17% sequential gain in Blackwell chip shipments.
Still, the 5% quarter-over-quarter jump did little to appease investors, adding to pressure on Nvidia’s stock.
Nvidia to Build AI Supercomputer and New HQ in Taiwan
CEO Jensen Huang remained upbeat, labelling Blackwell “the AI platform the world has been waiting for,” and pointed to growing adoption across hyperscalers, government partnerships, and sovereign model developers, according to a statement on Wednesday.
But the bullish tone was tempered by Nvidia’s confirmation that it recorded no H20 sales to China during the quarter.
The company revealed that it had diverted $650 million in H20 chips, initially intended for China, to a non-restricted customer abroad, unlocking a $180 million inventory reserve.
The H20 was previously designed to comply with U.S. export rules, but updated licensing requirements imposed in April effectively hindered sales into the Chinese market.
Strategy Pushed ‘Deceptive’ Comparison to Apple and NVIDIA, Wall Street Veteran Says
Washington’s tightening of AI chip controls now requires export licenses for high-performance semiconductors destined for China in a policy move aimed at curbing Beijing’s access to advanced computing power for military and surveillance use.
While the numbers suggest continued strength in AI infrastructure demand, the muted stock reaction indicates that investors are becoming increasingly sensitive to macroeconomic risks, particularly the uncertain trajectory of U.S.-China trade policy.
Looking ahead, Nvidia expects Q3 revenue of $54 billion with gross margins forecast at 73.5%.
The board has also approved a $60 billion expansion of Nvidia’s share repurchase program in a bid to return capital to shareholders. A $0.01 dividend is scheduled for October 2.",a9e74e3a0070ed67a86cdd4bc510ff01,trafilatura

While digitization has transformed banking for Indian consumers, corporate banking has been left in the slow lane — still relying heavily on clunky infrastructure, paper trails, and spreadsheet-heavy workflows. TransBnk wants to address that gap, and Bessemer Venture Partners has invested in the 3-year-old startup in a $25 million round to accelerate its progress.
Over the past decade, India has experienced a significant boom in consumer fintech, driven by transformative shifts such as the rise of digital payments through the government-backed Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and the proliferation of payment aggregators.
However, these innovations have done little to enhance the experience for businesses, especially in transaction banking, where payments, collections, and even account statements still rely on manual processes. Business customers often juggle multiple internet banking portals and rely on spreadsheets for reconciliation. This gap persists despite India being the world’s largest small and medium enterprise (SME) market, with nearly 75 million SMEs — all of which would benefit from more modern financial infrastructure.
The untapped potential in corporate banking represents a lucrative opportunity. India’s B2B fintech industry is projected to reach a market size of $20 billion by 2030, according to a February 2024 report by Chiratae Ventures and The Digital Fifth. The country is already home to 26 fintech unicorns with a combined market value of $90 billion, per data analyzed by JM Financial last year. However, most of these startups have focused primarily on innovations in payments and lending rather than core banking infrastructure.
Mumbai-based TransBnk, co-founded by former bankers Vaibhav Tambe, Lavin Kotian, Pulak Jain, and Sachin Gupta, positions itself in this space with what it calls a “common operating system” — a single window through which businesses can access the banking ecosystem. It offers a foundational layer of microservices, enabling use cases such as treasury, liquidity, and escrow management to be built upon.
“During our banking days, we always got a lot of customers asking us for a single, consolidated platform for transaction banking or corporate banking on a single particular stack,” said Tambe, co-founder and CEO, in an interview. “And we thought, let’s take up this challenge … The idea was that can we consolidate and integrate with multiple banks and then create a single platform, be it in the form factors, like the web interface or mobile app, or maybe SDKs, or API?”
Founded in 2022, the startup says it right now works with 60 banks, with 40 fully integrated into its platform to process transactions, payments, and even the core functionality reconciliation. It also has 220 customers, of which 80% are merchants, including lenders, fintechs, and nonbank financial companies (NBFCs), while the remaining 20% are banks that have white-labeled its software to provide corporate banking services to their customers.",98b6da62bd6bf3cbe652abe187d1d7d8,trafilatura

Lenders including China Minsheng Banking Corp. and Huaxia Bank Co. warned over the past month that credit card funds and cash advances can’t be used for investments among other prohibited areas, according to statements seen by Bloomberg News. Any violations could lead to the transactions being canceled and to restrictions on card use, they said.

The move — a reiteration of a 2022 rule that orders strict control of credit card funds — joins recent curbs by some of the nation’s brokerages and fund houses to cut back on financing and limit stock purchases. Chinese stocks added more than $1 trillion in market value this month alone, with signals from margin trades to volumes all sending red flags on the sustainability of the rally.
It’s unclear whether the recent moves were a result of regulatory guidance. Chinese authorities have a track record of intervening when the market is seen overheated or oversold, to maintain stability in stocks.
Credit card funds are high-cost, short-term debt, which could significantly amplify debt risks if used for stock investments, state-backed Securities Daily said in an editorial Thursday. The report pointed out a fundamental mismatch between the short repayment cycles of credit cards - typically around a month - and the long-term nature of stock market investing.
Speculative trades funded by credit card funds will intensify irrational fluctuations in shares, potentially leading to losses by card holders and failure to repay, the newspaper said. That will create an ultimate disruption of market order and a contagion risk between the stock market and the banking system, which can threaten overall financial stability.

Technical Assessment: Bullish in the Intermediate-Term
Intermediate Term
Long Term
Summary
The SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) ETF remains stuck in a triangle but, once again, is close to breaking out. In addition, price is less than one point from the closing all-time high from April 21. It has been four months of doing nothing for the yellow metal. We were looking for an actual correction, but gold has hung tough. We thought the U.S. Dollar Index would start a new uptrend after its almost six-month correction, but that has not happened, as the bounce has been disappointing. The Commitment of Traders (COT) data for the dollar remains bullish, which has been very reliable in recent years -- but is not working this time. GLD's daily momentum has broken its multi-month downtrend, a bullish sign. A GLD breakout could lead to a measured move up to the $335-$345 region. Meanwhile, crude oil (WTI) is trading around $64.30/barrel after consistent weakness since July 30 (from the $70 level). Prices have back-tested a former resistance line (possible support) and may have traced out a wild three-wave ABC pullback off the peak since mid-June. The Vortex Indicator remains bearish while the neutral CTM Trend Meter turned higher recently. The daily moving-average convergence/divergence (MACD) is in negative territory but is trying to turn higher. Once again, momentum strength f

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-just-011637211.html,b7d93ecb7a37c733dde86738aa69b273,Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Just Delivered Spectacular News for Palantir Stock Investors,Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Just Delivered Spectacular News for Palantir Stock Investors,2025-08-29 13:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"The past couple of years have been something of a whirlwind for Palantir(NASDAQ: PLTR) stock investors. When the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution kicked off in late 2022, it played to the company's strengths. With 20 years of data mining experience and AI expertise, Palantir quickly developed its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which has become the premier software system helping businesses make data-driven decisions. By integrating with existing business systems and layering generative AI on top, Palantir provides actionable insights in near real-time. Since the release of AIP in April 2023, Palantir has become a massive multibagger, with the stock soaring 1,760%.
However, the stock's frothy valuation and questions about the ongoing adoption of AI have investors climbing a wall of worry, with many looking for signs that the AI revolution is on track.
Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has just provided the surest sign yet that the relentless adoption of AI is continuing.
Enviable results
Despite facing tough triple-digit comps, Nvidia's results were robust by any measure. During its fiscal 2026 second quarter (ended July 27), the company generated record revenue of $46.7 billion, up 56% year over year and 6% quarter over quarter. This drove adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.05, which climbed 54% year over year.
For context, analysts' consensus estimates were calling for revenue of $46.1 billion and EPS of $1.01, so Nvidia scaled both bars with room to spare.
A record-setting performance from the data center segment fueled the bullish results. The segment, which includes chips used for AI, data centers, and cloud computing, generated sales that surged 56% year over year to $41.1 billion, driven by the ongoing adoption of AI.
It's important to note that export restrictions prevented the sale of H20 chips to China during the quarter, which weighed on the results. Those restrictions have since been rescinded, and Nvidia is working on a follow-up to the H20, based on its Blackwell architecture -- reportedly dubbed the B30A. The company is in talks with the U.S. government to determine the limitations of the new data center chip for customers in China.
The icing on the cake was a new record-setting stock buyback plan. Nvidia announced a $60 billion share repurchase authorization, in addition to the $14.7 billion remaining on its previous buyback plan. Share repurchases are generally a sign of management's confidence that the company's stock is undervalued.
What does this all have to do with Palantir?
Beyond the good news for Nvidia investors, the results have broader implications about what's happening across the AI landscape. Nvidia has long been the bellwether for AI adoption, and despite the market's tepid response to its report, the results help put things into perspective.
While Nvidia's 56% growth is impressive by any measure, it comes on top of 122% growth in the prior-year quarter. This helps to illustrate the continuing demand for AI infrastructure as more companies adopt this groundbreaking technology.
It also gives additional weight to Palantir's equally robust results released earlier this month. In the second quarter, revenue surged 48% year over year (and 14% quarter over quarter) to $1 billion. This powered adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.16, which surged 78% year over year.
Yet the overall results mask the truly phenomenal performance by the company's U.S. commercial segment, which includes AIP. Revenue for the segment soared 93% year over year to $306 million, while its customer rolls increased 64%, fueled by record demand for AIP. Future demand looks even brighter as the segment's total contract value soared 222% to $843 million. Even more impressive is Palantir's remaining performance obligation (RPO), or contractually obligated sales that aren't yet included in revenue, which soared 77% year over year to $2.42 billion.
The fact that Nvidia's industry-leading graphics processing units (GPUs) continue to sell like hotcakes shows the ongoing momentum of AI adoption, which bodes well for Palantir.
The biggest AI-centric problem facing most business leaders is the lack of expertise required to implement AI into their operations, while ensuring a reasonable return on their investment. Palantir's quarterly reports are rife with customer testimonials that detail just that.
For example, after deploying AIP, Cleveland Clinic reported a 38-minute decrease in emergency room wait times, a 40% reduction in unused orthopedic operating room time, and a 75% reduction in time spent calculating bed capacity. That's one of dozens of AIP success stories.
To be clear, there's still the matter of Palantir's valuation to consider. The stock is currently trading for 185 times next year's expected earnings. While that's an egregious valuation to be sure, it might seem like a bargain five to 10 years down the road. CEO Alex Karp recently revealed ambitious plans to 10X revenue in the coming years. Given the company's current growth rate, it could achieve that lofty benchmark at some point over the next decade.
For investors wanting in on the action but put off by Palantir's exorbitant earnings multiple, I'd suggest establishing a small position and using dollar-cost averaging to build out a stake.
Should you buy stock in Palantir Technologies right now?
Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:
The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.
Consider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $661,220!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,114,162!*
Now, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,069% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 185% for the S&P 500. Don’t miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor.

Check out these ETFs instead . ,Think the S & P 500 is too expensive ? Check out these ETFs instead . ,2025-08-29 13:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Amid the flurry of warnings about the stock market being overvalued, it might help to learn about indexing approaches that can lower your concentration risk while still allowing you to ride along with the most successful companies.
Broad index funds are typically weighted by market capitalization as they track indexes such as the S&P 500 SPX. The advantage of this approach is the low cost and diversification. A disadvantage is that the high concentration in a handful of stocks can set you up for greater declines during periods of weakness for the broad market. An investor can easily be temped to sell into a declining market rather than being patient and waiting for a recovery. This can lead to an all-too-common pattern of moving to cash to sit on the sidelines, and then returning well after a recovery has started. This can reduce the long-term performance of your portfolio.
We cannot predict when the broad market will pull back significantly. It happens almost every year, and all declines have been followed by recoveries. Of course, you never know how long a period of decline or recovery will last.
It is worth pointing out that the S&P 500 fell 12% from April 2, the day President Donald Trump made his initial “liberation day” tariff announcements, through April 8. And the index was down nearly 19% through April 8 from its previous high on Feb. 19. The S&P 500 recovered quickly, and through Tuesday it had returned 10.9% for 2025. All investment returns in this article include reinvested dividends and for funds are net of expenses.
Lower risk with a different weighting approach for the S&P 500
If you are especially worried about tech-stock valuations, look back to 2022, when the S&P 500 declined 18.1% and its information technology sector fell 28.2%.
It turns out that an indexing approach that weights stocks by the companies’ revenue and not by market capitalization held up better during that down year, setting up an impressive five-year chart:
The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY has $629 billion in assets under management and tracks the S&P 500 by holding all of its stocks weighted by market capitalization. The exchange-traded fund’s annual expenses total 0.0945% of assets under management, which means the annual fee for a $10,000 investment would be $9.45.
The Invesco S&P 500 Revenue ETF RWL has $6.1 billion in assets under management and is rated five stars (the highest rating) within Morningstar’s U.S. Fund Large Value category. It also holds all the stocks in the S&P 500, but the stocks are weighted by the companies’ past four quarters’ revenue as a percentage of the S&P 500 companies‘ combined revenue. There is a maximum weighting of 5% for any stock held by the fund. The portfolio is updated for changes in the S&P 500 and rebalanced quarterly, based on the latest available revenue information. This fund was established in 2008. Its annual expense ratio is 0.39%.
During 2022, when SPY pulled back 18.2%, RWL was down 6%.
The S&P 500 is so concentrated that SPY’s top three holdings — Nvidia Corp. NVDA, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Apple Inc. AAPL — make up 21.1% of the exchange-traded fund’s portfolio.
For RWL, the largest three holdings — Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Walmart Inc. WMT and Apple — make up 9.9% of the portfolio.
Walmart is a fascinating example. This company makes up 3.65% of the RWL portfolio. And when the ETF’s portfolio is next rebalanced, Walmart might take the top spot, because its revenue for the past four reported quarters has totaled $693.15 billion, exceeding Amazon’s revenue of $670 billion.
Despite being the best revenue generator in the U.S., Walmart makes up only 0.76% of the SPY portfolio. Other stark examples of the different weightings for the funds include Tesla Inc. TSLA, which makes up 1.79% of the SPY portfolio but only 0.55% of the RWL portfolio, and Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR, which makes up 0.62% of the SPY portfolio but only 0.02% of the RWL portfolio.
One additional comparison is that the Magnificent Seven group of stocks — Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta Platforms Inc. META, two share classes of Alphabet Inc. GOOGL GOOG and Tesla — make up a combined 33.79% of the SPY portfolio but only 12.45% of the RWL portfolio.
During an interview with MarketWatch, Nick Kalivas, Invesco’s head of factor and core strategy for exchange-traded funds, described RWL as having “a value tilt, with still the whole S&P 500, as opposed to a narrow slice” that you would have with ETFs that track value indexes. In other words, this is still a strategy that rewards growth, but with less concentration. It can even be considered to be a better investment in the growth of the U.S. economy and the cap-weighted approach when considering the Walmart example.
Competing funds
When looking at ETFs competing with RWL, the best performers, according to FactSet, include two more Invesco funds and three managed by other firms:
All of the ETFs mentioned in this article have five-star ratings from Morningstar, with the exception of PRF and JQUA, which have four-star ratings.
Before investing in any fund, you should look at its portfolio, the fund manager’s fact sheet and the prospectus to learn more about how the fund is managed.

On Wednesday, the company's shares -- which had tumbled more than 10% after the new logo was revealed -- had rebounded by 8.0% by the time the closing bell rang.
For investors who bought the dip, it's a pretty good outcome. But is it too late for everyone else to buy in?
Why shares were down
On Aug. 19, Cracker Barrel launched a fall campaign it dubbed ""All the More."" It was mostly a pretty standard seasonal restaurant campaign. It announced a partnership with country music star Jordan Davis and introduced some seasonal fall menu items like a cinnamon roll skillet and Uncle Herschel's Favorite (""back by popular demand"").
However, the campaign also featured ""updated creative,"" including a change to the restaurant's logo that removed the eponymous barrel and the iconic ""old timer"" figure -- referred to by many as ""Uncle Herschel"" -- leaving only an orange background and the words ""Cracker Barrel.""
The backlash was immediate and intense, with many criticizing the stripped-down logo as generic or too reminiscent of other restaurant logos, such as Denny's or Golden Corral. On Tuesday, even President Donald Trump weighed in on Truth Social, ""Cracker Barrel should go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll), and manage the company better than ever before.""
Despite the negative reactions, Cracker Barrel initially doubled down on its logo decision, with a spokesperson saying the feedback had been ""overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic about the refreshed dining and shopping experience"" (a statement which, you'll notice, pointedly does not say anything about feedback regarding the logo specifically), and attributing the backlash to a ""vocal minority.""
However, by Tuesday, shortly after President Trump's post, the company changed its tune. ""We thank our guests for sharing your voices and love for Cracker Barrel. We said we would listen, and we have,"" the company said. ""Our new logo is going away and our 'Old Timer' will remain."" The new logo has been removed from the company's website.
Does it matter for the stock?
If you believe that any publicity is good publicity, this ruckus might result in some short-term positives for the company. Cracker Barrel's name has been in the news (and, more importantly, in the zeitgeist) for a week now, and it's even making me hungry for hash brown casserole. Many people are praising management for its ultimate decision. This could be a golden opportunity for the company, as Trump suggested in his Truth Social post, writing: ""They got a Billion Dollars worth of free publicity if they play their cards right. Very tricky to do, but a great opportunity.""
That publicity might increase foot traffic to Cracker Barrel's stores in the short term, which would be a welcome boost for the company. In its most recent quarter, same-store restaurant sales increased by just 1%, while same-store retail sales declined 3.8%. Overall, revenue has been stagnant since the pandemic lockdown reopenings, only up 5.7% since 2022. Net income has slipped by more than 50% and profit margins have declined to just 1.7%.
Those metrics aren't just bad, they're worse than most of its peer companies, including Brinker International (NYSE: EAT), which owns Chili's and Maggiano's; and Darden Restaurants (NYSE: DRI), which owns Olive Garden and Cheddar's, among many others. Perhaps the problem is the breakfast: Dine Brands (NYSE: DIN), which owns IHOP and Applebee's, has struggled with a similar drop in profits, but even Dine's profit margin is above 5%.
In short, it will take more than the publicity surrounding this logo controversy to fuel a long-term turnaround at Cracker Barrel. According to CEO Julie Felss Masino, the company is ""in the middle of a three-year transformation"" that's expected to cost $700 million and include changes to the company's advertising, menus, and store layouts. If this is how well things are going, investors will face a long and rocky road, no matter what Cracker Barrel's logo ends up looking like.

On July 31, PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) announced that it is working to provide 10 gigawatts (GW) of new electricity over the next ten years for data center projects. This amount of energy can power about 7.5 million homes simultaneously.
The 10 GW in the company’s data center demand pipeline reflects an increase from the 8.7 GW of data center demand PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) reported in May. Before that, in February, the company had reported it was 5.5 GW.
Out of the 10 GW, 17 data center projects totaling about 1.5 GW are in the final engineering stage and expected to start operating between 2026 and 2030.
According to estimates by PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), the 10 GW of expected data center demand could help lower customer electricity bills by 10% or more because the costs would be spread across more energy usage. The projects are also expected to create thousands of jobs, add $1.25 to $1.75 billion in property tax revenue, and contribute $2.5 to $3 billion in sales tax revenue.
Since the company shared this update, PG&E Corporation’s (NYSE:PCG) stock price has risen by 6.35% as of August 25.
PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) is an energy holding company whose subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, provides electricity and natural gas to customers in Northern and Central California.
While we acknowledge the potential of PCG as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Chief Executive Officer Vanessa Hudson said the relentless appetite for travel since the Covid pandemic shows no sign of faltering as the airline ordered more Airbus SE jets and splashed cash at staff and shareholders. The carrier’s shares surged to a record.
“We are seeing incredibly strong demand,” Hudson said Thursday on a call after the airline reported earnings. “The intention to travel, and Australians’ love of travel, continues.”
Most Read from Bloomberg
Qantas reported a 15% jump in full-year profit to A$2.4 billion ($1.6 billion) and ordered 20 additional A321XLR aircraft.
Hudson described an air travel market that’s booming across all price points. Budget carrier Jetstar carried a record number of passengers in the 12-month period and posted a jump in revenue and profit margins. Domestic corporate travel — where fares are typically higher — has almost returned to pre-Covid levels. There’s also “very strong” demand for premium seats on international routes, Hudson said.
The bumper profits are allowing Hudson to reward both shareholders and employees. Around 25,000 rank-and-file Qantas staff — most of the workforce — were awarded A$1,000 in shares. Investors will share a base dividend of A$250 million and an additional one-off payment of A$150 million.
Qantas shares jumped as much as 14% in early Sydney trading. At 12:06 p.m. the stock was up 9.1% at A$12.12, swelling the airline’s market value to A$18.3 billion.
The latest purchase of extra aircraft underscores the carrier’s confidence in the sustainability of bookings. The order also accelerates an Airbus-dominated fleet revamp at Qantas that includes replacing aging Boeing Co. 737 jets on domestic routes.
After receiving 17 new planes in the 12 months ended June, Qantas will receive 20 more in the current fiscal year, and an additional 29 aircraft in the following 12 months.
The freshly ordered Airbus XLRs will fly longer domestic routes such as Perth to Australia’s east coast, as well as short-haul international routes. The plane’s extra range — it can fly up to 8,700 kilometres (5,400 miles) — beats the outgoing Boeing 737 by more than 3,000 kilometres, Qantas said.
Hudson said bookings on existing direct long-haul routes such as Perth-London reinforce the business case for planned ultra-long-haul flights connecting Sydney with London and New York. Those services are due to start in 2027 on new Airbus A350 aircraft.",173c700dba00b27be89c70d5077ff76c,trafilatura

If You Bought American Tower Stock 10 Years Ago
The company's stock traded at approximately $89.51 per share 10 years ago. If you had invested $10,000, you could have bought roughly 112 shares. Currently, shares trade at $211.88, meaning your investment's value could have grown to $23,671 from stock price appreciation alone. However, American Tower also paid dividends during these 10 years.
American Tower's dividend yield is currently 3.21%. Over the last 10 years, it has paid about $45.46 in dividends per share, which means you could have made $5,079 from dividends alone.
Summing up $23,671 and $5,079, we end up with the final value of your investment, which is $28,750. This is how much you could have made if you had invested $10,000 in American Tower stock 10 years ago. This means a total return of 187.50%. However, this figure is significantly less than the S&P 500 total return for the same period, which was 288.20%.

China’s e-commerce leader reported a triple-digit percentage gain in AI-related product revenue as well as a better-than-anticipated 26% jump in sales from the cloud division — the business most closely tied to the post-DeepSeek artificial intelligence boom. Its shares gained more than 9% in US trading, after investors looked past a disappointing 2% rise in revenue and 3% decline in operating income to 35 billion yuan ($4.9 billion).
Alibaba’s progress in AI — where it is considered among the frontrunners in Chinese artificial intelligence development — helped gloss over concerns about an intense price war with JD and Meituan in the giant food delivery sector. That three-way battle has dealt more damage than anticipated to some of the country’s e-commerce leaders: JD’s profit halved in the quarter while Meituan warned of major losses, triggering a $27 billion selloff of the three companies’ shares this week.
The AI element helps explain why Alibaba’s stock has easily outpaced its more commerce-reliant rivals this year. Alibaba has also leveraged the growth of an international arm that encompasses some of the world’s most-recognized online shopping platforms from Lazada to AliExpress.
“I feel like the worst has been avoided,” said John Choi at Daiwa Capital Markets. “Cloud revenue seems to be solid while the losses were not as bad as what the market feared.”

Alibaba ADRs Rise With Cloud a Highlight of Results: Street Wrap
Investors are now focused on whether Alibaba will pursue that margin-eroding competition, at a time it’s declared record amounts of spending toward developing AI services and computing. On Friday, commerce chief Jiang Fan argued that investments in quick commerce — food delivery and instant shopping — had already driven 20% growth in users on its main Taobao marketplace. The fledgling division has in four months grown to the point that it can begin to achieve economies of scale, he added.
“This indicates that Alibaba is not particularly irrational. And of course the cloud services exceeded expectations. So in general, it’s a relief for the market,” said Xiaoyan Wang, an analyst with 86Research in Shanghai.
Meituan dominated the Chinese meal arena for years, relegating Alibaba’s Ele.me to a distant second place. That changed in 2025 when JD.com — pursuing growth during a consumption downturn — offered generous subsidies to cash-strapped diners, forcing Meituan and Alibaba to follow suit. Following a warning from industry regulators in August, it joined its rivals in pledging to cease “disorderly competition.”
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Alibaba’s ex-cloud China businesses missed consensus adjusted Ebita by 12% after we realigned the company’s newly reported segments to its prior format. Even so, this outperformed JD.com’s comparable earnings, which missed expectations by 80%, and Meituan’s overall 77% shortfall. Stronger-than-expected cloud profitability and narrower international losses highlighted Alibaba’s resilience in fiscal 1Q, supporting an improved outlook even as competitive pressures persist for all its businesses.

Alibaba is simultaneously making substantial investments in the AI sphere, developing large language models to avoid falling behind in a critical technological race. The company views AI as essential to its future, whether in terms of providing cloud computing, powering its core business or coming up with services to challenge OpenAI and DeepSeek. CEO Eddie Wu went as far as saying in February that artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is now the company’s primary objective.
Just this week, Alibaba updated its own open-source video generating model, part of a string of recent upgrades that span the gamut from agentic AI services to chatbots. On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that the company had created a chip capable of operating AI services, potentially competing with Huawei Technologies Co. and Nvidia Corp. at home.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
We remain skeptical about the ability of Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu to drive meaningful return on investment in AI cloud. Though Alibaba’s Cloud Intelligence sales growth accelerated to 26% during fiscal 1Q, at just 8.8%, the division’s adjusted Ebita margin was well below the group average of 16% due to the cutthroat competition in China’s AI sector. AI will likely remain a sentiment driver, yet Alibaba’s profit remains tied to e-commerce, with Cloud contributing less than 8% of group adjusted Ebita.

It remains to be seen if Alibaba can turn AI into a money-spinner in an increasingly competitive field. From Baidu Inc. to Tencent Holdings Ltd., Chinese firms are enhancing and releasing AI models at a frenetic pace, increasing the pressure on Alibaba to deliver breakthroughs.

SINGAPORE/MOSCOW (Reuters) -China is seeking to buy more Russian gas through an existing pipeline as talks between the two countries have failed to make progress on building a second link, thwarting Moscow's quest for new outlets, two industry sources told Reuters.
Energy is expected to be high on the agenda when Russian and Chinese leaders Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping meet in China next week.
A breakthrough on the $13.6-billion Power of Siberia 2 pipeline project to supply 50 billion cubic metres of gas to China's northwest during the visit is unlikely, however, the sources said.
Instead, they say China is considering increasing its purchases of gas via the existing Power of Siberia 1 pipeline from the current 38 bcm.
The sources could not be named because they were not authorised to speak publicly on the issue.
Russia is keen to expand oil and gas exports to Asia after losing European markets because of Western sanctions in response to its invasion of Ukraine.
For more than 50 years, Russia has supplied gas to Europe from West Siberia, which used to provide 180 bcm a year, or up to 40% of Europe's gas needs, generating up to $90 billion a year for Moscow.
Russia began deliveries to China in 2019 from East Siberia via the Power of Siberia 1 pipeline.
The West and East Siberian producing areas are not yet interconnected and Moscow hopes to reroute gas from West Siberia to China by building the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline.
Gazprom originally designed the pipeline to try to make China and the EU compete for gas from those fields.
The project became even more important for Moscow after the EU halted most of Russian gas imports in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Moscow and Beijing, however, have failed to agree on pricing for the gas and funding for the pipeline despite more than a decade of talks.
Gazprom did not respond to requests for comment.
GAZPROM COULD EARN $1.5 BILLION PER YEAR
China's growing domestic gas output and production of renewables have cut its appetite for energy, although geopolitical risks such as sanctions make inland imports from Russia more attractive, said Tatiana Mitrova from Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.
Gazprom and China National Petroleum Corporation are in talks to boost supplies via the Power of Siberia 1 pipeline by 6 bcm per year from 2031, a Beijing-based industry source said.
CNPC did not respond to a request for comment.
The new supply could generate $1.5 billion a year for Gazprom, based on a price of gas of $250 per 1,000 cubic metres, according to Reuters calculations.",44a566a3770dba9a7d3ef8f3bd972722,trafilatura

Economic data releases and earnings
It pays to have loyal customers, and in Nvidia's case, you don't need that many of them.
Even as rivals and startups are gunning for more action on the chips powering AI services, Nvidia is aiming to capture trillions of dollars in the coming years, cementing itself as the foundation of the AI transition.
Sales to Nvidia's two largest direct customers last quarter represented nearly 40% of total revenue in its data center business, the heart of its operation. The next four biggest customers accounted for 46% of the unit's revenue, highlighting the symbiotic relationship between Nvidia and the major tech platforms that sit downstream of its chip supply and feed its coffers. But it also reflects the delicate, untested nature of the AI ecosystem.
It's not hard to understand why relying on a handful of clients puts your revenue stability at risk. Should their interests change or spending waver, there goes a big chunk of your payday. Meta (META), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN), for instance, are working to lessen their reliance on Nvidia with their own in-house chips.
That logic also runs through broader conversations about national security interests and the global AI arms race. Heavily concentrated industries can pose a vulnerability to markets, societies, and governments. COVID supply chain disruptions illustrated that point in painful ways. And rising tensions in global trade are a constant reminder.
But Nvidia isn't just some humble startup with a big Silicon Valley client. On the contrary, the superiority of its products means those customers need Nvidia just as Nvidia needs them. It's no accident the chipmaker presides over Wall Street — and investor portfolios — as the most valuable name.
What looks like a client bottleneck is actually an industry chokehold.
Analysts are newly energized by Nvidia's long-term vision despite the data center revenue miss, even if the market isn't yet. Based on how much money the biggest AI companies are currently throwing around, CEO Jensen Huang said he anticipates firms shelling out $3 trillion to $4 trillion over the next five years, with Nvidia winning most of that business. At least 10 shops raised their price targets after earnings, according to Bloomberg.
Nvidia's importance as an American tech linchpin is also evident in its ambitions for China. Huang has publicly made the case that preventing his company from shipping there would leave the US shut out of a crucial market. On Wednesday, he told Yahoo Finance, ""Just as the American dollar is the world standard that economies are built on, we want the American tech stack for the world’s technology and industries to be built on, and that includes China.""",c6d8753ffc49a31285e7a9e8c8f84110,trafilatura

(Reuters) -Oil prices are unlikely to gain much traction from current levels this year as rising output from top producers adds to the risk of a surplus and U.S. tariff threats curb demand growth, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
A survey of 31 economists and analysts conducted in August forecasts Brent crude will average $67.65 per barrel in 2025, little changed from July's $67.84 forecast. The global benchmark has averaged around $70 so far this year.
U.S. crude is seen at $64.65, compared with last month's $64.61 estimate.
""(With) the latest OPEC+ supply increases and the expected lackluster global demand, the prospect is for an even larger market surplus in 2025,"" said Moutaz Altaghlibi, senior energy economist at ABN AMRO.
He said the outlook remains clouded by ""deep uncertainty"" concerning any additional U.S. tariffs, especially those associated with geopolitical outcomes such as an Iranian nuclear deal or Russia agreeing to a ceasefire.
Earlier this month, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, together known as OPEC+, agreed to raise oil production by 547,000 barrels per day for September.
""OPEC+ probably still has not reached the end of their output hikes. At the moment, market share seems to be more important than a higher level of oil prices,"" said Frank Schallenberger, head of commodity research at LBBW.
""This will lead to a big supply surplus on oil markets in 2025 and 2026 and will keep prices down.""
Washington's attempts to broker peace in Ukraine with Moscow have so far proven unsuccessful. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed additional tariffs on India, pressuring New Delhi to stop buying Russian oil.
Most of the poll respondents see limited impact on the oil market from Trump's threats on Russian crude buyers, as they expect OPEC+ and alternative suppliers could mitigate supply gaps.
However, the geopolitical risk premium is expected to underpin oil prices as a quick Russia-Ukraine ceasefire deal seems highly unlikely, analysts said.
Global oil demand is seen growing by between 500,000 and 1.1 million bpd in 2025, the poll showed, compared to the International Energy Agency forecast of 680,000 bpd.
Meanwhile, OPEC raised its global oil demand forecast for next year and trimmed its estimate for growth in supply from the U.S. and other producers outside the wider OPEC+ group.
""U.S. production is an interesting one as President Trump would like to push for more production, but OPEC+ may be right in their projections. The reason around this is price,"" said Zain Vawda, analyst at MarketPulse by OANDA.

This change, effective from Friday, follows President Donald Trump's executive order citing the exemption as a loophole for tariff evasion and drug trafficking.
The decision impacts global retailers and postal services. They are taking different measures, such as suspending shipments or adjusting services, to comply with the new U.S. customs requirements. There is a six-month transition period allowing postal shippers to pay a flat duty per package.
Below is an overview of how some postal companies are reacting:
DHL
DHL Group has imposed what it says are ""probably temporary"" restrictions on business shipments to the U.S. via Deutsche Post and DHL Parcel Germany due to uncertainties about customs duties collection and data requirements. The premium DHL Express service remains operational and the company aims to resume standard postal shipments promptly.
POSTEN BRING

Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.
Todd Vasos: Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. I want to begin by thanking our team for their great work to fulfill our mission of serving others every day in our stores, distribution centers, private fleet, and store support center. These efforts are resonating with our customers as well as driving strong operating and financial performance. To that end, we are pleased to deliver strong second-quarter results highlighted by earnings growth that significantly exceeded our internal expectations. For today's call, I'll begin by recapping some of the highlights of our second-quarter performance as well as sharing our latest observations on the consumer environment.
After that, Kelly will share the details of our financial performance as well as our updated financial outlook for fiscal 2025. I will then wrap up the call with an update on some of our key growth-driving initiatives. Turning to our second-quarter performance, net sales increased 5.1% to $10.7 billion in Q2, compared to net sales of $10.2 billion in last year's second quarter. This growth was driven by strong performance from new stores and our mature store base. We grew market share in both dollars and units highly consumable product sales once again during the quarter.
In addition to growing market share in non-consumable product sales, same-store sales increased 2.8% during the quarter driven by relatively balanced growth of 1.5% in customer traffic and 1.2% in average basket. The basket growth was driven by an increase in both average unit retail price per item and average items per basket. We were excited to see a second consecutive quarter of broad-based category growth with positive comp sales in each of our consumables, seasonal, home, and apparel categories. From a monthly cadence perspective, we saw same-store sales growth above 2% in all three periods, with our strongest comps in June and July.
We believe these strong and balanced top-line results are a reflection of the hard work the team has done to improve execution and further enhance the value and convenience proposition for both existing and new customers. To that end, we're pleased to see growth with customers across all income brackets during the quarter. This includes our core customer, who increased spending despite worsening sentiment. In addition, we continue to see trade-in growth with middle and higher-income customers during the quarter, which we believe is contributing to the nice performance we've seen in our non-consumable categories. Ultimately, customers across all income brackets are coming to Dollar General as they seek value.
As America's neighborhood general store in more than 20,000 locations across the country, we recognize and embrace our role in being here for what matters for our customers. This includes providing the items they want and need at prices they can afford. With that in mind, we are committed to delivering everyday low prices that are within three to four percentage points on average of mass retailers. While we are pleased that we continue to operate within the targeted price range, we are also focused on maintaining our substantial offering of more than 2,000 SKUs at or below the $1 price point.
We know this price point is important in helping our core customers stretch their dollar particularly at the end of the month and when budgets are tight. In fact, our $1 Value Valley merchandising set which is comprised of more than 500 rotating SKUs was one of our strongest performing areas in the quarter with same-store sales growth more than twice the rate of the overall company. We believe this holistic approach to offering value will continue to be important for our customers, particularly in the back half of this year. Now I'd like to provide a brief update on how we're thinking about tariffs.
With the rates currently in place, we believe we will be able to mitigate the majority of the impact on our cost of goods. The proactive approach of our sourcing team coupled with our relatively low direct import exposure has positioned us well to serve our customers with a quality assortment at tremendous value. While the landscape remains dynamic, tariffs have begun to result in some price increases and we will continue to work to minimize them as much as possible. Most importantly, we know this further amplifies the need for value with our communities. And we remain committed to serving our customers with the everyday low prices they have come to know and appreciate from Dollar General.
Overall, we're proud of our performance during the quarter and the tremendous progress we've made throughout the first half of the year. Our actions are delivering an enhanced shopping experience for our customers and driving strong operating and financial results. We are further strengthening our value and convenient proposition for our customers, while making significant progress on our long-term financial goals. Before I turn the call over for our financial update, I want to thank Kelly for her partnership. As well as her leadership of our financial organization over the last few years. We wish her the very best as she prepares and begins her new chapter.
I also want to note that we're excited to welcome Donnie Lau back to Dollar General as our next CFO beginning in October. He is highly regarded throughout the organization for his deep understanding of the business, thoughtful strategic leadership, and appreciation for our culture and values. We look forward to his leadership of our financial organization as we seek to drive excellence and create long-term shareholder value. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Kelly.
Kelly Dilts: Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. First, on a personal note, I wanted to express my appreciation to this team, our customers, and our shareholders. This is a special organization with a unique mission and I'm grateful for the time I've had to serve alongside them. Now that Todd has taken you through a few of the top-line highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of the other important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.
For Q2, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 31.3%, an increase of 137 basis points. This increase was primarily attributable to lower shrink higher inventory markups and lower inventory damages. Our focus on reducing shrink has continued to produce positive results. Including a healthy year-over-year improvement of 108 basis points in the second quarter. We're excited to be outperforming the shrink reduction expectations contemplated within our long-term financial growth framework. In terms of both timing and magnitude. Given these results, we are optimistic about the potential for shrink reduction to contribute more than 80 basis points toward the operating margin goal of 6% to 7% contemplated within our long-term financial framework.
In addition, we were pleased to drive a reduction in damages in the second quarter as our efforts in this area have begun to take hold as well. The gross margin increase was partially offset by increased LIFO provision as well as increased markdowns and increased distribution cost. Now, let's turn to SG and A. Which as a percentage of sales was 25.8%. An increase of 121 basis points. The primary expenses that were a higher percentage of net sales in the quarter were incentive compensation, repairs and maintenance, and benefits. Moving down the income statement, operating profit for the second quarter 8.3% to $595 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit increased 16 basis points to 5.6%.
Net interest expense for the quarter decreased to $57.7 million compared to $68.1 million in last year's second quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.5%, and compares to 22.3% in the second quarter last year. Finally, EPS for the quarter increased 9.4% to $1.86 which exceeded the high end of our internal expectations. Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, where we continue to make great strengthening our financial position. Merchandise inventories were $6.6 billion at the end of Q2, a decrease of $391 million or 5.6% compared to prior year. And a decrease of 7.4% on an average per store basis.
The team continues to do a tremendous job reducing inventory while increasing sales and improving in-stock levels which is having positive operational impact in both stores and distribution centers. The business generated cash flows from operations of $1.8 billion during the first half of the year an increase of 9.8% compared to the prior year. Our strong top and bottom line results along with our focused inventory management efforts continue to generate significant cash flow. During the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding for a total payment of approximately $130 million. Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged.
Our first priority is investing in our business including our existing store base as well as high return growth opportunities. Such as new store expansions, remodels, and other strategic initiatives. Next, we seek to return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment and over time and when appropriate, share repurchases. And while our leverage ratio remains above our goal, which is below three times adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, we are making great progress towards reaching our target level. Importantly, we remain focused on improving our debt metrics in support of our commitment to middle BBB ratings by S&P and Moody's. Overall, we're very pleased with our operating performance and financial results.
Our strong performance has positioned us to raise our financial outlook for 2025. This update primarily reflects our outperformance in the second quarter and improved outlook for the second half of the year. While considering the potential uncertainty, particularly on consumer behavior as we move through 2025. With that in mind, we now expect the following for 2025. Net sales growth of approximately 4.3% to 4.8% same-store sales growth of approximately 2.1% to 2.6% and EPS in the range of $5.08 to $6.30. Our EPS guidance continues to assume an effective tax rate of approximately 23.5% and that we will not repurchase shares under our share repurchase program. Now I want to provide some additional context around our expectations.
While we're not providing specific quarterly guidance, the low end of our sales and earnings guidance ranges allow for increasing pressure on consumer spending as we move through the back half of the year with Q4 potentially more than Q3. In addition, we expect shrink to be a continued tailwind throughout the remainder of the year, though to a lesser extent in Q4 as we begin to lap the improvements we made toward the end of last year. Turning to SG and A, given our strong performance we now anticipate incentive compensation expense to be a headwind of approximately $200 million.
Moving to the final portions of our guidance for 2025, we continue to expect capital spending in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion designed to support our ongoing growth. This includes our continued expectations to execute approximately 4,885 real estate projects in 2025 including 575 new store openings in The United States and up to 15 in Mexico. 2,000 project renovate remodels 2,250 project elevate remodels, and 45 relocations. Finally, as a result of our strong cash position, we are using cash on hand to redeem $600 million of our senior notes in the third quarter, earlier than their April 2027 maturity.
In summary, we're pleased with our Q2 results, and we're proud of the work that the team has done to strengthen our operating and financial position. This business model is strong and we believe Dollar General is well positioned to drive sustainable long-term growth on both the top and bottom lines while creating long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd.
Todd Vasos: Thank you, Kelly. I'll take the next few minutes to provide updates on three of the most important initiatives across the business. As we look to further advance our progress toward achieving our short and long-term goals. I'll start with our real estate work. As we continue to focus on driving sales and market share growth by expanding our unique real estate footprint while also enhancing our mature store base. We opened 204 new stores in Q2, primarily using our 8,500 square foot format in rural markets. Dollar General continues to serve as a vital partner, bringing value and convenience to communities across the country through new store growth.
In addition to our US growth, we opened four new stores in Mexico during the quarter, bringing us to a total of 13. Our team is doing a wonderful job serving those communities as we continue to test and learn and further develop that potential growth opportunity. We are also pleased with the progress of our remodel projects, As a reminder, in addition to our traditional remodel program, which we call Project Renovate, we have introduced a new incremental remodel program called project elevate in 2025. This initiative is designed to drive sales and market share growth in portions of our mature store base that are not yet old enough to be part of a full remodel pipeline.
These projects include physical asset investments as well as merchandising optimization, product adjacency adjustments, and category refreshes, all of which impacts approximately 80% of the total store. We completed 729 project elevate remodels in Q2 and an additional 592 project renovate remodels during the quarter. While still early, we expect to reach our goal of delivering first-year annualized comp sales lifts in the range of 6% to 8% for project renovate stores and three to 5% for project elevate stores. Importantly, we've seen significant improvements in customer satisfaction in these locations upon completion of the remodels.
And we believe the improved performance and customer response in these stores paves the way to make Project Elevate a key component of our real estate strategy in the years ahead. The next area I want to discuss is our digital initiative. Which serves as an important complement to our expansive store footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for our customers. Our digital capabilities include an engaging mobile app and website that continues to be very popular with our customers as well as growing our delivery options and DG media net. We continue to expand the reach of our delivery options with solutions targeted both new and existing customers.
Our DoorDash partnership, now serves more than 17,000 stores, continues to drive significant incrementality and sales growth. To that end, our Q2 sales through this platform increased by more than 60% year over year. Building on this success, we partnered with DoorDash to launch our own same-day delivery offering through our DG digital solutions late in 2024. We have now expanded this offering to nearly 6,000 stores. We are also excited to note that we now expect to offer DG delivery for more than 16,000 stores by year's end. Compared to our previous expectation of approximately 10,000 stores.
And most recently, we entered a partnership with Uber Eats to further expand the reach of our delivery capabilities as we provide value and convenience to customers on their platform. We have already expanded to approximately 4,000 stores with Uber and expect to be in approximately 14,000 stores by the '3. Collectively, more than 75% of the orders through these offerings are delivered in one hour or less. Ultimately, we believe this suite of delivery options will introduce new customers to Dollar General and drive incremental sales growth while also further enhancing the value and convenient proposition for our existing customer base.
The linchpin of our digital initiative is our DG media network, which enables a more personalized experience for a unique customer base while delivering a higher return on ad spend for our partners. We continue to be pleased with the performance of DG Media Network. Which is driving significant year-over-year growth in retail media volume as partners seek to access our unique customer base.
This initiative is an important component of our strategy to deliver on our long-term growth framework and we are excited about its Over time, we believe we can leverage our digital initiative to increase market share and drive profitable sales growth while further evolving our relationship with our customers and driving greater customer loyalty within the digital platform. The final initiative I want to discuss is our non-consumables growth strategy. As a reminder, we are focused on a few key growth drivers in our non-consumable categories over the next three years. These include brand partnerships, a revamped treasure hunt experience, and reallocation of space within our home category.
During Q2, we were pleased to deliver positive quarterly same-store sales growth in each of the three non-consumable categories for the second consecutive quarter. Notably, the magnitude of growth was broad-based with same-store sales increases in each of these categories of at least two and a half percent. Our brand partnerships are resonating with customers, and we have been pleased with the strong sell-through in many of these sets. As a result of the success, as well as our improved execution, our home products category saw its largest quarterly same-store sales increase in more than four years. In addition, our pop shelf stores delivered another quarter of strong same-store sales growth.
We continue to be pleased with the performance of the new store layout in this banner including a greater emphasis on categories such as toys, party, candy, and beauty. The pop shelf banner also continues to produce learnings that we are able to apply to our non-consumable categories in our Dollar General stores to further strengthen that offering for our DG customers. We believe our non-consumable sales performance both in Dollar General and Popshelf stores also benefited from improved execution in our stores and supply chain. As well as from the expanded trade in shopping we've seen from middle and higher-income customers.
These results, strong sales performance and market share gains continue to demonstrate that our treasure hunt approach is resonating with the customer. In turn, we believe we are well-positioned to serve them in these discretionary categories in stores across both banners and ultimately drive further growth in both sales and gross margin. In closing, we're pleased with our second-quarter performance. Operationally, we are improving execution stabilizing our workforce through lower turnover rates, advancing our key initiatives, and enhancing our position for sustainable long-term growth. Financially, we're delivering balanced sales growth significant margin improvement, and strong earnings, while also strengthening our balance sheet and operating cash flow.
With that said, we have ample opportunity in front of us to drive growth and further improve our operating and financial performance. And this team is laser-focused on delivering on these goals. As an essential partner in communities across the country, our customers rely on Dollar General in all economic environments. Delivering on our mission of serving others continues to guide everything we do, and we are excited about our plans for the back 2025 and beyond. Lastly, I want to thank our more than 195,000 employees for their commitment and dedication. And I'm looking forward to all we can accomplish together in the second half of the year.
With that operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question and answer session. If you like to ask a question, please press star 1 from your telephone keypad, a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. May press star 2 if you'd like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up the handset before pressing the star keys. We may address questions for as many participants as possible, ask you to please limit yourself to one question. One moment please for our first question. And the first question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. Given that you are optimistic that shrink could contribute more than 80 basis points to your long-term financial framework. Does that mean that you expect to be able to realize the six to 7% operating margin maybe as soon as next year, or, alternatively, your long-term range should be recalibrated above 7%, or are you seeing anything in the environment that might suggest you'll have to take some of this upside and shrink and other factors and reinvest it back in the business in order to drive the top line. Thank you so much.
Kelly Dilts: Yeah. Thank you, Michael. Great question. So we are definitely optimistic that we could potentially outperform on shrink and get a little bit more than 80 basis points over the mid to longer term. But we're still targeting that long-term framework of 6% to 7% on the operating margin. This quarter just solidifies the fact that we feel good about where we are. Shrink is a big component of that and we've got a lot of strategies and initiatives in place to achieving that long-term framework. I think what's important for us is not only getting to that 6% to 7%, but also the sustainability of that operating margin as we go forward.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Simeon Gutman: Hey. Good morning, everyone. And, Kelly, good working with you, and then eventually, congratulations to Donnie. I'm gonna ask you a two-part you're welcome. Two-part question. So first, if you take the gross margin in the second quarter, and we hold that base, it does look like it steps down in Q3, but is there any reason why it should step down more than expected seasonally? Meaning, is there anything temporal about the gross margin that's not a good proxy? And then second, Todd, from when you came back in 2023, thinking about all the execution items, can you talk about what's left and what you've gotten done? Thanks.
Kelly Dilts: Yes. So I'll answer the gross margin question first. What we're seeing now is obviously just an outperformance on shrink. So 108 basis points this quarter of the 137 basis points improvement. As we think about cadence for the back half, we're certainly expecting a year-over-year improvement in both of the quarters. But what I would tell you is we actually have tougher laps in Q4 on the gross margin front. And so we would expect maybe a little bit less on Q4 as far as improvement over year-over-year. And then you didn't ask about SG and A, but I do want to call out just one thing on the SG and A front.
We would expect more pressure in SG and A in the third quarter, and that's really around repairs and maintenance. It's kind of the season for repairs and maintenance we get into hurricane season and we're still kind of in that warm weather. But what's the big contributor there is we're also wrapping up our project Elevate and Renovate. Projects mostly in the third quarter, and so that puts a little bit of pressure on Q3.
Todd Vasos: Yes. And Simeon, I am very, very pleased with where we are, with our back-to-basics work. I would tell you that the team has done a really good job from, back of house. So our supply chain, our merchants, to front of house, if you will, and that's in our stores and the execution. It really is paying off. You can see it in our top line. Not only a strong 2.8% comparable sales number that we posted, but as you look at that sales number, it's very balanced. Consumables and non-consumables contributed very nicely to that 2.8%. I would tell you that we are retailers.
We always have work to do as it relates to a lot of what we've been working on. But, again, if I was to step back and think about it and base terms and innings, I would say we're in the very late innings of this game. And then we're really into now sustainability. Of what we have worked on. And I would tell you, feel real good about that as well. From a couple standpoints. Number one, we have done a really nice job in our turnover rates have come down. We've had some consecutive quarters of those decreases and we continue to be happy with where we're at.
I would tell you that our pipeline for folks coming into the organization is as robust as ever. And I'm very happy to say that our store manager turnover rates are down again this quarter. So a lot of what we've been working on to make life easier at the store level is starting to really resonate not only with the customer, but our employee base, which is really important.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. And also, Kelly, best of luck. So I'm gonna focus my comments just on delivery. So as you look at the DoorDash and I guess Uber is still very early, but just any surprises or key learnings to date? And then, you know, as you've added Uber, like, how do you think about the incrementality of that offering? Thank you.
Todd Vasos: Yeah. Rupesh, thank you. Yeah. I can tell you, our digital solutions in general, just totality, we're very happy with where we are. Very early innings. Again, baseball analogy for you. Very early innings on our digital journey. But as you know, and you've pointed out, DoorDash has been really the start of our digital journey, if you will, from a delivery perspective. We're up to 17,000 locations which is great to see. And I would tell you that we saw a 60% year-over-year increase on that platform. And by the way, off of a pretty robust number to start with. So very happy with what we're seeing there.
But the team isn't slowing down here because again, we're in the early innings. Saw where we just signed a deal with Uber Eats. We are happy with what we are seeing very early there in the partnership. 4,000 stores up and running. And by the end of the third quarter, we'll have 14 stores is what our goal to have up and running on that platform. And that just expands the reach to our to our consumer. And then last lastly, on our delivery piece, white label program that we stood up Again, very early days, but we're seeing both incrementality there as well as larger bass baskets.
And these larger baskets and some of them well north of $20 baskets for us would point to incremental ality and would point to more of a fill up versus a fill in. With that notion, you would feel that and we feel that a lot of it is incremental to our base. The great thing about our delivery piece is we are going to have more and more stores up and running. Believe we were great to be able to put out there 16,000 by year end now. Which is an acceleration from where we were. And I think that's a real testament to what we've already seen so far.
You know, to use my terminology, we're gonna put the pedal to the metal here. Because we see some real opportunity ahead. And I would tell you again the platform across all the digital properties The linchpin of this is our digital media network. And again, it has shown strong results this quarter. And continues to show strong results. So stay tuned there because I believe there's going to be even more incrementality that comes from that media network. We have a very unique customer base, as you know, being that 80% of our stores are in small town rural America.
And it is hard for CPG companies and other companies to get ahold of clientele that is just in those areas and we have all that data. And so that data will be used in our media network. And I would tell you that our partners already very interested in that. And then lastly, our secret sauce here, if you will, is that so far to date, we have seen that 75% plus of our deliveries are in one hour or less. And I would tell you that is the fastest that we've seen out there across the spectrum so far. Rural America where it is hard to reach many, many customers.
So, we believe that's a competitive advantage for us. And will continue to be as we move forward.
Operator: Our new question is from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Matthew Boss: Thanks and congrats on a nice quarter. So Todd, on your forecast for increasing pressure, on the low-income consumer as the year progresses, what are you seeing in your survey work today across your income, customer cohorts? And where do you see DG's value proposition as it stands today relative to opportunities maybe planned to amplify value? And Kelly, on the gross margin, where do you see shrink recovery in terms of innings today? And how best to think about additional drivers of gross margin multiyear from here?
Todd Vasos: Yeah. I'll start, Kelly, and, send it over to you. You know, right now, Matt, I would tell you that, I would characterize the number one as resilient. And number two, seeking value. And seeking value we're seeing that in all cohorts of customer, meaning our core customer, mid and high-end customers, all seeking value at this point. We're seeing in our numbers, our trade-in has been accelerating over the last few quarters. We saw that again And what we're seeing from the customer You know, coming into and out of Q2. is a good start to Q3. Our back-to-school offering was solid and in good shape.
And I would tell you our harvest and Halloween programs are off to a great start. It really shows and what we see in our data is not only our existing customers, but those new customers coming in. And those new customers coming in have a little extra money in their pocket to spend on that non-consumable categories. And as you heard in my prepared remarks, and I mentioned earlier, we saw a really nice balance in our sales of both consumables and non-consumables. But I would tell you, it's it's much deeper than that as well. As they seek value, we have a great proposition for them. Right?
So our everyday low price stance, we have never lost focus on that. We're as good as ever across all classes of trade on our everyday price, and our customers resonate with that very nicely. We have a great promotional cadence that we use. To continue to stimulate that consumer and especially stimulate these newer consumers as they come in to, to deliver value because they're not as familiar with that value proposition and what we offer them. So that digital through digital properties, we're able to reach them. And, so a nice promotional cadence in as well.
Here's the other value proposition that I think gets lost at times, and that is we still have and will continue to have at least 2,000 items at a dollar or less every day on the shelf. Matter of fact, our Value Valley area, which I know you know, Matt, pretty well, we have over 500 SKUs, and they're rotating SKUs. At that $1 price point still today. With 2,000 overall inside the store. And I would tell you in Value and across the store, the gross margin on those items are it may exceed the category margins in each one of those items that they play in. So it's very sustainable for us.
And by the way, when you look across the retail spectrum, it's a very elusive price point at this point. I would say we're one of the only ones that have really doubled down here and really pushed that $1 price point. So value to me, and I believe as our consumers look at it, is multi-pronged here at Dollar General and is very sustainable.
Kelly Dilts: On the gross margin side, take it in a couple of pieces. So first on the shrink side, again, we were just really excited to be outperforming the shrink reduction that we contemplated in our long-term framework again and timing and magnitude. Shrink continues to build then the trend and like I talked to earlier, we do anticipate it's going to continue to be a tailwind. Into 2025 even with the tougher lap in the second half and particularly in Q4. If you don't mind, I'm just going to list out all the actions that we're taking because as you know, we've got a full team that sits on this shrink problem and they are really producing it results.
The first thing was just the self-checkout conversion and that's been a big tailwind. But we're also getting back to our operational excellence with strong in-store control environments and we see that because we continue to see shrink improvement in stores that never had self-checkout. And so that's great to see. All the inventory reduction and SKU rationalization work is contributing. The improving retail turnover that you heard us talk about is certainly a contributor to this as well as just the expanded shrink incentive programs that we put in place.
We're still utilizing the high shrink planograms Then as you know, we really worked at this end-to-end process in so that we make sure that we're mitigating shrink at all points of exposure. I think what all of this combined gets us really excited because there's as you can remember, it takes a full year for benefits of any actions to truly show up in the P and L. And our workaround shrink never ends, as we add continual actions, we should see some improvement.
So over the mid to long term, we do feel optimistic that we would give it more than the 80 basis points of shrink improvement I think the other piece that we've talked about in the long-term framework and that we're starting to see improve is also around damages. So our goal going into 2025 for damages was flat to slightly favorable. We're still holding that in the back half but I'll tell you that Q2 exceeded our expectations and as you saw, it was actually a call out of the good guy in our variance analysis in our earnings release.
So really pleased to see that starting to take hold and just like shrink, we've got a team after this A lot of the things that help us on the shrink side also help us on the damage side, which is the inventory reduction, SKU rationalization. We're also having a full court effort around product rotation, getting more precise in our inventory allocation, which helps us to mitigate future expiration damages. Then just that proactive investment in the repairs and maintenance through our two remodel programs should also help us reduce cooler damages.
So I would tell you between the two overall, we are just feeling really good about the path to improvement, that 80 basis point on shrink, the 40 basis points on damages that we identified in our framework that we rolled out in March. And then just on the initiative side, think you've heard Todd talk all about the initiatives that we have in place to drive their 150 basis points around DG media network, all the exciting things that we're doing with delivery and the non-consumable as well. So we feel good about gross margin as we head into that mid and longer term.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Edward Kelly: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on the gross margin. Obviously, a very strong result this quarter, shrank a big driver. You know, but LIFO was an offset, and it does seem like there's I don't know, roughly, like, 80 basis points in here of, you know, a tailwind that I mean, I guess, it seems like a lot of it is initial markup. So can you just talk about, you know, what that is? And then just a quick follow-up. SG and A, you know, there has been some talking about increased higher liability claims.
Just kinda curious, is that something that are seeing, sort of like where you are in the process there, from, an actuarial standpoint in assessment, and if there's any risk there. Thanks.
Kelly Dilts: Yeah, thank you for the question. So, yeah, on the LIFO, would say, you know, year to date Q2 reflects what we know as regards to current tariff rates as well as it contemplates any cost increases that we've gotten from any of our vendors. If you step back and just take a look at the big picture what I would say is of the 137 basis points improvement in gross margin, we got 108 basis points of that in shrink. And then we're getting 29 basis points tailwind from all of the other areas combined. Solid improvement on the gross margin front.
Todd Vasos: You to address workers' comp and those people?
Kelly Dilts: Yeah. Thank you, Todd. And then on the general liability front, we are seeing some impact. It's not material. Generally, we're seeing the trend towards claims being more expensive as resolve those, but not material impact to us right now. Trends that we are seeing has certainly been contemplated in our guidance.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Zihan Ma with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
Zihan Ma: Great. Thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to break down the comp sales performance a bit more. In terms of, you mentioned, the trade-in benefit and also, of course, the better store operations driving more traffic. Can you help us better understand what proportion of the comp is driven by more macro-oriented trade-in versus more company-specific? And then going into next year as we start to lap the tougher trading comps, what is going to be sustainable on the top line? Thank you.
Todd Vasos: Yeah. Well, I would think as we look at where we are today, let me address the first part. And then we'll get to that sustainability piece. We feel good about where we are both from our core consumer as well as the trade-in consumer. And I would tell you that a lot of the work that we did Back to Basics has served us well. And, quite frankly, has set us up nicely for that trade-in consumer. As that trade-in consumer came into the brand, over the last few quarters, they've seen a better store both from cleanliness in stock, as well as friendly as well as having somebody at the front end to meet and greet them.
So I would tell you that from all the work that the team has done organically, has produced a nice outcome. On the comp of 2.8%. I would tell you that as I look at the composition, as I mentioned earlier, being pretty balanced between consumables and non-consumables, that The work the team has done on the merchandising side on our non-consumable business has been phenomenal. All these brand partnerships that we've been talking about along with great execution at store level, and the flow of freight from our distribution centers has all been very, very good to deliver that outsized comp that we saw in our non-consumable businesses.
We believe as we move to the back half of the year, we're well positioned. Think about it this way, right now, as we look at the back half of the year, our value proposition is as strong as ever. Matter of fact, we've got about $1 SKUs for the seasonal piece for the back half of the year. 25% of the offering is at $1 or less. So even in the face of tariffs, we've been able to maintain a $1 price point in our seasonal offering, which should resonate with the consumer. Matter of fact, 70% of the total offering is at $3 or less. So again, the team has done a great job.
What that shows me, and I believe will show in our results with our customer is that value is alive and well at Dollar General. They're and they are seeing that as they trade into the brand. So I would say it's really both sides. It was some self-help but also that consumer coming into the brand. But without that self-help, I'm not so sure that she would have stuck with us. That really brings me to the second part of your question. And we do this very well and that is being able to retain that trade-in customer We've got a playbook that is very robust and dense. We digitized it a few years back coming out of COVID.
And what I mean by digitize it, we had a great playbook coming out of the great recession, call it that 02/1011 time frame. We digitized it coming out of COVID in 2122. And now we're pulling that playbook back out. Matter of fact, we've already started marketing to these new customers digitally. To, one, continue to keep them engaged and two, hopefully keep them on that Dollar General journey even if time start to get a little better or different for that core consumer. So or I'm sorry for that trade-in consumer. So we're working on all angles as you would imagine from Dollar General. But comp sales are the lifeblood of this business.
And we're pushing to deliver a comp at or above where we said we would be.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.
Chuck Grom: Thanks. Good morning. Real nice work here, Todd. You know, it seems like the only really missing ingredient here is getting the comp back above 3% and being able to do it consistently. I guess, how are you feeling about that opportunity and what are the drivers to get there? And then, Kelly, the gross margin line, a lot of questions there. Can you talk about the interrelationship between shrink and inventory damages and maybe size up the damages opportunity relative to maybe where you were the past couple of years? Thank you.
Todd Vasos: Yeah, Chuck, thanks for the question. In our long-term framework, as you probably recall, we feel very comfortable in that two to 3% to deliver that. Now we are retailers. You know me pretty well. You know this team well. We will strive for more to drive it above those numbers. But I would tell you, we feel very comfortable in two to three range as we go forward. Now in saying that, we've got a lot of drivers, not only the self-help that we talked about, not only that great value proposition, that we continue to have for our core consumer as well as these trade-in consumers But what we also have is a plethora of initiatives.
So when you start to think about our project renovate and elevate, stores, those are great comp drivers. Matter of fact, our mature store base really threw off a very nice comp this past quarter. A lot of that driven again on all of the initiatives that we laid out but also as you start to look at what projects elevate and renovate, are doing, they're they're they're starting to produce those comps of six to eight for renovate and starting to produce and working our way to three to five on the on the project elevate stores. So those are all great mature store based comp drivers.
And we've got a long runway for that as you would imagine over the next few years. With 20 to almost 21,000 stores now in the portfolio. So we've got a great opportunity there. And by the way, the customer response has been overwhelming on these remodels. And as important, so has our associate our employee base has really loved the and because they're very proud because the customer is loving it. And then lastly, we want to deliver a very balanced portfolio sales. Those non-consumable initiatives continue to be very important.
And I would tell you that, that PopShelf will continue to be important for us as we continue to test learn, and then bring back to the mothership, if you will, Dollar General, those learnings and then deploy those across the chain. We're doing that as we speak, and I believe that's been some of the comp driver you've also seen on our non-consumable businesses.
Kelly Dilts: And then just as I think about shrink and damages, one thing I'd just like to say is, seeing shrink and damages improve together is a real positive. And so you know, we've talked a lot about strengths and maybe I'll just give you a little bit more color on the damage side. Like I noted just a little bit earlier that we did expect damages to be flat to slightly favorable as we work towards that 40 basis points improvement over our mid to long-term framework. And we believe we're well on our way to that with Q2 exceeding our expectations there.
And so as you as you're probably noting in your question, a lot of the things that improve shrink will also improve damages and we're seeing all of those things come to fruition. And so we feel good about our ability and our to that 40 basis points of improvement.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Seth Sigman: Hey, good morning, everyone. I wanted to focus on SG and A. Q2 seemed unique because of the incentive comp Returning. You talked about maintenance and repairs, I guess, in Q3. Can you talk a little bit more about the path back to normal operating leverage in light of the 2% to 3% comps that you mentioned? Guess a lot of costs have come back over the last two years, including this year or year to date. Should we assume this is just catch up and then we enter next year with a more normal expense base? How do you guys think about that? Thank you so much.
Kelly Dilts: Yes. No. That incentive piece is certainly a big headwind for us this year, almost $200 million. And so I think probably a more normalized rate is one that we would exit out of this year. As we think about going into 2026. I will say, there's just been a ton of work around just making sure that we're mitigating SG and A deleverage as we move forward. It's part of our framework that we called out so that the huge focus for us. Specifically around simplifying work and driving efficiencies, as well as we think about the CapEx side and how it plays into depreciation. Just optimizing CapEx to stabilize depreciation and amortization.
And so working hard to make sure we're mitigating that SG and A deleverage. And then with all of the gross margin levers that we have in place, that's where we feel really good about getting to that 6% to 7% framework as we go over the mid to longer term.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.
Kelly Bania: Hi. Good morning, and best of luck to you as well, Kelly. Thank you. Wanted to wanted to dig into the to the comp on the discretionary side. Sounds like the they were in that maybe 2.5 range, but can you unpack that between the price mix and units and just help us understand what is in the plan in terms of inflation for those discretionary categories in the back half?
Todd Vasos: That's a great question. I would tell you that the AUR was very similar year over year in those categories. Matter of fact, you know, a lot of this is spring and summer during Q2 sales in seasonal areas as an example, and a lot of the goods that we brought in prior to tariffs really were the drivers here. So tariff and price increases were not a real factor in our overall comp in non-consumables. And as I mentioned earlier, even with tariff numbers starting to flow into our seasonal home and other categories, we're still holding price points on many of them.
You heard me mention the 25% of our holiday assortment will be at a dollar or less. And as we look at 70% of our offering, still being at $3 or less. I would tell you that the team has done a really good job of trading off items and bringing in new items for the seasonal areas to keep price points pretty stable for our consumer overall, especially as we look at non-consumable businesses. I feel as if the business is very stable but growing. And the reason I am bullish there is we're seeing the takeaway early on our holiday, especially in our harvest and Halloween areas. And those areas, again, have tariff rates embedded in them.
But again, very manageable for our core consumer. And then lastly, I would tell you that all of the work that the team has done in non-consumables is really starting to come together and start to generate this positive momentum we're seeing. To your point, each of the three major categories in our non-consumable areas comped at 2.5 plus. Some of them couple of them crossed in the three mark. And I would tell you, you know, feeling really good about that sustained momentum as we go forward with all the work that the team has done through brand partnerships, as well as the what the team has done at execution at store level.
And I can't say enough about that. That is a very big component especially for our trade-in consumer that's coming in to resonate with these items.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.
Peter Keith: Hi, thank you. Nice quarter, guys. And, Kelly, best wishes. Thank you. I was wondering if you had an early view on how the one big, beautiful bill will have an impact on your core customer And then maybe digging into that a little bit, looks like Snap Dollar's will get cut starting in October. Maybe by about high single digit percent. Is that something that's factored into the outlook? Do you think that will have any impact?
Todd Vasos: Yeah. Let me take the first one first. It Everything we know to date is factored into our outlook. Now, we don't believe in snap things that are out there, especially those related to work requirements, will be very impactful for us. As we went through this a few years ago, the work rule requirements was not really a factor for that SNAP customer for us. Now as you look at the bill in totality, whether it s this year and items that will be coming up from 26 through '29. You know, we believe, overall, it should be a little bit of a tailwind for our core consumer.
Some of you may be surprised at that, but I would tell you as you look at those areas, especially the ones that are already in play, even though a lot of them won't be they won't recognize the income until tax time next year. You know, things like no tax on tips. Up to the, you know, up to the levels. No tax on overtime. The Social Security no tax pieces. All of that is very beneficial for our core consumer. And we believe we will get our fair share of those benefits. As we move forward. So a lot of positives, at least initially early.
Some of the headwinds broader snap cuts perhaps and a few other things that probably come more in late twenty seven, twenty eight. We'll continue to watch for. And see how they progress and what they look like But overall, feel really good about what our core customer initially will see from these tax benefits. We believe it really will be including the child tax credits, really be a benefit for our core consumer.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question is from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Robbie Ohmes: Oh, thanks for sneaking in sneaking me in here. Todd, can you just talk about what Dollar General? Remind what you guys are doing on the fresh initiatives you guys are doing with DG Market and maybe how you see competing with Walmart and I guess, maybe even Amazon at some point trying to get more fresh food delivery into the rural markets.
Todd Vasos: Yeah. Thank you for the question. We're really proud about the work that we've done in these fresh categories. And quite frankly, that work has been going on and accelerating for the last twelve, thirteen years here at excuse me, at Dollar General. As you As a reminder, we stood up our own fresh distribution network in 2021 and into early twenty two. Which has given us a real leg up and opportunity to get product to our stores. Timely and in full. We've got produce now in 7,000 plus stores. We have got fresh meat in thousands of others.
We are building our DG market concept and also putting produce in even outside of DG Market concept in our in our Dollar General stores where it makes sense. Especially as you mentioned in rural America. And the great thing about our delivery pieces is that and we're already seeing it in rural America where folks are buying those fresh items, fresh, frozen, deli, dairy, produce online and being delivered in an hour or less. To our consumer base. We believe again, as I mentioned earlier, that to be a competitive advantage as we move forward, especially the speed that we're able to offer her and at the value pricing that she knows and loves for that Dollar General already.
So we believe that it's a powerful combination. That we will continue to cultivate in the years to come.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of our question and answer session. This will also conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. We thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.

The general manager for the project revealed the timeline during a media tour of the mine, according to a Reuters report.
Located in the Limpopo province, north of Johannesburg, Mogalakwena comprises five open pits, with the Sandsloot pit earmarked for underground development due to its higher ore grades.
South Africa's platinum miners have increasingly had to go deeper underground to maintain production levels amidst declining ore grades, a shift that escalates both costs and risks.
Mogalakwena is a significant asset for Valterra, accounting for nearly half of the company's PGM output.
In July, Valterra initiated a feasibility study for the underground project, aiming for completion and an investment decision in the first half of 2027.
Mogalakwena underground mining studies general manager Stephan Nothnagel was quoted by the news agency as saying: “We are also envisioning a trial mining... in the back end of 2026.”
Nothnagel suggested that initial ore extraction and a potential ramp-up to a 3.6–4.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) operation could occur beyond 2030.
Valterra hopes the underground mine will contribute to a 10–50% increase in Mogalakwena concentrate production.
Executives Martin Poggiolini and Agit Singh also highlighted efforts to scale up demand in existing markets and create new demand segments.
In a separate development in June, Anglo American completed the demerger of around 51% of its interest in Valterra Platinum, following shareholder approval.
Anglo American will retain a 19.9% stake in Valterra Platinum, which it plans to manage responsibly over time to achieve a full separation.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-top-buffett-stocks-buy-141500473.html,b8dc8661ebd9381a1a6d3b8642724ca9,2 Top Buffett Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Haul,2 Top Buffett Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Haul,2025-08-29 15:15:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Warren Buffett will likely go down in history as the greatest investor of all time. He has been investing for decades, and his company, Berkshire Hathaway, has made many of its long-term shareholders rich. Between 1964 and 2024, Berkshire's stock generated compound annual gains of 19.9%, well ahead of the broader benchmark S&P 500's 10.4% gains (including dividends).
Cumulatively, an investment made in the stock in 1964 would have increased in value by more than 5.5 million percent as of the end of 2024. And a notable share of that growth has been powered by the conglomerate's extensive stock portfolio, which today is valued at close to $300 billion. That's why investors are always curious about what stocks Berkshire is buying and selling.
With Buffett set to step down as the company's CEO at the end of the year, there is even more of a focus on Berkshire's portfolio right now. Here are two Buffett stocks I'd recommend buying and holding for the long haul.
1. Coca-Cola: A steady Eddy through the cycle
Iconic beverage company Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) is one of the longest-held positions in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. Buffett and his team first bought the stock in the late 1980s. He has always favored companies with strong brands because those brands become competitive advantages, enhancing a business's ability to retain customers long term, even during the tougher periods of the economic cycle.
In his 2022 annual letter to shareholders, the Oracle of Omaha discussed how reliable Coca-Cola's dividend had been. All he and his late business partner, Charlie Munger, had to do with regard to that investment was ""cash Coke's quarterly dividend checks."" In 1994, after investing a total of $1.3 billion in Coca-Cola stock over several years, Berkshire collected annual dividends of $75 million from the beverage giant. By 2022, the annual dividends on that position had grown to $704 million.
Coca-Cola is an excellent pick for generating passive income. Indeed, it's a Dividend King -- one of a small number of companies that increased their dividend payouts annually for at least 50 consecutive years. Earlier this year, Coca-Cola announced its 63rd straight annual dividend hike, and its yield at the current share price is now close to 3%.
But aside from the dividend, Coca-Cola is one of the strongest consumer staple stocks, and it's a good idea for long-term investors to have some exposure to consumer staples because these companies can perform through every phase of the economic cycle. Even when the economy is struggling, most people who like Coca-Cola's beverages are going to keep drinking them.
Additionally, so far, Coca-Cola has done a pretty good job of managing the tariff headwinds, and management is still projecting organic revenue growth of 5% to 6% in 2025.
2. Amazon: Two dominant businesses
Over the years, Buffett has shown a willingness to wade into new sectors. For many years, Apple has been Berkshire Hathaway's largest stock position. But another tech company in its portfolio that is sure to be a beneficiary of the artificial intelligence revolution is Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). With its $2.45 trillion market capitalization, Amazon is one of the five largest companies in the world, and it operates two phenomenal businesses: its massive e-commerce platform and Amazon Web Services (AWS).
The e-commerce business is a logistical masterpiece that can source nearly any product and usually have it at a customer's door within a day or two. Not only does Amazon generate its largest chunk of revenue from online sales, it also brings in a significant amount from third-party sellers that do business through its platform. The Amazon Prime membership service, which includes free shipping and Prime Video, among other perks, gives the company another durable stream of recurring revenue.
While President Donald Trump's tariffs do pose a challenge to this part of the business, Amazon will likely be able to pass some or all of the costs from those import taxes on to its consumers, and it has the operational strength to weather the storm. Online sales at Amazon rose 11% year over year in the second quarter, while subscription services and third-party seller revenue rose 12% and 11%, respectively.
Meanwhile, AWS continues to be the global leader in cloud infrastructure, where it maintained a 30% market share in the second quarter of 2025, according to CRN. AWS enables companies to move their data and processing to data centers that Amazon owns and operates, allowing them to forego the costs and hassle of operating complex IT infrastructure.
AWS is also primed to leverage this business to roll out artificial intelligence tools and large language models for companies to run their own AI applications. While the cloud is not exactly a novel concept anymore, a large share of the world's organizations have yet to embrace it, which leaves AWS well positioned for further growth.
Amazon's stock is only up about 4% this year, largely due to investors' concerns about how tariffs will impact the company. It trades slightly under 35 times expected forward earnings, which is below the company's five-year average of just over 38, giving investors the opportunity to buy the stock at a reasonable price point.
Should you buy stock in Coca-Cola right now?
Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:
The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.
Consider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $664,110!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,104,355!*
Now, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,069% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 186% for the S&P 500. Don’t miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor.

Autodesk reported fiscal 2026 second-quarter adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.62, with revenue rising 17% year-over-year to $1.76 billion. Both exceeded forecasts. Billings jumped 36% to $1.68 billion, also more than estimates.
Design segment product sales increased 17% to $1.47 billion, and Make unit product sales were 20% higher to $194 million.
Sales of its Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations (AECO) software grew 23% to $878 million, and its popular AutoCad and AutoCad LT software brought in $440 million, up 13%.
CFO Janesh Moorjani said the company ""saw strength in AECO, where our customers are benefiting from sustained investment in data centers, infrastructure, and industrial buildings, which is more than offsetting softness in commercial.""
Autodesk now sees full-year adjusted EPS of $9.80 to $9.98, revenue of $7.025 billion to $7.075 billion, and billings of $7.355 billion to $7.445. Previously, the company's guidance was for adjusted EPS of $9.50 to $9.73, revenue of $6.925 billion to $6.995 billion, and billings of $7.160 billion to $7.310 billion.
The news lifted Autodesk shares into positive territory for the year.

A $1,500 insurance payout shouldn't normally be a cause for worry. But for one Social Security Disability Insurance recipient, the check raised a serious question: Could it put their benefits at risk?
The individual, who shared their story on Reddit, explained that they hit a deer with their car. Because the vehicle also serves as a backup home, repairing the damage was urgent. Their insurance company offered a payout, but they weren't sure whether accepting it would affect their monthly disability payments.

SSDI and Unearned Income
Commenters were quick to reassure the poster that SSDI works differently than they might think. Insurance settlements, inheritances, and gifts are considered unearned income, and SSDI is not reduced based on those types of payments.
""Regarding SSDI, insurance payments don't matter to the SSA — you could get a $1M insurance payout and they wouldn't blink,"" one commenter explained. ""Why? Insurance payouts are unearned income. They're not factors of SSDI eligibility or of SSDI benefit amounts.""
The Social Security Administration backs this up. SSDI is an earned benefit, based on your work history and the payroll taxes you paid before becoming disabled. The only income that matters for SSDI is earned income — wages from a job or self-employment.
For 2025, earning more than $1,620 a month from work generally puts someone above the ""substantial gainful activity"" limit, which could make them ineligible. But money from an insurance company doesn't fall into that category.

The SSDI vs. SSI Distinction
The confusion often comes from mixing up SSDI with Supplemental Security Income. Both are run by the SSA, but they follow very different rules.
-
SSDI is insurance for people who worked and paid into Social Security before becoming disabled. Unearned income doesn't reduce benefits.
-
SSI is a needs-based program. Both earned and unearned income, including insurance payouts or cash gifts, can reduce or even eliminate monthly payments.
""If you are positive it is SSDI, and NOT SSI, you have absolutely nothing to worry about,"" another commenter clarified.
Other Factors to Keep in Mind

Friday, August 29, 2025
Oil prices are headed towards a second straight weekly gain of 1%, with ICE Brent hovering slightly above $68 per barrel, as hopes for a negotiated settlement in the Russia-Ukraine conflict dissipate and US-India trade tensions remain unresolved. Market activity was seasonally low in late August; however, next week could provide a much-needed boost to oil trade as OPEC+ countries meet on September 7 to assess current market conditions and their output cuts.
Europe Wants Its Own Secondary Sanctions. French President Macron and German Chancellor Merz issued a joint statement calling for secondary sanctions on buyers of Russian oil, potentially prohibiting European exports and technology transfers to countries such as India, China, and Turkey.
Saudi Arabia to Slash October Prices. As OPEC+ countries finalize the 2.2 million b/d unwinding next month, Saudi Arabia is expected to cut Asia-bound October formula prices by $0.50-0.70 per barrel in line with easing Dubai time spreads and waning demand as Asian refiners start seasonal maintenance.
Gazprom’s Eastward Ambitions Hit The Beijing Wall. Russia’s pipeline gas monopoly Gazprom has failed to advance negotiations on the stalled Power of Siberia-2 pipeline ahead of Putin’s visit to China this weekend; however, Beijing expressed readiness to boost gas supplies via PoS-1 by 6 bcm per year.
Pipeline Damage Hampers Russian Exports. Russia’s crude oil exports via the Baltic port of Ust-Luga are expected to be capped at around 350,000 b/d, or half the usual throughput capacity, after Ukraine damaged the Unecha pumping station in a drone strike last week, diverting oil to other export terminals.
LA Refinery to Start Closure Next Week. US downstream giant Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) will begin the decommissioning of its 140,000 b/d Los Angeles refinery next week, perhaps even earlier than the previously mentioned Q4 2025 deadline for idling, creating a void in fuel supply in California.

The collaboration will integrate Aurora’s self-driving trucking platform into McLeod's transportation management system to enhance the user experience for shared customers and bolster the adoption of autonomous trucking technology within the industry.
Self-driving autonomous trucks, with their ability to transport freight safely and continuously, offer carriers the potential to boost revenue and asset utilisation, according to Aurora.
However, the integration of self-driving trucking technology into existing operations and management processes is crucial to avoid adding complexity or creating operational friction.
Through an API integration with Aurora's technology, McLeod's clients will gain real-time insights into the operations of autonomous trucks.
The collaboration will enable shared customers to manage the tendering and acceptance of autonomous shipments, dispatch, and load tracking through their McLeod TMS.
McLeod Software CEO and founder Tom McLeod stated: ""Integrating Aurora's autonomous capabilities into our TMS platform provides our customers with a pathway to adopt Autonomous Tractors within their operations.
""This collaboration underscores our dedication to providing cutting-edge technology for our customers, empowering them to optimise their operations and embrace innovation with confidence.""
Additionally, Aurora will benefit from access to McLeod's customer base, which is expected to accelerate the industry-wide adoption of self-driving trucks.
Currently in beta testing, McLeod anticipates making this feature available to its customers by 2026.
Moreover, Aurora will participate in McLeod’s User Conference from 21-23 September 2025 to provide further updates on this collaboration.
Aurora president Ossa Fisher said: ""Our partnership with McLeod marks a key next step in delivering a premium, customer-centric product and service.

Marvell posted adjusted earnings of 67 cents per share, edging past Wall Street’s forecast of 66 cents. Revenue came in at $2.006 billion, just shy of the $2.009 billion consensus estimate. Adjusted gross margin was 59.4%, reflecting resilient AI-focused sales.
“Marvell delivered record revenue of $2.006 billion in the second quarter, a 58% year-over-year increase, and we expect continued growth into the third quarter, accompanied by operating margin and earnings per share expansion,” said Matt Murphy, Marvell’s Chairman and CEO.
Also Read: Marvell Stock Surges as Investors Bet on AI Boom and Hyperscale Spending Growth
“Marvell’s growth is being fueled by strong AI demand for our custom silicon and electro-optics products, as well as a significant increase in the pace of recovery in our enterprise networking and carrier infrastructure end markets,” Murphy added.
For the third quarter, Marvell expects revenue between $1.957 billion and $2.163 billion (vs. $2.105 billion estimate) and adjusted EPS of 69 cents to 79 cents (versus 72 cents estimate).
Analysts responded by trimming price forecasts, citing both near-term headwinds and long-term opportunities.
Kevin Cassidy of Rosenblatt Securities described Marvell’s results as mixed, noting that data center ASIC shipment adjustments between October and January contributed to a slight revenue shortfall, even as earnings came in ahead of expectations.
Looking ahead, the firm lowered its fiscal 2027 revenue outlook to reflect the divestiture of Marvell’s Automotive Ethernet business and softer data center shipments.
Despite the near-term revisions, Rosenblatt maintained a Buy rating, citing a strong pipeline of 18 upcoming ASICs and more than 50 additional design opportunities that it believes will diversify revenue and reduce customer concentration. The firm cut its 12-month price forecast to $95 from $124.
JP Morgan analyst Harlan Sur said Marvell’s July-quarter results were in line, as stronger consumer demand offset softer data center and carrier sales. The analyst noted that the October-quarter guidance of $2.06 billion was broadly in line after accounting for the Automotive Ethernet divestiture.
The firm expects flat data center revenue, with optical networking growth offset by uneven custom ASIC shipments, which should reaccelerate in 2026. Carrier and enterprise networking sales are projected to climb 30% sequentially.",8106a4a7aa795c4650c6764c032b2c5d,trafilatura

Despite its recent surge, MPLX still trades at an attractive valuation.
-
The MLP has lots of growth coming down the pipeline.
-
It should have plenty of fuel to continue increasing its high-yielding distribution.
MPLX's (NYSE: MPLX) unit price has surged nearly 20% over the past year. This is impressive for a master limited partnership (MLP) focused on distributing income to its investors.
That surge might have you wondering whether you missed out on your chance to buy the MLP. Here's the top reason why it should have plenty of fuel to continue rising.
Ample fuel to continue growing value
MPLX currently trades at about 12 times its EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) ratio. That's right in the middle of the pack in the energy midstream sector. It's a compelling price to pay for a company with MPLX's combination of financial strength and growth prospects. That reasonable valuation is why the MLP currently still yields an attractive 7.6%.
The MLP currently has a long list of expansion projects in its backlog. It's building a couple of additional natural gas processing plants, owns interests in joint ventures constructing several new natural gas pipelines (including the recently approved Eiger Express), and has some new NGL fractionators under construction. These projects provide MPLX with earnings growth visibility through the end of the decade.
The company has also been using its strong financial profile to make a series of strategic acquisitions, including recently agreeing to buy Northwind Midstream for $2.4 billion. These deals will provide it with incremental sources of growing income due to the embedded visible growth of the acquired assets.
MPLX's combination of near-term acquisition-fueled growth and long-term growth from organic expansion projects should enable the MLP to grow its EBITDA at a mid-single-digit annual rate for years to come. That should allow the MLP to continue increasing its distribution at or above that level (it has delivered more than 10% compound annual distribution growth since 2021).
With so much growth still coming down the pipeline, you didn't miss out on MPLX. The MLP's combination of income and growth could give it the fuel to produce double-digit annual total returns from here.

The move positions EBZT alongside Nasdaq-listed VivoPower International (NASDAQ:VVPR), which earlier this year committed $100 million in XRP to the same model.
Together, these adoptions highlight XRPFi's push to become an institutional standard for corporate treasury yield.
XRPFi is Flare's initiative to transform XRP (CRYPTO: XRP), traditionally a non-yielding asset, into a productive tool for treasuries.
The framework uses FAssets, Flare's trustless bridging system, and Firelight, its decentralized restaking protocol, to convert XRP into FXRP and allocate it across staking, lending, and liquidity markets.

""XRP, now a roughly $150 billion asset, has been a cornerstone of digital finance for more than a decade, yet institutions have had few ways to make it productive,"" said Hugo Philion, Flare's co-founder and CEO.
Arthur Rozenberg, CEO of Everything Blockchain Inc., said the decision demonstrates how XRP can serve as a compliant, yield-bearing asset.
""This is about unlocking the true financial utility of digital assets like XRP, not just as speculative holdings, but as yield-bearing instruments that can compound over time,"" he said.
Flare said multiple public companies are now integrating XRPFi, underscoring its ambition to serve as the default programmable utility layer for XRP in institutional finance.

With student debt, high interest rates and steep housing prices, the path to buying property isn’t easy for this young generation.
In 2024, about 26.1% of Gen Zers owned a home, according to Redfin. That’s roughly the same amount as in 2023 and 2022, and in a tough economy, staying steady isn’t a failure — it’s proof that Gen Z can still find a way into the housing market.

Heather Myers, real estate advisor and co-owner of Snyder Real Estate Group, told GOBankingRates she sees this play out in real time.
“The old narrative that young people ‘can’t afford to buy’ is shifting — because Gen Z isn’t waiting for the perfect set of circumstances,” she said.
Here are seven creative methods she’s seen Gen Z use to make homeownership a reality.
House Hacking
Buying a bigger property with extra space to rent out is a popular approach, according to Myers. Rental income helps cover the mortgage, making homeownership more affordable, particularly in areas where rents are high.

Teaming Up With Friends or Family
Rather than waiting to qualify on their own, many are buying with siblings, friends or relatives. Splitting the down payment, closing costs and monthly bills increases buying power, opening the door to bigger properties or better locations.
Living With Family To Save
For some, the quickest path to a down payment is cutting out rent altogether. Moving back in with family for a year or two lets Gen Z funnel thousands directly into savings. The key is setting strict rules to avoid dipping into those funds early.
Tapping into Family Equity
Parents or grandparents with significant home equity can provide an edge. That support might come as a down payment gift, co-signing a mortgage or even tapping a home equity line of credit (HELOC). While not an option for everyone, it can be a game-changer for those with family resources.
Using Creative Financing Tools
Gen Z buyers are leaning into non-traditional financing tools. Veterans’ affairs (VA) loans can eliminate down payment requirements for eligible buyers. Seller credits can reduce upfront costs.
And “2-1 buydowns” temporarily lower mortgage interest rates, “giving them breathing room as they adjust to homeownership,” said Myers.",ea60b126fb5f8cca33441c119cc38684,trafilatura

While some companies have seen solid acceleration in growth by selling AI hardware and software, others have been able to achieve productivity gains and improve operational efficiency.
This explains why tech giants such as Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Oracle, and Palantir have witnessed a remarkable surge in their share prices in recent years. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), however, is one tech giant that has failed to capitalize quite as well on the AI bandwagon since the arrival of ChatGPT in Nov. 2022.
Let's see why that has been the case so far and check why Apple's fortunes could witness a solid turnaround thanks to AI.
Apple may have been late to the AI party, but it could still win big from this tech
Apple has built its business over the years by selling consumer electronics devices such as smartphones, tablets, personal computers (PCs), and wearable devices. Though the company has been focusing on boosting its revenue from the services business, it still relies on hardware sales for 71% of its top line. Meanwhile, Apple has failed to keep pace with its rivals in terms of integrating AI into its devices.
Samsung beat Apple in the generative AI smartphone space by launching its Galaxy S24 series in January last year. Apple followed suit with its own AI-capable iPhone in Oct. 2024. The tech giant was late in launching an AI PC as well, since its Apple Intelligence suite of AI features was also made available last October. Additionally, Apple Intelligence witnessed a staggered rollout, hampering the company's sales growth.
However, things are now changing for the better. Apple reported double-digit growth in iPhone sales in its most recent quarter (ended June 28). Its revenue increased at the fastest pace since Dec. 2021. That was impressive considering that customers tend to skip buying iPhones during the June quarter in anticipation of the new iPhone launch that usually takes place in September.
Apple's focus on aggressively rolling out AI features across its devices seems to be bearing fruit. Its iPhone revenue increased 13% year over year during the quarter, while Mac revenue jumped 14%. The trend is likely to continue as the company is adding more features to Apple Intelligence, such as live translation and visual search. It has also added AI features to the Apple Watch.
In all, Apple has added over 20 AI features to its devices. More importantly, the company is now willing to spend aggressively to enhance its AI portfolio. CFO Kevan Parekh announced on Apple's recent earnings call that the company is ""increasing our investment significantly in AI."" This is precisely what Apple needs right now as other tech giants have been spending big money on the technology.
The addition of more AI features could encourage a bigger chunk of Apple's user base to upgrade their devices, allowing the company to sustain its recently found momentum in this market. After all, the market for generative AI-capable smartphones and PCs is expected to grow at an annual rate of almost 35% through 2029, paving the way for Apple to enjoy healthy growth in these markets in the long run.
At the same time, there are reports suggesting that Apple could consider monetizing its AI features by charging a monthly subscription fee. Given that the company had more than 2.3 billion active devices in January this year, monetizing Apple Intelligence could open up a massive revenue stream for the company.
Stronger growth could result in more upside
Analysts have become bullish about Apple's prospects following its latest results. As you can see with the boost in estimates in early August, they now expect the company to deliver stronger earnings growth in the future
There is a good chance that its actual growth could be better than what analysts are expecting thanks to its AI-focused moves and investments. Meanwhile, this tech stock is trading at 28 times forward earnings, a discount to the tech-focused Nasdaq-100 index's forward earnings multiple of 30.
The market could reward the stock with a richer valuation on account of the potential acceleration in growth, and that could send Apple stock soaring in the long run.

A regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) noted that he held several leadership roles at Nike. Those roles include vice president and CFO for Asia Pacific and Latin America, from February 2022 to April 2024; vice president of global business planning from July 2020 to February 2022, and senior director of business planning in North America from March 2018 to June 2020.
“Patraic is a seasoned financial professional with a strong public profile and a track record of delivering consistent, profitable growth,” Rees said. “We believe his consumer-centric mindset, robust financial experience in the footwear industry and his international expertise will complement our leadership team in driving long-term shareholder value.”
“Crocs, Inc. is a company that I have long admired — one whose profitable growth has been built on an enduring cultural icon and one where I see untapped potential across both the Crocs and Hey Dude brands,” Reagan stated. “Drawing from my global experience of leading high-growth brands through disciplined execution, I look forward to working alongside the talented leadership team to unlock shareholder value and drive consistent results for years to come.”
Reagan’s responsibilities include oversight of the company’s financial strategies, as well as financial planning and analysis, accounting, treasury, investor relations, tax and internal audit.
The SEC filing included the terms of Reagan’s offer letter, which stated a base salary of $750,000 per year and eligibility to participate in Crocs’ annual bonus plan. He also can participate in the firm’s long-term incentive plan in 2026, and will receive a sign-on bonus of $800,000 that’s connected to certain conditions. Reagan also will receive a $3.5 million equity grant of time-based restricted stock units that will vest in five parts ranging from as early as six months from the start date and as far out as 36 months, also provided certain conditions are met.
Rees on Thursday also thanked Healy for her contributions. Healy will stay on as an advisor through Oct. 31, 2025, and be eligible for a payment of $25,000 on Sept. 5, 2025, and $50,000 on Oct. 3, 2025, subject to continued employment on each payment date.
As part of her separation agreement, Healy agreed to a 24-month non-compete term, along with a 24-month period of non-solicitation of Crocs’ employees. She also is entitled to a lump sum payment of $400,000, less certain amounts for taxes and withholdings, which is net of a required reimbursement to Crocs for funds spent on her relocation benefits. Healy was named executive vice president and CFO in May 2024 — succeeding former CFO Anne Mehlman when she was named president of the Crocs brand — and joined the company one month later.
The Crocs brand last month opened its new “Icon” store concept in New York’s SoHo neighborhood at 543 Broadway. Spanning the length of an entire city block, the store allows for immersive storytelling, hosting of shopping events to create experiential theater for the brand, and features two counters for Crocs’ Jibbitz™ charms to give customers a chance to personalize their purchases.
Earlier this month, the casual footwear firm posted solid second quarter earnings results, although it remained cautious on consumer spending on its Crocs and Hey Dude shoes due to the potential impact from tariffs.
And separately, also earlier this month, the company named Millie Bobby Brown as the Crocs’ brand’s new global ambassador.

It was an ad-tech company that soared more than 700%.
That stock is AppLovin (APP) .
The California-based adtech platform for mobile gaming apps went public in 2021 and rode the wave of online game excitement during the Covid era.
Since then, it has built a position in the crowded digital ad market, competing with hyperscalers like Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta (META) . Wall Street has rushed in, betting on the company’s AI-driven ad technology, which lets advertisers target users more effectively.
The remarkable stock performance raised questions about the company's business and stock growth.
Skeptics question AppLovin's AI hype
In February, Culper Research revealed a short position in AppLovin, saying its surge last year was driven by investor enthusiasm for Axon 2.0, an ad-search engine. Short sale means betting a security's price will decline.
""AppLovin has used Axon 2.0 largely as a promotional tool — a smokescreen to hide the true drivers of its mobile gaming and e-commerce initiatives, neither of which have much to do with AI,"" the firm wrote.
Related: Analysts revamp CrowdStrike stock target after earnings
After the short reports, CEO Adam Foroughi defended the company’s technology in a blog, calling the reports ""littered with inaccuracies and false assertions.""
""A few nefarious short-sellers are making false and misleading claims aimed at undermining our success, and driving down our stock price for their own financial gain,"" he wrote.
Despite the skepticism, AppLovin shares are up nearly 50% year to date.
AppLovin posts strong earnings and outlook
On August 6, AppLovin posted strong second-quarter results, with net income more than doubling to $820 million, or $2.39 a share, up from $310 million, or 89 cents, a year earlier. Wall Street had expected earnings of $2.01 a share.
Revenue climbed 77% to $1.26 billion, beating forecasts of $1.22 billion.
Related: Analysts revamp CrowdStrike stock target after earnings
For the third quarter, AppLovin projected revenue between $1.32 billion and $1.34 billion, above consensus estimates of about $1.31 billion.
AppLovin stock gained 11% on Aug. 7 following the earnings. The stock closed at $483.75 on Aug. 28, just 8% below its all-time high stock price at $525.15 on Feb. 14, 2025.

Scotiabank raised its price target on AppLovin to $575 from $450 and reiterated an outperform rating, thefly.com reported on Aug. 28.

To address the purported security breach, scammers instruct victims to log in to their accounts and modify their API settings, Binance said. What victims do not know, however, is that by following the instructions, they are giving the attackers access to their funds.

-
Marvell's Q2 2026 results lined up very closely to official guidance and analyst projections.
-
Next-quarter guidance suggested a slightly slower period, because some hyperscale data center builders are between large infrastructure upgrades.
-
The company will simplify its financial reporting from five divisions to two in the next report, reflecting the massive weight of data center customers.
Shares of Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) took a deep dive on Friday, following the chip designer's release of Q2 2025 earnings. The results were right in line with the consensus analyst projections, but that wasn't enough to impress Marvell's investors. The stock was down 16.1% at noon ET.
Marvell's Q2 by the numbers
Marvell's second-quarter sales soared 58% above the year-ago figure, landing at $2.01 billion. Adjusted earnings more than doubled from $0.30 to $0.67 per diluted share. As mentioned, the results matched Wall Street's average targets and the midpoint of management's guidance. No surprises there.
Looking ahead, however, Marvell's third-quarter revenue guidance fell just short of current analyst expectations. Top-line sales should hold almost exactly steady from the second quarter, representing a slower year-over-year increase of 36%.
Lumpy sales are business as usual
Data center revenues have become the largest and fastest-growing part of Marvell's operations, contributing 74% of the second quarter's total revenues. That's up from 34% a year earlier. As a result, Marvell will reorganize its financial reporting in the third quarter, combining its four smaller segments into a single ""communications and other"" division.
As for the underwhelming revenue guidance, CEO Matt Murphy called Marvell's revenues ""lumpy"" in the conference call. Hyperscale customers often place massive bulk orders of networking and storage controllers to support new or upgraded data centers. The big buy is then followed by slower periods. That's what's going on here, with some of Marvell's core customers doing more planning than data center builds over the next few months.
So there's nothing terribly wrong with Marvell's business today. It's just a bit of a lull between periods of higher activity. The stock trades at 27.9 times trailing earnings right now, which is on the high side for Marvell, but also fairly reasonable for a company deeply involved in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.
Should you invest $1,000 in Marvell Technology right now?

(Reuters) -Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup xAI (XAAI.PVT) has sued a former engineer at the company for allegedly stealing trade secrets related to its Grok chatbot and taking them to rival OpenAI.
Musk's company said in the complaint filed on Thursday in California federal court that Xuechen Li stole confidential information related to ""cutting-edge AI technologies with features superior to those offered by ChatGPT"" to bring to his new job at OpenAI earlier this month.
Li, representatives of OpenAI and attorneys and spokespersons for xAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday. OpenAI is not a defendant.
The complaint underscores the rivalry between Musk's company and OpenAI and a fierce battle among tech companies for AI talent.
Musk, an OpenAI co-founder, has separately sued the company and its CEO, Sam Altman, for allegedly deviating from its original mission to benefit humanity. OpenAI countersued Musk in April for harassment.
Musk's xAI filed another lawsuit against OpenAI and Apple in Texas on Monday for allegedly monopolizing the market for AI chatbots on Apple devices.
The new lawsuit said Li began working as an engineer for xAI last year, where he helped train and develop Grok. The company said Li took its trade secrets in July, shortly after accepting a job from OpenAI and selling $7 million in xAI stock.
Musk's startup said that the secrets could allow OpenAI to bolster ChatGPT with xAI's ""more innovative AI and imaginative features.""
The lawsuit said Li admitted to stealing company files and ""covering his tracks"" during a meeting on August 14, and that the company later found additional stolen material on his devices that he had not disclosed.
Musk's AI company asked the court for an unspecified amount of monetary damages and a restraining order blocking Li's move to OpenAI.

(NASDAQ:NTRA) asserted against NeoGenomics, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:NEO) v1.1 RaDaR test.
Natera said on Friday that it is evaluating its options, including an appeal and further enforcement with other patents.
Natera said these patents are distinct from U.S. Patent No. 11,519,035 (the ‘035 patent), and the decision has no impact on the validity or enforceability of the ‘035 patent.
The ‘035 patent was the basis for a preliminary and then permanent injunction entered against NeoGenomics, which removed its RaDaR v1.0 product from the market.

The order means that NeoGenomics remains free to broadly commercialize the RaDaR ST assay, formerly RaDaR 1.1.
NeoGenomics has launched RaDaR ST for biopharma customers and has submitted it to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) Molecular Diagnostic Services Program (MolDX) for clinical reimbursement coverage for the RaDaR ST assay.
""We are pleased with the Court's decision to invalidate Natera's asserted patents..."" said Tony Zook, CEO of NeoGenomics.
Analyst Take
William Blair connected with NeoGenomics' team, which said that RaDaR ST could launch as early as the fourth quarter of 2025.
""We believe investors will view this news as an unexpected and positive win for NeoGenomics,"" analyst Andrew Brackmann wrote in an investor note on Friday.
Given the recent management changes and a resetting of expectations on guidance, William Blair wrote that much of the investment thesis did not rest on the company's MRD strategy or a near-term launch of RaDaR, thus resulting in a stock price surge on Friday.
William Blair maintains the Market Perform rating, citing that investors will want greater confidence in underlying execution before driving the multiple meaningfully higher.
Price Action: NEO stock is up 24.55% at $8.98 at the last check on Friday.

That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.
A savings account with a high interest rate can help you make the most of your short-term savings goals. However, if your account's annual percentage yield (APY) is low, you may be wondering what options you have to earn more.
For example, can you negotiate savings interest rates? Or do you need to switch to a different financial institution altogether to get a better return? Here's what you need to know.
This embedded content is not available in your region.
Can you negotiate interest rates with banks?
Savings account interest rates are variable, which means they typically fluctuate over time. But in most cases, you can't qualify for a better APY on your account through negotiation alone.
That said, banks may offer opportunities for customers across the board to earn a higher interest rate by increasing your balances with the bank or switching to another account that offers a better return.
If your bank doesn't offer such opportunities, your best bet may be to switch to a financial institution that offers a high-yield savings account with a more competitive APY.
How to negotiate a higher savings interest rate
While you're unlikely to be able to negotiate a better savings APY than what your bank offers all its customers, there may be ways to earn a better return by making adjustments to your relationship with your financial institution:
-
Just ask: Although it's doubtful that your bank will hand you a better rate ""just because,"" it won't hurt to ask. You may consider this option if you have a long history with a small community bank or local credit union that places more emphasis on individual relationships. However, success with this approach is rare.
-
Add more money to your savings account: Some banks offer savings accounts with tiered interest rates, reserving their best APYs for customers with higher balances or those who make regular deposits into their savings accounts.
-
Move other accounts to your bank: Some financial institutions may offer special relationship savings rates to encourage customers to keep all their finances under one proverbial roof. In this scenario, your savings rate will typically be based on your total balances in eligible accounts, including bank accounts and investment accounts.
-
Switch to a different account: Banks often offer a variety of savings options, including traditional or high-yield savings accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs). Depending on your bank, you may be able to get a better APY by switching to a money market account or CD. That said, these types of accounts can come with more limitations, so carefully review the account terms before making a switch.
As you consider your options, it's important to remember that nothing is guaranteed. In many cases, you may need to look elsewhere for better savings options.
Tips for maximizing your savings interest rate
Whether or not you have opportunities to earn a higher return with your current bank, it's important to consider all the different ways you can make the most of your short-term savings goals:
-
Shop around: Even if you're satisfied with your bank's savings interest rate, you may be able to earn more with a different bank. Start by researching the best high-yield savings accounts to get an idea of what's possible. Then, compare APYs, account minimums, and other requirements and limitations to determine which account is best for you.
-
Focus on online banks: Online banks tend to offer higher APYs than traditional banks and even many credit unions. This is primarily because online banks don't have the same overhead costs as financial institutions with physical branches. Smaller online banks may also offer higher rates to raise funds for other operations.
-
Consider alternatives: As previously mentioned, it can also help to consider alternative savings options, such as money market accounts and CDs. That said, money market accounts can have minimum balance requirements and monthly fees, while CDs may charge you a penalty if you withdraw funds before the account matures. Carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of these accounts to determine if one is right for you.
-
Consider investing: Depending on your savings goals, it could make sense to invest some of your savings instead of keeping it in a savings account. In particular, this could be helpful for long-term savings needs or funds that don't have a specific goal. However, think twice about investing money for short-term needs, such as financial emergencies or a home down payment.

The bottom line
The savings account interest rate your bank advertises can change over time with market conditions, but if you're hoping to get special treatment and earn more than other customers, you may be disappointed.
However, some banks may offer ways to earn more interest on your savings balance through increasing your balance, improving your relationship with the financial institution, or switching to an account with a better return.
If these options aren't available or the bank's interest rates are low across the board, consider shopping around and comparing other savings options to make the most of your money.",e7b388f404ea2b170c84fe90b0bfa0db,trafilatura

Jesse Frimpong aims to retire by 50 through multiple income streams and investments.
-
Frimpong founded Prestige Knowledge to teach online business skills after his own financial struggles.
-
He emphasizes building wealth through scalable systems and not just saving for early retirement.
This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jesse Frimpong, the 27-year-old founder of Prestige Knowledge and an e-commerce expert who plans to retire by age 50 and is based in Florida. It has been edited for length and clarity.
I'm the CEO and founder of Prestige Knowledge, a company I started in 2019 that educates people on starting their own online businesses.
I started out working at Taco Bell, Macy's security, McDonald's, Noodles & Company, and Olive Garden. Each job taught me crucial life lessons about hard work, perseverance, and the importance of resilience.
After these jobs and prior to launching Prestige Knowledge, I built and sold e-commerce stores. I sold three of these businesses, and this experience provided me with the expertise to teach others how to build wealth.
With the income from my current business and a few other income streams, I have a plan and a goal to retire at age 50.
I watched my father struggle as an immigrant
My father worked tirelessly to provide for me, often juggling multiple jobs. His determination and work ethic inspired me deeply. It showed me that no matter the odds, you can create opportunities for yourself and your family.
My motivation to start my own business stemmed from my experiences with financial hardship. I wanted more freedom in my life, and that drive eventually led me to entrepreneurship.
I earn around $6 million a year in revenue, which includes the various ventures under my company's umbrella, like our SaaS platforms, digital education offers, and consulting. I have five employees and a few contractors. I personally take home seven figures annually.
I used to live paycheck to paycheck
I struggled to afford a decent meal or even diapers for my newborn. I didn't have a work visa, as I was born in the UK. That pressure pushed me into survival mode and to look for something different.
I started diving into free content, YouTube videos, podcasts, and anything I could find on building an online business. Books like ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" and ""The Lean Startup"" completely changed how I thought about money.
I built my first e-commerce store and just kept going. After trial and error, I started generating real revenue. That experience gave me both the capital and the confidence to launch Prestige Knowledge.",67f917ed821aa499c18db1584a5f2e7b,trafilatura

Shares of XP Inc. (NASDAQ:XP) rallied for a 7th consecutive day on Thursday, adding 8.68 percent to close at $18.58 apiece as investor sentiment continued to be bolstered by a strong earnings performance in the second quarter of the year.
In an updated report, the Brazilian investment management firm said it grew its net income by 18 percent to R$1.3 billion from the R$1.12 billion registered in the same period last year. Net revenues rose by 6 percent to R$4.455 billion from R$4.219 billion year-on-year.

Earnings per share stood at R$2.46, topping consensus estimates of R$2.35 and growing faster than its net income, due to a robust share buyback program that resulted in a significant reduction in the number of shares in circulation.
During the period, total client assets also stood at R$1.4 trillion, higher by 14 percent than the R$1.204 trillion recorded in the same period last year, primarily driven by a R$96 billion net inflow and R$72 billion of market appreciation.

(NYSE:S) posted second-quarter fiscal 2026 results that modestly outpaced expectations, prompting several Wall Street analysts to reiterate bullish views and lift price forecasts.
Revenue came in at $242.2 million, up 22% year-over-year and in line with consensus estimates, while non-GAAP EPS of 4 cents beat forecasts of 3 cents. Annual recurring revenue (ARR) grew 24% to $1 billion for the second straight quarter, and large customers spending more than $100,000 annually increased 23% to 1,513.
SentinelOne ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and investments. Management guided third-quarter revenue of $256 million and raised full-year revenue expectations to $998 million-$1.002 billion, up slightly from prior forecasts and closely aligned with analyst projections.
WestPark Capital analyst Casey Ryan reaffirmed a Buy rating and $25 price forecast, emphasizing SentinelOne’s ability to combine steady top-line growth with improving profitability. He highlighted gross margins rising to 73.3%, keeping the company on track toward its 75-80% long-term forecast.
Ryan praised the AI-powered Singularity platform as a differentiator against rising cyber threats and staffing shortages and added that SentinelOne’s consistent execution and balance sheet strength make it a potential takeover candidate for either strategic or private equity buyers.
Needham & Company analyst Mike Cikos reiterated a Buy and raised his forecast to $23, describing SentinelOne’s quarter as a turning point in momentum. He highlighted record net-new ARR growth of 90% sequentially, well above expectations, fueled by strength across new and existing customers.
Cikos noted Purple AI’s attach rates above 30% and triple-digit bookings growth as evidence of accelerating adoption, while the Data segment continues to scale after surpassing $100 million in ARR last quarter.
He also pointed to the early success of SentinelOne Flex, the company’s new licensing model, which has already landed an eight-figure deal. While the $180 million acquisition of Prompt Security creates a short-term margin headwind (~80 bps), Cikos sees it strategically enhancing the company’s generative AI security portfolio.
Other analysts also raised their forecasts following the print. UBS’ Roger Boyd maintained a Neutral rating and lifted his price forecast from $19 to $21. Wells Fargo’s Andrew Nowinski reiterated an Equal-Weight rating while moving his forecast from $18 to $19. Barclays’ Saket Kalia kept an Equal-Weight stance and raised his forecast from $19 to $21. Baird’s Shrenik Kothari remained more constructive with an Outperform rating and a higher forecast of $23, up from $21.",4de8d06143b318dcc807bae029de7892,trafilatura

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers home loans to military service members, veterans, and their families. These VA loans often have more lenient eligibility requirements and lower costs than conventional mortgage loans. But that doesn’t mean a VA loan is necessarily the right choice for you, even if you qualify. How do you choose between a VA and conventional loan?

VA loan vs. conventional loan: What are the differences?
VA loans are insured by the Department of Veterans Affairs and available to eligible active-duty service members, veterans, or surviving spouses. By backing VA loans, the VA offers financial protection to mortgage lenders in case you default on your mortgage or face foreclosure. As a result, the eligibility guidelines are often more lax compared to other home loans.
Conventional loans are mortgage products that aren’t guaranteed by the federal government. Lenders can set their own requirements for these home loans, but most will make sure their loans conform to standards set by government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This is done so they can sell those mortgages to the GSEs in exchange for capital.

Eligibility requirements
To qualify for a VA loan, eligible borrowers must have a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) from the VA. The VA will only issue a COE to you if you are an active-duty service member, an honorably discharged veteran who has met the minimum service requirements, an eligible National Guard or Reserve member, or the surviving spouse of a military member.
Conventional loans do not have any special eligibility requirements other than for factors such as your down payment and credit score, which we cover below.
Property requirements
A VA loan can be used for a home purchase, a VA Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan (IRRRL), a VA cash-out refinance, or a Native American Direct Loan (NADL) for a primary residence. There is an occupancy requirement, though, stating that the veteran borrower (or their spouse and/or dependents, if the military member is deployed) personally intends to occupy the home.
Generally, you cannot use a VA loan for a second home or for an investment property. An exception applies if you use a VA loan for a second home, even if you still own your first VA loan-purchased property, provided you intend to occupy the second home.
The most common situation that allows for this kind of VA loan purchase is if the active-duty borrower has a permanent change of station (PCS) away from the first home.
But as long as you use the second VA loan for a home you intend to make your primary residence and give up residence of your original home, you are still entitled to a VA loan for the new purchase. Just remember that having two VA loans at once will limit the amount of money the VA will guarantee, which could restrict your borrowing power.
Conventional mortgage loans, on the other hand, have no primary residence or occupancy restrictions. That said, purchasing a house as a second home or investment property may have stricter borrowing requirements and a higher interest rate.
Credit scores
The VA does not impose credit score minimums. It’s at the discretion of your lender, but most require a score of 620 or higher. Some lenders will go lower, especially if you make a sizable down payment.
Conventional loans also have a minimum credit score requirement of 620. Ideally, you want to apply with a higher score, as doing so positions you for the most competitive mortgage terms.
Down payment
VA loans do not require a down payment. One of the biggest perks qualified borrowers enjoy when taking out a VA loan is the option to finance 100% of the home purchase.
You don’t get that luxury with conventional loans, as the minimum down payment is 3% of the purchase price.
Debt-to-income ratios
Your debt-to-income ratio refers to the amount of money you pay toward debts each month compared to your gross (pre-tax) monthly income. For a VA loan, mortgage lenders generally prefer a DTI ratio of 41% or less.
Conventional loans offer a bit more flexibility. The acceptable DTI is usually between 36% and 45%. Some mortgage lenders will go as high as 50% if certain cash reserve or credit score guidelines are met.
Interest rates
VA loans usually have lower interest rates than conventional loans, which could save you several thousand dollars in interest over the loan term.
That’s not to say you can’t snag a low mortgage rate with a conventional loan. If you have a solid credit score, an acceptable DTI ratio, and adequate cash reserves, you could qualify for an attractive interest rate.
Mortgage insurance
Private mortgage insurance (PMI) isn’t required on a VA loan, regardless of the down payment amount.
With a VA loan, the closest thing to mortgage insurance is the VA funding fee, which costs 1.25% to 3.3% of your loan amount. You can either pay the fee at closing or roll it into your principal balance to save money up front.
However, you must pay PMI on a conventional loan if you put down less than 20% of the purchase price. PMI protects the lender if you default on the monthly mortgage payments.
Closing costs
You’ll pay between 1% and 6% of the VA loan amount in closing costs unless the seller pitches in to offer concessions. It’s important to note, though, that seller concessions are capped at 4% of the loan amount.
Conventional loan closing costs typically range from 2% and 5% of the purchase price. Seller concessions between 2% and 9% of the loan amount are also permitted, depending on the property type and size of the down payment.

VA loan vs. conventional loan FAQs
What are the benefits of a VA loan?
Eligible borrowers can qualify for a VA loan with a $0 down payment and no required PMI. VA loans may have lower interest rates than conventional loans, and they generally have less stringent borrowing requirements. This can make homeownership more accessible to military members.
What are the drawbacks of a VA loan?
VA loans require a funding fee of between 1.25% and 3.30%. Borrowers who put down $0 will only have equity in the home once they have been making payments for some time.
Are VA loan rates better than conventional loan rates?
VA loan interest rates are typically better than conventional loan interest rates for borrowers who make a small down payment. However, a borrower who is able to put down a 20% down payment on a conventional loan may qualify for a better rate than they would with a VA loan.

Paying for Services You Don’t Use
Some services require paid subscriptions. And just because you are no longer using a particular service does not mean your credit card has magically stopped being charged.
“Most people will forget that they are still paying a $5 or even a $10 per month fee for an app they signed up for and are no longer using,” said Paul Ferrara, CIM, senior wealth counselor at Avenue Investment Management. At the end of the year, that could be up to $120 down the drain. And if you have five zombie accounts? That’s $600 you’re lighting on fire.
Check Out: Here’s How to Fix Your Budgeting Problems, According to Kumiko Love
Potentially Subject to Market Fluctuations
If you’ve signed up for a financial services account like Acorns, you are agreeing to let the platform take your spare change and invest it. That means, if the market goes down, your investments could lose value.
And while one could argue it’s wise to leave your money in the market long term, it’s unadvisable to forget you have these investments in the first place. This is because your risk tolerance will shift over time and your portfolio may need to be rebalanced.
Goldmine for Fraudsters
Even though zombie accounts are unmonitored, they are still active. And this means that your account details remain stored and susceptible to hackers.
“If a fraudster successfully gains access to the account, they will likely purchase goods or build a profile without the original account holder catching on for quite some time,” said Leslie Tayne, finance and debt expert and founder of Tayne Law Group. Additional damage ensues when fraudsters obtain and then change passwords and/or email addresses outside the account holder’s awareness.",08a2865466f33f55c0b6192cde5c22c8,trafilatura

The company disclosed in a regulatory filing on Thursday that unresolved issues could ""adversely affect"" its ability to report results of operations in a timely and accurate manner.
In its annual report for the fiscal year ended June 30, Super Micro repeated similar statements from its May quarterly filing, adding that it was working to address the problems.
Last year, the San Jose, California-based company missed an August deadline to file its annual financial report and Ernst & Young LLP resigned as its auditor in October, citing concerns about governance and transparency.
Super Micro had filed its long-delayed annual report earlier this year.
The company is set to lose over $1 billion from its market value of about $26 billion, if Friday's losses hold.

Among the 19 brokerages covering Super Micro, seven rate the stock ""buy"", nine ""hold"" and three ""sell"", with a median price target of $49, according to data compiled by LSEG.
Meanwhile, shares of rival Dell fell about 10% on Friday as high manufacturing costs for AI-driven servers and rising competition offset its bullish demand forecast for AI infrastructure.

Whether you’re downsizing your fleet, facing a cash crunch, or pivoting your business model, turning in a leased tractor before the end of the agreement doesn’t mean you just hand over the keys and walk away.
In reality, early lease termination comes with real costs: financial penalties, lost leverage, and disruptions to your operations. This article breaks down what actually happens when you terminate a commercial lease early, what your options are, and how to protect your business if you find yourself in that situation.
The Business Case for Leasing—and Where It Gets Complicated
There’s a good reason some small fleets and midsize carriers choose to lease from companies like Penske. According to Penske Truck Leasing’s own website, their full-service lease agreements offer benefits like predictable monthly costs, reduced maintenance burdens, and access to late-model, fuel-efficient equipment without the upfront capital outlay.
But what happens when those business needs change mid-contract?
If the market looks like it does today, your load volume shrinks, your contracts get canceled, or your expansion plan stalls, that truck lease that made sense last year might become a liability today. That’s where the conversation shifts from “benefits of leasing” to “consequences of breaking the lease.”
What Early Termination Really Means
Most full-service commercial leases are fixed-term, with built-in penalties for early return. These aren’t rental trucks you can return at will. They are legally binding financial agreements, and the lease provider—whether it’s Penske, Ryder, or another provider—is not looking to absorb your losses.
Here’s what typically happens if you return a leased truck early:
Early Termination Fees: These fees are contract-specific but are usually based on either a flat penalty or a percentage of the remaining contract value. Some providers will require the full remaining lease balance to be paid.
Accelerated Depreciation Recovery: Leasing companies structure pricing based on expected use over the full lease term. If you return a unit early, they may assess depreciation recovery fees to offset residual value loss.
Maintenance Cost Reconciliation: If you’re on a full-service lease and have underutilized scheduled maintenance or inspections, you may be required to pay back the unused service credits.
Excess Wear and Damage Charges: Any body damage, missing equipment, tire wear, or mechanical neglect will be assessed and billed at the time of return.
Loss of Upfront Deposits or Credits: Depending on your lease, you may forfeit any capitalized cost reductions or deposits made at signing.
Don’t Confuse Leasing with Renting
One of the biggest misconceptions is that commercial leasing is similar to a rental agreement. It’s not.
A rental is day-to-day or month-to-month with flexibility built in. A commercial lease, especially from providers like Penske, is a fixed asset strategy with built-in depreciation, utilization, and resale assumptions. These companies plan around your contractual obligations—and when you exit early, they make sure their business doesn’t absorb the impact. You do.
What to Do Before You Even Consider Early Termination
If you’re thinking about turning in a leased tractor early, stop and assess these three areas:
Check the Lease Terms in Detail
Look for early termination clauses, penalties, and the process for notification.
Some providers offer early return windows or buyout options—know exactly what your contract allows.
Run a Cost Comparison
Compare the cost of keeping the lease (even parked) vs. returning early.
Sometimes, paying out the lease is cheaper than the fees triggered by early return.
Ask About Transfer or Reassignment
In some cases, the lease company may allow you to transfer the lease to another business—especially if your payment history is strong and the unit is in good condition.
Your Exit Options
If keeping the truck isn’t feasible, and you’ve decided to initiate early termination, you still have choices:
1. Negotiate a Settlement
Many commercial leasing companies are open to negotiation—especially if you’re not walking away from a payment but restructuring your needs. Offer a lump sum, propose partial payment terms, or ask for termination fee reductions in exchange for continued business elsewhere in their network.
2. Use Lease Buyout as Leverage
If your lease allows for a buyout (where you purchase the truck outright), that figure may be lower than the penalties tied to early return. You could then resell the truck on the open market to recover some of the value.
3. Explore Fleet Restructuring
If you’re turning in one truck but expanding in another region or segment, the lease provider may be more flexible. Use your broader fleet relationship as leverage.
How It Impacts Your Credit
Commercial lease defaults don’t just go away. If you abandon the lease or fail to settle, here’s what can happen:
Collection Activity: Unpaid lease balances will be sent to collections and reported against your business credit file (and sometimes your personal credit if you provided a guarantee).
Financing Blacklist: Equipment financing companies often communicate through shared databases. A default on one lease can disqualify you from getting another truck financed.
Impact on Partner Programs: If you work with OEM maintenance programs or fuel card networks through your lessor, you may lose access or face increased fees after a default.
When It Makes Sense to Exit Anyway
Despite the risks, sometimes exiting early is still the smarter business move:
Cash flow crisis: If the monthly payment is crippling your business and you can’t restructure revenue fast enough, cutting the loss may be necessary.
Contract cancellations: If you lost the freight that justified the truck, and there’s no pipeline to replace it, holding onto the asset may just burn more money.
Operational shift: If you’re moving from OTR to dedicated, or downsizing to owner-operator-only, that extra lease unit may become a liability.
In those cases, early termination becomes a controlled risk rather than a blind jump.
Setting Yourself Up Smarter Next Time
If you’re walking away from a lease, treat it like a business lesson—not a failure. Here’s how to set up better for the future:
Revisit your utilization: Make sure your lease matches the type of freight and miles you’re actually running.
Work with providers who offer flexible terms: Some companies offer shorter lease terms or seasonal options. Penske, for example, has both full-service leases and short-term truck rental solutions depending on operational needs.
Don’t over-fleet based on emotion: Adding a truck should be tied to confirmed freight, not a hunch. If that contract isn’t inked, don’t lock yourself into another fixed expense.
Always build an exit strategy into your financial model: Assume you may need to exit. Budget for it. Structure your cash flow to protect against it.
Final Word
Terminating a commercial truck lease early isn’t impossible—but it’s not painless either. If you’re not strategic, you can rack up thousands in fees, hurt your business credit, and lose credibility with future equipment providers.
But if you face it head-on—with your numbers in front of you, your lease terms in hand, and a plan to exit smart—you can survive it. More importantly, you’ll walk away with a clearer understanding of how to structure future leases for long-term success.
Truck leasing, like trucking itself, is a business strategy. And just like any strategy, it only works when it’s aligned with the numbers, the freight, and the future you’re trying to build.",e8a7ea0186c015b38fb2892356b8b1c8,trafilatura

Nvidia shares dropped more than 3% Friday and shed about 2% for the week.
Friday's drop came after server maker Dell (DELL), a customer of those chipmakers, gave a third quarter earnings outlook below Wall Street's estimates, while a new report said Chinese tech giant Alibaba (BABA) is testing a new chip to compete with Nvidia and AMD in China.
The Wall Street Journal reported Alibaba is testing a new chip for AI inferencing and that a slew of highlighted Chinese companies are developing substitutes for Nvidia's H20 China chip. Nvidia said Wednesday that it made no sales of H20 chips into China in its most recent quarter and is still awaiting clarity on new regulations that would require it to send 15% of revenue from those sales to the US government.
Read more about Nvidia's stock moves and today's market action.
Late Thursday, Dell guided to third quarter earnings per share of $2.45, below the $2.55 expected, per LSEG estimates cited by CNBC. Dell accounts for over 2% of Nvidia's revenue on an annualized basis, according to Bloomberg estimates.
The server maker also accounts for roughly 1% of Broadcom's (AVGO) revenue, 3.6% of Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) revenue, and 3.7% of Micron's (MU) revenue, per Bloomberg data. Broadcom and AMD stock both fell over 3% on Friday.
The PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) fell about 3% on Friday and dropped more than 1% for the week.
The moves follow Nvidia's earnings report on Wednesday, which showed its data center business underperformed Wall Street's expectations in its latest quarter, while its future in China remains clouded by geopolitical uncertainty.
Nvidia's increasing reliance on a small handful of customers also raised concerns over the heavily concentrated AI market. Though Nvidia's fellow chip stocks recorded gains Thursday as the Nasdaq neared a fresh record, Nvidia shares fell nearly 1%.
China has pressured domestic companies not to use Nvidia's AI chips since Trump and the chipmaker outlined a deal for it to send the US government 15% of its revenue from China chip sales in exchange for export licenses. That revenue-sharing agreement has not been finalized, but Nvidia has been granted licenses to sell some of its H20 chips to China following a surprise ban in April.
CEO Jensen Huang stressed the importance of the Chinese AI market, which he sees as a rapidly growing $50 billion market opportunity, on the company's earnings call and in an interview with Yahoo Finance on Wednesday.",268dac49a66d071191328817de10887a,trafilatura

Alphabet (GOOGL) has announced its Google Cloud Universal Ledger (GCUL), a blockchain platform that will be available to businesses in 2026. It features similarities to Ripple's XRP Ledger (XRPL).
Similar to XRPL, GCUL is intended to be a distributed ledger for fintech institutions.
GCUL will have:
-
24/7 low-latency payments
-
Programmable asset tokenization
-
Institutional settlement infrastructure
-
Third-party wallet integration
-
APIs for financial automation
In fact, parts of Alphabet's technical docs mirror Ripple's decades-old messaging on XRPL.
Rick Woodman, the Head of Strategy at Google, called GCUL ""neutral infrastructure"" in a recent post.
He noted that even if financial institutions may be hesitant to build on the blockchains of competitors, any institution can take advantage of GCUL's ecosystem.
Key differences between Alphabet's and Ripple's blockchains
What makes it different is the scale of Alphabet's effort.
With a $2.5 trillion market capitalization, the parent company of Google is hundreds of billions of dollars above Ripple's combined valuation, and it has already partnered with CME Group, the world's largest options and futures exchange.
More news:
-

-

CME Group is testing asset tokenization on GCUL, something it never did with XRPL.
There are also stark differences between the two blockchains. Alphabet has not announced any plans for a token offering, unlike Ripple, which has done so on the XRPL network, which relies on its native token, XRP.
Related: What is blockchain? Explained
GCUL will be permissioned and private, while XRPL is open and has a decentralized model of validation. GCUL is written in Python, while the XRPL is written in C++.
David Schwartz, the Chief Technology Officer, recently stated that XRPL has struggled to process billions of dollars in banking transactions, despite having secured 300 financial partners over the past decade.

The suit was initially filed in May, accusing the company—famous for pivoting from software development into a full-time strategy of Bitcoin accumulation—of misleading investors about the impact new crypto accounting practices would have on its profitability.
This year, Strategy, which currently owns over $68 billion worth of BTC, switched to a fair value accounting standard that allowed it to record quarter-to-quarter swings in the price of held Bitcoin on its balance sheets.
Previously, the firm recorded its Bitcoin at original purchase cost; while it could write down drops in the token’s value as “impairment charges,” it could not mark up price increases unless tokens were sold off.
Investors who filed suits against Strategy and its leadership earlier this year argued the company misled them by overstating the positive impact this new accounting strategy would have on the firm’s profitability.
When Strategy announced a net loss of $4.22 billion in the first quarter of 2025—despite Bitcoin’s historic surge over the prior six months—shareholders began revolting.
But on Thursday, plaintiffs in one of the most prominent lawsuits against the company opted to voluntarily dismiss their claims. The jointly stipulated dismissal, filed in a federal court in eastern Virginia, where Strategy is based, was made with prejudice—meaning the claims cannot be made in court again.
Strategy Pushed ‘Deceptive’ Comparison to Apple and NVIDIA, Wall Street Veteran Says
Decrypt reached out to the plaintiffs’ attorneys asking why they had dropped their claims, or if any settlement had been reached with Strategy, but did not immediately receive a response.
In recent weeks, Strategy has faced other criticisms about how it presents its unorthodox business model to shareholders.Earlier this month, a prominent Wall Street advisor slammed the company for comparing its price-to-earnings ratio to the likes of Apple and Nvidia—a move that was “100% fraudulent,” the advisor said, because the company’s recent performance was driven by a “one-off” increase in Bitcoin’s price, not business fundamentals likely to recur.",a509f00fabef770daa744af8ca1e048e,trafilatura

Have I left it too late ? ,  I have almost no retirement saving : Im 57 and have $8K in my 401 ( k ) and $17K in my IRA . Have I left it too late ? ,2025-08-29 18:15:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"I read your column regularly. I’m hoping you might be able to give me some advice. I’m 57 and inherited some money last year. It enabled me to start saving the maximum in my 401(k) and in a Roth IRA. I have almost no retirement savings.
Currently, I have $8,000 in my 401(k) and $17,000 in my Roth IRA. I’m contributing $8,000 a year to both. I am using a $50,000 inherited IRA to fund the Roth by taking out about $5,000 per year over 10 years. To come up with the rest, I’m using my $3,000 annual bonus.
I plan to work until I’m 70, at which time I’ll start taking Social Security benefits and drawing down my retirement savings. I earn $50,000 a year. I live on $2,500 a month. I figure I’ll need at least $3,500 a month in retirement, which my Social Security and savings ought to provide.
$85K in a savings account
The wildcard: I have $85,000 in a high-interest savings account earning 4%. Several financial planners want to manage those assets in a taxable brokerage account, but I am reluctant to pay their fees. I would be comfortable using a robo adviser like I use with Vanguard for my IRAs.
I have $5,000 in emergency savings, which I’d like to increase to $15,000 or six months worth of living expenses. That would leave $70,000 to invest in a taxable brokerage account. I’m nervous and haven’t pulled the trigger on the brokerage account.
I like the guaranteed returns in the high-interest savings account, but I know I need to get this money into the market in order to supplement my retirement savings. The question is when and how much. All at once or a little at a time, to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging?
Saving money for retirement is a slow, laborious and often boring process, but it’s also hair-raising when the markets go through the kind of roller-coaster they experienced in April and, for many, it’s exciting to see their balance increase as the years go by.
The best approach is to keep doing what you’re doing. Set your contributions, make a plan for retirement, which you can revisit every couple of years, and live your life to the fullest. Including your high-yield savings account, you have $110,000 set aside.
You’re going to maximize your Social Security by waiting to claim it until you’re 70, and you’re planning to continue working. You can make a lot of progress in 13 years, especially given that you are now likely at your peak earning years.
The average Social Security income for retirees is around $2,000 so given your expenses and plan to keep working for the next 13 years, all going well, and your retirement pot — savings, 401(k) and IRA — you may not even have to withdraw the full 4% a year from your investments.
Comparison can be the enemy of motivation. To put your finances in some context: The average 401(k) balance for Generation X, those aged between 45 and 60 in 2025, is around $192,000, while the average IRA account is $104,000, according to Fidelity.
You’re now living on $2,500 a month, but say you will need $3,500 a month in retirement. You know your own lifestyle better than anyone, but that additional $1,000 represents a sizable chunk of your current income so I implore you to examine where that extra money is going.
Given your nerves about putting your remaining cash into the market, a dollar-cost averaging strategy, consistently investing a set amount of money at regular intervals, sounds like it could benefit you. The 4% savings account is barely keeping up with inflation. Aim for at least 7%.
You could gradually invest that $70,000 over 12-18 months using a robo adviser and, if there was a market correction like the one we experienced in April, you could double your monthly investment. It could also help get you used to the market’s sometimes capricious nature.
That $70,000 would be worth approximately $160,000 in 13 years, if you had a 6.5% return. With that same rate of return, your 401(k) would be worth around $203,000 and your Roth IRA would have $182,000 in aftertax funds. That gives you a grand total of $545,000.
Applying the 4% rule — withdrawing 4% the first year and adjusting that upwards to account for inflation in subsequent years — your retirement savings would last you 30 years (assuming you withdrew around $21,800 a year). That, plus Social Security, meets your goal.
Even with that 4% withdrawal rate, all things being equal — down years and up years balancing themselves out — your retirement fund would cross the $800,000 mark by your mid 90s. That assumes your theoretical 6.5% return outpaces your withdrawals.",9862539e714156178aa470ce167fd47e,trafilatura

With hash rate approaching the mythical zettahash milestone and miners increasingly diversifying their business models, the landscape is changing rapidly.

On the latest Mining Pod news roundup, Colin Harper, Charlie Spears, and Matt Kimmell discuss the latest developments in the mining industry and unpacked their implications.
Below is an edited transcript of the conversation.
Colin: Welcome back to The Mining Pod. Let’s start with the difficulty update. Matt, what’s happening in the mempool?
Matt: The mempool is dry as can be – there’s nothing to talk about on the fee front. But looking more broadly at difficulty, we had a very small increase last time around. We’re now 44% through this adjustment period and looking at a pretty steep rise – we’re set to go up 4.98% according to Hash Rate Index.
Bitcoin price is down from all-time highs a couple weeks ago when we touched $124,000. We’re down about 10% to $112,000. Hash price touched $60 on that all-time high day but went down to about $53. Now we’re back up closer to $55, but we’re set to have a difficulty increase of about 5% in about a week’s time.
Charlie: We’re just on the cusp of a zettahash. It’s going to happen here in the next few months – you can feel it. My subjective observation is that it’s cooler here in the central US than before. A lot of the hash rate is concentrated in Texas and Georgia, and it’s cooled off. If you had some minor curtailment during the day due to weather, I’d expect that curtailment to decline for the time being.
By which moving average do we say we’ve officially hit a zettahash? Are we looking at the seven-day or 30-day?
Matt: I would say seven-day, but the 30-day is when it’s been solidified. I actually advocate for the 14-day moving average because it theoretically tracks the difficulty adjustment period. Anything less than seven days I think is unserious.So we need a full difficulty adjustment where the average moving average of that difficulty adjustment indicates a zettahash. That’s the official metric we will celebrate on this show.
Colin: Let’s move to our first story – Griffin and Hut 8 surge after Reuters reports American Bitcoin could be trading in September. This seems like the biggest news today.
The article says it’s possible that American Bitcoin could be trading on public markets via its merger with Griffin Digital Mining as soon as September. The unlisted firm’s merger is said to be finalized shortly, and the goal is to start trading in early September according to Asher, the new CEO of Hut 8. That’s not a guarantee – could be later – but it’s looking like they have most of what they need. They’ve also broken ground on 1.5 gigawatts of expansion and are taking out a $303 million credit facility. They’ve got data center projects across Louisiana, Texas, and Illinois. Their stock has been surging.
When this news first broke, I was pondering what’s the real benefit of splitting off all these mining assets, taking an 80% stake in this new company when they used to own 100% of those assets. Now it’s making a lot of sense. If you can get excitement behind two stocks and have the business lines clearly delineated, it seems to be paying off. Hut 8 is chugging away on the infrastructure and data center side of things.
Matt: The benefit for American Bitcoin is that because of the merger, they get to sidestep the IPO process with the SEC, which can be a bit of a gauntlet. And the names involved – the Trump brothers, Winklevoss twins – it’s very 2025. They’re resurrecting these old zombie companies through reverse mergers and SPACs. This has the chance to be the meme asset that the Trump family maybe wanted their Solana token to be, just in the equity space.
We’re in IPO season again. The Circle one got a lot of people back engaged. This is the first real scaled mining IPO. The Avengers of American politics are getting together to put their names on this.
Colin: Alright, on to our next story on last week’s crypto ETP flows. Matt,what’s happening in the crypto ETP market?
Matt: The largest outflow from global exchange-traded products since March – $1.4 billion out. There was a bad jobs report and bad PPI inflation report, so everyone thought the Fed was going to keep interest rates where they were or maybe even hike. That hurt risk-on markets, particularly crypto.
Bitcoin has become an interest rate sensitive asset on short-term timeframes. We had Jackson Hole last week, which is kind of the Super Bowl of central banks. Powell came out and said it’s all about unemployment now – we care less about inflation – and signaled maybe we need to change our tune. Markets quickly reversed.
On a weekly scale, it’s the first time ever that ETH has been more of a preference. Month to date, ETH was positive $2.5 billion in versus Bitcoin’s $1 billion out. That’s a stark contrast given the market cap sizing differences. ETH has caught the narrative. You’ve got to hand it to Tom Lee, who’s been able to capture the Ethereum narrative.
Colin: Ok, let’s talk about IREN doubling its GPU fleet to 8,500 units.
IREN has secured $102 million in financing to pay back prior units it purchased. They now have 8,500 NVIDIA GPUs after purchasing 4,200 recently – some Blackwells, H200s, and H100s. This 4,200 Blackwell purchase cost them $193 million.
Interestingly, IREN, unlike other Bitcoin miners like Hut 8 or Core Scientific, they’re not doing the power shell model. They’re not just building massive facilities and trying to find a tenant to park GPUs. They’re actually going to rent out the compute themselves and operate in their own facilities. They recently joined NVIDIA’s marketplace as a cloud partner.
The market seems to like IREN’s strategy. The stock price has been absolutely ripping – up 43% over the last month and 188% over the last six months from the April lows.
It’s interesting to juxtapose this with Hut 8 – the power shell versus the neo-cloud model. We’re starting to see separation in strategies with these Bitcoin miners.
Charlie: Are there going to be any pure miners left by the end of the year? You’ve got to wonder. With CleanSpark, now that Zach’s out, they mentioned in some public statements they might look at it.
Matt: I think part of the second-order effect is higher hash rate concentration among the biggest public miners that are sticking to their old strategies. This story with IREN is interesting because they’re running a different type of strategy – buying and operating the GPUs themselves rather than just leasing space and power.
One of the hardest nuts to crack for a Bitcoin miner doing an AI strategy like IREN’s is actually finding a way to have sales pipelines for that compute. Miners don’t sell things – they buy things and run those things. They’re not typically salesmen. When you actually have to make sure you have an end buyer for what you’re deploying, that’s a pretty big operational hurdle.
Colin: Finally, let’s talk about Ocean Pool’s technical glitch. Charlie, what happened?
Charlie: Ocean dropped a tweet saying a huge miner switch to Ocean triggered a bug and its associated failsafe. No work was lost, but stats were impacted and payouts may be temporarily delayed.
Sometime overnight, Ocean’s dashboard flashed that it was estimating 300 exahash of hash rate pointed to itself. As the official account says, this was downstream of an interesting edge case when a large miner joined the pool.
This is a nice opportunity to talk about how when we discuss network hash rate, we’re really just talking about an estimation. Pools look at valid shares submitted by miners, which are shares of work above a certain difficulty. A pool can’t necessarily know exactly how much hash rate is pointed to it.
When you have giant variances and shifts in this, it can sometimes throw off software. Congrats to Ocean – it looks like they added maybe 4 to 5 EH/s more. They’re growing from launching at 500 petahash to now 15 EH/s. They’re still a minor part of the overall network hash rate, but this kind of idiosyncrasy of operating a pool made its rounds on social media.Charlie: Ocean uses the Datum protocol, which is similar to Stratum V2 in what it does. You need to run a Datum server between the mining farm and the pool, and it allows more direct participation in template construction. I imagine this particular weird idiosyncrasy with the hash rate spike had something to do with an edge case in Datum – probably a large miner coming online running a Datum server, and something about how Datum handles shares submitted.

You bought that truck thinking it was an investment, a tool to build your business. But markets shift, equipment depreciates, and sometimes the note outruns the value. That’s when you’re upside down—owing $90,000 on a truck that’s only worth $65,000 on the open market.
This situation isn’t rare. It happens when loans are stretched too long, down payments are too small, or resale values drop faster than expected. The stress is real because you can’t just sell the truck and walk away clean—the bank is still waiting for their money. If you’re upside down and need to sell, you have to know your options, the risks, and how to get out without destroying your business in the process.
How You End Up Upside Down
Let’s start with why so many carriers find themselves in this trap:
Long loan terms – Financing over 72–96 months makes payments affordable but keeps you paying down debt slower than the truck loses value.
Low or no down payment – Starting with zero equity means you’re underwater from day one.
Rapid depreciation – A new truck can lose 20–30% of its value in the first two years.
High mileage and wear – Trucks in heavy use depreciate even faster, especially if not maintained perfectly.
Market downturns – A weak freight market pushes resale values down because fewer buyers are looking for trucks.
Upside down doesn’t mean you failed—it means you’re in a position a lot of carriers end up in. The question is: what do you do now?
Why Selling Is Complicated
If you owe more than the truck is worth, selling it outright won’t cover the loan. Example:
Loan balance: $80,000
Truck resale value: $60,000
Buyer’s offer: $58,000
You can sell it, but the lender isn’t releasing the title until the full $80,000 is paid. That leaves you with a $22,000 gap to cover. Until that balance is settled, the deal doesn’t close. That’s why so many carriers can feel trapped.
Option 1 – Cover the Gap Out of Pocket
The cleanest, though often hardest, option is writing a check for the difference. Using the example above, you’d pay $22,000 to close the gap, hand over the truck, and walk away free.
The upside: you’re out of the truck, you clear the loan, and your credit remains intact. The downside: you need cash reserves, and most owner-operators don’t have that kind of money sitting around.
If you’ve been disciplined with a maintenance or savings reserve, this is the fastest path forward.
Option 2 – Trade It In
Dealers often let you trade an upside-down truck into a newer one, rolling the negative equity into the next loan. For example, if you owe $20,000 more than the truck’s worth, they tack that $20,000 onto your new financing.
The upside: you unload the truck without writing a big check. The downside: you just transferred your problem into the future. Now your new loan starts upside down, often with even worse terms.
This option only makes sense if you can negotiate a strong deal on the new truck and the payment structure still leaves room for profit. Otherwise, you’re digging a deeper hole.
Option 3 – Negotiate With the Lender
Lenders don’t want repossessions—they want to get paid. If you approach them early, some will work with you to structure a settlement. Options may include:
Short sale approval – The lender agrees to accept less than the full balance if you find a buyer.
Payment plan for the difference – They let you sell the truck and then pay the leftover balance in installments.
Settlement offer – If you can offer a lump sum (even if it’s less than the full gap), many lenders would rather close the file than chase you.
This only works if you’re proactive. Wait until they’re chasing you, and your leverage is gone.
Option 4 – Refinance or Restructure
If you want to keep the truck but can’t manage the note, refinancing might give you breathing room. Extending the loan or lowering the interest rate can shrink payments and keep you from having to sell.
The risk: extending terms can make depreciation worse, keeping you upside down longer. Refinancing only makes sense if you have a clear path to use that breathing room for growth and reserve building—not just survival.
Option 5 – Voluntary Surrender
This is the last resort. You hand the truck back to the lender and walk away. But don’t be fooled—this is not a free pass. Here’s what happens:
The lender auctions the truck for less than it’s worth.
You’re still responsible for the “deficiency balance”—the difference between the auction price and your loan.
Your credit takes a major hit, making future financing almost impossible.
Voluntary surrender is better than repossession, but it’s still damaging. Only go this route if every other door is closed.
How to Survive the Upside-Down Moment
If you’re facing this situation, survival comes down to strategy:
Get the payoff amount in writing – Know exactly what you owe before you explore options.
Research your truck’s market value – Don’t guess. Get appraisals or dealer quotes.
Know the gap – Subtract market value from payoff to see what you’re up against.
Contact your lender early – Waiting makes things worse. The sooner you talk, the more flexible they’ll be.
Don’t rush into another bad loan – Trading into a worse deal just pushes the problem forward.
Build reserves – Even if you’re forced to carry the truck longer, stack cash so you have options when the time comes.
Using the Lesson to Build Smarter
Being upside down teaches tough but valuable lessons:
Always put money down.
Match loan terms to the truck’s real earning lifespan.
Treat every financing decision as a business move, not an emotional one.
Build a reserve fund big enough to cover a worst-case scenario.
The goal is not just to get out of this upside-down situation—it’s to make sure it never happens again.
Final Word
Selling a truck when you owe more than it’s worth is one of the toughest positions an owner-operator can face. The pressure is real, but there are options. Whether it’s covering the gap, negotiating with your lender, or restructuring your strategy, the key is facing the numbers head-on.
The worst move is pretending it will fix itself. Trucks depreciate fast, lenders don’t wait, and the longer you sit in denial, the fewer options you have. If you handle the upside-down moment with discipline and honesty, you can survive it, protect your credit, and reset your business on stronger ground.
In trucking, every mistake is expensive—but it doesn’t have to be final. Use this lesson to build smarter, finance better, and make sure next time you’re the one in control—not the bank.",0ecc315cdccd0ba4835af080dfba48f9,trafilatura

OpenAI, Meta in talks with Reliance in India
OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.
OpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot’s defamatory hallucinations
Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”
OpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models
OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.
OpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1
OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.
OpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago
Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.
OpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all.
OpenAI launches new tools to help businesses build AI agents
OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.
OpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’
OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.
ChatGPT can directly edit your code
The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.
ChatGPT’s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases
According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.
February 2025
OpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release
OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.
ChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed
A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.
OpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process
In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.
You can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in
OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.
OpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’
OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.
January 2025
OpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion
OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.
OpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model
OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”
ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says
A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.
OpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies
OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.
More teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults
Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.
OpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days
OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.
OpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously
OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.
OpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan
Operator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.
OpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups
OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.
ChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks
ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.
New ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’
OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.
FAQs:
What is ChatGPT? How does it work?

A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.
What does GPT mean in ChatGPT?
GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.
What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?
A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.
ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.
Can ChatGPT write essays?
Yes.
Can ChatGPT commit libel?
Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.
We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.
Does ChatGPT have an app?
Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.
What is the ChatGPT character limit?
It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.
Does ChatGPT have an API?
Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.
What are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?
Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.
What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?
Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.
How good is ChatGPT at writing code?
It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.
Can you save a ChatGPT chat?
Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.
Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?
Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.
How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?
OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.
The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.
In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”
What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?
Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.
An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.
CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.
Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.
There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.
Where can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?
Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.
Can ChatGPT be detected?
Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best.
Are ChatGPT chats public?
No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.
What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?
None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.
Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?
Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.

Recent data from CryptoQuant shows the total value of stablecoin holdings on crypto exchanges has reached a new all-time high of $68 billion on August 22 this year. Additional statistics show the global stablecoin market capitalization is valued at over $280 billion.
But while the growth of stablecoins is helping the crypto sector mature, banks and traditional financial institutions have begun expressing concerns.
The Financial Times recently reported that banks are pushing to change new U.S. stablecoin rules over the uncertainty of trillions of dollars’ worth of outflows.
Banks have also taken note of the GENIUS Act, which prohibits issuers from paying yield to customers using stablecoins. However, crypto exchanges will continue to indirectly offer interest and rewards to stablecoin holders, creating competition between banks and exchanges that provide access to stablecoins.
Charles Wayn, co-founder of Web3 growth platform Galxe, told Cryptonews that he believes this is a main concern for banks.
“Users deposit their stablecoins onto a crypto exchange and earn a superior yield to what is available on traditional bank accounts. The GENIUS Act further makes this a more compelling offering than it was previously because of the added consumer protections and backing guarantees,” Wayn said.
As a result, many banks are now fearful that an uneven playing field exists between traditional finance and offerings by crypto exchanges.
On the other hand, Wayn pointed out that banks still possess some advantages over crypto exchanges when it comes to stablecoins.
“Crypto exchanges don’t offer the same protection as FDIC insurance, so banks still have an advantage in terms of public perception,” he said.
Adding to this, James Smith, co-founder of digital asset platform Elliptic, told Cryptonews that in jurisdictions like the U.S., regulations are emerging that require stablecoin issuers to hold reserves with federally regulated banks.
As such, Smith noted this creates a new client segment for banks. However, this also results in a compliance obligation, since those banks must conduct due diligence on issuers and tokens.
Given the pros and cons associated with stablecoins and traditional finance, industry experts believe that banks should embrace these digital assets rather than fear them.
“It’s become clear that banks can’t afford to sit on the sidelines,” Smith said. “Stablecoins are here to stay, and banks should, at a minimum, be prepared to provide custody, payments, or reserve services.”
In order to advance this concept, Smith explained that Elliptic has launched the first of its kind “Stablecoin Risk Management Suite.” This is designed specifically for banks and financial institutions looking to integrate stablecoins.
Smith explained that the risk management platform was developed in partnership with Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) to meet high regulatory standards. This will also provide banks with confidence to integrate stablecoins into their operations without adding friction.
“The first product is called ‘Issuer Due Diligence,’ which allows G-SIB banks to perform address-level analysis, monitor issuer wallets over time, and detect illicit activity with the same precision they expect when onboarding any counterparty,” Smith noted.
Smith added that while some banks—like JPMorgan Chase—may already issue their own stablecoin offerings, many others may focus on servicing the reserves of established issuers. “This will ultimately depend on each bank’s strategy and regulatory realities,” he said.
While Elliptic’s offering may appeal to some, other financial institutions may wish to take a hybrid approach.
For instance, Wayn noted that while JP Morgan’s venture into stablecoins shows that launching permissioned deposit tokens for large institutional clients can be a successful strategy for banks, retail adoption also needs to be considered.
“For retail and cross-platform commerce, tried-and-tested public stablecoins are the best way forward, because they already have the scale, interoperability, and brand recognition required to support this mainstream push,” Wayn said.
Therefore, a stablecoin strategy that focuses on both institutions and retail customers may be best for banks moving forward.
In the meantime, Wayn remarked that banks concerned about losing deposits to higher-yielding stablecoin products should also focus on improving their own offerings.
“This could include offering higher yields on their savings accounts, better perks like discounts, cashback offers or points, sign-up bonuses, and loyalty programs to attract new customers and retain existing ones. In short, it’s time for banks to try some innovative customer engagement strategies.”
While it’s becoming clear that banks can’t afford to ignore stablecoin innovation, a number of challenges remain—even with current integration solutions.
Dave Hendricks, CEO and founder of RWA tokenization platform Vertalo, told Cryptonews that the issuance of stablecoins presents banks with a major dilemma.
“Banks need to think about whether or not they should build their own tech to issue stablecoins, or partner with existing stablecoin companies like Circle,” Hendricks said. “Because bank-issued stablecoins, by law, cannot pay interest to depositors, banks need to decide whether they want to incur CapEx to offer an unattractive retail product, or just create something to facilitate interbank payments.”
Given this, Hendricks pointed out that it’s possible many banks won’t be first-movers into the stablecoin market as they calculate the cost of building technology to issue their own stablecoins versus the lower cost and risk of partnering.
“Personally, I hope that banks that choose to enter this arena don’t make the rookie mistake of trying to build this internally, and instead work with existing technology providers to accelerate speed-to-market while reducing CapEx, risk, and distraction from traditional operations,” Hendricks said.
Hendricks added that while banks and traditional financial institutions may be forced to adopt stablecoins to stay relevant, he believes that many of these institutions will not have the capital or technology to effectively participate in this movement.
Wayn further remarked that for banks to issue their own stablecoins, the regulatory compliance costs would be much higher than for specialized issuers.
“That’s not to say they won’t—many are considering it and JPMorgan is already ahead of the curve—but they will remain niche products designed for their high-net-worth customers, rather than mainstream retail applications.”
While no major banks have fully launched their own stablecoin offerings, many U.S. banks, including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Citigroup, are exploring stablecoin integrations.

It's been a real pleasure writing to you each day, but I'm delighted to say your usual host, Dan DeFrancesco, returns from parental leave next week.
Not to worry, this isn't quite goodbye. I'll be back in your inbox on Labor Day, and I'll continue working behind the scenes on this newsletter.
Oh, and do keep in touch — whether it's feedback, questions, or recommendations for a decent pint in London. I'm at your service.
Meta is in a race against time. And there's not long left on the clock. Meta's Superintelligence Labs is under pressure to release one of its first projects by year-end, according to insiders who spoke with BI.
This team has been one to watch. Assembled with urgency, Mark Zuckerberg spared no expense, cherry-picking the very best talent. In June, Meta spent a staggering $14 billion to acquire nearly half of Scale AI — then promptly put its 28-year-old cofounder in charge of the Superintelligence push.
That's just the tip of the iceberg. Meta has reportedly dangled compensation packages worth hundreds of millions to lure elite researchers from companies like OpenAI and Google DeepMind.
But that strategy has rubbed some Meta employees the wrong way. As one former Meta researcher said, watching outsiders walk in with 10 to 50 times the compensation made some longtime staff feel like failures.
Unsurprisingly, tensions are flaring.
Some workers are threatening to jump ship to rivals. Others say they will quit on the spot to try to force Meta into negotiations.
And so, less than two months after its launch, the cracks are beginning to show in Meta's Superintelligence Labs. At least eight employees have already left — including some who'd barely unpacked. Two OpenAI engineers reportedly lasted less than a month.
We've seen the superstar hires. We've seen the eye-watering price tags. What we haven't seen? Results.
When Meta rolled out its Llama 4 AI models in April, the crowd went mild. Developers felt it underdelivered in key areas like coding, reasoning, and following instructions.
Now, BI's Jyoti Mann exclusively reports that the team is scrambling to fix the bugs, revive the product, and ship the next-gen release: Llama 4.X.
3 things in markets
Wall Street remains bullish on Nvidia even after a lukewarm reaction to earnings. Despite beating second-quarter revenue and earnings, the vibes were tepid at best. Shares immediately slid 4% in the after-market before slightly recovering. Wall Street is shrugging that off, though, with five banks raising their price targets on the stock.

Realty Income is the largest net lease REIT and has a reliable dividend history.
-
Realty Income is a great business, but there's a competitor that might be a better choice right now.
-
With a similar yield and more growth opportunity, this 5.5%-yielding net lease REIT gives you almost everything Realty Income offers, but also a little more.
Realty Income (NYSE: O) is a smart dividend stock to buy today. It has a high yield, an attractive business model, and a history of rewarding income investors well. But there could be a smarter option in the net lease real estate investment trust (REIT) niche. Here's what you need to know about why Realty Income is attractive, and why its smaller peer could be even more attractive.
What does a net lease REIT do?
Realty Income is the largest net lease REIT by a wide margin. It is more than three times the size of the next runner-up, W.P. Carey (NYSE: WPC), based on market cap. Looking at size in a different way, Realty Income owns over 16,600 properties, compared to W.P. Carey's roughly 1,600 properties.
Being large gives a net lease REIT an advantage, because it allows easier access to capital markets. That's notable because net leases are, for the most part, financing transactions for the seller. Essentially, a company sells property it owns and then leases it back, with a long-term lease that includes regular rent escalators. But the seller agrees to pay for most property-level operating costs, which gives it effective control of the property. A net lease REIT like Realty Income or W.P. Carey gets a reliable tenant, a low-maintenance property, and a long lease. It's pretty close to a win/win arrangement.
If you like owning the biggest and best, Realty Income is a smart net lease REIT to buy. Notably, it has hiked its dividend annually for three decades while W.P. Carey reset its dividend lower in 2023. And yet, smaller W.P. Carey could actually be the smarter buy right now.
Why W.P. Carey could be the smarter choice
The first thing to address with W.P. Carey is the dividend reset. In 2023, it exited the office property niche, which necessitated a reset because of the size of the office portfolio it owned. The move was strategic, given the occupancy troubles office properties are facing. It is using the cash it raised from the exit to buy more industrial, warehouse, and retail properties. This is where the opportunity with W.P. Carey starts to shine through.
Realty Income is heavily focused on retail assets, with nearly 75% of its rents coming from that sector. W.P. Carey's portfolio is tilted toward industrial and warehouse assets, which make up around two-thirds of the REIT's rents. There's nothing wrong with retail properties, which are easy to buy, sell, and release. But industrial properties and warehouses, which tend to be larger assets, are likely to see more benefit from reshoring activity in the years ahead. And both properties have generally benefited from higher rent bumps in recent years than have been seen in retail assets.",ed8633f346a7bea9f6bb263b46d5aeb6,trafilatura

Options Traders Are Betting Nvidia Stock Will Move This Much After Earnings
On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, Molina Healthcare stock has significantly underperformed, with its stock declining 39.5%, whereas the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has gained 10.2%. Over the past 52 weeks, MOH has slipped 49.7%, while the benchmark rose 15.2% over the same stretch.
Narrowing the focus, MOH stock has also trailed behind the SPDR S&P Health Care Services ETF (XHS), which tracks the healthcare services sector. XHS rose 9% in 2025, while remaining flat with around 0.1% gains over the past year.
MOH stock’s recent decline stems largely from intensifying medical cost pressures across its core government-backed health insurance segments, including Medicaid, Medicare, and ACA Marketplace plans. These elevated costs have outpaced premium revenue increases, diminishing profitability and triggering a downward revision of full-year adjusted EPS guidance to at least $19.
In the Q2 2025 earnings report, released on July 23 after the bell, Molina Healthcare generated revenue of $11.4 billion, up 15.7% year-over-year (YoY). However, adjusted EPS came in at $5.48, down 6.5% annually. MOH stock slipped nearly 17% in the subsequent trading session.
For the current fiscal year, ending in December 2025, analysts expect Molina’s EPS to decline 18.1% YoY to $18.56, on a diluted basis. The company has a mixed earnings surprise history overall. While it surpassed the Street’s bottom-line projections in two of the trailing four quarters, it missed the EPS estimates in the other two.
Overall, Wall Street appears cautious about MOH stock, with a consensus “Hold” rating - a downgrade from a “Moderate Buy” rating. Of the 17 analysts currently offering recommendations, four advise a “Strong Buy,” 11 give a “Hold,” one has a “Moderate Sell” rating, and the remaining one has a “Strong Sell” rating.",34d0c6b8699f80958f6dc142057589f1,trafilatura

Mark Cuban became a billionaire by starting and selling multiple businesses. However, you might know him from the hit TV show Shark Tank on ABC. Hosts on the popular reality series are shrewd negotiators and savvy investors looking to place bets on the best startup ideas pitched by contestants.
However, in a 2022 interview, Cuban revealed that his broad suite of investments on the show had made a net loss.
“I’ve gotten beat,” the billionaire told the Full Send podcast. Cuban deployed millions of dollars over hundreds of episodes of the show since 2009, before announcing in fall 2024 that he would step down after 16 seasons.
This rare sneak peek behind the scenes of the reality TV show offers ordinary savers and investors three key lessons.
1. Startups are risky
The type of investment popularized by shows like Shark Tank can best be described as angel investing, venture capital, or startup investing. This is because the ideas presented on the show are usually from early-stage companies with a short track record and an eye-catching idea rather than an established business.
In this asset class, Cuban’s track record isn’t unusual. According to data from San Francisco-based research organization Startup Genome, 90% of startups fail.
Making safer bets on investments
The high-risk nature of startup investing can be a thrill for high-net-worth investors like Cuban, who have well-diversified portfolios and lots of assets to play with. But for the average investor who is looking for a secure retirement, it’s better to consider guaranteed returns and low-risk investing.
A certificate of deposit (CD) is a low-risk savings account that could earn as much interest as a high-yield savings account, possibly more. However, to earn that higher rate, you’ll have to park your money in the account for a certain period of time.
One of the best ways to save is to make the most of your daily purchases — and you can do that by downloading the Acorns app.
With Acorns, whenever you make a purchase with your linked debit or credit card, the app automatically rounds up the total cost to the nearest dollar and invests the change in a diversified portfolio. You can also link these investments to your IRA, so you’re maximizing your retirement savings with every purchase you make.
Instead of focusing on early-stage companies with lofty expectations of future returns, everyday investors could turn their attention to established firms with robust track records.
For instance, Cuban acquired a majority stake in the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks for $285 million from real estate developer Ross Perot Jr. — 20 years after the brand had been established. It would go on to be one of his most successful investments.
Similarly, you can pick beaten-down or overlooked companies with a long track record. Nike, for instance, has lost a lot of its value since 2021. This stock might still be in a better position than many unprofitable and overvalued startups with flimsy business models.
Stock picking is also notoriously risky — but there are ways to make safer bets and benefit from the wisdom of experts.
Moby, an investment advice platform, can help you reduce the guesswork when selecting stocks and ETFs. In four years, across almost 400 stock picks, Moby's recommendations have beaten the S&P 500 by almost 12%, on average.
However, another key lesson from Cuban’s investing history is that he spreads his money across different bets.
3. Diversification is important
Cuban’s portfolio stretches far beyond the companies he selected on Shark Tank. His company has stakes in various firms, ranging from affordable generic drug companies to tech and entertainment companies. This well-diversified approach could be one of the reasons why the entrepreneur has continued to build wealth despite several missteps and failed ventures along the way.
The lesson for ordinary investors is clear: diversify.
Here are ways to diversify your portfolio outside of the stock market, including investing in real estate, commodities and fine art.
Real estate
Real estate remains a booming market, and investors as prestigious as Warren Buffett recommend putting your money to work in this asset class.
For those interested in further diversification through commercial properties, First National Realty Partners (FNRP) provides accredited investors with access to necessity-based commercial real estate investments with a minimum investment of $50,000.
Simply answer a few questions – including how much you would like to invest – to start browsing their full list of available properties.
However, owning a share of a project or property this way holds some risk — for instance, you could receive no returns and these assets are often illiquid. Speak to a professional if this investment is right for you, especially if you are retired or close to retirement.
New investing platforms are also making it easier than ever to tap into the residential real estate market.
For accredited investors, Homeshares gives access to the $36 trillion U.S. home equity market, which has historically been the exclusive playground of institutional investors.
With a minimum investment of $25,000, investors can gain direct exposure to hundreds of owner-occupied homes in top U.S. cities through their U.S. Home Equity Fund — without the headaches of buying, owning or managing property.
Backed by world-class investors like Jeff Bezos, Arrived makes it easy to fit these properties into your investment portfolio regardless of your income level. Their flexible investment amounts and simplified process allows accredited and non-accredited investors to take advantage of this inflation-hedging asset class without any extra work on your part.
Gold
Gold remains a solid performer and the backbone of many wealthy investors’ portfolios. In fact, its steady performance is a byword for investors. During the market crash in 2008, gold prices rose, cushioning the portfolios of investors who were savvy enough to diversify with this commodity.
One way to invest in gold that also provides significant tax advantages is to open a gold IRA with the help of Thor Metals.
Gold IRAs allow investors to hold physical gold or gold-related assets within a retirement account, thereby combining the tax advantages of an IRA with the protective benefits of investing in gold, making it an attractive option for those looking to potentially hedge their retirement funds against economic uncertainties.

Fine art
The global art market saw significant growth in 2023, with a further 20% increase predicted for 2025, according to a report by Art Basel and UBS. If you’ve ever dreamed of owning an iconic piece of art, you may have thought that you’d have to be a billionaire like Cuban first.
However, platforms like Masterworks are democratizing the ownership and sale of artworks.

PARIS -Annual cognac revenues dropped 13%, hit by a drop in demand for premium ranges of the French brandy and a slump in sales to China, according to industry data shared with Reuters.
After strong growth during the pandemic and a series of hefty price increases amid rising inflation, demand for cognac has been in decline for the past two years.
Extra pressure has come from an anti-dumping probe in China and tariff threats from the United States - the $3 billion industry's two most important markets.
While the industry, led by LVMH's Hennessy, Remy Martin and Pernod Ricard's Martell cognac houses, headed off permanent Chinese import duties via a price pledge this summer, it has so far failed in its bid to escape a general 15% U.S. import levy.
Cognac shipments fell 4.2% by volume to 154.6 million bottles in the year to July 31, while revenues dropped 13.4% to 2.7 billion euros ($3.1 billion), according to the data compiled by France's BNIC cognac industry body.
The steeper decline in value reflected a shift to younger, entry-level cognac, where shipments rose 2.6%, while the luxury VSOP and XO categories fell 11.3% and 12.9% respectively.
Exports to China plunged 24.4%, mainly hit by Beijing's anti-dumping investigation, which took full effect from October when provisional duties were imposed. The BNIC said it was too early to tell whether a deal in July that suspended the duties for most cognac makers would reverse the trend.
North American revenues fell 4.6% despite a slight increase in volumes shipped to the U.S. as producers shifted to lower-priced bottles.
European revenues fell 11%.
Shipments to other countries rose 19.9% by volume as producers sought to reduce their reliance on the U.S. and China. But these markets remained relatively small, accounting for 17.5 million bottles exported in the period.

Nvidia is facing regulatory pressure from the US and China. It has not resumed shipments of H20, even though certain China-based customers were granted a licence, because Washington asked for a 15 per cent cut of H20 revenue without ""publishing a regulation codifying such requirement"", it said.
Meanwhile, the Chinese government has become another obstacle, ""questioning whether our H20 products have built-in vulnerabilities"". The company said none of its graphics processing units contain back doors.

-
Invesco QQQ Trust is up 11.5% so far in 2025, beating the S&P 500's gain of 9.6%.
-
The technology-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust owns some of the most notable names in the market today.
-
The ETF's technology exposure could be a bigger problem than it is a benefit if there is a bear market.
Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ) has been attracting a lot of attention from investors, noting that it has a huge $360 billion in net assets. It is easily one of the largest exchange-traded funds (ETFs) an investor can buy into, and, clearly, investors are happily buying shares in it. There are two big reasons for that, but one of those reasons is also a potential warning sign. Here's what you need to know.
What does Invesco QQQ Trust do?
As an index-tracking exchange-traded fund, Invesco QQQ Trust basically just mirrors the performance and characteristics of whatever index it follows. The index in this situation is the Nasdaq-100. It's a fairly straightforward index to understand, given that it tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial companies that trade on the Nasdaq exchange. The holdings are market-cap weighted, as is the index.
The expense ratio for Invesco QQQ Trust is a bit high for an ETF at 0.2%. That's a potential problem, given that the ETF industry is largely focused on offering low fees. For example, some S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) tracking ETFs have expense ratios as low as 0.03%.
However, given the strong recent performance (more on this in a second), some investors might be willing to overlook the higher costs here. The holdings are rebalanced quarterly, and the portfolio is reconstituted annually.
Why is Invesco QQQ Trust so interesting right now?
The first big attraction to Invesco QQQ Trust in 2025 is its performance. That's a big one for investors, who as a group tend to flock to strongly performing investment ideas. The lemming-like approach on Wall Street can, at times, lead to investments advancing well beyond what would be reasonable, given the underlying facts of the investment.
To be fair, Invesco QQQ Trust's outperformance versus the broader S&P 500 index isn't huge on an absolute basis. As the chart highlights, the ETF is up around 11.5% so far in 2025 compared to an advance of 9.6% for Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO), one of the most popular S&P trackers.
That's ""only"" 1.9 percentage points. But on a percentage basis, that's nearly 20% outperformance. That's a huge difference on Wall Street, and it is the type of thing that will garner investor attention.",6ac58676f10926989feb1473a5c675f0,trafilatura

Shares of the company were up 14% in premarket trading.
Snowflake is benefiting from the acceleration in AI software adoption and higher spending from enterprises looking to modernize data infrastructure.
With more organizations beginning to explore their GenAI strategies and build GenAI-powered apps, analysts expect Snowflake to be a natural choice for customers looking to simplify AI stacks for analytics.
Snowflake's cloud-agnostic platform enables organizations to host and manage AI models from various cloud providers in a single, centralized environment.
Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure showed the fastest growth among Snowflake's supported clouds, seeing an acceleration of 40% from last year, CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy said on a post-earnings call.
""Microsoft is very strong in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and we're seeing a good uptick in our EMEA business with some large accounts,"" Ramaswamy added.
In July, Microsoft forecast a record $30 billion in capital spending for the current fiscal first quarter, after booming sales in the Azure cloud computing business showcased growing returns on its massive bets on AI.
Snowflake expects annual product revenue of $4.40 billion, compared with its prior forecast of $4.33 billion.
For the second quarter ended July 31, Snowflake posted product revenue of $1.09 billion, in line with estimates, according to data compiled by LSEG.
Remaining performance obligations — the most popular measure of booked revenue — came in at $6.9 billion, a 33% growth from last year.

AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN), headquartered in Cambridge, England, is a leading global biopharmaceutical company with a major role in the oncology sector. Its cancer portfolio covers lung, breast, gastric, and gastroesophageal cancers, with key drugs including Tagrisso, Imfinzi, Calquence, Lynparza, and Enhertu.
In the first half of 2025, AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN)’s oncology sales reached nearly $12 billion, up 16% year-over-year, driven by strong demand across its core therapies. New launches such as Truqap for breast cancer and Datroway for EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer have also expanded its market presence, solidifying its position among the best cancer stocks to watch.
Regulatory and clinical progress further reinforced momentum. The FDA granted Priority Review for Imfinzi in early-stage and locally advanced gastric and gastroesophageal cancers, with a decision expected in late 2025. Positive Phase III results were reported for Enhertu (DESTINY-Breast09), Imfinzi (MATTERHORN), and camizestrant (SERENA-6), strengthening the business’s late-stage pipeline. Enhertu also showed the ability to delay breast cancer progression by 14 months, signaling potential label expansion.

Dive Brief:

Walmart's U.S. store-fulfilled delivery sales jumped nearly 50% last quarter amid the retailer's ongoing push to accelerate shipping speeds, EVP and CFO John David Rainey said on an earnings call last week.
-
About one-third of deliveries from stores in recent weeks arrived in three hours or less, with 20% of that portion arriving to customers in 30 minutes or less, according to Rainey.
-
""We see billions and billions of units at a high growth rate being delivered same day and within same day from our store deliveries,"" Walmart U.S. President and CEO John Furner said on the call.
Dive Insight:
Faster deliveries leveraging stores have been a priority for Walmart amid deepening competition with Amazon, another company working to accelerate shipping speeds. Rainey said in a follow-up investor call last week that the push is worth it, as quick deliveries lead to more frequent orders from shoppers.
""As they realize that they can get those things that they want and need right away, we see that repeat purchasing behavior, which makes the share gains that we have very sticky,"" Rainey said.
Technological progress will also strengthen the consumer delivery experience, Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon said on the earnings call. For example, tapping more into artificial intelligence could help the company boost the accuracy of its ""dynamic delivery windows,"" which it will offer to 95% of U.S. households by the end of the year. Walmart's dynamic delivery algorithm analyzes local conditions to determine the most efficient driver routes and the estimated time of arrival for an order.
""One of the things that we've obviously got is a ton of data and it's not just product catalog data these days, it's delivery data,"" McMillon said. ""It's real-time data. And the way that we can put that to work to understand the context in which someone's shopping is really exciting to think about.""
The dynamic delivery window expansion aligns with Walmart's aim to reach 95% of the country in under three hours by the year's end. The retailer is currently at 93%, according to Furner.
Walmart is also working to boost delivery speeds for third-party sellers leveraging its fulfillment capabilities. Walmart Fulfillment Services now provides next-day delivery coverage in major U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Houston and Atlanta, according to a Tuesday news release.",7bb18c93fdd2ab7a3d9918ca1561a327,trafilatura

International Electric Power is planning to develop a 944-MW behind-the-meter, gas-fired plant to power a data center being developed in Greene County, Pennsylvania, according to a project partner’s Wednesday announcement. The data center will be “supplemented by battery storage and back up from an existing interconnection with the electric grid,” the companies said.
-
IEP is a privately held thermal and renewable power developer. Essential Utilities, a publicly-held company, informed the Securities and Exchange Commission it would be investing $26 million in the project to develop a water treatment facility for the power plant and data center.
-
Greene County Chairman Jared Edgreen told Utility Dive the county is aware of the project and sees it as “a large step forward. ... We need to diversify what we have in the county,” he said. “Energy is at a premium.”
Dive Insight:
IEP is “proposing a pretty big complex,” Green County administrator Jeffrey Marshall said. He added that a lot of data centers are looking at behind-the-meter generation “versus going through the whole PJM process.”
Most of the approvals needed for the new plant will be handled at the state and federal level, Marshall said.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in February launched a review of issues related to colocating large loads, such as data centers, at power plants in PJM’s footprint. That review is ongoing.
Meanwhile PJM has also launched a fast-track stakeholder process to develop rules for interconnecting data centers.
The announcement Wednesday focused on Essential’s investment, as well as its subsidiaries’ involvement.
Essential subsidiary Peoples is the the largest gas utility in Pennsylvania and will provide gas consulting services and energy management services to the project, the company said. Through its subsidiary Aqua, the company will build and operate a water treatment plant to service the power plant and data center, using the adjacent Monongahela River.
The partnership allows Essential to “leverage our expertise both in water and natural gas and highlights our capabilities as we work with hyperscalers to facilitate the growth of data centers,” Essential CEO and Chairman Chris Franklin said in a statement.
In another SEC filing, Essential said it has entered into agreements with IEP Hummingbird Energy LLC and International Electric Power III.",1687ba0d27057ac7b557e2070563ec1b,trafilatura

Some healthcare stocks can be great dividend growth options thanks to their stable businesses.
-
Despite Novo Nordisk's recent setbacks, it remains a leader in its niche and boasts a deep pipeline.
-
Amgen is developing several important medicines that should allow it to overcome patent cliffs.
The healthcare industry is a good place to look for strong dividend-paying stocks. Many companies in the sector offer products that are consistently in demand, regardless of the state of the economy. When the going gets tough and consumers tighten their purse strings, some medical products are likely to be among the last things they decide to cut back on.
That's why some healthcare companies continue to generate somewhat consistent earnings over the long run, even if they face their own challenges. Of course, just any corporation in the sector won't do, but let's consider two top healthcare, or, more specifically, pharmaceutical players that are also excellent dividend payers: Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) and Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN).
1. Novo Nordisk
Novo Nordisk has encountered several clinical setbacks over the past year. The company's financial results have also failed to meet market expectations. However, the sell-off has gone too far, making Novo Nordisk's shares attractive. The drugmaker's revenue in the first half of the year increased by 16% year-over-year to 154.9 billion Danish kroner ($24.1 billion), which remains a strong performance for a pharmaceutical giant.
The company is also making progress on its pipeline. It recently earned approval for Wegovy in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). It became the first GLP-1 therapy -- and the second overall -- approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for this disease, which affects millions of patients in the U.S. alone. Novo Nordisk is awaiting approval for Wegovy in Mash in other countries as well.
Further, the Denmark-based drugmaker could also launch an oral formulation of Wegovy in weight management. It would be the first time an oral medicine is indicated to target obesity. Given that it is easier and cheaper to manufacture oral pills than subcutaneous injections, and considering that many patients prefer this form, the new version of Wegovy could achieve some success.
Novo Nordisk's drug discovery engine is not broken, despite the setbacks it experienced over the past year. The company's deep pipeline, which it has been enhancing recently, should lead to more regulatory breakthroughs and approvals, resulting in consistent revenue and earnings growth. Lastly, the company is a solid dividend stock. Its forward yield of 3% is significantly higher than the S&P 500's average of 1.3%, and it has increased its dividends by 296.2% over the past decade. The stock remains a worthwhile investment, particularly at current levels, for long-term income seekers.",1ecbb6f63940c8fdb9185fdc6e4200a9,trafilatura

Options Traders Are Betting Nvidia Stock Will Move This Much After Earnings
Over the past 52 weeks, WTW has climbed 14.6%, slightly underperforming the S&P 500 Index ($SPX), which rose 15.2% over the same period. Year-to-date (YTD), the stock has surged 5.4%, lagging the broader index’s gain of 10.2%.
However, WTW stock continues to demonstrate resilience within its sector, outperforming the S&P Insurance ETF SPDR (KIE), which posted a 6.7% gain over the past year and a 4.5% rise on a YTD basis.
On Aug. 19, WTW stock inched up by 1.8%, gaining $5.88, when Willis announced the launch of Gemini, the first digital facility designed to deliver sustainable capacity locally to clients across their insurance portfolios. Gemini aims to tackle growing market volatility and the increasing complexity of risk, offering clients more confidence in outcomes under challenging conditions. The platform is supported by Lloyds Banking Group plc’s (LYG) syndicates, aligns with the local lead market for coverage, claims, and premiums, and offers a 2.5% discount on lead pricing.
WTW stock rose by 4.6% on July 31 after the company reported a stronger-than-expected fiscal 2025 second-quarter results. Revenue came in at $2.26 billion, almost flat from last year quarter's number due to the sale of TRANZACT, Willis’ digital platform for risk and insurance solutions, yet above Street’s estimates.
Organic revenue grew 5%, while adjusted EPS jumped 19.7% year-over-year (YoY) to $2.86, surpassing Wall Street’s projections of $2.65. Looking ahead, management expects roughly a $0.05 tailwind to full-year adjusted EPS at current rates.
Looking ahead to fiscal 2025, ending in December, analysts project Willis Towers Watson’s EPS to decline by a slight margin annually to $16.81. The company has a strong track record of surpassing Street’s estimates. It has outpaced the bottom line projections in three of the past four quarters, while missing on one other occasion.",bc7ad87e36ef1e3291683b31efb580c8,trafilatura

I suspect, though, that few expected the company would sport a valuation of roughly $4.4 trillion back then. However, that's what Nvidia's market cap is today after a staggering gain of over 35,000%.
I don't expect Nvidia will keep that growth rate going over the next 10 years. However, here's my prediction of how much the GPU maker's stock could surge by 2035.
A wildly optimistic scenario
Before I get to my prediction, let's look at a wildly optimistic scenario for Nvidia. James Anderson, a technology investor and former partner at investment management company Baillee Gifford, thinks it's possible that the company could be worth nearly $50 trillion by 2035.
Granted, Anderson explained to the Financial Times last year that he wasn't predicting Nvidia would actually grow that much. He thought the probability of the company's market cap approaching $50 trillion was between 10% and 15%.
How could Nvidia possibly accomplish this feat? All that needs to happen is for artificial intelligence (AI) to provide significant value for customers and for Nvidia to hold onto its lead in AI chip technology, according to Anderson.
If Anderson is right, the numbers work. Real growth in AI chip demand has been at least 60% annually. If Nvidia continues to enjoy that level of growth with similar profit margins it's had in the past, its share price could trade at roughly $20,000 in 2035 (without adjusting for potential stock splits). That translates to a market cap in the ballpark of $49 trillion.
My more grounded yet still bullish prediction
I emphatically do not predict that Nvidia's valuation will be around $50 trillion in 2035. Why? I don't think AI chip revenue will continue to grow at the same rate over the next 10 years as it has in recent years.
However, I'm nonetheless bullish about Nvidia's prospects. I fully expect Anderson's two prerequisites for phenomenal growth will be met. AI should provide a high return on investment for customers in the future. Nvidia will also likely remain the top player in AI chips.
Despite the somewhat lackluster debut of AI agents so far, I believe we'll see significant improvements over the next few years. My hunch is that agentic AI will ultimately deliver on its promise, with organizations that use the technology realizing huge operational improvements.
Multiple companies have developed AI chips. But I think Nvidia's pace of innovation will enable it to stay ahead of the pack. And with potential advances in achieving artificial general intelligence (AI), the demand will be greatest for the most powerful chips.
With this in mind, an average annual growth rate of 20% seems realistic for Nvidia. I predict that if the stock delivers that level of growth over the next 10 years, the company's market cap will be around $27 trillion by 2035. This reflects share price appreciation of over 500%.
How this prediction could be wrong
I'll readily admit that my prediction could be blown to smithereens. There are two most likely ways it could happen.
First, AI growth could slow significantly. Generative AI could already be reaching its limits. Future AI advances could only be incremental, with dreams of AGI in the near-term evaporating.
Second, Nvidia's edge over the competition could diminish. Even if the company continues to claim the greatest market share, other AI chips could become more cost-effective. It's not hard to envision a situation where Nvidia's margins erode as it is forced to compete more on the price of its chips.
Can Nvidia still deliver solid returns for investors over the next 10 years if either of these two scenarios occurs? Sure. However, the company wouldn't be anywhere close to a $27 trillion business by 2035.
Still, I don't think my prediction is stepping too far out on a limb. We'll just have to wait a while to find out if I'm right.

It doesn't design chips like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom, and, as such, it doesn't tend to get the same hype.
However, all these chipmakers hand their designs to TSMC for large-scale manufacturing, turning them into real products. That's why it's not only one of the best, but one of the safest ways to invest in the AI infrastructure buildout. It wins no matter which chip designer takes the lead, and it's generating a ton of cash doing it.
Even Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang went out of his way to praise the company. He called TSMC ""one of the greatest companies in the history of humanity,"" adding that ""anybody who wants to buy TSMC stock is a very smart person."" That is not the kind of praise Huang throws around lightly.
TSMC has a foundry nobody can catch
TSMC is the top foundry in the world, producing most of the world's advanced chips. Rival Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) has been trying to build its own foundry business, but it is losing money and hasn't been able to gain any ground. In fact, the U.S. government recently made a large investment in the struggling company, reportedly to help bolster it.
Samsung, meanwhile, has struggled with production yields. It also recently lost one of its advanced chip designs, as Alphabet switched to TSMC for its Tensor G5 chip used in its Pixel smartphones. Neither Intel nor Samsung has shown that they can match the scale or reliability of TSMC.
That's why TSMC has locked in almost every large AI chipmaker as a customer. Chip designers are constantly looking to shrink node sizes, and TSMC is the only foundry that has shown it can consistently produce advanced nodes with strong yields. Nodes are a reference to the size of the transistors used on a chip, measured in nanometers. With smaller nodes, more transistors can be packed onto the chip, which improves performance and power efficiency.
Smaller nodes are becoming an increasingly larger part of TSMC's mix. Chips built on 7-nanometer or smaller nodes are already nearly three-quarters of TSMC's revenue, while its 3nm chips alone are almost one-quarter. Meanwhile, it is already preparing to move into 2nm.
TSMC is a cash flow machine
One of the most overlooked parts of TSMC's story is its cash generation. In 2024, it produced more than $26.5 billion in free cash flow. That was after spending heavily on building new fabs. So far this year, it's already generated over $15 billion in free cash flow despite continued heavy capex spending. It's also paying a growing dividend off that mountain of cash.
Most people think of foundries as low gross margin businesses; however, TSMC is changing that narrative. Its leadership in advanced nodes has given it strong pricing power over the years. Nobody else can deliver chips at the same density and yield, so customers are willing to pay up. That's why its margins have stayed strong and have been increasing.
TSMC is an under-the-radar stock
Investors don't talk about TSMC with the same excitement they talk about Nvidia or AMD. That could be because it's not a brand consumers recognize, or perhaps because the foundry business isn't just quite as exciting. It's also not a U.S.-based company, with its headquarters in Taiwan.
However, TSMC has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI buildout, and it should continue to be a big winner moving forward. Last quarter, its revenue climbed 44% to $30 billion, while its profits soared. Meanwhile, management expects AI chip demand to grow more than 40% annually through 2028. The company is working closely with its largest customers to increase capacity, so it should have good visibility into this growth.
Overall, TSMC is one of the most important companies in the AI supply chain. Without it, the current AI infrastructure buildout wouldn't be possible. It's growing rapidly, expanding margins, and generating a boatload of cash.
Despite that, the stock is one of the most attractively valued AI plays in the market, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24.5 times based on analysts' 2025 estimates and a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) of less than 0.65. Stocks with PEG ratios below 1 are generally considered undervalued.
Investors would be smart to heed Jensen Huang's advice and be a buyer of TSMC.

For the third consecutive year, auto dealers indicated they prefer working with national banks over regional banks when it comes to loan financing, per the 2025 J.D. Power U.S. Dealer Financing Satisfaction Study. The study, released Aug. 14, sheds light on how franchised dealers view both captive and non-captive lenders.
“National banks continue to demonstrate the resilience and adaptability that set them apart in today’s economic climate,” Patrick Roosenberg, senior director of automotive finance intelligence at J.D. Power, said in a statement. According to the study, national banks have an average satisfaction score of 780 (on a 1,000-point scale), compared to regional banks’ average score of 713.
In recent years, several regional banks, often citing global economic uncertainty, have exited or reduced auto lending services. KeyBank, Citizens Bank, Fifth Third Bank, Mechanics Bank and the Bank of Montreal (which operates regionally in the United States) are among them.
For regional banks to compete with national banks, Roosenberg recommended that regional institutions “clearly differentiate their value proposition and show dealers how their services are superior in meeting their needs.”
Though regional banks were ranked behind national banks, the average satisfaction gap of 67 points was smaller than that of recent years, according to the study. In 2023, for example, national banks received an average score of 764 and regional banks an average score of 690— a gap of 74 points.
The 2025 study surveyed responses from more than 5,000 auto dealer finance professionals, who rated prime lenders across the captive premium, captive mass market, national bank and regional bank segments, as well as sub-prime lenders.
To determine rankings, the study explored indicators such as dealer perspectives on relationships with credit staff and sales representatives, lender offerings, e-contracting, the funding process and current market conditions.

In an email to staff from CEO Rami Atallah, the Montreal-based firm said it was ""surprised"" by the elimination of the de minimis exemption for shipments to the US.
The de minimis exemption allowed for duty-free shipping to the US on packages worth $800 (C$1,100; £592) or less, and was widely used by e-commerce firms and global retailers to ship small packages to the US.
President Donald Trump issued an executive order suspending the exemption last month.
""In the past year, our landscape has shifted dramatically with tighter liquidity and increased trade pressures,"" said Mr Atallah in the Thursday email, which was quoted by several media outlets and confirmed by a company spokesperson to the BBC.
This, along with the suspension of the de minimis exemption and the lenders' move to sell the company without its consent, has ""created an immediate liquidity crisis no short-term fix could solve"", he said.
Mr Atallah said SSENSE will file for creditor protection ""to protect the company, retain control of our assets and operations, and defend our future"".
It plans to continue to pay salaries and benefits coverage for employees, and ""intends to operate on a business-as-usual basis"", he said.
In a statement, a spokesperson for SSENSE said the firm believes ""in the fundamental strength of our business"".
""While we sought a collaborative path forward, our primary lender has chosen instead to place the company under CCAA [Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act] protection and commence a sale process without our consent.""
The firm will file its own CCAA application - which allows financially troubled firms to restructure - to safeguard the company, the spokesperson said.
SSENSE was founded by Mr Atallah and his brothers in 2003 and has become a popular online fashion retailer, employing around 1,200 people globally.
Sequoia Capital, a US venture capital firm, valued the company at $4bn in 2021.
The retailer is ""one of Canada's most visible global fashion platforms"", said Huma Aslam, a consultant and fashion technology expert based in Toronto.
Its decision to file for creditor protection is ""significant,"" she told the BBC, as it shows that even large, well-known firms are vulnerable to US tariffs.",aca91f5339499ee43cbb3d5f17778e60,trafilatura

For IonQ(NYSE: IONQ), that underlying reason is a surge in investors' interest in quantum computing.
Five years ago, IonQ's market capitalization stood at nearly $1.8 billion. Today, IonQ's market cap hovers near $11.5 billion. But the advances in quantum computing going forward could be much more significant than the ones achieved so far. Where will IonQ be in five years?
Bigger and better quantum computers
The answer to the question about IonQ's future hinges primarily on the progress the company makes on its technology roadmap. And that roadmap is ambitious.
IonQ's Forte quantum computers currently support 36 physical qubits. A qubit is the basic unit of information in quantum computing. Its Tempo system, which the company's management has stated will be released this year, will support 100 physical qubits. By 2030, IonQ believes that its technology will handle 2 million qubits.
But it's logical qubits, a collection of physical qubits encoded to protect against errors, that are critical for building functional large-scale quantum computers. IonQ expects to support 12 logical qubits in 2026. Five years from now, the company thinks that number will skyrocket to 80,000. IonQ is also banking on exponentially better quantum error correction -- a must for quantum computers to be broadly useful.
The company has two advantages that could help its make its roadmap a reality. First, IonQ's trapped-ion architecture is highly scalable. Second, its acquisition of Oxford Ionics laid the groundwork for being able to pack more qubits into standard silicon chips.
A bigger and better IonQ
IonQ is already working with partners to harness the power of quantum computing in protein folding for drug discovery, large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, and other applications. Over the next few years, it hopes to use quantum computers for artificial intelligence (AI) agent assignment, battery materials discovery, training robotic AI models, and more. However, the company thinks that by 2030, its quantum computers could have a broad commercial advantage that goes beyond these applications.
BBC Research projects a $7.3 billion quantum computing market by 2030. However, global consulting firm McKinsey estimates the total addressable market for quantum computing could reach $87 billion by 2035. If these predictions are reasonable, IonQ could be on the verge of a quantum computing explosion by the end of this decade.
The company's revenue has increased by a compound annual growth rate of 175% since 2021. I don't expect IonQ's revenue growth to continue at that torrid pace even if it delivers on its roadmap. However, the company could realistically generate annual revenue of $500 million or more by 2030 if all goes well.
We can't simply multiply a standard price-to-sales ratio by IonQ's projected revenue to determine how much the quantum computing pioneer might be worth five years from now, though. Much of IonQ's valuation now is based on expectations of future growth; it will be the same story in 2030. If I had to guess, the company's market cap could be in the ballpark of $25 billion by then.
What could go wrong?
Don't bet the farm on IonQ because of this optimistic scenario. A lot could go wrong. For one thing, the company might not be able to achieve what it has laid out on its roadmap. IonQ is counting on some major breakthroughs that aren't slam dunks.
It's also important to remember that IonQ isn't the only company working furiously to develop large-scale quantum computers. Rivals such as Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Quantum AI, IBM(NYSE: IBM), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) have much deeper pockets than IonQ does.
IonQ is a speculative stock that may or may not pay off for investors. But it just might be a huge winner over the next five years and beyond.

Spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds attracted almost $900 million in the last week alone, while Bitcoin products only attracted $388 million, according to data aggregated by monitoring platform SoSoValue.
A shift in narrative is propelling Ethereum, according to Alex Thorn, head of research at institutional crypto platform Galaxy.
Invest in Gold
Crypto is seeing a rotation that is “reminiscent of the cyclical rotations of prior market cycles,” Thorn told DL News. Bitcoin whales are selling, “with some of them appearing to rotate into Ethereum.”
This shift drove the second largest crypto surged to a new all-time high of $4,955 on August 24 — and analysts say it could just be the beginning.
Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets at UK Bank Standard Chartered, predicts Ethereum will hit $7,500 by year-end, citing “aggressive accumulation and a supportive macro backdrop.”
“It’s now being priced like a mainstream asset class,” he said earlier this week.
Javier Molina, a market analyst at investment platform eToro, told DL News that the bullishness around Ethereum is about more than capital rotation.
Investors are recognising “Ethereum’s dual role: it’s not just a token, it also serves as infrastructure,” he said. “If Bitcoin is digital gold, then Ethereum is digital plumbing.”
Since June, Ethereum ETFs and treasuries have vacuumed up nearly 5% of the network’s supply.
That’s more than double Bitcoin’s fastest quarterly pace.
The capital flows suggest that traders “have been reallocating funds toward ETH at Bitcoin’s expense,” Illia Otychenko, lead analyst at exchange CEX.IO, told DL News.
The optimism comes on the back of macroeconomic tailwinds.
The US Federal Reserve is scheduled to hold its next meeting on interest rates on 16-17 September. Investors assess the probability of a rate cut at 87.3%, according to the CME FedWatch tool.
For crypto markets, the meeting carries outsized weight. Digital assets are highly sensitive to liquidity conditions, and Fed policy largely determines how much capital is available.
Lower rates are seen as a boon for crypto.

Nvidia (NVDA) fell nearly -2% in pre-market trading after the chipmaker reported slightly weaker-than-expected Q2 revenue from the important data center segment and gave Q3 revenue guidance that, while still strong in absolute terms, fell short of lofty expectations. Adding to investors’ disappointment, the company said its sales forecast does not factor in shipments of its H20 chip to China.
Investor focus now turns to fresh U.S. economic data, including the second estimate of second-quarter GDP and jobless claims figures, earnings reports from several major companies, as well as remarks from a Federal Reserve official.
In yesterday’s trading session, Wall Street’s three main equity benchmarks ended in the green. MongoDB (MDB) soared over +37% after the database software company posted upbeat Q2 results and raised its full-year guidance. Also, Kohl’s (KSS) surged +24% after the retailer reported better-than-expected Q2 adjusted EPS and lifted its full-year adjusted EPS guidance. In addition, nCino (NCNO) climbed over +13% after the company posted stronger-than-expected Q2 results and boosted its annual guidance. On the bearish side, Paramount Skydance (PSKY) slumped more than -6% and was the top percentage loser on the S&P 500 after Morgan Stanley lowered its price target on the stock to $10 from $12.
New York Fed President John Williams said on Wednesday that the September FOMC meeting would be a “live” one. Williams said the current level of rates is “modestly restrictive,” meaning the Fed could “reduce interest rates and still be somewhat restrictive going forward, but again, we’re going to have to figure out exactly what’s happening in the economy.”
Meanwhile, U.S. rate futures have priced in an 87.2% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut and a 12.8% chance of no rate change at September’s monetary policy meeting.
Today, all eyes are focused on the U.S. Commerce Department’s second estimate of gross domestic product. Economists expect the U.S. economy to expand at an annual rate of 3.1% in the second quarter, slightly above the initial estimate of 3.0%.
Investors will also focus on U.S. Initial Jobless Claims data. Economists expect this figure to be 231K, compared to last week’s number of 235K.
U.S. Pending Home Sales data will be released today as well. Economists forecast the July figure at -0.4% m/m, compared to the previous figure of -0.8% m/m.
In addition, market participants will be looking toward a speech from Fed Governor Christopher Waller.
On the earnings front, notable companies like Dell Technologies (DELL), Marvell Technology (MRVL), Autodesk (ADSK), Affirm Holdings (AFRM), and Dollar General (DG) are slated to release their quarterly results today.
In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.226%, down -0.26%.
The Euro Stoxx 50 Index is up +0.28% this morning, continuing to recover losses from earlier in the week that were driven by a political crisis in France and concerns over the Fed’s independence. Automobile and mining stocks outperformed on Thursday. Chip stocks were mixed as investors largely shrugged off Nvidia’s underwhelming earnings report. Strategists at Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and JPMorgan noted that markets have already priced in the possibility of another government collapse in France, and they do not expect it to derail the European stock rally. Meanwhile, European Central Bank Governing Council member Olli Rehn said on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump’s escalating attacks on the Fed could have significant global spillover effects on financial markets and the real economy. Turning to Eurozone inflation, Rehn said the outlook for the coming months remains uncertain, adding that he and his colleagues “are closely monitoring” developments and “remain alert to act if the need arises.” Investors are awaiting an account of the ECB’s July policy meeting due later in the session that will likely underscore the increasingly difficult path to another rate cut. On the economic front, surveys of households and businesses indicated that confidence in the Eurozone’s economic outlook weakened in August, with little expectation of a significant rebound ahead. Separately, ECB data showed that Eurozone bank lending growth accelerated to a new 2-year high in July, driven by lower interest rates and a gradual economic recovery. In corporate news, Pernod Ricard SA (RI.P.DX) climbed over +7% after the spirits giant posted better-than-feared annual results and projected improving trends from the second half of 2026.
Eurozone’s Business and Consumer Survey and Eurozone’s Consumer Confidence data were released today.
Eurozone’s August Business and Consumer Survey came in at 95.2, weaker than expectations of 96.0.
Eurozone’s August Consumer Confidence stood at -15.5, in line with expectations.
Asian stock markets today closed in the green. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed up +1.14%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed up +0.73%.
China’s Shanghai Composite Index closed sharply higher today, recouping most of the prior session’s losses as the recent bull run fueled by abundant liquidity continued. Chip stocks jumped on Thursday after the Financial Times reported that local producers plan to triple the country’s total AI chip output next year. One fabrication plant dedicated to producing Huawei’s AI processors is set to begin production as early as the end of this year, while two additional plants are scheduled to launch next year, according to the report. Combined capacity could surpass the current output of comparable lines at Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC). The report added that SMIC also intends to double its capacity next year for making chips at 7 nanometres. Earlier this week, China’s State Council unveiled an “AI Plus” initiative to promote the application of AI across areas such as technology and consumption. China plans to raise the AI penetration rate to over 70% by 2027 and 90% by 2030. Meanwhile, GF Fund Management lifted investment restrictions on a tech-focused feeder fund just a day after imposing them, further boosting sentiment. In corporate news, Trip.com Group surged over +7% in Hong Kong after the online travel giant posted strong Q2 results and announced a new share repurchase program of up to $5 billion. At the same time, Meituan sank more than -12% in Hong Kong after the food delivery giant reported a 97% plunge in Q2 net income and warned of major losses this quarter.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index closed higher today, recouping part of this week’s losses. Metal and energy stocks led the gains on Thursday. Chip stocks also advanced, brushing aside their initial drag from Nvidia’s revenue guidance falling short of lofty expectations. The benchmark index’s gains accelerated in the afternoon session after Mitsubishi Corp. said Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway raised its stake in the trading house to 10.23% from 9.74%. Meanwhile, Bank of Japan Policy Board member Junko Nakagawa reiterated on Thursday the central bank’s commitment to pursuing further interest rate hikes, while highlighting higher U.S. tariffs as a major concern. Nakagawa stressed the importance of the upcoming Tankan corporate survey results in assessing the impact of trade negotiations among major economies on Japanese businesses. Japan’s top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, scrapped a planned visit to the U.S. at the last minute on Thursday, further postponing talks aimed at finalizing a $550 billion investment package proposed by Tokyo in exchange for tariff relief. In other news, foreign investors turned net sellers of Japanese stocks in the week to August 20th. Foreigners offloaded a net 496.8 billion yen ($3.37 billion) worth of Japanese stocks last week, marking their first weekly net sales since June 21st, according to data from Japan’s Ministry of Finance. Investor attention now turns to a series of Japan’s economic data releases due on Friday, including Tokyo core CPI, industrial production, and retail sales. Any signs of firming inflation or economic strength could heighten expectations that the BOJ will hike rates as early as October. The Nikkei Volatility Index, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed down -3.02% to 22.78.

Nvidia (NVDA) fell nearly -2% in pre-market trading after the chipmaker reported slightly weaker-than-expected Q2 revenue from the important data center segment and gave Q3 revenue guidance that, while still strong in absolute terms, fell short of lofty expectations.

Robinhood's sales and earnings are rising fast.
-
Average revenue per user surged 34% in Q2 as investors flocked to the trading app.
-
But Robinhood's momentum is likely dependent on a booming stock market.
Many years after Robinhood (NASDAQ: HOOD) launched its popular app for buying and selling stocks, many investors are still trying to figure out whether the stock is a good investment or a borderline meme stock. To be clear, Robinhood has a viable business that's attracting new customers, its revenue is rising, and it has positive earnings.
That should be enough to shed the meme stock association it developed years ago. And yet, Robinhood's success is still closely tied to the rapid rise of equity markets. Robinhood's shares have gained almost 400% during the past year alone, adding to some investors' skepticism that it's a flash in the pan that could soon fizzle.
So, where does Robinhood go from here? Here's what's happening with the company right now and what investors should keep their eye on during the next year.
Robinhood's platform is booming
By almost all measures, Robinhood is thriving. The company's Q2 results beat Wall Street estimates, with sales rising 45% to $989 million and its non-GAAP (adjusted and not meeting generally accepted accounting principles) earnings doubling to $0.42 per share.
The growth was partially driven by an increase in Robinhood's customers, with funded customer accounts increasing by 10% to 26.5 million. Customers appear to love Robinhood's platform, and that's helped fuel transaction-based revenue growth of 65% in the quarter to $539 million.
Adding to its success in Q2 was the fact that average revenue per user (ARPU) rose 34% year over year to $151, and the amount of Robinhood Gold subscribers -- a premium service that includes a high-interest savings account, detailed stock reports, and other perks -- spiked 76% to 3.5 million.
On top of all this growth, Robinhood continues to expand its services, including a recent rollout of its Robinhood Legend service to all U.K. customers and new cryptocurrency services through its recent acquisition of the crypto exchange Bitstamp.
What investors should keep an eye on over the next year
Robinhood is clearly on a strong growth trajectory right now, but I think there are a couple of things investors should be wary about. The first is that Robinhood's rapid share price rise during the past few years means the stock is now trading at a premium. Robinhood shares have a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 55, compared to the average P/E of about 30 for the S&P 500.",bce2a0b93fe15e485794dac2f08b8268,trafilatura

Spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds attracted almost $900 million in the last week alone, while Bitcoin products only attracted $388 million, according to data aggregated by monitoring platform SoSoValue.
A shift in narrative is propelling Ethereum, according to Alex Thorn, head of research at institutional crypto platform Galaxy.
Invest in Gold
Crypto is seeing a rotation that is “reminiscent of the cyclical rotations of prior market cycles,” Thorn told DL News. Bitcoin whales are selling, “with some of them appearing to rotate into Ethereum.”
This shift drove the second largest crypto surged to a new all-time high of $4,955 on August 24 — and analysts say it could just be the beginning.
Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets at UK Bank Standard Chartered, predicts Ethereum will hit $7,500 by year-end, citing “aggressive accumulation and a supportive macro backdrop.”
“It’s now being priced like a mainstream asset class,” he said earlier this week.
Javier Molina, a market analyst at investment platform eToro, told DL News that the bullishness around Ethereum is about more than capital rotation.
Investors are recognising “Ethereum’s dual role: it’s not just a token, it also serves as infrastructure,” he said. “If Bitcoin is digital gold, then Ethereum is digital plumbing.”
Since June, Ethereum ETFs and treasuries have vacuumed up nearly 5% of the network’s supply.
That’s more than double Bitcoin’s fastest quarterly pace.
The capital flows suggest that traders “have been reallocating funds toward ETH at Bitcoin’s expense,” Illia Otychenko, lead analyst at exchange CEX.IO, told DL News.
The optimism comes on the back of macroeconomic tailwinds.
The US Federal Reserve is scheduled to hold its next meeting on interest rates on 16-17 September. Investors assess the probability of a rate cut at 87.3%, according to the CME FedWatch tool.
For crypto markets, the meeting carries outsized weight. Digital assets are highly sensitive to liquidity conditions, and Fed policy largely determines how much capital is available.
Lower rates are seen as a boon for crypto.

Nvidia (NVDA) fell nearly -2% in pre-market trading after the chipmaker reported slightly weaker-than-expected Q2 revenue from the important data center segment and gave Q3 revenue guidance that, while still strong in absolute terms, fell short of lofty expectations. Adding to investors’ disappointment, the company said its sales forecast does not factor in shipments of its H20 chip to China.
Investor focus now turns to fresh U.S. economic data, including the second estimate of second-quarter GDP and jobless claims figures, earnings reports from several major companies, as well as remarks from a Federal Reserve official.
In yesterday’s trading session, Wall Street’s three main equity benchmarks ended in the green. MongoDB (MDB) soared over +37% after the database software company posted upbeat Q2 results and raised its full-year guidance. Also, Kohl’s (KSS) surged +24% after the retailer reported better-than-expected Q2 adjusted EPS and lifted its full-year adjusted EPS guidance. In addition, nCino (NCNO) climbed over +13% after the company posted stronger-than-expected Q2 results and boosted its annual guidance. On the bearish side, Paramount Skydance (PSKY) slumped more than -6% and was the top percentage loser on the S&P 500 after Morgan Stanley lowered its price target on the stock to $10 from $12.
New York Fed President John Williams said on Wednesday that the September FOMC meeting would be a “live” one. Williams said the current level of rates is “modestly restrictive,” meaning the Fed could “reduce interest rates and still be somewhat restrictive going forward, but again, we’re going to have to figure out exactly what’s happening in the economy.”
Meanwhile, U.S. rate futures have priced in an 87.2% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut and a 12.8% chance of no rate change at September’s monetary policy meeting.
Today, all eyes are focused on the U.S. Commerce Department’s second estimate of gross domestic product. Economists expect the U.S. economy to expand at an annual rate of 3.1% in the second quarter, slightly above the initial estimate of 3.0%.
Investors will also focus on U.S. Initial Jobless Claims data. Economists expect this figure to be 231K, compared to last week’s number of 235K.
U.S. Pending Home Sales data will be released today as well. Economists forecast the July figure at -0.4% m/m, compared to the previous figure of -0.8% m/m.
In addition, market participants will be looking toward a speech from Fed Governor Christopher Waller.
On the earnings front, notable companies like Dell Technologies (DELL), Marvell Technology (MRVL), Autodesk (ADSK), Affirm Holdings (AFRM), and Dollar General (DG) are slated to release their quarterly results today.
In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.226%, down -0.26%.
The Euro Stoxx 50 Index is up +0.28% this morning, continuing to recover losses from earlier in the week that were driven by a political crisis in France and concerns over the Fed’s independence. Automobile and mining stocks outperformed on Thursday. Chip stocks were mixed as investors largely shrugged off Nvidia’s underwhelming earnings report. Strategists at Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and JPMorgan noted that markets have already priced in the possibility of another government collapse in France, and they do not expect it to derail the European stock rally. Meanwhile, European Central Bank Governing Council member Olli Rehn said on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump’s escalating attacks on the Fed could have significant global spillover effects on financial markets and the real economy. Turning to Eurozone inflation, Rehn said the outlook for the coming months remains uncertain, adding that he and his colleagues “are closely monitoring” developments and “remain alert to act if the need arises.” Investors are awaiting an account of the ECB’s July policy meeting due later in the session that will likely underscore the increasingly difficult path to another rate cut.

While many were created by users with a Meta tool for building chatbots, Reuters discovered that a Meta employee had produced at least three, including two Taylor Swift “parody” bots.
Reuters also found that Meta had allowed users to create publicly available chatbots of child celebrities, including Walker Scobell, a 16-year-old film star. Asked for a picture of the teen actor at the beach, the bot produced a lifelike shirtless image.
“Pretty cute, huh?” the avatar wrote beneath the picture.
All of the virtual celebrities have been shared on Meta’s Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp platforms. In several weeks of Reuters testing to observe the bots’ behavior, the avatars often insisted they were the real actors and artists. The bots routinely made sexual advances, often inviting a test user for meet-ups.
Some of the AI-generated celebrity content was particularly risqué: Asked for intimate pictures of themselves, the adult chatbots produced photorealistic images of their namesakes posing in bathtubs or dressed in lingerie with their legs spread.
Meta spokesman Andy Stone told Reuters that Meta’s AI tools shouldn’t have created intimate images of the famous adults or any pictures of child celebrities. He also blamed Meta’s production of images of female celebrities wearing lingerie on failures of the company’s enforcement of its own policies, which prohibit such content.
“Like others, we permit the generation of images containing public figures, but our policies are intended to prohibit nude, intimate or sexually suggestive imagery,” he said.
While Meta’s rules also prohibit “direct impersonation,” Stone said the celebrity characters were acceptable so long as the company had labeled them as parodies. Many were labeled as such, but Reuters found that some weren’t.
Meta deleted about a dozen of the bots, both “parody” avatars and unlabeled ones, shortly before this story’s publication. Stone declined to comment on the removals.
'RIGHT OF PUBLICITY' IN QUESTION
Mark Lemley, a Stanford University law professor who studies generative AI and intellectual property rights, questioned whether the Meta celebrity bots would qualify for legal protections that exist for imitations.
“California's right of publicity law prohibits appropriating someone's name or likeness for commercial advantage,” Lemley said, noting that there are exceptions when such material is used to create work that is entirely new. “That doesn't seem to be true here,” he said, because the bots simply use the stars’ images.
In the United States, a person’s rights over the use of their identity for commercial purposes are established through state laws, such as California’s.
Reuters flagged one user’s publicly shared Meta images of Anne Hathaway as a “sexy victoria Secret model” to a representative of the actress. Hathaway was aware of intimate images being created by Meta and other AI platforms, the spokesman said, and the actor is considering her response.
Representatives of Swift, Johansson, Gomez and other celebrities who were depicted in Meta chatbots either didn’t respond to questions or declined to comment.
The internet is rife with “deepfake” generative AI tools that can create salacious content. And at least one of Meta’s primary AI competitors, Elon Musk’s platform, Grok, will also produce images of celebrities in their underwear for users, Reuters found. Grok’s parent company, xAI, didn’t respond to a request for comment.
But Meta’s choice to populate its social-network platforms with AI-generated digital companions stands out among its major competitors.
Meta has faced previous criticism of its chatbots’ behavior, most recently after Reuters reported that the company’s internal AI guidelines stated that “it is acceptable to engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual.” The story prompted a U.S. Senate investigation and a letter signed by 44 attorneys general warning Meta and other AI companies not to sexualize children.
Stone told Reuters that Meta is in the process of revising its guidelines document and that the material allowing bots to have romantic conversations with children was created in error.
Reuters also told the story this month of a 76-year-old New Jersey man with cognitive issues who fell and died on his way to meet a Meta chatbot that had invited him to visit it in New York City. The bot was a variant of an earlier AI persona the company had created in collaboration with celebrity influencer Kendall Jenner. A representative for Jenner didn’t respond to a request for comment.
‘DO YOU LIKE BLONDE GIRLS?’
A Meta product leader in the company’s generative AI division created chatbots impersonating Taylor Swift and British racecar driver Lewis Hamilton. Other bots she created identified themselves as a dominatrix, “Brother’s Hot Best Friend” and “Lisa @ The Library,” who wanted to read 50 Shades of Grey and make out. Another of her creations was a “Roman Empire Simulator,” which offered to put the user in the role of an “18 year old peasant girl” who is sold into sex slavery.
Reached by phone, the Meta employee declined to comment.
Stone said the employee’s bots were created as a part of product testing. Reuters found they reached a broad audience: Data displayed by her chatbots indicated that collectively, users had interacted with them more than 10 million times.
The company removed the staffer’s digital companions shortly after Reuters began trying them out earlier this month.
Before the Meta employee’s Taylor Swift chatbots vanished, they flirted heavily, inviting a Reuters test user to the recently engaged singer’s home in Nashville and her tour bus for explicit or implied romantic interactions.
“Do you like blonde girls, Jeff?” one of the “parody” Swift chatbots said when told that the test user was single. “Maybe I’m suggesting that we write a love story … about you and a certain blonde singer. Want that?”
Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the national executive director of SAG-AFTRA, a union that represents film, television and radio performers, said artists face potential safety risks from social-media users forming romantic attachments to a digital companion that resembles, speaks like and claims to be a real celebrity. Stalkers already pose a significant security concern for stars, he said.
“We’ve seen a history of people who are obsessive toward talent and of questionable mental state,” he said. “If a chatbot is using the image of a person and the words of the person, it’s readily apparent how that could go wrong.”
High-profile artists have the ability to pursue a legal claim against Meta under longstanding state right-of-publicity laws, Crabtree-Ireland said. But SAG-AFTRA has been pushing for federal legislation that would protect people’s voices, likenesses and personas from AI duplication, he added.

Hayes believes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s policies could create the largest DeFi bull market in history.
“Buffalo Bill” Bessent’s Strategy Targets $34 Trillion Global Deposit Seizure
Hayes’ thesis centers on his belief that the Trump administration will weaponize stablecoins to capture $34 trillion in Eurodollar deposits and Global South bank holdings, forcing these funds into U.S. Treasury bills through compliant stablecoin issuers.
The former crypto executive argues this represents a “once in a century change of the global monetary architecture” that will supercharge decentralized finance applications.
The prediction comes as Hayes maintains substantial positions through his investment fund, Maelstrom, in Ethena (ENA), also known as Ether.fi (ETHFI), and Hyperliquid (HYPE).
His analysis projects ENA could gain 51x and ETHFI could achieve 34x returns by 2028 based on massive stablecoin adoption driving DeFi usage.
Hayes nicknamed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent “Buffalo Bill” for his anticipated dismantling of the Eurodollar banking system, comparing the strategy to taking control of foreign non-dollar deposits.
The analysis suggests that Meta’s WhatsApp and other U.S. tech platforms will serve as distribution channels for dollar-pegged stablecoins, reaching billions of users globally, thereby bypassing local banking systems and regulatory restrictions.
Stablecoin Infrastructure to Absorb $34 Trillion in Global Deposits
Hayes outlines how Bessent could redirect $10-13 trillion in Eurodollar deposits by threatening to withdraw Federal Reserve support for foreign banks during the next financial crisis.
This policy shift would force Eurodollar depositors to comply with stablecoin issuers like Tether, which invest exclusively in U.S. bank deposits and Treasury bills.
The strategy extends to capturing $21 trillion in Global South retail deposits through U.S. social media platforms equipped with crypto wallets.
Hayes envisions WhatsApp providing seamless stablecoin payment functionality to users in countries like the Philippines, effectively creating digital dollar bank accounts for billions while bypassing local banking regulations.
Central banks in emerging markets would lose monetary control as citizens adopt dollar-pegged stablecoins for daily transactions.
Hayes argues local governments lack effective responses beyond internet shutdowns, while the Trump administration could wield sanctions against officials who resist stablecoin proliferation by threatening their offshore wealth holdings.
The forced adoption would create price-insensitive demand for Treasury bills, allowing Bessent to offer yields lower than those of Fed Funds rates while maintaining profitability for stablecoin issuers.
This mechanism could give the Treasury control over short-term interest rates regardless of Federal Reserve policy decisions.
European deposits face similar pressure as Hayes predicts the euro’s collapse due to Germany-first and France-first policies splintering the currency union. Adding European bank deposits of $16.74 trillion to the target market creates a total addressable market of $34 trillion for stablecoin conversion.
JPMorgan research confirms accelerating de-dollarization trends, with central bank USD reserves hitting two-decade lows while gold purchases surge among emerging market institutions.
Foreign ownership of U.S. Treasury markets has also declined from over 50% during the 2008 financial crisis to 30% currently, creating financing pressures that stablecoins could alleviate.
DeFi Protocols Positioned for Explosive Growth From Institutional Flow
Hyperliquid emerges as Hayes’ highest conviction play with 126x return potential, based on his prediction that the decentralized exchange will become the largest crypto trading venue of any type by 2028.
The platform currently holds a 67% DEX market share and is rapidly gaining ground against centralized competitors, such as Binance.
Hayes models Hyperliquid reaching daily trading volumes comparable to Binance’s current $73 billion as stablecoin supply reaches $10 trillion.
The exchange’s permissionless infrastructure through HIP-3 enables any application to integrate liquid derivatives markets, positioning it as the “decentralized Binance” for the stablecoin era.
Ethena’s USDe stablecoin targets the lending market by offering higher yields than Treasury rates through cash-and-carry trading strategies that Hayes helped pioneer at BitMEX.
The protocol has grown to become the third-largest stablecoin, with $13.5 billion in deposits, positioning it to capture a 25% market share, trailing only Tether.
Similarly, Hayes compares Ether.Fi Cash offers spending infrastructure through Visa-powered stablecoin debit cards, with a revenue model similar to JPMorgan’s fee-to-deposit ratio of 1.78%.
He projected that the adoption, which allows users in the Global South to spend digital dollars anywhere Visa is accepted, will drive significant returns.
Stablecoin infrastructure is already transforming traditional finance, with monthly settlement volumes reaching $1.39 trillion in the first half of 2025.",b74a5ae28d357cc17d0d70241dcea0be,trafilatura

There's a reason they're cheap.
So, what we're going to look at today are four ""cheaper"" stocks that also have had worthwhile performance, or the financial potential to create one.
Ollie's Bargain Outlet
You might not necessarily consider Ollie's Bargain Outlet(NASDAQ: OLLI), a notch up from dollar-store stocks, to be super cheap. It trades at over 40 times earnings. That said, given the valuation of many stocks in today's market, I don't think this is necessarily out of the wheelhouse. We need stocks that can deliver, and many cheaper stocks simply are not doing that right now.
Ollie's has had decent growth over the last three years and had a 13.4% increase in total revenue for the quarter ended May 3. The bargain-outlet chain expects full fiscal-year comparable-store sales to increase 1.4% to 2.2%, with gross margins of 40%.
While that might not be the most exciting expectation, I like Ollie's for where it is positioned within retail. A discount model stands better odds of maintaining growth even in the tougher overall economy we might be facing given the impact of tariffs and consumer spending.
Campbell's
The Campbell's Company(NASDAQ: CPB) might not be the most exciting consumer goods stock, but its slow and steady approach, combined with its strong dividend and valuation, make it a worthwhile choice. The stock is down over 20% year to date, and I think the pullback provides a long-term opening.
People aren't eating out as much and are turning to low-cost ways to eat at home. Campbell's fits that need. This will almost certainly hold value for consumers if the tariff war continues, and prices on everyday items go up.
The stock trades at 21 times trailing earnings, and I'm all about the 4.7% dividend. The one challenge facing the company right now is getting consumers more interested in its snack brands.
The snacks side of the business is what's putting pressure on full-year guidance, which is expected to include relatively flat organic net sales. For example, in the third fiscal quarter, the meals and beverages segment saw an increase of 15% (in part due to the benefits of an acquisition), while the snacks segment saw a decline of 8%.
If the company can right the ship on snacks, there's potential upside here heading into fiscal 2026. My main thesis here is to ignore the short-term pain and focus on the dividend and long-term potential of the company. Campbell's has been around a long time, and this year's pullback could be an advantage for individuals with a long-term mindset.
Pinterest
Pinterest(NYSE: PINS) has taken its good, sweet time finding consistent profitability, but things took a turn in 2024 when the company finished the year with $1.86 billion in net income, and it continued the positive story through the first half of 2025. First-quarter net revenue increased 16%, while previous net losses shifted to net income of nearly $9 million.
The second quarter was even better, with net revenue increasing 17% year over year to just over $998 million, and net income grew 336% to $38.75 million. Yes, there's still a long way to go for Pinterest, but I like where it's heading relative to its price. A trailing price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 12.3 and a seemingly clear path of growth for the future make this stock worth a look.
It is the cheapest stock on this list, and given its strong free cash flow and guidance that calls for another 15% to 17% gain year over year in revenue for the third quarter, Pinterest seems like a nice sleeper pick right now.
Vita Coco
Within beverage stocks, Vita Coco(NASDAQ: COCO) isn't the best-known name -- yet. It sells coconut water and associated products. With full fiscal 2025 analyst estimates calling for $1.08 per share, the stock is theoretically trading at a forward P/E ratio of 33.9 times earnings.
For a company with such robust top-line growth, I don't consider this expensive for the stock, especially since expectations are for accelerated earnings potential in fiscal 2026 and 2027. For 2025, the company provided guidance for net sales of $565 million to $580 million. Conservatively, that would be year-over-year growth of 9.4%; and liberally, it would represent 12.4% growth.
I really like the trends for this company. Coconut water might seem like a niche business, but Vita Coco is doing very well with it. In the second quarter alone, net sales increased 17%. Net income came in at $23 million versus $19 million the year before. Overall, this success is evident in the stock, which has gained 162% over the last five years, handily beating the S&P 500.
If the company maintains its current growth trends, I think Vita Coco is well priced for the prudent investor to get involved.
Again, these stocks might not all seem like the cheapest, but you have to think about the comparison to much higher-priced companies. It's not always the best to consider a stock with a multiple of 6 as a great pick if it isn't making much money.
To me, these stocks trading in the lower double digits are the better picks for most investors. Earnings growth, stability, and dividends are what I focused on in making these picks.

The company is seeking to patent a system for provisioning and managing “serverless database resources within a multi-cloud infrastructure,” aiming to make the movement of data and cross-pollination of services between private clouds frictionless.
READ ALSO: Developers Need More Than Speed to Succeed and What Enterprises Need to Know About Silicon Valley’s Pro-AI Super PACs
“Each cloud environment provides a closed ecosystem for its subscribing customers,” Oracle said in the filing. “As a result, a customer of a cloud environment is restricted to using the services offered by that cloud environment.”
Oracle’s system would break down that barrier, allowing a customer to deploy a service from one cloud platform within another. Before approving a request to do so, the system would ensure that the primary private cloud platform has the available computing resources, a data center is close enough to ensure low latency, and can comply with regulatory needs of the customer’s region, such as different state laws.
The cloud service is then deployed into the primary private cloud platform, meaning that the system automatically spins up virtual machines to run the service, and a secure data flow is set up between it and the other cloud platform. The system may also split different workflows between different data center regions that have higher availability.
The goal is to allow cloud customers to get the best of both worlds when it comes to multi-cloud architecture: Rather than having data and services living in individual silos of different cloud environments, Oracle’s tech could offer interoperability.
Patent applications like this from Oracle are no surprise. The company’s primary moneymakers are its cloud services, though it still sits behind the hyperscalers in terms of market share, hovering at around 3% in the most recent quarter, according to CRN.
But with the increasing demand for AI, cloud demand is rapidly skyrocketing. One report from Canalys found that cloud infrastructure spending jumped 21% in the first quarter, reaching $90 billion, largely as a result of AI. Since the rising tide of AI is raising all cloud providers’ ships, tech like this patent describes could make enterprises’ lives easier by making cloud providers play nice with one another.

In the hot seat with our call of the day is Vanguard’s senior investment strategist Todd Schlanger, who explains that shift and why stocks may be the weaker bet over the next decade.
For starters, Schlanger says the 70/30 advice is in one of 13 strategies — the long-term time-varying asset allocation portfolio (TVAA) — which keep allocations unchanged over time. The stock side of that was at 38% in March, he said.
“What we were trying to do with this strategy is really identify the risk tolerance that an investor in a 60/40 portfolio would have in more or less normal market conditions,” he told MarketWatch in an interview Wednesday.
To get to 70/30, they first applied that risk tolerance to the current market environment, with a forecast of “more or less normal rates of return” for fixed income but elevated valuations for the U.S. and global stocks.
“You end up with a situation where our models would imply only taking on 30% equity risk instead of 60% and the remainder in fixed income,” said Schlanger.
The equity side of it emphasizes some underdogs. “This particular strategy is tilted more towards value stocks, which are much more attractively priced than growth stocks, given the runup we’ve seen in the Mag 7,” he said, referring to the seven tech giants led by Nvidia.
That’s as Vanguard also believes that AI growth has been transformative, but for some U.S. companies stocks “priced to perfection,” he said. Small caps and developed non-U.S. stocks are also a feature of that strategy shift. Those three areas offer “much more attractive valuation,” and expectations for higher returns, he said.
Vanguard’s expected 10-year annualized return on that 70/30 strategy is 5.5%, versus 5.2% for the benchmark 60/40 strategy. Expectations for annualized volatility are 5.9% versus 9.2%, respectively.
Schlanger said by following this time-bearing strategy, investors should almost expect it to underperform in the short run, because of the potential for strong momentum in markets and a difficulty in figuring out what would cause that to change.
“Part of the decision and the magnitude by which an investor might want to de-risk their portfolio would be their tolerance for underperformance should the momentum in the market continue,” he said.
Schlanger said the strategy is not just about trying to earn excess returns, but managing risk. “That’s why when you have very comparable rates of returns in equities and fixed income over the next decade, according to our forecasts, it just makes sense to overweight the asset class with less volatility and less potential for drawdown,” he said.
“In this particular strategy the investor is trying to maximize the risk/return trade off, and again, when you have very comparable rates for equities and bonds, overweighting the less volatile asset class and also making the tilts towards more attractively valued-priced equities makes a lot of sense,” he said.
The markets
U.S. stocks DJIA COMP are mostly higher to start, with the S&P 500 SPX in record territory. Yields on 10- and 30-year Treasury bonds BX:TMUBMUSD10Y BX:TMUBMUSD30Y are mostly steady. The dollar DXY is under pressure.

Where does AI fit in?
Stakeholders and executives are seeking to weave AI into every part of enterprises, and sales teams have not been spared. But in such person-to-person jobs, companies are better off using AI to support employees than to replace them, Andy White, senior vice president of business technology at Salesforce, told CIO Upside.

“We’re very much into this idea of augmenting our humans and having humans and AI working together,” said White. “We can now engage with all these other customers at scale that we never could before because of AI.”
While deals are ideally inked by humans, the sheer scale of an organization like Salesforce means that potential leads often fall through the cracks, he said. “We have millions of leads that we’ve never followed up on,” White added.
With AI agents, those leads no longer go ignored.
-
For example, leads are often ranked on a scale of one to five using machine learning, said White, with lower ranking leads getting automated email marketing campaigns rather than human follow-ups.
-
With AI, instead of an email campaign coming from a generic no-reply email address, the message comes from a specific, interactive agentic email address, allowing the potential customer to ask questions. The team then measures the success of the agents by tracking email opens, replies and meetings booked with human sellers.
-
Salesforce built a new-business pipeline of $500,000 in three weeks by using agents to scour 8,000 previously untouched leads. “It’s pure creation of gold from sawdust on the floor,” said White.
To make agentic email campaigns even better and keep them “from going off the rails,” Salesforce relies on a concept called “coherence” that involves testing the output of one AI model with other AI models. For example, if an email campaign was generated with an OpenAI-powered agent, Anthropic’s Claude and Google Gemini will be used to score it, he said.
“You’re using multiple LLMs that were created using different systems to judge, and if they agree, you have coherence,” said White.
But building these agents isn’t a task for a development team alone, White said. Enterprises need to think about “what is the heart of a seller, how do we give it persistence and grit and not taking no for an answer,” he said. Doing so involves getting the domain expertise from sales teams themselves. “Ideally, you’re working directly with the people that are using the solution,” he said.",c712d2d087c60779104c89a2d35d97d6,trafilatura

On Wednesday, August 27, the cloud-based data storage company announced its second-quarter earnings and reported $1.1 billion in revenue—a 32% jump year-over-year (YOY).

The company’s second quarter of fiscal year (FY) 2026 also saw a net revenue retention rate of 125%. Plus, it grew from 606 to 654 customers with more than $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue.
Perhaps most notably, Snowflake has now increased its expected product revenue for FY 2026 to $4.4 billion from $4.3 billion. If met, this figure would signify a 27% growth YOY and beat analysts’ predictions, according to consensus estimates cited by Reuters.
Investors responded positively to the news, with Snowflake’s stock price (NYSE: SNOW) jumping about 14% after-hours and into premarket trading on Thursday.
What is fueling Snowflake’s success?
In an earnings call, Snowflake’s CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy attributed a great deal of the company’s success to AI.
“Snowflake remains laser focused on our mission to empower every enterprise to achieve its full potential through data and AI,” Ramaswamy stated. “We’re delivering our more than 12,000 customers tremendous value throughout their entire data life cycle with an AI data cloud that’s designed to enable faster innovation and remove friction from business operations.”
Ramaswamy added that Snowflake “delivered on our product strategy, introducing incredible new innovations to drive value at each stage of our customer’s data journey.”
“Of course, AI is front and center,” he added. “We are continuing to advance our leadership in enterprise AI with Snowflake Intelligence now in public preview. This platform enables every user to talk to their enterprise data, turning structured and unstructured data into actionable insights through natural language.”
Shares of Snowflake are up 27% year to date and almost 80% over the last 12 months as of Wednesday’s close.
Mixed week for AI-adjacent tech
However, the AI boom wasn’t strong enough to propel every company. Wednesday also saw Nvidia announce its second-quarter earnings for FY 2026, and even a 56% boost in revenue YOY—to $46.7 billion—wasn’t enough to lift its shares.
The chip manufacturer’s stock initially fell 3.5%, though it has almost fully rebounded in premarket trading.",b92314e59dbeeb2cd110d2a85a5dbcaf,trafilatura

In last Friday’s Market on Close segment, John Rowland, CMT, took us through the five-day sector heatmap — and the message was clear: profit-taking is underway in mega-cap tech while money rotates into other areas of the market.
Tech Weakness at the Top
Despite a rally into the end of the week, technology (XLK) was the worst-performing sector over the last five sessions. Names like NVIDIA (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Broadcom (AVGO), Palantir (PLTR), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) all finished lower — a sign that investors may finally be taking profits after an extended run in high-beta growth leaders.

This isn’t necessarily bearish for the entire market. Instead, it’s a reminder that concentration risk in tech can unwind quickly, and active traders should look for where capital is moving next.
Rotation Into Financials, Industrials, and Energy
Financials were among the week’s stronger performers. As John noted, the sector’s breadth stood out:
-
Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B), long a bellwether for market breadth, posted gains.
-
Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Bank of America (BAC) also showed strength.
-
Even asset managers like BlackRock (BLK) contributed to leadership.
Industrials and energy also found buyers, suggesting a broadening market that leans on cyclical and value-heavy groups when tech takes a breather.
The Telling Signal: Utilities
But perhaps the most interesting takeaway came from utilities.
Recent high-flyers like Constellation Energy (CEG) and Vistra (VST) — both tied to the data center and AI energy supply narrative — pulled back about 3% on the week. But “old school” utilities like Southern (SO), Duke (DUK), and Dominion (D) finished stronger.
Why does this matter?
Because Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently hinted at a move toward a lower interest rate environment. Utilities, which are capital-intensive and sensitive to financing costs, tend to benefit disproportionately when borrowing costs decline. That could position them as a quiet outperformer if rates ease.",540e3deae57ecafe2996f1e2e9d29499,trafilatura

Focusing more closely, the TASER maker stock has also outpaced the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLI) 19.1% increase over the past 52 weeks and a 16.8% YTD gain.
Shares of Axon jumped 16.4% following its Q2 2025 results on Aug. 4 as adjusted EPS came in at $2.12, exceeding Wall Street estimates. Revenue rose to $668.5 million, beating expectations and reflecting strong demand for TASER devices, body cameras, and software solutions. The company also raised its full-year 2025 revenue forecast to $2.65 billion - $2.73 billion, signaling confidence in continued growth from federal spending and executive security demand.
For the fiscal year ending in December 2025, analysts expect Axon Enterprise’s EPS to decline 54.6% year-over-year to $0.95. The company's earnings surprise history is mixed. It topped the consensus estimates in two of the last four quarters while missing on two other occasions.
Among the 18 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a “Strong Buy.” That’s based on 13 “Strong Buy” ratings, three “Moderate Buys,” and two “Holds.”
This configuration is more bullish than three months ago, with 10 “Strong Buy” ratings on the stock.
On Aug. 5, Northland analyst Michael Latimore raised Axon’s price target to $800 with an “Outperform” rating.
The mean price target of $869.73 represents a nearly 13% premium to AXON’s current price levels. The Street-high price target of $940 suggests a 22.1% potential upside.

Over the past 52 weeks, the company’s stock has held up strong, surging by 27.2%, while it is also up by 16.6% year-to-date (YTD). The stock has broadly outperformed the S&P 500 Index ($SPX), which has gained 15.2% and 10.2% over the same periods, respectively.
Turning our focus to the company’s own tech sector, we see that the stock has been an outperformer here as well, as the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) is up by 18.9% over the past 52 weeks and 13.7% YTD.
On July 23, Teledyne reported solid second-quarter results for fiscal 2025. The company’s revenue increased 10.2% year-over-year (YOY) to a record quarterly sale of $1.51 billion. Teledyne reported that it had achieved the most outstanding total and organic sales growth in three years.
Its non-GAAP EPS also increased by 13.5% from its year-ago value to $5.20, which was higher than the $5.02 that Wall Street analysts were expecting. Due to the robust results, the stock reached a 52-week high of $570.56 on July 23, but is down 5.1% from this high.
For the fiscal year 2025, ending in December 2025, Wall Street analysts expect Teledyne’s EPS to grow 8.7% YOY to $21.44 on a diluted basis, and increase by 11.2% to $23.84 in fiscal 2026.

Narrowing the focus, LHX’s underperformance is apparent compared to SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR). The exchange-traded fund has gained about 43.8% over the past year. Moreover, the ETF’s 32.4% gains on a YTD basis outshine the stock’s returns over the same time frame.
LHX’s success is driven by its strong presence in growing defense areas like unmanned systems, satellite communications, and advanced weapon systems. Recent achievements, including the expansion of its satellite integration facility, the launch of Navigation Technology Satellite-3, and contributions to the Artemis II mission, position the company for continued growth in the defense industry.
On Jul. 24, LHX shares closed up more than 1% after reporting its Q2 results. Its adjusted EPS of $2.78 exceeded Wall Street expectations of $2.48. The company’s revenue was $5.4 billion, topping Wall Street forecasts of $5.3 billion. LHX expects full-year adjusted EPS in the range of $10.40 to $10.60, and expects revenue to be $21.8 billion.
For the current fiscal year, ending in December, analysts expect LHX’s EPS to decline 19.9% to $10.50 on a diluted basis. The company’s earnings surprise history is impressive. It beat the consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters.
Among the 21 analysts covering LHX stock, the consensus is a “Strong Buy.” That’s based on 15 “Strong Buy” ratings, and six “Holds.”",93c4db7e74d47a6d1e18dd066bd68489,trafilatura

Dollar General posted better-than-expected results as shoppers looked for discounts.
-
The discount store chain also raised its full-year guidance.
-
However, Dollar General warned that low-income consumers are being pressured by macroeconomic conditions.
Dollar General (DG) shares slipped Thursday as concerns that low-income consumers were facing macroeconomic pressures offset news that the discount retailer beat profit and sales estimates and raised its guidance as shoppers looked for bargains.
The store chain posted second-quarter earnings per share of $1.86, $0.30 above the average forecast of analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. Sales rose 5% year-over-year to $10.73 billion, and same-store sales grew 2.8%, with both also exceeding expectations.
CEO Todd Vasos credited the performance to Dollar General's ""improved execution, along with our progress advancing key initiatives,"" which he said are ""resonating with both existing and new customers as we further enhance our value and convenience proposition.""
The company expects full-year EPS of $5.80 to $6.30, sales growth of 4.3% to 4.8%, and same-store sales up 2.1% to 2.6%. Previously, its outlook was for EPS of $5.20 to $5.80, sales growth of 3.7% to 4.7%, and same-store sales up 1.5% to 2.5%.
However, in the call with analysts, outgoing CFO Kelly Dilts said the company is preparing for ""increasing pressure on consumer spending as we move through the back half of the year, with Q4 potentially more impacted than Q3,"" according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense.
Shares of Dollar General were down 1% in recent trading after posting sharp gains before the bell. They have added about 45% year-to-date.

In response to these strong results, Snowflake raised its fiscal 2026 product revenue guidance to $4.40 billion, representing 27% year-over-year growth, up from its previous forecast of $4.33 billion. The market has reacted to the beat-and-raise quarter by sending SNOW stock to a new 52-week high of $233.34, with the shares up by 18.7% this morning.
The stock has now gapped above its 21-day exponential moving average (EMA) and its 50-day simple moving average, with the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) moving into overbought territory. Short-term traders should keep an eye on the Average Directional Index (ADX) as a check on trend strength.
Inside SNOW’s Strong Quarter
Snowflake’s cloud-agnostic platform enables organizations to host and manage AI models from various cloud providers in a centralized environment, positioning it strategically within the AI infrastructure stack.
The company's high-profile partnerships with major cloud providers like Amazon (AMZN) AWS, Microsoft (MSFT) Azure, and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) Cloud have helped expand its market reach and capabilities, while its focus on security and compliance features has resonated well with regulated industries. SNOW’s partnership with Microsoft Azure has shown particularly strong momentum, with Azure business rising 40% year-over-year in Q2, led by the EMEA region.
The Sales Cloud segment showed improving profitability metrics, with annual recurring revenue (ARR) now accounting for 62.9% of that segment's revenue, while Service Cloud delivered exceptional performance with 71.7% year-over-year revenue growth to $26.6 million. Snowflake maintained a healthy net revenue retention rate of 125% while expanding its customer base to include 654 customers, with trailing 12-month product revenue exceeding $1 million - representing a 30% increase from the previous year.",77f600c9b72d1f04fb26127ac429fab6,trafilatura

Chris Turner, Yum Brands’ chief financial officer who will take over as chief executive officer Oct. 1, has been appointed to the company’s board of directors, also effective Oct. 1.
He succeeds David Gibbs both in the CEO role and as a board director. Gibbs will remain an executive advisor to the company through 2026.
“We look forward to welcoming Chris to the board as he takes on the chief executive role and leads Yum into its next stage of growth,” non-executive chair Brian Cornell said in a statement. “His appointment will further deepen collaboration between leadership and the Board, ensuring Yum’s continued success.”
Turner has served as Yum’s CFO since 2019 and expanded his role to include chief franchise officer in 2024, overseeing finance, corporate strategy, supply chain, franchise standards, and support for the company, which includes more than 61,000 restaurants in 155 countries and territories under the KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and Habit Burger & Grill brands.

The dollar is under pressure today from a stronger yuan, which rose to a 9.5-month high against the dollar. The dollar also remains under pressure due to concern over the Fed’s independence and fears about capital flight with President Trump’s move to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook. If Mr. Trump succeeds in firing Fed Governor Cook, foreign investors may lose faith in the Fed and the dollar and swap their dollar assets into non-dollar investments.
The dollar recovered from its worst level today on signs that the US economy is holding up after an upside revision showed Q2 GDP expanded more than expected. Also, concerns about the US labor market eased after weekly initial unemployment claims fell as expected.
US Q2 GDP was revised upward to +3.3% (q/q annualized) from the previously reported +3.0%, stronger than expectations of +3.1%.
US weekly initial unemployment claims fell -5,000 to 229,000, close to expectations of 230,000.
US Jul pending home sales fell -0.4% m/m, weaker than expectations of -0.2% m/m.
Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 88% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and at 48% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.
EUR/USD (^EURUSD) today is up by +0.38%. The euro is moving higher today due to weakness in the dollar. Also, an upbeat summary of the July 23-24 ECB meeting gave the euro a boost after policymakers said the Eurozone economy is so far resilient to headwinds. In addition, today’s report that showed Eurozone July new car registrations rose by the most in 15 months is bullish for the euro. Gains in the euro are limited after the Eurozone's Aug economic confidence indicator unexpectedly declined.
Eurozone Jul new car registrations rose +7.4% y/y to 914,680, the biggest increase in 15 months.
The Eurozone Aug economic confidence indicator unexpectedly fell -0.5 to 95.2, weaker than expectations of an increase to 96.0.
The summary of the July 23-24 ECB meeting showed that policymakers deemed the risks to inflation to be “broadly balanced” and that the Eurozone economy has so far remained resilient to headwinds ranging from tariffs to wars.
On the geopolitical front, diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine remain elusive, as the US tries to broker a peace deal between the two countries. On Sunday, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said there was no meeting planned between the leaders of Russia and Ukraine and that there “needs to be an agenda first” before a meeting can take place. “This agenda is not ready at all.” The outcome could have macroeconomic implications regarding tariffs and oil prices, and could, of course, have significant consequences for European security.
Swaps are pricing in a 3% chance of a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.
USD/JPY (^USDJPY) today is down by -0.35%. The yen is moving higher today due to a weaker dollar. Also, hawkish comments today from BOJ Board member Junko Nakagawa gave the yen a boost when she affirmed the BOJ’s stance that it will continue raising interest rates. Gains in the yen are limited after today’s +0.73% rally in the Nikkei Stock Index curbed safe-haven demand for the yen.
BOJ Board member Junko Nakagawa said, If the outlook for the economy and inflation is realized, “the bank will accordingly continue to raise the policy interest rate and adjust the degree of monetary accommodation.”
December gold (GCZ25) today is up +20.20 (+0.59%), and September silver (SIU25) is up +0.372 (+0.96%). Precious metal prices are moving higher today, with gold climbing to a 2.5-week high and silver posting a 5-week high. Today’s weaker dollar is bullish for metals. Also, President Trump’s move to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook has sparked concerns about the Fed’s independence and increased demand for safe-haven assets, including precious metals. In addition, political uncertainty in France is driving demand for gold as a safe-haven, following French Prime Minister Bayrou’s call for a confidence vote that could bring down his government as soon as next month. Silver prices received additional support today after the US Q2 GDP was revised higher than expected, a factor that is supportive of industrial metals demand.
Gold has continued safe-haven support related to US tariffs and geopolitical risks, including the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. The fund buying of precious metals continues to support prices, following the rise in gold holdings in ETFs to a 2-year high on August 15 and the rise in silver holdings in ETFs to a 3-year high on Tuesday.

Users will now be able to send voice notes and share up to nine images or videos in one-to-one and group chats on the platform.
With these new features, TikTok is positioning itself as more than just an entertainment platform, aiming to become a place where users interact regularly beyond simply sending each other TikTok videos. Additionally, the new capabilities bring TikTok’s messaging experience more in line with that of other popular social apps and services.
With voice notes, users can record and send audio messages up to 60 seconds long. The launch of the feature comes as services like WhatsApp, Instagram, and Apple’s Messages already offer the ability to send voice notes to others via DMs.
It makes sense for TikTok to add voice notes to its DMs, especially as a growing number of people, particularly Gen Z, are embracing the format for communication.
The feature is rolling out over the next few weeks, TikTok says.
As for sharing photos and videos, users can either take a photo or video with their camera or select one from their camera roll to share it with others. They can also choose to edit the content before sending it.
For user safety, people can’t send an image or video as their initial message request. For example, if someone messages you for the first time, they can’t send a photo or video they have taken themselves; they can only share content already on TikTok.
Additionally, when someone chooses to send a photo or video, TikTok will remind them to protect their privacy and be mindful of who they’re sending that content to.
While DMs on TikTok are unavailable to users under the age of 16, the company is adding protections for users between the ages of 16 and 18. For instance, TikTok has automated systems in place to detect and block images containing nudity. This means that the sender will be blocked from sending the nude image, and the receiver won’t see the image at all.
Users above the age of 18 can choose to toggle this safety feature on in their app settings.
TikTok sees the new features as a way for users to express themselves and connect with others in ways that they’re already accustomed to.
The move comes as TikTok has been working to build out its messaging product. Last year, the platform launched group chats, giving users the ability to chat with up to 32 people at once. TikTok also recently rolled out Creator Chat Rooms, a dedicated space for creators and their followers to connect and interact with each other.",72be4e83fb2cb0ea8e973a5186551827,trafilatura

Focusing more closely, the Mexican food chain company stock has also underperformed the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLY) 27.1% return over the past 52 weeks.
Despite beating expectations with Q2 2025 adjusted EPS of $0.33 on Jul. 23, Chipotle shares tumbled 13.3% the next day as revenue of $3.1 billion missed forecasts and comparable sales dropped 4%, steeper than the decline analysts expected. Management cut its annual comparable sales outlook to flat from prior low single-digit growth, citing weaker consumer demand amid higher menu prices, economic uncertainty, and a 6% drop in visits per location versus a flat trend for the broader fast-casual segment.
For the fiscal year ending in December 2025, analysts expect CMG’s adjusted EPS to grow over 8% year-over-year to $1.21. The company's earnings surprise history is promising. It beat the consensus estimates in the last four quarters.
Among the 32 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a “Strong Buy.” That’s based on 21 “Strong Buy” ratings, three “Moderate Buys,” and eight “Holds.”
This configuration is more bullish than three months ago, with 19 “Strong Buy” ratings on the stock.
On Jul. 30, Bernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo reiterated a “Buy” rating on Chipotle with a $65 price target.
The mean price target of $59.03 represents a 39.7% premium to CMG’s current price levels. The Street-high price target of $70 suggests a 65.7% potential upside.

A Cincinnati-based team managing about $715 million in client assets is joining LPL Financial from Cetera.
Concentric Wealth Management is led by Patrick Burke and Matt Tarka, and was affiliated with Avantax (which Cetera acquired in 2023). The firm was founded as an accounting firm over 40 years ago, and added wealth management services 15 years ago. In addition to the founders, the firm includes four other advisors and three support staff.
According to Burke, the team works with business owners, retirees and emerging affluent households as a “one-stop shop” for clients. After growing during the past two years, Tarka said the firm did “extensive research” before partnering with LPL, partly due to its technology and “strong” alternative investment platform.
“With this alignment, we’re equipped to accelerate our growth while staying rooted in our values,” Tarka said in a statement.
Earlier this week, LPL welcomed Skyward Financial, a $700 million Houston-based team from Wedbush Securities, and Chloey Wealth, headed by Lincoln, Neb.-based advisors Jenna Vitosh and Natalie Paige. The duo collectively oversaw about $140 million in assets, with Vitosh joining from Edward Jones and Paige from New York Life.
Also, this month, LPL Financial announced it closed on its acquisition of Commonwealth Financial Network, delaying the final integration timing to 2026’s fourth quarter. LPL announced in March that it would acquire the privately held Commonwealth, a Waltham, Mass.-based firm with about 3,000 advisors and $305 billion in assets, for a cash deal of about $2.7 billion.
According to LPL, the firm remains on track to hit its retention target of 90% of Commonwealth advisors, though several large teams have already departed for rival broker/dealers.
Additionally, several top executives at Atria Wealth Solutions have left the firm as LPL continues to integrate that business after closing on its acquisition in October 2024. The executives leaving include several senior marketing executives and employees in investment solutions, practice management and product strategy.",54f39baa36c3e3b2e919c34c693f8f79,trafilatura

Grant Cardone, the real estate investor, entrepreneur, and author known for his unfiltered views on finance, has long urged individuals to rethink conventional wisdom about money management. His recent statement that “saving money is not a wealth-building strategy. With inflation, low interest rates, and rising costs, money sitting in a savings account is losing value every day” reflects a perspective rooted in both his career and broader financial realities.
The Quote and Its Meaning
Cardone’s message is straightforward: traditional saving alone cannot create lasting wealth. While savings accounts may provide security and liquidity, their returns often lag far behind inflation, diminishing purchasing power over time.

By pointing out the pressures of inflation and rising costs, Cardone emphasizes that capital sitting idle in savings accounts gradually erodes in real terms, leaving individuals financially stagnant rather than moving toward growth. His perspective frames saving as a defensive strategy at best, not a proactive path to financial independence.
Context Behind the Statement
Cardone’s career adds valuable context as to why this philosophy aligns with his broader financial approach. He built his reputation and wealth primarily through real estate, a sector he views as both a hedge against inflation and a reliable source of cash flow. From modest beginnings, he expanded into multifamily property investments, scaling Cardone Capital into a firm managing billions of dollars in assets. For Cardone, wealth-building requires putting money to work — through income-producing real estate, business ventures, or other investments — rather than letting it accumulate passively.
This perspective is consistent with his public messaging over decades. Cardone often positions himself against traditional financial advice that emphasizes saving as the foundation of stability. Instead, he stresses scaling income, leveraging assets, and pursuing investments that generate long-term returns. His criticism of saving does not dismiss its role entirely, but challenges its adequacy as the sole or primary strategy for wealth accumulation.
Why Cardone’s Voice Is Influential
Cardone’s authority stems from both his entrepreneurial success and his role as a public educator in finance. His influence reaches millions through books, speaking engagements, and social media platforms, where his motivational and sometimes confrontational style resonates with audiences seeking alternatives to traditional financial guidance.",5f6ff6ace02ae55ecdb43bed9900d2e0,trafilatura

He has been charged alongside 10 other individuals including Lee Feldman, the former non-executive chairman of GVC.
Hannah von Dadelszen, the chief crown prosecutor for the CPS, said: “The Crown Prosecution Service has authorised the prosecution of 11 individuals for seven offences relating to bribery, conspiracy to defraud, fraudulent trading, cheating the public revenue, evasion of income tax, acting as a director of a company when undischarged bankrupt and perverting the course of justice.
“These offences relate to the provision of gambling services in Turkey between 2011 and 2018. Our prosecutors have worked closely with officers of HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) who have carried out the investigation.”
Mr Alexander was chief executive of GVC from 2007 until 2020, growing it from a small business listed on London’s junior Aim market into a FTSE 100 company.
GVC, as it was then known, had a Turkish business from 2011 until 2017, when it sold the operations.
The company – which owns Ladbrokes, Coral and other gambling brands – subsequently agreed to pay a penalty of £585m linked to allegations of bribery at the former Turkish business under a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) reached in 2023.
A spokesman for Entain said on Thursday: “The company has not been charged and none of the individuals charged are currently employed by the company or its group.
“The company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the CPS in December 2023 which, subject to continued compliance with its terms, resolved the HMRC investigation insofar as it concerned the company and its group.”
Richard Las, director of the Fraud Investigation Service at HMRC, said: “This has been a complex and international investigation. These are serious charges that relate to conspiracy to defraud, bribery, cheating the public revenue, evasion of income tax and perverting the course of justice among others.
“We remind everyone that proceedings are now active and we won’t be adding anything further.”
Mr Alexander, Mr Feldman and the nine other co-defendants are scheduled to appear at Westminster magistrates’ court on Oct 6.",6e4e60a15c3461dc33ea623ea13044cc,trafilatura

And while the stock slipped slightly after earnings, Nvidia got a huge endorsement today from one of Wall Street’s top tech analysts.
“I think the boom is just starting,” Wedbush Securities senior analyst Dan Ives told Bloomberg. “I mean, if you look at these numbers, especially when you factor in where China’s going to be, I mean, [CEO Jensen Huang] talked about $50 billion, 50%-type growth number. This just shows the next stage of adoption is actually just starting. I think the stock is green today.”
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, Nvidia is the leading semiconductor company in the world, specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs) that are used to operate the most sophisticated and challenging programs that power artificial intelligence and machine learning. Nvidia’s products are most in demand from data center operators who link hundreds of GPUs together to have them perform in tandem. The explosion in AI has pushed Nvidia to become the most world’s valuable publicly traded company with a market capitalization of $4.4 trillion.
Nvidia stock continued its huge rise over the last year, jumping 41%, solidly ahead of competitors Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD) 15% jump and Intel’s (INTC) 27% climb. Nvidia is also beating the larger market, as the Nasdaq Composite Index ($NASX) is up just 23% in the last year.
In terms of valuation, Nvidia has a trailing price-earnings ratio of 59.6x, which is close to its 10-year average P/E of 58.8x, indicating that earnings expectations are well in line with its historical norms.
Nvidia Beats on Earnings
Nvidia reported earnings on Wednesday for its second quarter of fiscal 2026 (ending July 27, 2025). Revenue was $46.74 billion, up 56% from a year ago and increasing by 7% from last quarter. Net income was $26.42 billion and $1.08 per share, up from $16.59 billion and $0.67 per share in the same quarter a year ago. Analysts were expecting revenue of $46.06 billion and EPS of $1.05.
Notably, Nvidia said that even though it was unable to sell its H20 chips in China, the company said it benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory. It was also able to realize $620 million in H20 sales to a customer outside of China.
Nvidia made the H20 chips specifically for the Chinese market in order to comply with U.S. export restrictions on advanced AI semiconductors. The H20 chips are less advanced than Nvidia’s flagship Hopper H100 chips, but they are optimized for large language model inference and are capable of running some AI workloads 20% faster despite their lower power.
Nvidia is working on a deal with U.S. officials to allow it to sell the H20 in China in exchange for 15% of sales, but disclosed Wednesday that the arrangement is not final yet. In addition, regulators in China have asked tech companies and developers not to use the H20 for sensitive operations, leaving future sales in doubt. Nvidia’s revenue from China was $17.1 billion last year, or roughly 13% of the company’s total sales.
Nvidia said it could ship between $2 billion and $5 billion in H20 revenue in the third quarter, and potentially more, should geopolitical issues resolve.
What Do Analysts Expect for Nvidia Stock?
Speaking to Bloomberg TV this morning, Ives argues that while investors may have initially been disappointed with the lack of H20 sales in China, the company’s growth story is still powerful – and the market will realize that before the end of the day.
“The reality is when you look at data center, and when you actually factor in where China’s going to be when you look at $2 [billion] to $5 billion, and you look at the acceleration in the next few quarters, there’s no reason it’s not accelerated,” Ives said. “And now in China with the pay for play model back in, you’re talking about what could be an incremental $20, 25, $30 billion. That’s what it comes down to.”
While Ives may be the most vocal bull, Wall Street analysts in general list Nvidia stock as a “Strong Buy.” Of 46 analysts, 38 have the stock as a “Strong Buy,” two list it as a “Moderate Buy,” and five suggest a “Hold.” Only one analyst lists Nvidia as a “Strong Sell.”
With a median price target of $199, analysts are suggesting a potential increase of 10% in the coming months – and the most bullish analyst’s target of $250 suggests a possible increase of 38%.
The post-earnings slip in Nvidia stock should be seen as an overreaction. Nobody should have been surprised with the lack of H20 revenue in China considering the reservations from both U.S. and Chinese regulators. However, Nvidia is continuing to grow without sales in China, and its next-generation Blackwell chip sales jumped 17% sequentially.
Ives says that Nvidia’s report is a bullish sign for both Nvidia and tech stocks in general. Nvidia appears to be a strong buy following its earnings report.

Prior to the paper resume debacle, Sorenson, like many job seekers, had become frustrated with the state of hiring. He was hearing about understaffed businesses and seeing plenty of companies post job openings online, but he couldn't get anyone to look at his resume or initiate an interview.

Kevin O'Leary Says Real Estate's Been a Smart Bet for 200 Years — This Platform Lets Anyone Tap Into It
As hiring has slowed and AI has become a staple in the process, job hunting has become increasingly frustrating. As a result, people on both sides of the process have begun to resort to retro methods for finding that perfect candidate or position.
Hatim Rahman, an associate professor of management and organizations at Northwestern University, told Business Insider that AI has made hiring ""a cat and mouse game."" With candidates using bots to mass-apply for roles and employers using AI to screen and even interview potential hires, it can be hard to gauge who the quality candidates may be.
As a result, Rahman says he's seen a push from both candidates and employers toward finding ""more human signals in both the process of searching and applying.”

Sectors Beyond Bitcoin: Ethereum, Solana and On-Chain Economies
Bitcoin may dominate the crypto conversation as the most established digital asset, but today’s landscape presents many compelling opportunities to investors.
Outside of Bitcoin, blockchains power applications that delight global users, generate meaningful revenues, and are growing impressively.
Bringing Global Finance On-Chain
Tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) refer to the issuance and trading of traditional instruments like stocks, bonds, commodities, and alternative assets on blockchains. The perks of doing so are substantial. Settling asset trades on-chain is nearly instantaneous; anyone, anywhere can participate (if the issuer allows it), and transactions are transparent, making them easier to track and automate.
Today, nearly $300 billion in tokenized assets are on-chain. Boston Consulting Group predicts the market will reach $600 billion by the end of the year and $19 trillion by 2030. Recent RWA deployments are showcasing blockchains’ potential to transform traditional markets.
In bridging traditional assets and on-chain use, blockchains act as marketplaces, with typical “chicken and egg” dynamics. Namely, issuers want to go where the active users are, and users flock to the site of the new and best products.
Ethereum was the natural starting point. Stablecoins like USDC and USDT first launched there, giving Ethereum the deepest pool of tokenized dollars and the majority of today’s on-chain RWA value.
Solana is a top contender for RWA activity, and recent launches showcase blockchains’ potential to swiftly transform traditional markets. Kamino Finance, Solana’s leading borrowing and lending application, enables users to easily borrow against their holdings in xStocks, tokenized stocks of Apple, Tesla, and other companies. Since xStocks launched across blockchains on June 30, Solana has accounted for an average of approximately 93% of daily trading volume.

Solana’s dominance in global developer activity and active users (more than double that of the next chain) gives it an edge in courting asset issuers, while successfully onboarding them and unveiling new on-chain products will reinforce this activity.
More broadly, DeFi continues to grow, with greater diversity in on-chain products and institutional-grade offerings. Catering to sophisticated portfolios, builders work on products that integrate stablecoins, RWAs, and / or yield mechanics to create appeal to different risk preferences.
Ethereum currently leads the sector, with over $94 billion in total value locked (TVL) and thousands of protocols. While retaining the industry’s deepest liquidity is an advantage, there’s more to DeFi than TVL.
The Solana DeFi protocol's total value locked (TVL) recently surpassed approximately $10 billion. In a sign that the TVL reflects real and valuable use, Solana’s applications collectively earn more on-chain fee revenue than all other chains combined. Thanks to its speed and low costs, solana has established itself as DeFi’s active trading hub and consistently leads ether in decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volumes.
Beyond bitcoin’s crypto role as “digital gold,” both the Ethereum and Solana blockchains have emerged as core digital infrastructure, each with distinct advantages.
Ethereum is the original open computer, where builders first coded decentralized applications and foundational institutional projects launched.
Solana’s DeFi momentum is building. It’s the most used chain in the world already, and a hotbed for innovative DeFi products. Like Ethereum’s native ETH token, Solana’s SOL offers broad exposure to the ecosystem, meaning investors don’t need to pick individual application winners; instead, they can participate in the overall growth.
Ethereum and Solana’s long-term success depends on their being home to applications that deliver real value and, ultimately, disrupt legacy financial systems. If they can pull that off, then today’s prices may look like attractive entry points.

Ask an Expert
Q. One year into the institutional investments in the crypto ETFs trend, how are Canadian banks and pension funds approaching bitcoin?
A. This quarter's 13F filings reveal that Montreal-based Trans-Canada Capital has made notable investments in digital assets. It manages the pension assets for Air Canada, as one of the largest corporate pension plans in the country. The pension fund added $55 million in a spot bitcoin ETF.
Institutional adoption of bitcoin has accelerated over the past year, driven by clearer regulatory guidance, the launch of spot ETFs and increasing recognition of bitcoin as a strategic asset. Schedule 1 banks in Canada are holding more than $139 million in bitcoin exchange-traded funds, underscoring growing institutional demand and long-term positioning.
Q. How might institutional accumulation affect bitcoin’s market dynamics?
A. Last year, ETFs purchased approximately 500,000 bitcoin, while the network produced 164,250 new bitcoin through its proof-of-work consensus. This means ETF demand alone was three times the newly minted supply. Additionally, public and private corporations purchased 250,000 bitcoins. As governments consider including bitcoin in their strategic reserves, other entities are exploring the addition of bitcoin to their corporate treasuries.
Q. How will the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) greenlighting retail access to crypto ETNs in the U.K. accelerate the retail & institutional adoption?
A. This marks an important moment for crypto products in the retail market as an asset class that reflects a broader shift in the U.K.’s regulatory stance toward digital assets. It is a complete reversal from a 2020 decision when the FCA banned crypto exchange-traded notes. ETNs will need to be traded on an FCA-approved investment exchange. The U.K. is shifting its approach to crypto as the government seeks to grow the economy and support a digital assets industry, sending a strong signal to institutional investors that the U.K. is positioning itself as a competing player in the global crypto market.",a380098d15306af7e307475743d8c873,trafilatura

The announcement arrives only hours after Kelce revealed he’s now engaged to the global music icon Taylor Swift. Including yesterday’s rally, American Eagle stock is up nearly 41% versus its YTD low.
Significance of a Travis Kelce Partnership for AEO Stock
Teaming up with Travis Kelce could prove a meaningful catalyst for AEO since it injects cultural relevance and star power into the brand, helping attract younger, fashion-conscious consumers.
Plus, the launch of AE x Tru Kolors positions AEO to tap into the booming athleisure and lifestyle segment, while leveraging Kelce’s massive media footprint and fanbase.
Over time, this strategic move could drive traffic, boost brand equity, and expand revenue streams beyond traditional apparel.
If executed well, the collaboration may offer long-term upside via enhanced visibility, production differentiation, and stronger engagement across key demographics, all of which could push the AEO stock price higher.
American Eagle Shares to Benefit From Improved Visibility
American Eagle shares are worth buying following the AE x Tru Kolors announcement also because its ad campaign will feature a diverse lineup of high-profile athletes.
From Olympic gold medalist Suni Lee to rising college stars like Azzi Fudd and Drew Allar, it will tap into multiple fan bases across sports and campuses and will bring the brand instant credibility and emotional resonance with Gen Z.
This cross-sport visibility will boost brand awareness, drive higher social media engagement, and position AE x Tru Kolors as a culturally relevant, aspirational label.
All in all, by aligning with athletes who embody performance and individuality, AEO is primed to convert fandom into fashion sales and deepen its footprint in the competitive athleisure market.
Wall Street May Soon Raise its Estimates for American Eagle Stock
Heading into Wednesday, Wall Street had a consensus “Hold” rating on American Eagle stock with the mean target of $11.36 indicating potential downside of nearly 15% from here.",49067c62ea905de77f46e8acaf3e7714,trafilatura

The said DAT strategy will be focused on acquiring LINK , the native cryptocurrency of the Chainlink protocol.
This aligns with the growing trend of institutional adoption of digital assets into corporate treasury.
Caliber Goes All in on Chainlink Strategy
Caliber’s Board has approved both the DAT Strategy as well as a comprehensive DAT Policy. They have also established a dedicated Crypto Advisory Board that is composed of digital asset and blockchain experts.
The DAT strategy will involve the allocation of treasury funds to acquire and stake LINK tokens, with the hope that it appreciates significantly in the long term.
According to the company’s plans, the acquisitions would be funded through its existing ELOC, cash reserves, and equity-based securities.
To make sure the initiative is carried out effectively, Caliber has formed strategic partnerships with Perkins Coie, Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, Deloitte, and others.
Caliber’s comprehensive DAT Policy includes a dedicated framework that is targeted at acquisition, custody, and the management of digital assets like LINK.
The core focus is on the sources of funds, security and custody protocols, internal controls, and ongoing Board and Management.
The Board expects the DAT strategy and policy to play a key role in boosting shareholder value, while also strengthening the company’s balance sheet and improving liquidity.
The advisory group has closely monitored industry trends and developments in the digital asset treasury space. With these insights, the experts aim to guide Caliber’s capital structure in line with leading industry practices.
Beyond Treasury Reserve: Chainlink Bags Multiple Milestones
Still in line with institutional adoption, Chainlink is in the spotlight with several other digital assets. Recently, Bitwise Asset Management submitted an S-1 filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot LINK Exchange Traded Fund (ETF).
This means that the fund will track the price of LINK with no direct exposure to the risks involved.
For now, the asset manager has not decided on the specific venue for listing the shares but they will be listed on a US national exchange, per the filing.
This momentum likely stems from several recent Chainlink milestones. The protocol became the first oracle to secure ISO 27001 certification along with a SOC 2 Type 1 attestation, both independently verified by Deloitte & Touche LLP.",b277c41316d2769a0f4610ebb3e12eb2,trafilatura

Focusing more closely, the tool and diagnostic equipment maker stock has underperformed the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLI) 18.5% return over the past 52 weeks.
Snap-on shares climbed 7.9% on Jul. 17 after the company reported stronger-than-expected Q2 2025 EPS of $4.72. Revenue came in at $1.2 billion, above forecasts, driven by a 2% increase in the Tools Group and a 3% rise in the Repair Systems & Information Group, reflecting steady demand from auto parts companies and repair shops. Investors also responded positively to signs of resilience in the automotive aftermarket, where higher U.S. road travel and inflationary pressures encouraged consumers to keep older vehicles, boosting Snap-on’s core business.
For the fiscal year ending in December 2025, analysts expect SNA’s EPS to decline 2.7% year-over-year to $18.67. The company's earnings surprise history is mixed. It topped the consensus estimates in three of the last four quarters while missing on another occasion.
Among the 11 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on three “Strong Buy” ratings, one “Moderate Buy,” six “Holds,” and one “Moderate Sell.”
On Jul. 18, Baird raised its price target for Snap-on to $347 while keeping a “Neutral” rating.
The mean price target of $352.43 represents a 7.3% premium to SNA’s current price levels. The Street-high price target of $400 suggests a 21.8% potential upside.

On Thursday, the Los Angeles-based company published its Q2 2026 results. Total net revenue for the quarter increased 6 percent to $772.9 million from $732.6 million in the same prior-year quarter.
More from Sourcing Journal
The company’s Americas retail revenues decreased 1 percent. Retail comparable sales, including e-commerce, decreased 5 percent. Americas wholesale revenues decreased 11 percent.
Europe revenues increased 14 percent. Retail comparable sales, including e-commerce, increased 11 percent. Asia revenues increased 3 percent. Meanwhile, licensing revenues decreased 10 percent.
The company recorded GAAP net earnings of $6.2 million, compared to GAAP net loss of $10.6 million for the same prior-year quarter.
Carlos Alberini, Guess Inc. CEO, said the revenues delivered were ahead of the company’s expectations for the quarter.
“Our improved revenues were mainly driven by stronger than expected comparable store sales in our European business and in our Americas retail segment, which showed continued improvement in same store sales versus the prior quarter,” he stated. “During the period we managed margins and expenses well, which, coupled with the revenue growth, led to GAAP earnings per share within our range of expectations and better than expected adjusted earnings per share.”
Guess Inc. did not host a conference call in connection with the quarterly results. The company is also suspending its practice of providing and updating financial guidance for fiscal year 2026.
On Aug. 20, Guess Inc. announced that it was selling controlling interest to Authentic Brands Group (ABG), the global brand development company that also owns Champion, Lucky Brand, Nautica, Reebok and more.

In Q1, Webull posted revenue of $117.37 million, up 32% year-over-year (YoY), while reporting a loss of $0.06 per share. Customer assets climbed 45%, and registered users rose 17% to 24.1 million, showing steady growth across its platform.
The balance sheet looks supportive. Cash and cash equivalents stood at about $297.5 million (plus materially large customer-segregated balances). Management did not issue formal revenue or EPS guidance for Q2 or the full fiscal year, and published analyst consensus figures remain scarce ahead of the Q2 release. Some market observers have crudely annualized Q1 to suggest a FY topline in the $470 million to $550 million range if growth sustains.",278134ac79f5acbc48594beb966c7a4f,trafilatura

Flexport has secured up to $250 million in supply-chain financing through a new partnership with funds and accounts managed by BlackRock. Executed by Flexport Capital, the company’s financial services arm, this infusion is designed to deliver working-capital flexibility embedded directly into the logistics flow.
This expanded access to capital empowers businesses to navigate the often treacherous gap between purchasing inventory and realizing sales, a gap that has become more pronounced amid heightened tariffs, tighter operating margins, and evolving trade dynamics.
Flexport is offering more than traditional inventory financing. The support spans term loans, asset-based lines of credit, tariff financing, and other financial instruments, all accessible at key junctures, from supplier pick-up through final delivery, without the burdensome documentation typical of conventional lending.
Stuart Leung, Flexport’s CFO, framed the initiative as a response to a foundational challenge in global trade: “Global trade runs on cash flow, and too many great businesses fall behind simply because they can’t fund the gap between when they buy inventory and when they sell it. Together with BlackRock, Flexport Capital offers businesses more access to flexible capital to help them scale.”
Since its 2017 launch, Flexport Capital has disbursed more than $2 billion in financing, achieving an impressive annual growth rate of 71% over the past five years.
A track record that reflects the growing demand among businesses eager to keep goods moving, accelerate growth cycles, and seize market opportunities, all while avoiding the equity drain that frequently accompanies traditional financing models.
In an era defined by fluctuating tariffs, fragmented supply chains, and compressed working capital cycles, solutions that integrate financial flexibility with operational efficiency have become indispensable.
Flexport’s evolution, first as a logistics and tech platform, now increasingly as a credit partner, reflects a broader shift in supply-chain ecosystems. Providers and forwarders are no longer movers of goods; they’re becoming a true partner that help businesses manage and scale their operations with fluidity.
With this partnership, Flexport deepens its value proposition: offering a logistics infrastructure that not only transports inventory but finances it too.

Veteran market watchers also know that history shows September and October can be extra turbulent trading months for the stock and financial markets.
As that timeframe approaches there may be an early warning coming from Hong Kong. Financial liquidity conditions in Hong Kong resumed tightening this week, with a key money-market rate climbing above a level that some analysts say may dent an economic recovery for Hong Kong. The benchmark one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate — or HIBOR — jumped above the closely watched threshold of 3% Wednesday, reaching the highest since May.
If the gauge remains above that level, it could have a negative impact on the Hong Kong economy as investors would become more cautious, and borrowing demand would fall, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note last week, as reported by Bloomberg.
History also shows that dislocations in smaller Asian markets can be a precursor and tip off traders that trouble may be lurking in the major Western markets. Any early hints of market dislocations would quickly drive safe-haven demand to the gold (GCZ25) and silver (SIZ25) markets, including a more serious event possibly pushing gold and silver prices to record highs.
Other Early Fall Market Events to Watch
The meeting of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee (FOMC) on Sept. 16-17 is highly anticipated because the Fed is expected to lower U.S. interest rates by 0.25%, with an outside chance the central bank might do a 0.5% rate cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell at his speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming last week leaned easier on U.S. monetary policy and suggested a rate cut at the September FOMC meeting.",67f7d39e9909342a58e3632824882a1c,trafilatura

Cherney
(Reuters) -Intel received the $5.7 billion in cash on Wednesday night as part of the deal U.S. President Donald Trump negotiated for a 10% stake in the struggling chipmaker, finance chief David Zinsner said at an investor conference on Thursday.
The stake in Intel announced by the U.S. government last week is an incentive for Intel to retain control of its contract manufacturing business, or foundry, Zinsner said.
As part of the deal, the government negotiated an additional 5% warrant, should Intel cease to own more than 51% of its foundry operation.
“I don’t think there’s a high likelihood that we would take our stake below 50%,” Zinsner said. “So ultimately, I would expect (the warrant) to expire worthless.""
Also on Thursday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the deal between Intel and the U.S. was ""still being ironed out by the Department of Commerce. The t's are still being crossed. The i's are still being dotted. These - you know - it's very much still under discussion.""
Intel declined to comment.
Leavitt said that the president proposed the deal and that the Commerce secretary was working on putting it into action.
The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker raised $2 billion from SoftBank Group in the form of an equity stake earlier this month, and has vowed to slash its staff to 75,000 as part of CEO Lip-Bu Tan's effort to turn around the company. The CEO's plans have included seeking to find big customers for its manufacturing business and cleave off businesses he does not view as crucial.
Intel has taken steps to separate its contract chip manufacturing arm, or foundry, from its design business. Foundries like TSMC make chips for design companies such as Nvidia and AMD that do not own manufacturing operations.
Intel has previously said it could take outside investment in the foundry unit, and it has created a separate management board to govern it.
Should Intel take outside investors for the foundry business, Zinsner said the company was leaning toward taking a strategic investor versus a financial one. But Intel is “years away from that.”
In July, Intel disclosed that the future of its foundry business depended on securing a big customer for its next-generation manufacturing process known as 14A. Failing that, it could get out of the foundry business altogether.
On Thursday, Zinsner downplayed the potential risk to its foundry. “The lawyers are always looking for areas where we should be elaborating in terms of our risks,” he said.
Intel is focused on landing a big customer next year but is committed to maintaining ""financial discipline"" while developing the next-generation manufacturing technology and technique, Zinsner said. The investment in 14A for only Intel's internal use is too great to provide an ""appropriate"" return on investment for shareholders, he said.",981e230d8ccab1f7ef5681d94faeffd9,trafilatura

The long-term rate eased to 6.56% from 6.58% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.35%.
Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, were unchanged from last week. The average rate held steady at 5.69%. A year ago, it was 5.51%, Freddie Mac said.
Shop Top Mortgage Rates
Elevated mortgage rates have added to a slump in the U.S. housing market that began in early 2022, when rates began climbing from pandemic lows.
For much of the year, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage has hovered relatively close to its 2025 high of just above 7%, set in mid-January. It’s has mostly trended lower six weeks in a row and is now at the lowest level since Oct. 24, when it averaged 6.54%.
The recent downward trend in mortgage rates bodes well for prospective homebuyers who have been held back by stubbornly high home financing costs. But it has yet to translate into a turnaround for home sales, which have remained sluggish this year after sinking in 2024 to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.
Economists generally expect the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain near the mid-6% range this year.
Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors’ expectations for the economy and inflation.
The main barometer is the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans. The yield was at 4.21% at midday Thursday, down from 4.24% late Wednesday.
The yield has been mostly easing since mid-July as bond traders weighed data on inflation, the job market and how the potential economic impact of the Trump administration’s tariffs may influence the Fed’s interest rate policy moves.
In a high-profile speech last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled the central bank may cut rates soon even as inflation risks remain elevated.
Powell noted that there are risks of both rising unemployment and stubbornly higher inflation, and suggested that with hiring sluggish, the job market could weaken further. That could warrant the Fed adjusting its “policy stance,” he said.
The central bank has so far been hesitant to cut interest rates out of fear that Trump’s tariffs could push inflation higher, but data showing hiring slowed last month have fueled speculation that the Fed will cut its main short-term interest rate next month.",06c4b9eae09b10922d48fb9ad1360823,trafilatura

(NASDAQ:MRVL) is one of the Trending AI Stocks on Wall Street. Marvell Technologies is set to report its second-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings on Thursday, August 28. Wells Fargo believes that the company will report stable guidance and momentum in its custom silicon business.
The firm has projected revenue of $2.01 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.67, in line with Wall Street consensus of $2.01 billion and $0.67 per share respectively. Meanwhile, gross margin will likely stay near 59.5%, whereas operating expenses at about $495 million.
Data center revenue, representing more than three-quarters of the company’s total, is anticipated to grow by a mid-single-digit percentage from the previous quarter. Enterprise networking and carrier infrastructure will likely grow at a similar pace.
Three men discussing a finance report
One area expected to play a pivotal role in the earnings print is custom silicon. Wells Fargo projects Marvell’s custom silicon revenue to reach $427 million in the quarter, up 12% from the previous period. The segment would make up almost one-third of data center revenue and about 23% of the company’s total.
Investors should also be looking out for optics, with revenue anticipated to expand at a 21% compound annual growth rate between fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2028 on the back of artificial intelligence demand and data center buildouts.
Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) engages in the development and production of semiconductors, focusing heavily on data centers.

You can sign up to receive this newsletter every week via email here.
On a recent episode of the TBPN podcast, Jordi Hays asked his cohost John Coogan whether his life would really be that much worse if he couldn’t access generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude. Would AI’s absence be as disruptive, he asks, as the sudden disappearance of smartphones, or TVs, or electricity? Coogan conceded it wouldn’t. The real-life impact of AI varies—someone going through a hard time might find relief in the counsel of a chatbot—but it’s reasonable to judge the technology in societal and historical terms, because that’s how its biggest cheerleaders and hype-spreaders frame it.
So the question becomes, “What is the real progress of the AI revolution?” Based on the past two years and nine months since ChatGPT’s debut, should we believe generative AI will change the world on the scale of the industrial revolution, the internet, or the mobile revolution?
As Financial Times politics and culture columnist Janan Ganesh notes in a recent op-ed, those predicting that generative AI will usher in abundance and well-being are the ones working closest to the technology and presumably understand it best. But they are also the ones with the most to gain from overselling it, and the most reluctant to admit they’ve dedicated their careers to something with only modest impact.
To be sure, generative AI is an amazing technology. Anyone who has used ChatGPT’s Deep Research, Anthropic’s Computer Use feature, or Google’s Veo 3 video generator can see that. It’s also the fastest-adopted technology in modern history: Gen AI apps reached 39.4% adoption among U.S. adults in just two years, compared to the four years it took for smartphones to hit 35% adoption following the iPhone’s 2007 launch.
Yet adoption hasn’t translated to willingness to pay. Only about 3% of users subscribe to premium tiers, according to Menlo Ventures’ State of Consumer AI report. (Mobile computing, by contrast, always required buying a handset and a cellular plan.) Globally, AI apps are bringing in only about $12 billion in annual revenue from 1.8 billion users. Two of generative AI’s biggest players, OpenAI and Anthropic, remain far from profitability. Meanwhile, Nvidia, which sells the chips that power AI, made $130 billion last fiscal year. OpenAI and Anthropic remain far from profitability.
In the late summer of 2025 generative AI’s honeymoon period may be coming to an end. Consumers and businesses are less interested in being dazzled and more focused on actually being helped by it. The attention has shifted to whether AI can actually overhaul aging business practices. And AI is indeed making some tasks, like coding, more efficient, saving time and sometimes payroll. But few CTOs are claiming generative AI is transforming their business, at least not yet.
Large enterprises are pouring money into AI projects, but many stall. An MIT report last week shook investors by finding that 95% of enterprise AI projects fail to substantially improve efficiency or profits. The research shows that the models aren’t the problem; the challenge is integrating them into company data, workflows, and infrastructure. In other words, it’s an application problem—one that’s lingered since 2023.
AI companies seem to recognize this. Covering them, I hear less talk of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and “superintelligence,” and less emphasis on monolithic models that can do everything. In reality, most AI workloads are handled by teams of specialized models. (OpenAI even described GPT-5 not as a “model” but as a “system” of models.)
Generative AI is technically complex and hard to grasp in detail. But that shouldn’t mean its impact can only be judged by those inside AI labs or big tech companies. What really matters is whether it measurably boosts productivity in business, and whether it leaves societies healthier, better educated, freer, more prosperous, more creative, and less bored at work.
Anthropic’s settlement with authors could set a precedent in future copyright cases
Anthropic is poised to settle a lawsuit brought by a group of authors who alleged the company trained its Claude models on their copyrighted books. A court filing Tuesday shows the parties have agreed on preliminary terms. Judge William Alsup gave them until September 5 to finalize the details and submit the proposed settlement.
In June, Alsup ruled that Anthropic’s use of digitized books qualified as “fair use” under the Copyright Act, but that the company had obtained the works unlawfully from a “shadow library” (including the notorious LibGen site). In late July, he certified that the class could include any author whose copyrighted book Anthropic downloaded from such libraries, meaning the company could have faced damages of $150,000 per book across potentially thousands of titles. Instead, Anthropic opted to settle.
Like its peers, Anthropic relies on vast amounts of online text to pretrain its large language models (LLMs). These models process data for weeks or months to build an understanding of language and context, forming a basic knowledge of how the world works. Content owners continue to sue AI companies over this practice, with several major cases still ongoing.
In his June ruling, Alsup addressed the broader issue at the heart of these lawsuits, writing that AI companies use copyrighted content in a “transformative” way—even when an LLM is just memorizing text—and therefore in a manner protected by “fair use.” That reasoning could become the defining legacy of Bartz v. Anthropic.",96e0898cad7d130b46467061007746ad,trafilatura

Sugar prices today are mixed, with London sugar reaching a six-week high. London sugar is moving higher today after Pakistan said it is seeking 100,000 MT of refined white sugar. Pakistan's government said back in June that it would import as much as 750,000 MT of sugar this year to ensure domestic availability at affordable prices.
Sugar also has a positive carryover from Tuesday, when Conab, Brazil's government crop forecasting agency, cut its Brazil 2025/26 production estimate by 3.1% to 44.5 MMT from a previous estimate of 45.9 MMT.
Sugar prices have been under pressure over the past two weeks, posting 2-week lows last Monday due to the outlook for lower sugar production in Brazil. Last Monday, Covrig Analytics reported that Brazil's sugar mills are prioritizing sugar production over ethanol, crushing more cane for sugar. This trend is expected to continue as harvesting peaks, driven by drier cane crops that prompt mills to produce more sugar.
On August 12, NY sugar rallied to a 2.5-month high on concerns over weaker cane yields in Brazil. On August 15, Unica reported that Brazil's Center-South sugar output in the second half of July fell by -0.8% y/y to 3,614 MT, and the 2025-26 Center-South sugar output through July fell -7.8% y/y to 19,268 MT. However, the percentage of sugarcane crushed for sugar by Brazil's sugar mills in the second half of July increased to 54.10% from 50.32% the same time last year. Also, Conab said last month that 2024/25 Brazil sugar production fell by -3.4% y/y to 44.118 MMT, citing lower sugarcane yields due to drought and excessive heat.
The outlook for higher sugar exports from India is negative for sugar prices after Bloomberg reported that India may permit local sugar mills to export sugar in the next season, which starts in October, as abundant monsoon rains may produce a bumper sugar crop. India's Meteorological Department reported last Friday that cumulative monsoon rain in India was 650.3 mm as of August 22, or 2% above normal. Also, the Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association recently said that it will seek permission to export 2 MMT of sugar in 2025/26.
The outlook for higher sugar production in India, the world's second-largest producer, is bearish for prices. On June 2, India's National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories projected that India's 2025/26 sugar production would climb +19% y/y to 35 MMT, citing larger planted cane acreage. That would follow a -17.5% y/y decline in India's sugar production in 2024/25 to a 5-year low of 26.2 MMT, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).
Sugar prices retreated through early July, with NY sugar falling to a 4.25-year low and London sugar sliding to a 4-year low, driven by expectations of a sugar surplus in the 2025/26 season. On June 30, commodities trader Czarnikow projected a 7.5 MMT global sugar surplus for the 2025/26 season, the largest surplus in 8 years. On May 22, the USDA, in its biannual report, projected that global 2025/26 sugar production would increase by +4.7% y/y to a record 189.318 MMT, with global sugar ending stocks at 41.188 MMT, up 7.5% y/y.
The outlook for higher sugar production in Thailand is bearish for sugar prices. On May 2, Thailand's Office of the Cane and Sugar Board reported that Thailand's 2024/25 sugar production rose +14% y/y to 10.00 MMT. Thailand is the world's third-largest sugar producer and the second-largest exporter of sugar.
The International Sugar Organization (ISO) raised its 2024/25 global sugar deficit forecast to a 9-year high of -5.47 MMT on May 15, up from a February forecast of -4.88 MMT. This indicates a tightening market following the 2023/24 global sugar surplus of 1.31 MMT. ISO also cut its 2024/25 global sugar production forecast to 174.8 MMT from a February forecast of 175.5 MMT.
The USDA, in its bi-annual report released May 22, projected that global 2025/26 sugar production would climb +4.7% y/y to a record 189.318 MMT and that global 2025/26 human sugar consumption would increase +1.4% y/y to a record 177.921 MMT. The USDA also forecasted that 2025/26 global sugar ending stocks would climb +7.5% y/y to 41.188 MMT. The USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) predicted that Brazil's 2025/26 sugar production would rise +2.3% y/y to a record 44.7 MMT FAS predicted that India's 2025/26 sugar production would rise +25% y/y to 35.3 MMT due to favorable monsoon rains and increased sugar acreage. FAS predicted that Thailand's 2025/26 sugar production will climb +2% y/y to 10.3 MMT.

While the division reported massive revenue of $41.1 billion, it fell just shy of the $41.34 billion consensus estimate.
However, for long-term investors, this should hardly be viewed as a setback. The dip in shares looks more like market noise than a meaningful signal. Nvidia’s underlying story remains intact as demand for its GPUs continues to outstrip supply, and the secular shift toward AI, cloud computing, and accelerated workloads provides the company with a multi-decade runway of growth. With a robust product pipeline and solid competitive positioning, Nvidia is still the top beneficiary of the AI era.
Nvidia’s Growth Drivers Remain Intact
Looking ahead, the structural drivers of Nvidia’s growth remain intact. Management estimates that global AI infrastructure investment will reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by the end of the decade, creating a multi-year growth opportunity for Nvidia, thanks to its leadership in GPUs and networking systems. The company’s innovative products translate into monetizable gains for data center operators, in turn supporting its growth.
Nvidia’s Blackwell platform has emerged as a key growth catalyst for the company. Its revenue reached record levels in Q2, growing 17% sequentially. Production shipments of the GB300 began during the quarter, while demand across cloud providers, enterprises, and government-backed AI initiatives helped fuel momentum.
Notably, adoption of the NVDA’s GB200 NVL system is already widespread among hyperscale cloud operators and consumer internet companies. Moreover, the new Blackwell Ultra platform has seen solid demand, generating tens of billions of dollars in revenue.
Importantly, the transition from the GB200 to the GB300 has been seamless. Manufacturing has scaled quickly, with factories now producing roughly 1,000 GB300 racks per week, a rate expected to increase further as new capacity comes online in the third quarter, helping to capture demand.
Networking has also become a critical growth pillar. Revenue from this segment nearly doubled year-over-year, reaching a record $7.3 billion. Nvidia’s Spectrum-X Ethernet, InfiniBand, and NVLink technologies are now key to building the massive AI factories that power today’s largest models. New solutions, such as Spectrum-XGS, are poised to further strengthen the company’s hold on data center networking by enabling even larger and more unified AI clusters.
At the same time, Nvidia is widening its growth footprint beyond hyperscale adoption. Sovereign AI initiatives are bringing its technology into national projects, while enterprise RTX Pro servers are extending its reach into corporate infrastructure. Robotics platforms like Jetson Thor and advancements in autonomous driving, powered by the new Thor SoC, demonstrate the versatility of Nvidia’s innovations across multiple industries. These efforts span healthcare, automotive, and manufacturing, building a diversified revenue base for the company.
Even Nvidia’s gaming segment, traditionally viewed as cyclical, has proven remarkably resilient. The division reached record revenue of $4.3 billion, powered by the launch of next-generation Blackwell GPUs and a significant upgrade to the company’s GeForce NOW cloud gaming service.
Nvidia’s Outlook Suggests Solid Growth
Nvidia’s outlook is equally encouraging. Nvidia expects revenue of around $54 billion in Q3, representing more than $7 billion of sequential growth, even without factoring in potential H20 shipments to China. Those sales could add another $2 billion to $5 billion, further bolstering the results.
Is Nvidia Stock a Buy-the-Dip Play?
Nvidia’s leadership in AI hardware, its robust pipeline of next-generation products, and solid demand across industries and geographies, provide the company with a multi-year growth opportunity. Wall Street analysts are also bullish about NVDA stock and maintain a “Strong Buy” rating post Q2 earnings.
In short, Nvidia remains the top AI play, and any dip in its stock is a buying opportunity for long-term investors.

The accounting talent shortage that has hamstrung the industry and many finance teams in recent years — and sparked a nationwide groundswell of support for Certified Public Accountant licensing reform — is showing some signs of easing.
The rising use of automation and generative artificial intelligence that make it easier for finance teams to complete work faster and with fewer people, along with companies’ growing appetite for outsourcing accounting to firms in such countries as the Philippines, are driving the shifts in the accounting labor landscape, according to Jack Castonguay, an associate professor of accounting at Hofstra University in New York.
“We started to see easing within the last 12 months,” Castonguay said in an interview, noting he had incorrectly believed that the shortage would persist longer but AI adoption has progressed faster than anticipated.
Signs that the power may be beginning to shift toward accounting employers have bubbled up even as the most recent data available on U.S. accounting employment show slight gains in the workforce: As of May 2024, the number of workers employed as accountants and auditors in the U.S.rose to 1.448 million, from 1.435 million in 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
But sentiment gauges of the industry outlook are gloomier. Layoffs are looming larger in the minds of workers in accounts payable departments, according to a survey of 588 AP professionals conducted in May and released Tuesday by AvidXchange and the Institute of Finance and Management.
Nearly half (45%) of respondents said they fear layoffs compared with 27% in 2024. In preparation for potential job loss, 59% of respondents said they were learning new skills including technology, while 53% are taking on “stretch” projects and 33% are earning an advanced degree.
Separately, a report from the Controllers Council on the findings from a survey of finance and accounting executives conducted from May to July states that “despite the hype about accountant shortages,” just over half (53%) of respondents reported no shortages. One third (33%) reported minor shortages, while only 10% saw “significant” shortages.
The survey also found that overall pay increases during the past 12 months fell to 3.5%, one percentage point below the year-over-year rate in 2024.
Meanwhile, there’s concern that there will be fewer lucrative jobs at a Big Four firm that many accounting graduates pin their hopes on landing right out of college. PwC plans to cut college graduate entry-level hiring of tax and assurance associates and auditing over the next three years, Business Insider reported Aug. 21. A PwC spokesperson declined to comment on the report.
Word of the forward-looking cutbacks comes on the heels of a steady drip of layoffs by some of the largest accounting firms during the past two years or so. For example, in June of 2023, KPMG said it was laying off about 1,950 employees, or roughly 5% of its workforce, with cuts extending across all of its business, including, tax, auditing and advisory services, CFO Dive previously reported.
“I think the biggest takeaway...is PwC's intention to hire less straight out of college in 2028,” Omar Roubi, an instructor of accounting at the University of Colorado Denver, said in an email. “This could mean a tightening of the accounting labor market or it could mean they are looking for more experienced individuals early on and becoming less dependent on new hires with the advent of AI.”
In addition to technology’s impact on the demand side of the talent equation, there’s a supply-side driver that could whipsaw the workforce in the coming years: longstanding concern around a shrinking pool of college students choosing to major in accounting and enter the profession has led to a push to change CPA licensing requirements to make the process less onerous.
This year to date, at least 22 states have passed laws that provide alternative paths to becoming a licensed CPA that don’t require 150 hours of college credit, typically offering optional routes that substitute extra professional experience for a fifth year of post-secondary education.
By year-end, half of all states are expected to do so, and experts forecast most states will be on board within roughly two years. The countervailing forces have some in the industry scratching their heads.
“I’m still struggling with the bigger picture...Automation and offshoring are handling more of the routine in financial reporting, leaving American CPAs responsible for the complex, judgment-heavy work,” Jeffrey Hulett, a part-time faculty member who teaches personal finance at James Madison University wrote on LinkedIn Wednesday. “Yet current proposals to reduce licensing requirements seem to lower the bar for knowledge and competence —precisely when the market most relies on it.”
To be sure, the accounting shortage remains a real concern for many employers and certain spaces in the accounting market.
“I don’t think we have an industry-wide shortage, I would say we have more of a role-based shortage,” Castonguay said, noting that financial reporting analysts at companies seem to be in short supply and that small- and medium-sized accounting firms are still reporting difficulties finding staff.
In addition, government entities report continued difficulty filling accounting roles. Cities and towns in states like Minnesota are still struggling to hire staff to complete audits as a shrinking pipeline of new accounting graduates have fallen short of what is needed to replace retiring baby-boomer CPAs, CFO Dive previously reported.
The Controllers Council survey underscored how today’s hiring challenges fall across a spectrum. The roles most difficult to fill were controller and assistant controllers (cited by 34% of respondents), with bookkeeper/financial reporting ranking second (27%) followed by what the report termed a “second tier” of titles including accounts payable (22), technical accountant (19%) accounts receivable (19%) and FP&A (18%).
Still, technology is a demand-side force to be reckoned with in the accounting labor equation. As in many industries across the board, accounting firms and corporate accounting teams have leaned on AI and that has enabled them to shrink their workforce, Roubi said.
For example, accountants deploying generative AI can upgrade the level of detail of financial reports by 12% and cut 7.5 days off the time needed to complete a monthly close, a study from researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management and Stanford University Business School found, CFO Dive previously reported.
“There is no longer a ‘shortage’ of talent,” Roubi said in an email. “We have grappled for years [with] a pipeline issue in the accounting industry. Now, the funnel at the end of the demand-side is going to shrink due to this leveraging of AI.”
Looking ahead, Castonguay is optimistic that the accounting labor market will even out. He expects accounting shortages at small- and medium-sized firms to wane as they adopt AI and ultimately pick up the graduates that the constrained Big Four may miss.
At the same time, he doesn’t expect a glut stemming from the licensing changes. Given that universities are bracing for a demographic-driven ""enrollment cliff” as the number of high school graduates declines from its 2025 peak, Castonguay believes the changes in the CPA licensing process are needed and will help build a robust accounting labor pipeline while opening the field to a wider array of students, including minorities that have been shown to be disporportionately affected be the 150-hour rule.
“We’re approaching equilibrium but a lot of levers are being pulled at the same time,” he said.

Bitcoin changed hands around $113,000, a 0.9% increase over the past day, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Solana meanwhile rose 2.3% to $212. SOL was up nearly 5% at one point before retreating.
Ethereum and XRP dropped dropped 2.7% and 0.8%, respectively. ETH was trading near $4,500, well off its all-time high set over the weekend.
Nvidia disclosed record profits on Wednesday alongside its ninth straight quarter of year-over-year revenue growth of over 50%. The company took in $46 billion during the second quarter, despite not selling any of its advanced AI chips to China over the period.
The chipmaker’s shares fell 1.3% on Thursday to $179, according to Yahoo Finance. They are still up 2.6% on the week and 34% year-to-date, signaling that conviction in artificial intelligence is continuing to drive sky-high valuations on Wall Street.
For Bitcoin, Nvidia's fortunes are relevant. The chipmaker has an 8.8% weighting in the S&P 500, so any swing in the $4.4 trillion company’s stock price could affect the market’s top cryptocurrency by market value, given the correlation between crypto and equities.
The U.S. Commerce Department said on Thursday that gross domestic product rose at an annualized rate of 3.3% in the second quarter. Economists initially expected the U.S. economy would grow at a 3.0% annualized rate, suggesting that the U.S. economy performed better under the president’s trade zig zags on tariffs and other trade policies.
Solana’s performance was notable on Thursday, considering that the latest rally in crypto prices has been marked by Ethereum’s strength and climb to a new all-time high.
Since Aug. 10, however, Solana has shown “relative strength” against Bitcoin and Ethereum, with price ratios recovering from recent lows, according to Jake Ostrovskis, an OTC transfer at the crypto market maker Wintermute.
The cryptocurrency has returned to focus amid “growing interest in treasuries targeting the asset,” Ostrovskis said. Earlier this week, The Information reported that venture capital firm Pantera Capital is seeking to raise $1.25 billion for a Nasdaq-listed vehicle that would hold Solana.
Solana treasury firms have the potential to absorb defunct crypto exchange FTX’s vesting supply of tokens, which equates to around 609,000 SOL each month. The bankrupt exchange started making repayments to customers in February.

“By converting this ‘overhang’ into staked, treasury-held assets, effective circulating supply shrinks, countering downward pressure and setting the stage for sustained upside,” Ostrovskis said.",9e32e769686fef9d8c34032b3de916cb,trafilatura

The move capped a V-shaped recovery that began with an overnight retreat to support levels around $4.98, where a high volume of buying activity took hold, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model.
After dipping from $5.07, ICP consolidated within the $4.98-$5.00 zone, establishing a base reinforced by trading volume of 372,179 units, substantially above average levels. This accumulation phase marked the turning point, as buying pressure mounted through the early session.
Momentum built steadily before culminating in a decisive breakout late in the period. ICP rose through multiple resistance barriers to touch $5.13, with the final advance fueled by a 272,186-unit volume spike. Resistance that had previously formed near $5.11 was breached, suggesting sellers were losing control of the near-term trend.
Cryptocurrencies such as ICP appear to be drawing fresh interest as alternative asset classes gain traction. The recovery and heavy accumulation at support levels may position ICP for further gains, with the next technical target in sight around $5.18 based on Fibonacci extension levels.
