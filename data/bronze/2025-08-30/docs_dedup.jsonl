It will return on Tuesday.\nBy Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\nBitcoin (BTC) has dropped nearly 3% to $109,800 in the past 24 hours, pulling the broader market, including ether (ETH), down with it. But those losses are nothing out of the ordinary, meaning major tokens are trading near recent valuations.\nWhat's new today is that BTC's volatility is bouncing from recent multiyear lows (See Chart of the Day). The 30-day implied volatility, as represented by Volmex's BVIV and Deribit's DVOL indices, has surged above the 100-day simple moving average for the first time since mid-June. Perhaps the price turbulence that some traders predicted for August may unfold in September.\nThe increase could be noteworthy for stock traders as an early indicator of a potential uptick in Wall Street’s VIX. The VIX is inversely correlated with stocks, suggesting there's of a rough day ahead on Wall Street, a possibility underlined by fiat liquidity dynamics.\n\"Market liquidity pressures are mounting as reserve balances decline and large Treasury settlements approach, leaving equities vulnerable despite lower volatility,\" Michael Kramer, the founder of Mott Capital Management, wrote in the latest edition of the firm's markets update.\nOne piece of data to keep an eye on is the U.S. core PCE release, due later today.\n\"This PCE release will shape the Fed’s future easing path rather than the September decision itself,\" analysts from crypto exchange Bitunix wrote in an email. \"If data comes in at or below expectations, risk sentiment can hold; but if significantly hotter, the Fed’s forward guidance may shift toward a 'one-and-wait' stance. Investors should focus on core services and wage trends, alongside U.S. Treasury yields and the DXY as key drivers of risk appetite.\"\nIn the event of a soft CPI, ether may outperform because traders have been increasingly focusing on Ethereum's native token. That's evident from the ETF flows. This week, the U.S.-listed ETH ETFs have registered a net inflow of over $1 billion, SoSoValue data show. That's close to double the $567 million entering the bitcoin ETFs.\nIn traditional markets, the spread between the U.S. 10- and two-year Treasury yields has risen to the highest since September 2022. The so-called curve steepening supports the bullish case in gold and bitcoin.

Pump.fun (PUMP) still led with $156.9 million, but was still down 44% as memecoin frenzy cooled.\nAxiom was the outlier, surging 641% to $126.6 million, showing how fast protocol-specific growth can offset broader ecosystem weakness. Jupiter (JUP) earned $66.4 million (–16%), while Phantom and Photon were hit hardest with declines of 65% and 72%, respectively.\nDespite revenue losses, DeFi TVL on Solana climbed 30% to $8.6 billion in the quarter and has since crossed $11 billion, cementing the chain as the largest DeFi network behind Ethereum.\nKamino Finance drove TVL growth, up 34% to $2.1 billion after introducing Kamino Lend V2, which attracted $200 million in deposits and $80 million in loans within three weeks. Kamino now controls 25% of Solana’s market share.\nRaydium staged a strong comeback, rising 54% to $1.8 billion in TVL, reclaiming second place from Jupiter. It now commands 21% share versus Jupiter’s 19%.\nTrading activity, however, told a different story: Average daily spot DEX volume fell 45% to $2.5 billion, reflecting a fading of the memecoin momentum that had fueled the previous quarter's records.\nDerivatives Positioning\nOpen interest (OI) in futures tied to the top 20 coins, excluding SOL, has decreased in the past 24 hours, indicating broad-based capital outflows.\nSOL's open interest, however, hit a record high 63.84 million, alongside a rally in the token's price to $217, a level last seen in February.\nThe eight-hour funding rates for ether, tron and BNB flipped slightly negative, indicating a bias for bearish bets on a drop in prices. Funding rates for other major tokens were steady at around zero, indicating neutral sentiment.\nOI in the CME bitcoin futures slipped to 135.72K BTC, the lowest since April, while ether OI remained elevated at record highs near 2.10 million ETH. The divergence suggests a continued preference among investors for ETH over BTC.\nOn Deribit, downside bias in BTC options has strengthened across all tenors, with puts trading at a five volatility premium to calls at the front end. ETH options display similar dynamics, marking a shift from bullish positioning early this week.\nOn Paradigm, block flows featured call selling and put rolling strategies in BTC and ETH. Market maker Wintermute pointed to demand for call spreads in the December expiry BTC options.\nMarket Movements\nBTC is down 1.87% from 4 p.m. ET Thursday at $109,828.05 (24hrs: +1.95%)\nETH is down 2.66% at $4,013.41 (24hrs: -5.69%)\nCoinDesk 20 is down 2.52% at 4,168.55 (24hrs: -3.73%)\nEther CESR Composite Staking Rate is up 2 bps at 2.92%\nBTC funding rate is at 0.0056% (6.0992% annualized) on Binance\nDXY is up 0.14% at 97.95\nGold futures are down 0.18% at $3,467.90\nSilver futures are down 0.54% at $39.49\nNikkei 225 closed down 0.26% at 42,718.47\nHang Seng closed up 0.32% at 25,077.62\nFTSE is down 0.27% at 9,192.27\nEuro Stoxx 50 is down 0.52% at 5,368.49\nDJIA closed on Thursday up 0.16% at 45,636.90\nS&P 500 closed up 0.32% at 6,501.86\nNasdaq Composite closed up 0.53% at 21,705.16\nS&P\/TSX Composite closed unchanged at 28,434.80\nS&P 40 Latin America closed up 1.07% at 2,770.74\nU.S. 10-Year Treasury rate is up 1.8 bps at 4.225%\nE-mini S&P 500 futures are down 0.32% at 6,496.75\nE-mini Nasdaq-100 futures are down 0.47% at 23,657.75\nE-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average Index are down 0.34% at 45,551.00\nBitcoin Stats\nBTC Dominance: 58.41% (+0.25%)\nEther-bitcoin ratio: 0.03954 (-1.35%)\nHashrate (seven-day moving average): 978 EH\/s\nHashprice (spot): $53.73\nTotal fees: 3.3 BTC \/ $371,906\nCME Futures Open Interest: 135,720 BTC\nBTC priced in gold: 32.2 oz.\nBTC vs gold market cap: 9.11%\nTechnical Analysis\nThe chart shows XRP's price is stuck within the Ichimoku cloud, indicating a clear directional bias in the market.\nA move below the cloud would confirm a bearish trend shift, opening the way for a deeper decline.\nThe price has already established a downtrend since peaking at $3.65 in July.\nCrypto Equities\nCoinbase Global (COIN): closed on Thursday at $308.47 (-0.16%), -1.53% at $303.75 in pre-market\nCircle (CRCL): closed at $130.94 (+2.78%), -0.69% at $130.04\nGalaxy Digital (GLXY): closed at $24.51 (+0.41%), -2.08% at $24\nBullish (BLSH): closed at $64.43 (+0.7%), -2.5% at $62.82\nMARA Holdings (MARA): closed at $15.96 (+0.69%), -2.26% at $15.60\nRiot Platforms (RIOT): closed at $13.8 (+1.84%), -1.88% at $13.54\nCore Scientific (CORZ): closed at $14.35 (+1.06%), -1.74% at $14.10\nCleanSpark (CLSK): closed at $9.55 (-0.31%), -1.26% at $9.43\nCoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI): closed at $29.67 (+1.23%), +0.78% at $29.90\nExodus Movement (EXOD): closed at $26.16 (-4%), unchanged in pre-market\nCrypto Treasury Companies\nStrategy (MSTR): closed at $338.84 (-0.94%), -1.84% at $332.60\nSemler Scientific (SMLR): closed at $30.63 (+0.23%), -0.2% at $30.57\nSharpLink Gaming (SBET): closed at $18.46 (-4.2%), -3.14% at $17.88\nUpexi (UPXI): closed at $8.09 (-1.58%), -5.32% at $7.66\nVolmex's BVIV index, which represents bitcoin's 30-day implied volatility, has risen above the 100-day simple moving average for the first time since April.\nThe uptick could be an early indicator of an impending rise in Wall Street's so-called fear gauge, the VIX index.\nWhile You Were Sleeping\nChina Says Stronger Ties With India Is in Interest of Both Sides (Bloomberg): China’s Foreign Ministry said Xi’s 2024 meeting with Modi restarted relations, stressing there was no “secret diplomacy” and that both sides are resuming dialogue while seeking a long-term strategic framework.\nStand Up to Trump on Big Tech, Says EU Antitrust Chief (Financial Times): The European Commission’s executive vice president said Brussels may walk away from a new trade deal if Trump demands weakening of the bloc's Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act.\nBitcoin Headed to $190K on Institutional Wave, Research Firm Says (CoinDesk): Tiger Research argues record liquidity, ETF accumulation and Trump’s 401(k) order give bitcoin its strongest institutional setup in years, though weak retail activity and on-chain signals show risks remain.","content_hash":"de234e2b41f5bd2da2ccbf5c64d46403","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":12082,"method_rank":0}

The two have clashed previously over her decisions, including earlier this month when Gabbard declassified a lightly redacted document related to Russian election interference.\nTwo former government officials said their read of the situation is that Gabbard is under pressure to regain President Donald Trump's confidence. Gabbard fell out of favor with Trump and his aides earlier this year after she posted a video and delivered testimony about Iran's nuclear capabilities.\nBut the tensions between Gabbard and Trump seem to have subsided for now. When Gabbard announced the security clearance removals last week, she said some of the 37 current and former officials were engaged in \"politicization or weaponization of intelligence\" and that she was acting on the president's orders.\nMore from NBC News:\nAnd on Tuesday, as he presided over a Cabinet meeting before television cameras, Trump praised Gabbard. \"You found some interesting things, Tulsi,\" Trump said. \"She's becoming a bigger and bigger star every day.\"\nOne of the former government officials said Gabbard appeared to be trying to show the president she was exposing Democrats and political enemies, including some purportedly inside the CIA. The security clearance removals reflected \"a battle between Gabbard and Ratcliffe,\" the former official said.\nThe director of national intelligence position was created after the Sept. 11 attacks in an effort to ensure close coordination among the country's spy agencies.\nThere have been turf wars and personality clashes in the past between some DNIs and CIA directors. During Barack Obama's presidency, Dennis Blair was often at loggerheads with the CIA chief, Leon Panetta, and he ultimately resigned after 16 months on the job.\nBut in this case, the current director of national intelligence appears to be seeking the president's support, former officials said, by doubling down on accusations against former Democratic administrations and punishing members of a perceived \"deep state\" of anti-Trump government bureaucrats.\nApart from highlighting the divide between Gabbard and Ratcliffe, the episode also illustrates the effect of a widening and unpredictable purge of career government officials deemed insufficiently loyal.\nThe fired analyst\nThe CIA officer whom Gabbard publicly identified and stripped of her security clearance was a veteran analyst. NBC News is not naming the employee for her protection. A former colleague said she is declining interviews.\nDays earlier, she had worked intensely to help prepare the White House team for a summit in Alaska between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, former intelligence agency colleagues said. She was due to take up a new assignment for the CIA in Europe, according to three sources with knowledge of the matter.\nAfter the summit, the CIA informed the analyst that she had lost her security clearance, effectively ending her career. \"She did most of the prep for the Putin summit and to this day has no idea why her clearance was removed,\" said a former colleague, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing fear of retaliation from the Trump administration.\nGabbard and her office failed to properly coordinate the move with the CIA before revoking the security clearances of the 37 current and former officials, said a U.S. official and a source with knowledge of the matter. It appeared that Gabbard and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence were unaware of the CIA employee's covert mission, the official added.\n\"ODNI didn't meaningfully consult with the agency,\" the official told NBC News.\nODNI spokesperson Olivia Coleman defended Gabbard's decision, saying in an email it was designed to ensure \"individuals who have violated the trust placed in them by weaponizing, politicizing, manipulating, or leaking classified intelligence are no longer allowed to do so.\"\nIn a social media post, Coleman added: \"No one was 'blindsided.' We coordinated with all agencies before sending the letter.\" Coleman said the memo from Gabbard revoking security clearances \"listed names and not agency affiliations, meaning @DNIGabbard did not out any 'undercover' officer.\"\nAsked about relations between the two spy chiefs, CIA spokeswoman Liz Lyons said: \"Director Ratcliffe and the president's entire elite national security team are committed to eradicating the politicization of intelligence and are focused on executing President Trump's national security priorities, and keeping the American people safe.\"\nThe Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal first reported the incident.\nThe fired CIA analyst had previously worked as a national intelligence officer specializing in Russia and Eurasia and had been ordered to help organize the assessment of Russia's interference in the 2016 election. Since Trump returned to the White House in January, the administration has taken action against officials who took part in the Russia investigation, those who prosecuted Jan. 6 rioters and those who pursued criminal cases against Trump.\nA former senior intelligence official, Larry Pfeiffer, said it would be reckless not to confer with the employee's spy agency before rescinding their security clearance and revealing their identity. He said that could put an officer at risk and jeopardize relations with a foreign government.\n\"Look, it's just common sense to consult with the agency that would be most impacted by a decision to pull the clearance of one of their employees,\" Pfeiffer said, \"especially in such a public manner.\"\nOngoing friction\nThe episode underscored continuing friction between Gabbard and Ratcliffe. The rift has been apparent across Washington, known to lawmakers, intelligence community employees and Pentagon officials.\nIn July, Gabbard declassified a 2020 report from the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee on Russia's interference in the 2016 election. She did this over the objections of some CIA officials, who argued the details should remain secret to protect sensitive spying sources and methods, NBC News previously reported.\nGabbard also raised eyebrows at the CIA when she unveiled plans to move preparation of the president's daily intelligence briefing from CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, to the national intelligence director's office a few miles away, in McLean.\nPresidents regularly receive a classified intelligence briefing, a digital document presented by senior officials that can shape a commander in chief's decision-making. While Gabbard oversees and approves the presidential daily brief, a large staff of analysts and other employees at the CIA compiles the briefing, creating detailed text, graphics and videos based on the latest intelligence.\nDozens of intelligence officials fired\nFormer intelligence officials say the CIA analyst is one of dozens of career employees at the country's spy agencies who have been abruptly fired or forced out in recent months for purported disloyalty. They have been ousted without being told of the evidence for the decision or having a chance to defend themselves.\nLegal experts say Trump has wielded his authority over security clearances unlike any previous president, using it as a tool to punish former officials who have criticized him and to silence dissent in the government.\nThe administration has defended its actions, saying those who were stripped of their security clearance had allegedly politicized intelligence for partisan purposes, had failed to safeguard classified material, had failed to adhere to professional intelligence \"analytic tradecraft standards\" or engaged in unspecified \"detrimental\" conduct. Gabbard, in announcing the move, did not provide evidence for these claims.\nThe 37 people targeted by Gabbard last week were mostly former officials who worked in national security roles during the Obama and Biden administrations. Of the 37 listed, 25 had signed a letter in 2019, when they were private citizens, backing efforts by Democratic lawmakers to launch an impeachment inquiry into whether Trump abused his power when he asked Ukraine's government to look for derogatory information about his political rival, Joe Biden.\nRight-wing activist and Trump ally Laura Loomer, who portrays herself as exposing \"disloyal\" government officials and civil servants, had flagged the 2019 letter in a recent social media post.\nRevoking former intelligence officials' security clearances could damage their reputation and limit their long-term ability to find jobs, former officials said. Security clearances are a standard requirement for many senior posts at defense and technology companies with federal contracts.\nApart from the CIA analyst, there were at least two other current intelligence officers on Gabbard's list. One was Vinh Nguyen at the National Security Agency, who colleagues say was recognized as the intelligence community's top mind on cutting-edge technology such as artificial intelligence. The government recruited Nguyen at the age of 17 and he was the youngest NSA employee ever promoted to a senior position, former colleagues said.\nFormer intelligence officers described him as a generational genius who could not be replaced. \"The U.S. government is the big loser here,\" said a former senior intelligence official, referring to Nguyen's ouster.\nIn 2016, when Nguyen was a national intelligence officer overseeing cybersecurity, he was asked to help direct the intelligence assessment of Russia's interference in the 2016 elections. The assessment by U.S. spy agencies concluded that Russia had waged information warfare to try to undermine Hillary Clinton's candidacy and help Trump.\nBut Trump and Gabbard have dismissed the assessment as false and part of a conspiracy they claim Obama and his aides orchestrated. A bipartisan Senate investigation overseen by then-Sen. Marco Rubio later endorsed the findings of the intelligence assessment that Putin sought to help Trump win. The Russian leader also later said himself that he wanted to see Trump prevail.\nThe officials who lost their security clearances also included two former career intelligence officers who delivered the daily intelligence briefing to Trump during his first term. Several others on the list said they no longer have active security clearances and learned that they were on the roster from social media.\n'No rhyme or reason'\nYael Eisenstat, a former CIA officer, wrote on social media that she was among those on Gabbard's list, though her last name was misspelled. Eisenstat said she left government more than a decade ago and did not need any security clearance for her work.\nBut she expressed outrage at Gabbard's action. In her social media post, she said \"the notion that the government can target former and current officers' clearances for political purposes without due process demonstrates yet another direct attack on democratic norms.\"\nMark Zaid, an attorney who is representing Eisenstat and several other people on the list, said the revocation of the security clearances \"literally has no rhyme or reason\" and carried echoes of the McCarthy era. The move was undertaken without due process, and the announcement from Gabbard employed \"defamatory generalized allegations,\" according to Zaid, who himself had his security clearance removed in a previous action.\n\"This act was nothing short of unlawful and disregarded decades of established precedent. Given the last six months, it is clear this administration has chosen to weaponize the security clearance process, which would make the late Senator Joseph McCarthy proud,\" Zaid said.","content_hash":"07c67aae12e3330803c96fe32019f8bd","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":11994,"method_rank":0}

We chose it as one of the best small business savings accounts out there but here's a breakdown of everything you need to know about the account.\nLive Oak Business Savings account review\nOffers in this section are from affiliate partners and selected based on a combination of engagement, product relevance, compensation, and consistent availability.\n3.46% with a daily balance of $5,000,000 or below; 4.42% with a daily balance above $5,000,000\n$100 to open account\n3.15%\nNone\nCompare offers\nLive Oak Business Savings\nAnnual Percentage Yield (APY)\n3.15%\nMinimum deposit\nNone\nMonthly maintenance fee\nNone\nSpecial offer\nNone\nMaximum transactions\nUp to 6 free withdrawals or transfers per statement cycle\nExcessive transactions fee\n$10\nOverdraft fees\n$25\nOffer checking account?\nNo\nOffer ATM card?\nNo\nTerms apply.\nPros\n- Above-average APY\n- No minimum deposit required to open account\n- No monthly fees\nCons\n- No welcome offer\n- No physical branches to do in-person banking\n- No checking account option\nAPY\nThe Live Oak Business Savings account currently offers 3.15% APY on your account balance. You must deposit at least $0.01 to begin earning interest. Unlike some other business banking options, Live Oak doesn't offer a tiered APY system for earning the highest return.\nAccess to your cash\nCustomers can link an external bank account (like a personal checking account) to their Live Oak Business account in order to transfer their cash. If the transfer is initiated before 4pm EST then funds should be available in your personal bank account within 1–2 business days.\nAnd to add funds to your account, you can have clients send you an ACH transfer, which will be immediately available to you in your account. You can also deposit checks mailed by your clients (either through the mobile app or by mailing the check to the bank's physical headquarters), but these will be held for up to five days before you can use it, even if it is posted to your account the same day. This is so the bank can verify the details of the transfer.\nKeep in mind that you won't be able to deposit physical cash into your account.\nPerks\nLive Oak doesn't offer much in the way of perks for its business savings account, but users can connect QuickBooks to their account for easy expense tracking.\nYou can also add up to five authorized signers to your business savings account. An authorized signer is someone who given permission to manage account transactions on behalf of the business. So they can typically sign checks, close accounts and make deposits and withdrawals, so you'll want to be very discerning about who you choose as an authorized signer for your account, if this is something you choose to use.\nAnother standout feature is that while Live Oak does offer FDIC insurance up to the standard $250,000, it also offers extended coverage. Extended coverage entails putting money beyond the $250,000 into Live Oak's Insured Cash Sweep account, which provides FDIC insurance up to $10 million. Live Oak is able to offer this because it's part of the IntraFi Network Deposits. At least 3,000 banks are also part of this network. So while it's not technically a feature built into the business account, it is still something offered to you as a Live Oak customer.\nIn order to use the Insured Cash Sweep program, you'll need a minimum balance of $350,000.\nFees\nThe Live Oak Business Savings account doesn't charge a monthly maintenance fee and also doesn't have a minimum balance requirement.\nHowever, there is a dormant account fee you should be aware of. Accounts are considered dormant if they have a balance of less than $10.01 and haven't had any activity for more than 24 straight months. Live Oak defines \"no activity\" as no withdrawals, no deposits, no contact with a Customer Success Manager, and no customer log-ins to their online banking site.\nThe dormant account fee is equivalent to the account balance or $10, whichever is less, but the fee will not overdraw your account. Once you're charged the fee, your account will be closed.\nIf you need to stop a payment from going through from your account, you'll be charged a $25 stop payment fee. And if customers return an item that you're selling there will be a $5 returned item fee. You'll also be charged fees for wires — a $10 incoming wire fee, a $19 fee for an outgoing domestic standard wire, $40 for an outgoing international standard wire and a $35 returned wire fee.\nHow does it compare?\nIf you still aren't convinced the Live Oak Business Savings account is for you, it helps to see how it stacks up against other accounts on the market.\nThe Capital One Business Savings Account, for instance, might be appealing if you value going with an account behind a strong household name like Capital One. But this account has several key differences that set it apart from Live Oak's Business Savings account. For starters, the Capital One account has a $3 monthly maintenance fee whereas the Live Oak account doesn't have that fee at all (though, there is the option to waive the Capital One fee as long as you keep a minimum monthly balance of at least $300.\nAlso, the Capital One account has a $250 minimum deposit required to open the account — again, Live Oak doesn't have a minimum open amount. So the trade off of going with Capital One's household recognition and access to in-person branches may be having to meet higher minimums and possibly pay more in fees if you can't reach those minimums.\nCapital One Business Savings\nAnnual Percentage Yield (APY)\nEarn a promotional interest rate for the first 3 months.

Axos Bank also doesn't have physical locations, unlike Capital One, but Axos Bank currently offers a higher APY on the savings account than Live Oak does, which means you can earn more for your deposits.

(NYSE:IBM), one of the world's oldest and largest technology companies, finds itself at a crossroads in 2025. The company continues to transition from legacy hardware toward hybrid cloud, artificial intelligence (AI), and consulting services, positioning itself as a partner for digital transformation among Fortune 500 clients. Yet the market's confidence in IBM's growth prospects has fluctuated, which is reflected in its volatile stock and mixed analyst ratings.\nThis article provides a full overview of IBM's current share price, long-range forecasts for 2025, 2026, and 2030, and an assessment of the headwinds and upside scenarios shaping IBM's story today.\nIBM is trading at $239 as of August 2025, reflecting moderation from recent highs as the tech sector faces ongoing rotation and macro uncertainty. The stock has swung substantially, trading well below its 50-day SMA of $272 and slightly under its 200-day SMA, mirroring a growing sense of bearish sentiment on Wall Street. The one-year Fear & Greed Index reading of 39 (Fear) indicates prevailing caution about IBM's short- and mid-term outlooks. Despite a trailing P\/E of nearly 39 and forward P\/E of roughly 22, IBM's valuation is notably above its historical tech peer averages, a sign that investors are cautiously optimistic about cloud transition but wary of near-term earnings risk.\nIBM's price has fluctuated with sector and market sentiment, showing only 11 green days out of the last 30 and 7.2% volatility, according to CoinCodex. While the company continues to ride macro themes like AI adoption, digitalization, and cybersecurity, investors are weighing these opportunities against a backdrop of competition from more nimble cloud-native firms and threats from legacy business erosion.\nDon’t Miss:\nAnalyst sentiment remains mixed. IBM currently has a consensus Hold rating based on Benzinga's poll of 22 analysts. The consensus price target sits at $236.48, bracketed by a high of $325 (Wedbush, June 2025) and a low of $140 (MoffettNathanson, January 2023). The three most recent ratings by UBS, JP Morgan, and BofA Securities in July 2025 average a $266.67 target, implying an 11.3% potential upside from current levels for investors expecting IBM to execute on its transition strategy.\nThe forecast range in this table is based on algorithmic projections provided by CoinCodex. These models use historical price trends, volatility patterns, and moving averages to estimate future stock prices over multiple time horizons.\nIBM's road ahead remains deeply debated as the company balances its legacy, brand recognition, and enterprise relationships with the need to adapt to fast-changing tech realities.\n-\nIBM's continued investment in cloud, AI, and cybersecurity bolstered by its Red Hat acquisition positions it for recurring revenue and long-term relevance in digital transformation.\n-\nStrategic partnerships and legacy client renewals support stable cash flows, giving management leeway to drive innovation and evolve service lines.\n-\nSteady dividend payouts and relative earnings stability provide downside protection, attracting income-focused investors.\n-\nLegacy business headwinds persist, with mainframe and hardware revenue under ongoing pressure as clients shift to public cloud solutions.\n-\nIBM faces intense competition from cloud-first giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, limiting its pricing power and growth momentum.\n-\nConsistently high volatility and a lack of strong, sustained profitability dampen broad institutional interest and cap the company's valuation.\nForecast Range: $213 – $262\nFor 2025, CoinCodex forecasts a price range between $213 and $262, with an average projection of $237. The outlook highlights a market grappling with IBM's execution risk: While ongoing cloud growth could move the stock toward the upper band, any delays in business transformation or competitive stumbles might keep the price soft. The bearish consensus, combined with cautious analyst ratings, reflects near-term skepticism even as IBM remains strategically positioned in several high-potential sectors.\nForecast Range: $175 – $279\nLooking to 2026, price targets widen quite a bit, spanning $175 to $279 with a steady average estimate of $216. The bull narrative contends that IBM's hybrid cloud and AI integration will yield compounding growth if successfully executed. Competitive headwinds and margin pressures continue to represent sizable risks to upside.\nForecast Range: $130 – $285\nBy 2030, projections stretch further, from $130 at the low end to $285 at the high, with an average around $171. This spread underscores the uncertainty surrounding IBM's transformation and market adaptability. Investors banking on IBM for long-term exposure to enterprise tech must be prepared for ongoing volatility and periodic business model reinvention.\nIBM continues to attract a diverse set of investors, from traditional value seekers who appreciate its longstanding dividend history and embedded relationships with Fortune 500 clients to those aiming for exposure to transformative trends in cloud computing and artificial intelligence. The company's resilient cash flow and continued presence in critical enterprise IT sectors offer a sense of stability, making it a reliable choice for investors focused on income and defensive positioning during periods of market uncertainty. Meanwhile, IBM's strategic moves such as acquiring Red Hat and building out its AI offerings give growth-minded investors a reason to monitor the name even if the payoff may require more patience than its tech peers.\nDespite these advantages, meaningful risks cloud IBM's investment appeal. The ongoing transition from legacy mainframe and hardware businesses to higher-growth areas has proven slow and occasionally costly. The company faces persistent competitive threats from cloud-native giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google which have faster innovation cycles, broader SaaS portfolios, and deeper cloud infrastructure penetration. At the same time, IBM's heavy investments in R&D and M&A often pressure margins, raising further questions about how quickly the company can reap rewards from these initiatives and satisfy shareholder expectations for growth.\nWith IBM trading at an elevated valuation compared to its historical average and carrying only a Hold consensus among analysts, most market observers recommend patience. The bull thesis largely rests on the company's ability to accelerate cloud and AI adoption while delivering operational leverage and integrating acquired assets successfully. Speed of execution, strength in next-generation technologies, and the ability to maintain or grow its iconic dividend will dictate whether IBM can overcome current headwinds and regain sustained momentum in a crowded and fast-evolving tech landscape.\nSee Next:\nWhen evaluating any stock price forecast, it's wise to think about portfolio balance and not rely on a single company's trajectory.

At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $149 billion.\nInvest in Gold\nPowered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above. TLDR: 95 of the top 100 coins have turned red today; All top 10 coins have dropped today, with ETH leading the list; BTC and ETH fell 2.7% and 5.2%, trading at $110,125 and $4,376, respectively; This is ‘a natural market correction following significant gains’; ’History cautions toward late‑Summer\/September pullbacks even after sharp rallies’; ’Momentum may carry ETH higher in the near term’; ’Strong accumulation by long-term holders and on‑chain demand retention can help sustain BTC’s recovery’; ’Retail and institutional investors are seeing the unique utility that altcoins provide over Bitcoin’; Both US BTC and ETH ETFs saw inflows on Wednesday, with $81.25 million and $307 million, respectively; Caution continues rising among investors.\nAt the time of writing, all top 10 coins per market capitalization have decreased over the past 24 hours.\nBitcoin (BTC) fell by 2.7% and below $110,500, now trading at $110,125.\nAt the same time, Ethereum (ETH) is down by 5.2%, now changing hands at $4,376. This is the biggest drop in the category.\nIt’s followed by Dogecoin (DOGE), with a drop of 4.7% to $0.2143, as well as XRP (XRP), having decreased by 4.6% to $2.87.\nAs for the top 100 coins, only five coins are up. Yesterday’s biggest fall, Provenance Blockchain (HASH), increased the most today: 10.3% to $0.02763.\nOthers are down below 4% each.\nCronos (CRO), which had stood at the top for three days in a row, saw the largest drop today. It fell 13.7% to the price of $0.2978. Also, this is the only double-digit drop.\nKinetiq Staked HYPE (KHYPE) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) follow with falls of 8.9% and 8.8%, now trading at $44.78 and $44.47, respectively.\nAnalysts have found that bearish divergences have been building over several months across weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly timeframes. Also, September has historically been bearish.\nJames Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet, argued that “Ethereum has stolen the spotlight.” The coin’s rally is driven by strong institutional demand, including hedge funds and corporate treasuries accumulating ETH, as well as regulatory advancements, spot ETF inflows, and staking yields.\n“Momentum may carry ETH higher in the near term,” Toledano said. “However, history cautions toward late‑Summer\/September pullbacks even after sharp rallies. Breaking below ~$4,400 or ~$4,500 could undermine the trend —especially if Jerome Powell decides not to cut rates in September due to core inflation fears, then momentum could be stopped in its tracks.”\nHe also commented on Bitcoin’s drop, stating that “it’s hardly in need of a recovery,” given that it hasn’t moved that far from its ATH.\n“Analysts will say that Bitcoin needs to stabilise above critical technical levels—particularly around $107K and $100K—to rebuild support,” he writes. “The slump in ETF inflows in favour of Ethereum ETFs isn’t helping either. The cooling macro volatility in response to more rate-cut signals from the Fed has the potential to reignite investor confidence. Avoiding further liquidations after recent “flash crash” events—triggered by large whale selling ($2.7B) —is also vital. Strong accumulation by long-term holders and on‑chain demand retention can help sustain recovery.”\nMoreover, FLock.io’s CEO Jiahao Sun, commented that Bitcoin’s price has plunged to a seven-week low below $110,000 in “what is a natural market correction following significant gains.”\nPer the CEO, “although it has kickstarted a cooling-off period and consolidation, it is still reflective of a maturing and dynamic asset class. Incumbent investors are growing in numbers, alongside the broader maturation of the altcoin market. This growth aligns with increasing interest from both retail and institutional investors, who are seeing the unique utility that altcoins provide over Bitcoin.”\nSun continued: “Ethereum overcame resistance with a breakout and retest confirmed, speculating calls for a run to double in value. While the market performance is a textbook bullish signal, it also speaks to ETH’s growing utility and adoption within the digital asset ecosystem. More and more projects are being built on the blockchain, which has become the gold standard for utility tokens.”\nAt the time of writing on Wednesday morning, BTC trades at $110,125. The chart shows a gradual decrease over the past 24 hours, unlike the sharp plunges and jumps over the past couple of days.\nThe day’s highest point was $113,291. The coin was unable to move above $114,000 and keep the level, falling to the intraday low of $110,003. The coin may fall further to $109,000 and towards $105,000.\nSince last Friday, BTC has fallen 7.6%. Also, it’s 11.3% away from its all-time high.\nBitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView\nEthereum is currently trading at $4,376. Its highest point today was $4,611, falling to the intraday low of $4,365.\nShould the pullback continue, ETH could fall below the $4,300 level.\nThe coin is still green over the past week, though by only 0.3% at the time of writing. It’s also 12% away from its ATH of $4,946.\nFurthermore, the crypto market sentiment has been moving within a narrow range in neutral territory for several days now. The crypto fear and greed index is back to 47 today from 45 yesterday.\nThe sentiment barely moving for the past few days highlights that investors are awaiting additional signals to see in which direction the market will move in the mid-term. Therefore, they are highly cautious.\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nMeanwhile, as of 28 August, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw the fourth day of positive flows, taking in $178.9 million.\nArk&21Shares is at the top today, with $79.81 million, followed by BlackRock’s $63.72 million.\nThree other funds saw inflows, and there were no outflows recorded on Thursday.\nSource: SoSoValue\nMoreover, the US ETH ETFs also saw inflows for the sixth day in a row, with $39.16 million on Thursday, reaching the total net inflow of $13.68 billion.\nTwo of the nine funds saw inflows, and two saw outflows. BlackRock and Grayscale took in $67.62 million and $6.27 million.\nOn the other hand, Fidelity and Bitwise lost $33.45 million and $1.28 million.\nSource: SoSoValue\nMeanwhile, US Bitcoin ETFs dominated spot volume with $10 billion daily trading, capturing 13.1% market share, while Ethereum ETFs surged with $4 billion inflows in August.\nAlso, 21Shares has filed for a spot SEI ETF with the US SEC, which would track the CF SEI-Dollar Reference Rate in USD. Also, the company could engage in staking if tax status permits. This follows Canary Capital’s similar filing in April.\nMatt McPhee, Chief Financial Officer at Xapo Bank, commented that institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs hit $33.6 billion in Q2 this year, “with investment advisors, hedge funds, and brokers leading the charge.”\n“That’s not just capital moving, it’s a signal that Bitcoin is firmly on the institutional and treasury radar. What was once a fringe asset is now being actively allocated to by some of the most influential firms and players in finance,” McPhee says.\nHe continued: “This growing wave of adoption shows the huge shift in mindset, even since the same period last year. Bitcoin isn’t just a speculative play; it has become a strategic allocation that is changing how modern-day finance operates. For institutions focused on long-term allocation strategies, this is merely the opening act.”\n-\nWhy did crypto move against stocks today?\nThe crypto market dropped over the past day, while the stock market continued rising on its previous day of trading. By the closing time on Thursday, the S&P 500 was up by 0.32%, the Nasdaq-100 increased by 0.58%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.16%. Stock investors are reacting to Nvidia’s quarterly earnings results, as well as other economic data in the US specifically.\n-\nIs this dip sustainable?\nFor now, yes. The continuation of the current pullback is possible. While many analysts and traders expect the prices to continue rallying, at least by the end of this year, we’ve entered a phase of (typical) corrections.\nYou may also like: (LIVE) Crypto News Today: Latest Updates for August 29, 2025 The crypto market is down today after a couple of green days, with about 95 of the top 100 coins seeing their prices fall over the past 24 hours.

Instead, he stuck to what he knew worked for the American palette: stereotypical menus and flavors like butter chicken and tikka masala.\nBut when American chef Anthony Bourdain visited Junoon for the first time, Khanna said he got the wakeup call of his career.\n\"He said, 'I don't understand why you guys want to camouflage your food to please the Western world,'\" Khanna told CNBC. \"He was saying, 'You need to patronize the cuisine.' And that became the foundation of Bungalow in many ways.\"\nBungalow, Khanna's next and highly popular venture in New York, is one of a growing number of Indian upscale and fine-dining restaurants popping up in the U.S. What was once takeout menus and buffets, Khanna said, has transformed into a business segment aiming to rival that of Italian and French cuisine and is garnering growing interest by the day.\nAccording to Jimmy Rizvi, Khanna's business partner at Bungalow, reservations for the restaurant sell out within 30 to 90 seconds of going live, with nightly waitlists averaging more than 1,000 people. The restaurant opened less than two years ago but consistently serves 300 to 400 dinners each night, becoming a top 10 restaurant in New York City on reservations platform Resy, Rizvi said.\n\"I definitely think that there's a knowledge base that's increasing; there's more awareness with Indian food,\" Rizvi, who also owns the restaurant Gupshup, told CNBC. \"And there's different cuisines within the Indian cuisine … that people are getting aware about.\"\nTracking the rise\nKhanna, who has been in the American restaurant scene for more than two decades, said he's seen the entire landscape shift from \"cheap food and curry houses\" to sophisticated sit-down establishments.\nFine dining overall has seen a significant upswing over the past few years, Circana foodservice analyst David Portalatin told CNBC, as a post-pandemic appetite for a dining experience beyond just food has seen a boom.\nDespite macroeconomic pressure with inflation and a pullback in consumer spending, Portalatin said customer visits to fine dining restaurants in July were up 5% year-over-year.\n\"One of the bright spots across the restaurant landscape right now is fine dining,\" he said. \"It's evidence that the American consumer is once again desiring these unique and differentiated experiences outside the home.\"\nAlong with that, Portalatin said younger consumers, like Generation Z and millennials, have a growing interest in global dishes with their \"quest for flavors.\" That opens the door for exploring cuisines like Indian food.\nAccording to data from market research firm Datassential, new Indian restaurant openings in December 2024 hit 115, up from just 54 in September 2018. Currently, the firm counts 154 upscale Indian dining restaurants in the U.S. compared with 101 in January 2018.\nResy CEO Pablo Rivero told CNBC that he's also seen demand for high-end Indian restaurants widen over the past few years.\n\"Modern Indian restaurants are redefining the category with ambitious menus and inventive formats — and diner demand for these elevated experiences shows no signs of slowing down,\" Rivero said. \"It's a clear sign that diners are eager to explore experience-driven, innovative expressions of Indian cuisine at the highest level.\"\nAnd while growing American interest in global cuisines has taken off, the Indian American population has also mirrored that growth. According to the Pew Research Center, the Indian population in the U.S. has increased by roughly 3.1 million, growing about 174% since 2000.\nThat population has also seen a rise in affluence, making a high median household income of more than $151,000 in 2023, compared with just a median of over $105,000 for Asian American households overall, according to Pew.\nGrowing investor interest\nAs reservations at Indian restaurants begin to sell out even faster, investors are also looking to secure a seat at the table.\nJust this month, popular U.K. Indian restaurant chain Dishoom gained private equity backing as it prepares to scale to the U.S. next year.\nL Catterton, backed by LVMH, announced it was acquiring a minority stake for an undisclosed amount in Dishoom, marking the restaurant group's first outside investment. The firm adds Dishoom to its growing slate of restaurant investments, including Japanese Kobe beef chain Kisshokichi and Spanish casual dining brand Goiko.\nThe new deal reportedly values the restaurant at roughly $400 million. L Catterton and Dishoom did not respond to CNBC's requests for comment.\nRoni Mazumdar, with the James Beard Award-winning Indian restaurant Semma, said he's seen a direct increase in investor interest as upscale Indian restaurants have boomed over the past few years.\nUnapologetic Foods — the company behind many popular New York restaurants including Semma, Dhamaka, Adda and more — is having \"continuous conversations\" with outside investors, Mazumdar told CNBC, but even having those talks marks a significant change from when the group first entered the restaurant scene.\n\"I don't think anyone saw Indian cuisine as a viable option until now,\" Mazumdar said. \"There are folks who we have consistent dialogues with who I don't think five years ago would have even thought about the idea of, 'Oh, it could be an interesting business model to look at.'\"\nMazumdar said the landscape is \"shifting rapidly\" as more investors take notice.\n\"I wouldn't call this a trend,\" he added. \"To take one of the oldest cuisines in the world – I think it's an inevitability. It's a matter of time.\"\nEmphasizing regional specificity\nThe Indian Restaurant Association of America identified hyper-regional flavors as one of its top 2025 Indian restaurant trends as chefs dig into the hundreds of local cuisines that dot the subcontinent.\nEach of the restaurants from Mazumdar and Unapologetic Foods Chef Chintan Pandya, including Semma, emphasizes regional cuisines, rather than the typical northwestern Indian menus of decades past.\n\"I think we see a very interesting pattern where there's a sense of curiosity towards finding out what a community is about through the lens of food,\" Mazumdar said. \"And I don't think 20 years ago that was the case.\"\nSemma, for example, which was ranked No. 1 on The New York Times' 2025 best restaurants list, explores the cuisine of South India, specifically the state of Tamil Nadu.\n\"I think one of the glorifying reasons that Semma is doing insanely great or something path-breaking is because it touches that nerve of Indian food which is cooked in India,\" Pandya said. \"That's the entire belief, or the standard, or the vision of our company, where we will touch and cook the actual Indian food which we ourselves love to eat.\"\nAvtar Walia, the owner of Tamarind in Tribeca, has been in the American restaurant scene for decades. When he first immigrated to America in the '70s, he couldn't figure out why Indian restaurants weren't at the same level as Italian and French restaurants.\nBy adding in more regional dishes and classic Indian street food, Walia said he began to see Indian restaurants — including his own eateries — change from typical buffets to sleek, elegant dining.\n\"From the last 47 years, I still follow the same pattern. Every month, month and a half, I change my lunch menu,\" Walia said. \"We take one of the regions … so that people can try different dishes, authentic dishes, and they don't have to go anywhere else. And this worked very well for me.\"\nWalia estimated that nearly 95% of his clientele are regulars, with his restaurant becoming a staple for Wall Street business meetings.\nAnd for Khanna over at Bungalow, the lines outside the restaurant just keep getting longer.\nHis rattan chairs have seated famed Indian celebrities like members of India's billionaire Ambani family and Bollywood stars, as well as American bigwigs like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who visited the restaurant last year.\n\"When he came, he kept saying, 'I know why every Indian in Seattle is on the phones at 8 a.m. PT to snag a reservation, because for them, this is not just visiting a restaurant — it's a pilgrimage back home,'\" Khanna said. \"And that really stayed with me.\"","content_hash":"5b65af6639ee5cdbdccf4b035343c3e1","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":8809,"method_rank":0}

In my column today, I look at the rotation out of tech stocks and into small caps that accelerated in August, and ask whether it can continue into September.\nIf you have more time to read, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today.\n1. Fed Governor Cook sues Trump over his attempt to fireher 2. Dollar drop on politicized Fed may be part of Trumpdeal: Mike Dolan 3. Nvidia CEO says AI boom far from over after tepid salesforecast 4. For bruised bond markets, turbulence persists as debtsales ramp up again 5. EU to scrap tariffs on U.S. goods to pave way for lowercar duties\nToday's Key Market Moves\n* STOCKS: S&P 500 hits new high, Nasdaq outperforms.Europe, Asia, emerging markets more mixed. * SHARES\/SECTORS: Nvidia slips 0.8%, but recovers fromafter-market lows overnight. Tech and communications lead U.Smarkets higher though, small caps lag. * FX: Dollar falls against nearly every currency in theworld, dollar index -0.4%. China's offshore yuan hits 2025 high. * BONDS: Long-dated yields in Japan, France, and UK easeback from this week's multi-year peaks. U.S. curve bullflattens, $44 billion auction of 7-year notes goes pretty well. * COMMODITIES: Copper has biggest rise in two weeks, up1.5% to a 2-week high. Nvidia, U.S. GDP help lift prices.\nToday's Talking Points:\n* U.S. GDP resilience\nSecond-quarter U.S. GDP growth was unexpectedly revised up to an annualized 3.3% from 3.1% and PCE inflation in the quarter was revised slightly lower to 2.5% from 2.6%. On the margins, this may point to more of a 'Goldilocks' scenario and temper some of the 'stagflation' fears that continue to swirl.\nDoes this alter Fed expectations? Probably not - there are some key data before the September 17 decision, starting with July PCE inflation on Thursday, that will have much bigger sway. But it does show that the impact from tariffs on activity and prices hasn't been properly felt yet.\n* Big government\nContrary to what we were told on the campaign trail and led to believe with Elon Musk's 'DOGE' moment in the Washington sun, the Trump administration is taking a very active role in many aspects of U.S. economic, policymaking and industrial life.\nFrom taking stakes in big companies like Intel and others to letting Nvidia sell its H20 chips to China in exchange for 15% of those sales, and from trying to stuff the Fed board with loyalists to targeting law firms and academic institutions, the administration's footprint seems to be expanding, not shrinking.\n* Yuan steps beyond\nThe Chinese yuan - onshore spot and offshore - leapt to its highest level against the U.S. dollar this year, precisely since November 6, the day after the U.S. election. The PBOC's USD\/CNY fixing is on course for its biggest weekly move since September.\nBeijing is clearly steering the yuan higher, not lower, as many observers predicted would be its response to the economy's deflationary pressures and looming trade war with the U.S. Maybe Beijing is focusing more on bolstering domestic demand than exports?\nU.S. small caps quietly notch historic outperformance vs tech\nAmid the Federal Reserve drama and deluge of corporate earnings in August, one clear but overlooked trend emerged in U.S. equities: the rotation out of expensive tech stocks and into cheaper small caps. As the month draws to a close, the big question is whether this can continue.\nThe Nasdaq 100 is currently on track for a monthly gain of 1.5% while the Russell 2000 small cap index is headed for a 7.3% rise, signaling an underperformance of 580 basis points for the tech-heavy index.\nAccording to Stuart Kaiser, head of equity trading strategy at Citi, that relative monthly performance for the Nasdaq 100 is in the bottom 5% since 1985.\nAnd if we look at ETFs, tech's underperformance looks even more striking. This month, the Invesco QQQ exchange-traded fund tracking the Nasdaq 100 is flat, while the iShares Russell 2000 ETF is up 7%.\nFED BOOST\nSo what's responsible for this dramatic divergence?\nIt may partly just reflect investors seeking to rebalance their concentrated and lopsided portfolios. But the split was clearly turbo-charged by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's Jackson Hole speech on August 22, when he opened the door to an interest rate cut next month.\nManish Kabra, head of U.S. equity strategy at Societe Generale, says the Russell 2000 index's outperformance against the broader S&P 500 that day was the biggest since the U.S. election on November 6 last year that returned Donald Trump to the White House.\nPowell's dovish pivot is helping small caps outperform because these companies tend to benefit more from lower interest rates given that they rely on borrowing to grow and expand. Larger firms, especially 'Big Tech' megacaps, often have huge cash reserves and easier access to other sources of financing.\nTo be sure, lower rates wouldn't just be good news for small caps. The rising tide of liquidity and investor sentiment would typically be expected to lift all boats, including the 'Magnificent Seven' megaships.\nAs analysts at UBS point out, past equity bubbles have often been burst by rising interest rates, so a resumption of the central bank's easing cycle would appear to minimize that particular risk for high-priced tech stocks.\nBut, regardless, small caps may still continue to get more of a Fed boost in the near term.\nAI DOUBTS\nAnother catalyst for the rotation has been creeping doubts about AI's ability to deliver returns commensurate with the bubble-like frenzy surrounding the new technology.\nTech stocks remain on the pricey side. That's justified, argue UBS analysts, by the potential revenue from AI-generated efficiencies, which they estimate could reach around $1.5 trillion a year globally.\nOthers are less optimistic. If value creation on this massive scale fails to materialize, then tech companies will struggle to generate a return on the trillions of dollars of global capex expected in the coming years.\nThat's why all eyes were on $4.4 trillion Nvidia's earnings on Wednesday. How investors interpret the global AI leader's results will help determine whether tech's underperformance continues into September. The company's revenue, profit and forecasts looked solid, but uncertainty surrounding the suspension of its business with China and skepticism around the revenue outlook are giving investors pause.\nUNDER THE RADAR\nFor now, market momentum remains with smaller firms. Francis Gannon, co-CIO and managing director at Royce Investment Partners, calls it a \"stealth summer\" for small caps, the recent outperformance of which has gone \"mostly unnoticed\" amid the daily headlines centered on economic uncertainty, geopolitical worries, and new highs in the larger cap-led indices.\nIndeed, the Russell 2000 has yet to revisit last November's peak, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have been printing new highs for weeks.\nWhether or not small caps start hitting new records will likely be determined by what happens at the Fed.\nSo the big macroeconomic events to watch next month will be the August employment report due on September 5, August CPI inflation data on September 11, and then, of course, the Fed's policy decision on September 17.\nSmall caps have enjoyed a pleasant end to the summer. Let's see what happens when investors all get back to their desks next month.\nWhat could move markets tomorrow?\n* China corporate earnings, including Alibaba, BYD, CITIC,China Construction Bank, ICBC, Bank of China * Japan retail sales, unemployment, industrial production(July) * Japan Tokyo inflation (August) * India GDP (Q2) * Germany retail sales (July) * Germany inflation (August, prelim) * ECB board member Luis de Guindos speaks * Canada GDP (Q2) * U.S. PCE inflation (July) * U.S. Chicago PMI (August)\nWant to receive Trading Day in your inbox every weekday morning?

In the middle of this storm, Apple (AAPL) is gearing up for its biggest moment of the year.\nOn Sept. 9, all eyes will be on Apple Park in Cupertino, where CEO Tim Cook will unveil the much-hyped iPhone 17 lineup at the company’s annual fall event. The invite teases an “awe dropping” experience, hinting at a redesigned, ultra-thin iPhone alongside refreshed Pro models, upgraded cameras, and next-gen Apple Watches.\nBut this launch is not just about shiny new gadgets. With slowing upgrade cycles, retiring Plus models, and analysts hinting at a possible AAPL stock selloff, the event could be a defining moment. For fans, it’s about the magic, but for investors, it’s about momentum. Sept. 9 will decide which side wins.\nAbout Apple Stock\nCalifornia-based Apple needs no introduction. Founded in 1976, the tech titan revolutionized personal computing with the Macintosh in 1984, reshaped music with the iPod, and transformed communication with the iPhone. Boasting a $3.4 trillion market capitalization, Apple leads innovation with the iPhone, iPad, Mac, AirPods, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro.\nIts six platforms — iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, visionOS, and tvOS — deliver seamless integration, fueling services like the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud, and Apple TV+. Known for its ecosystem, brand loyalty, and global scale, Apple remains a defining force in consumer technology and digital ecosystems, setting trends the world continues to follow.\nApple might be the king of innovation, but its shares have not been spared from the market headwinds in 2025. AAPL stock is down 7% year-to-date (YTD) and trades 10% below its 52-week high of $260.10. Escalating trade tensions, looming tariffs, and regulatory headwinds have forced Apple to rethink its manufacturing footprint, while intensifying AI competition adds to investor jitters.\nTechnically, though, AAPL stock is showing signs of strength. After bottoming near the $200 level in early August, the stock has staged a rebound over the past few weeks, breaking above its 50-day moving average and challenging the $235–$237 resistance band. A breakout here could trigger a momentum run back toward the $255-$260 zone. The 14-day RSI has bounced off oversold levels, suggesting buyers are regaining control, while volume upticks confirm institutional nibbling.\nApple stock trades at a lofty 31.1 times forward price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio, well above the sector — a premium that signals both power and pressure. While its ecosystem, dominance, and brand loyalty justify some of that markup, with single-digit earnings growth projected for fiscal 2026, much of the optimism is already priced in. Investors are paying up for certainty, but the upside may depend on Apple’s next big innovation play.\nThat same confidence shows in shareholder returns. The iPhone-maker has boosted payouts for 13-straight years, with a recent $0.26 dividend in August. This takes the annual payout to $1.04, offering a modest 0.44% forward yield. Yet with a lean 13.8% payout ratio, Apple has ample firepower to keep rewarding investors. For now, its premium price reflects both trust in its empire and expectations of what’s still to come.\nA Snapshot of Apple’s Q3 Results\nOn July 31, Apple released its third-quarter earnings report, and it was nothing short of a blockbuster. Revenue surged 10% year-over-year (YOY) to $94 billion. EPS climbed 12% to $1.57, surpassing Wall Street’s projections by 10.6%. Across the board, Apple smashed Street estimates, underscoring its strong fundamentals despite a shaky macro backdrop.\nThe iPhone led the charge with a 13% YOY jump to $44.6 billion, reflecting a solid iPhone 16 lineup sale. Meanwhile, services revenue soared to an all-time high of $27.4 billion, also up by 13% annually. Mac generated $8.05 billion in revenue, and iPad brought in $6.6 billion. Apple’s gross margin came in at a healthy 46.5% at the high end of Apple’s guidance range.\nPlus, Apple’s growth was not confined to one region — the company reported gains across the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Asia Pacific, pushing its installed device base to new highs globally.\nShareholders also reaped the rewards, with Apple returning over $27 billion to shareholders — $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $21 billion through open market repurchases of 104 million Apple shares. Despite the substantial outflows, the company concluded the quarter with a robust $36.3 billion cash reserve, underscoring its balance sheet strength and sustained liquidity position.\nBut beyond the headlines, a different narrative brews — geopolitical pressures. CEO Tim Cook revealed Apple absorbed $800 million in tariff-related costs in Q3 and expects that to swell to $1.1 billion next quarter if trade tensions persist. While Apple is expanding manufacturing in India and Vietnam, China remains its dominant production hub, making diversification a long, capital-intensive road.\nThe U.S. administration’s stance complicates matters further. While iPhone imports from India are exempt from the 50% tariff and proposed chip tariffs won’t hit Apple, calls for domestic manufacturing could inflate costs and risk pricing Apple’s flagship products out of reach for many U.S. consumers.\nDespite stellar numbers, AAPL stock closed in the red on Aug. 1, dragged down by broader market selloffs, tariff fears, and concerns about demand pull-forward ahead of potential policy shifts.\nLooking ahead, Apple anticipates momentum to continue into the current quarter. Management is guiding for mid-to-high single-digit annual revenue growth this quarter, with services expected to keep clocking double-digit gains. Gross margins are projected to be between 46% and 47% even after absorbing the tariff hit flagged by the CEO.\nAnalysts monitoring the company remain optimistic, predicting EPS to be around $7.35 for fiscal 2025, up 8.9% YOY, before surging by another 6.3% annually to $7.81 in fiscal 2026.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for Apple Stock?\nAs the countdown to Apple’s Sept. 9 event begins, Wall Street’s outlook is split. Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan expects the event to deliver only incremental updates over the iPhone lineup, with the spotlight on a super-thin iPhone Air. The analyst maintains a “Buy” rating on AAPL with a $250 price target but warns of a potential “sell-the-news” dip, a familiar trend in which Apple stock retreats after launch before rebounding within 30 to 60 days.\nOn the other hand, Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani sees an opportunity beyond the iPhone 17 itself. While he does not expect a major upgrade cycle from this launch, he is bullish on Apple’s AI roadmap, especially reports of a potential tie-up with Google’s (GOOGL) Gemini to revamp Siri. Daryanani rates AAPL stock as an “Outperform” with a $250 target, believing AI integration — not hardware tweaks — could reignite consumer excitement.\nAAPL stock has a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating overall, a vote of confidence tempered with caution. Out of 38 analysts covering the tech stock, 19 recommend a “Strong Buy,” two give a “Moderate Buy,” 15 analysts stay cautious with a “Hold” rating, and two have a “Strong Sell” rating.\nThe average analyst price target for AAPL stock is $235.44, indicating a potential upside of 1%. The Street-high target price of $300 suggests that the stock could rally as much as 29% from here.\nFinal Thoughts on Apple\nApple has long been synonymous with cutting-edge innovation, yet in the fast-moving AI arena, its measured pace has raised eyebrows on Wall Street. Competitors are pushing boundaries, while Apple quietly taps allies to maintain its edge.\nAs the Sept. 9 iPhone 17 unveiling nears, experts express caution over a typical post-launch pullback, given the modest upgrades. Still, past patterns hint at a rebound within weeks if Apple delivers unexpected flair — like daring AI features, strategic pricing, or a sleek, attention-grabbing iPhone Air.\nOn the date of publication, Sristi Suman Jayaswal did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Specifically, the writer recalls a demonstration hosted by Mastercard and a Norwegian bank in London as long ago as 2014, to highlight what was dubbed the world’s first biometric contactless payment card. Since then, it has become a regular feature of our annual new year forecasts feature for payments experts to aver that biometric cards would be the next big thing in payments technology. So, the concept is not novel. In the UK, NatWest claimed a country first with the launch of its first biometric fingerprint card in 2019.\nRBI discusses with Tolgahan Yildiz, VP of Trusted Mobile Connectivity and Transactions, Infineon, why previous pilots have not led to full rollouts.\nYildiz:\nSeveral issuers launched pilot projects to a handful of customers since 2019, but the projects were hindered by three major challenges.\nFirst, enrolment was complicated for users and expensive for banks. Users either had to enrol at a bank branch, or use an expensive ‘sleeve’ device at home. This resulted in an unattractive, inconvenient user experience.\nSecond, banks were deterred from launching pilot projects because of prohibitively expensive card production, complex implementation, limited support, and time to market was unacceptably long. As such, it was hard to truly gauge cardholder enthusiasm for using the cards.\nThird, customers were still uneasy using biometrics. Many cardholders misunderstood how their biometric data would be used, not realising the data is only stored and processed on the card; it is not even accessible to their bank.\nThese challenges combined to deter both banks and their customers from pursuing biometric cards – at least until the manufacturing process and user experience could be improved.\nRBI: So, what’s changed, in your opinion, to make the biometric offer more appealing today?\nYildiz:\nWhat’s changed is the investment that’s been made in innovation and support, as well as numerous emerging use cases – beyond contactless payments – that are looking very exciting.\nTo begin with, the challenges I outlined earlier have been overcome, resulting in a more affordable premium cardholder offer.\nIssuers today can offer customers easy, inexpensive enrolment, which now takes place either on the user’s smartphone or in their favourite stores. There’s no expensive hardware and no need to visit a bank branch.\nThis expands the biometric card market to branchless neobanks and fintechs – who are always looking for innovative ways to market their brand – enabling them to offer an enrolment experience befitting their digital-first status.\nCard manufacturing itself is also a critical innovation, as it has enabled turnkey solutions and scalabilities. What this means is that production is now compatible with existing manufacturing equipment, with only minor adaptations. This keeps costs down, enabling a high production yield, as well as cost-efficient and frictionless onboarding.\nCard solutions today comply with dedicated Mastercard and VISA specifications and comprehensive guidance and support is available. This enables a go-to-market process that is quick and simple.\nAnd finally, we can start getting excited by emerging, value-add use cases that biometric cards could unlock. These will take potential applications far beyond just payment, helping banks play a central role in the new world of digital identities.\nRBI: How are biometric cards unlocking the next wave of use cases?\nYildiz:\nBiometric cards enable banks to manage their own customer experience, rather than losing control of the user journey to mobile platforms owned by OEMs. By putting fingerprint cards into customers’ hands, banks can showcase their own branded payment solution, enabling trusted experiences both digitally and in-store.\nFor example, biometric cardholders can ‘Tap to Verify’; tapping their card on a POS device, using their fingerprint to confirm their identity and signify that they are the legitimate cardholder. They can also ‘Tap to Authorise’, using their biometric card to approve a transaction quickly, conveniently and with an added layer of security.\nWe’re also in a world of increasingly smart devices, many of which are equipped with NFC (near-field communication) capabilities. Biometric cards could enable cardholders to ‘Tap to Authenticate’, tapping their card to an NFC-enabled device to log in to a secured session, confirming they are the account owner for a bank account or merchant website, for example.\nThese scenarios will become increasingly widespread as consumers grow more accustomed to using biometrics to authenticate themselves and authorise purchases of goods and services.\nAt the same time, the rise of increasingly capable AI tools presents new and evolving cybersecurity risks, which is driving more banks to establish secured, convenient and trusted digital interactions with their customers.\nCombining biometrics with Secure Elements provides new ways to help mitigate the evolving risks that banks, merchants and cardholders face.\nAs users struggle with password apathy, delivering fast, convenient and trusted biometric authentication for services and purchases could be a massive game changer in tackling phishing attacks and reducing fraud.\nBut obviously, that is not all. Banks could also enable biometric cardholders to store and manage digital assets, providing a secured and convenient way to access digital currency accounts. This is an opportunity that is, as yet, largely untapped.\nRBI: Will issuers want to invest in biometric cards?\nYildiz:\nMore than anything, banks trade in trust. It has always been so: we as customers trust that our money will be robustly secured, while remaining easily accessible to us – and only us – as and when we need it.\nAs artificial intelligence helps cybercrime to grow and scale, consumers will be concerned about security and who to trust with their money. Biometrics aren’t just a cool gimmick, they offer real value by helping worried consumers trust their bank more. Market insights firm Global Data wrote in a 2023 report that “biometrics adoption has the potential to enhance efficiency while shaping the future of privacy and regulation”. In short, they offer an additional layer of convenience and security in today’s digital, global society.\nAnd because the card is something physical the customer holds and uses, it can be a visible symbol of that trust – much like the firm handshake previous generations once shared with their local bank manager.\nToday, it’s up to the banks to decide how to stand out in a fiercely competitive financial services market. But it’s important to recognise that physical cards are not disappearing anytime soon. Over 13 billion+ EMV® chip cards are deployed worldwide, offering unprecedented payment reliability, trust, consumer familiarity, and robust, universal security.\nWhether you’re an established bank or a newer entrant, this means that the payment card remains – and will for the foreseeable future – the most visible and sustainable way to connect the customer and the brand, with the potential to support secured journeys for new use cases far into the digital age.\nWe’ve seen many banks launch colourful cards, or metal cards, but at the end of the day this is a marketing tactic rather than a value-add to the customer. What biometric cards do is enable marketers, acquisition\/retention managers and CTOs to unite around an innovation that delivers on each of their ambitions: building brand visibility alongside convenient, secured cardholder experiences.\nQuite simply, if banks don’t offer a trusted gateway to these experiences, someone else will.\n\"What role will biometric cards play in the future of payments?\" was originally created and published by Retail Banker International, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Another 19% plan to add AI for conducting interviews this year.\n“The technology has caught on so quickly that many people aren’t ready for it,” Jim Chaffee, an AI expert at the University of Iowa, told Yahoo Finance.\n“Using AI early in the process to screen out candidates is a useful and time-saving tool for employers,” he said, “but chatbots are not properly equipped to get more in-depth with a candidate, at which point human participation is vital.”\nCompanies hiring right now are inundated with job seekers, which has escalated the use of AI interview assistants in recent months, Chaffee said.\nThe number of Americans filing new applications for jobless benefits rose by the most in roughly three months last week, and unemployment claims have reached the highest level in nearly four years, according to data from the US Department of Labor.\nRead more: What are jobless claims, and why do they matter?\nMoreover, last month, there were 62,075 job cuts, up 29% from June, according to a recent report by Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

Nonetheless, job seekers are not happy about it. Only a quarter of job candidates trust AI will fairly evaluate them, according to recent research by Gartner, Inc. More than 6 in 10 candidates said they are more likely to apply to a position if the organization requires in-person interviews.\nIn AI-assisted interviews, applicants log on to a hiring platform like Ribbon AI, where they provide videotaped responses to questions that either pop up on the screen or are verbally asked by an avatar. The sessions are typically under 30 minutes, but can stretch to an hour, Jones said.\nThe AI algorithms scan the video responses, looking for facial expressions, keyword usage and tone of voice. A transcript of the interview is then sent to a hiring manager or recruiter along with the bot's take on the candidate’s performance.\nI talked to several career strategists about the advice they’re giving their clients and have included my own expert tips. Here’s what you need to know:\nYour AI interviewer is looking for the same kinds of things that a human would look for, Chaffee said.\n“Job seekers should approach every interview the same way, whether having a human or an AI conversation,” said Christine Cruzvergara, chief education strategy officer at career platform Handshake. “This is critical because if you are qualified to move to the next round of interviews, chances are highly likely that a person will be reviewing your responses.”\n“Introduce yourself and smile,” Jones said. “This is your audition tape.”\nCandidates get nervous and clam up when there isn’t a person to talk to, she said. Turn the lights on so your face is brightly shown in soft light and your expressions and nonverbal cues are clear. Speak clearly and let your personality come through.\n“It's 10 times harder to let that shine through when you feel like you're talking to yourself,” Jones added.\nIt really is more like acting than interviewing, so practice. If possible, practice with a friend or family member on the platform you’ll be using or something similar. With Zoom, for example, you can record it to review. This also helps with figuring out how loud to talk and how to position the screen and camera lens.\nWatch and critique your recorded responses to improve your delivery. Keep your shoulders back and your hands quiet.\nWorkplace etiquette applies to all interview experiences, whether online or in-person, Cruzvergara said. “If you’re interviewing via video, keep your attire professional and your interview environment clear of distractions — no pets on the video.\"\nYou’ll need a reliable internet connection, a webcam, and a microphone. Most computers and laptops have these built in.\nPosition your computer screen so you’re in the middle (horizontally) and the top of your head is near the top of the computer screen. You should be looking up slightly at the camera, a position that helps define your chin and subtly conveys a message of strength and confidence.\nChatbots are always on and always looking at you, so focus on speech clarity, facial expressions, body language, and eye contact because it will note these things in its report, Chaffee said. Try your best to look into the camera when talking. This can take discipline when you aren’t talking directly to another person.\nThese explore how you’ve handled work situations in the past. “Having examples ready will keep you from pausing too long, which sometimes triggers an AI to think you’re done answering the question,” Cruzvergara said.\nSome bots are programmed to answer basic questions about the job or the employer, so go ahead and ask if it’s so equipped.\n“Think of an AI interview not as a traditional conversation, but as a chance to do in-depth fact finding,” said Maggie Mistal, a career consultant and executive coach. “Unlike an interview with a person, you won't be building rapport or camaraderie, but you can get solid information about the role, the company, and the skill sets they are searching to hire.”\nSome of Mistal’s suggestions to ask the bot:\n-\nFor people hired at my level, what's their general career path for promotion?\n-\nHow many years do employees typically stay at the firm?\n-\nIs this department a growing part of the company?\n-\nWhich skill sets or experiences are particularly important for success in this job?\n“Be factual in your responses to questions,” Mistal said. “Share specific details and add numbers where you can. For instance, don't say, ‘I worked in sales and had success.’ Rather, say, ‘I closed a million dollars in sales, landed a large new customer, and was recognized for top performance by leadership with a bonus.’\"\nSticky notes on your computer screen can prompt you with talking points to emphasize about your experience, why you’re a good fit for the job, and what questions to ask about the firm.\nHave a question about retirement? Personal finances? Anything career-related? Click here to drop Kerry Hannon a note.\nEnd your interview by saying a version of, “Thank you for considering me for the job. I look forward to hearing from you.” Smile, and continue eyeing the camera until the interview disconnects.\nThen send a thoughtfully worded thank-you note to the hiring manager or recruiter who set it up.\n“We receive the exact notes from thousands of candidates,” Jones said. “They're all identical, carbon copies. Make your note unique, make it stand out. Refer to specific things you talked about. It’s an extension of the interview itself. If you send an AI written note that they've received before, you risk being immediately declined from that pipeline.”\nKerry Hannon is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

She repeated the routine for two months, just to finalize her wardrobe for her two-day bachelorette party, she says.\nShopping for her other wedding events, including her bridal shower, wedding ceremony in Hawaii and reception in Bali, took similar amounts of dedication. She wanted to have a different look for every single photographed event, she says.\nThe 32-year-old real estate consultant from Upper Marlboro, Maryland, spent nearly $18,000 on 15 unique white outfits during her time as a bride, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.\n\"I felt an immense amount of pressure on what I needed to wear ... This is my wedding, the moment I've been dreaming about,\" Johnson says.\nFor many brides, tying the knot is no longer a single-day, or single outfit, affair. It can be an entire multi-event season that spans months, sometimes years. Fueled by social media and the growing extravagance of weddings, brides with disposable income are hosting more events than ever — and buying more outfits as a result, experts and brides tell CNBC Make It.\nPop culture and social media compel brides to host more events\nBrides buy an average of 12 looks for wedding-related events, says David's Bridal CEO Kelly Cook, up from eight outfits in 2021. Some brides wear little white dresses for their bridal showers and bachelorette parties, or even to go wedding dress shopping in.\nThe growing number of pre-wedding events, and the trend of buying a new outfit for each one, isn't necessarily new, says bridal stylist Julie Sabatino, who has worked with high net worth clients since 2001. The concept of hosting multiple pre-wedding events has long been advertised on TV and in pop culture — but recently, the concept has become more of a norm thanks to social media.\nBrides are now bombarded with wedding event-related content on Instagram and TikTok, giving them the inspiration to plan more elaborate celebrations with outfits and accessories that match the occasion, Cook says.\nEven smaller events like engagements now require planners and vendors so the couple can be Instagram-ready, Brian A.M. Green, an Atlanta-based upscale event planner, told CNBC Make It in November 2024.\nDavid's Bridal is just one of the many companies to meet the increasing demand, launching a \"Little White Dresses\" page on its website in 2021, Cook says. The company also sells little white bikinis, little white sunglasses and little white tote bags. Other retailers offering similar items include Revolve and Anthropologie.\nCalifornia-based bride Chiara Walsh spent nearly $4,000 on 16 bridal looks before her ceremony in June, including a $19 white powered wig off Amazon for a \"Founding Fathers\" theme night on her bachelorette. Wedding planning itself became an event: She bought a $168 blue Faherty dress to go shopping for her ceremony gown, she says.\n\"It was exciting, but I did feel like I needed something new for every single thing. If I already had a picture in it, I didn't really want to wear it again,\" says Walsh, 34.\nPhiladelphia-based bride Hailey McLaughlin, who got married in May, estimates she spent $800 buying outfits for her four-day bachelorette trip in Park City, Utah.\n\"For the bachelorette, I felt like I needed to be the best-dressed person in the room,\" McLaughlin, 29, says. \"Because of the location I picked, I had to get ski pants and coats and accessories and scarves.\"\nBrides can be pressured by wedding size, photos-ops and family to wear new outfits\nWeddings, generally, have gotten more lavish in just the last five years. The average U.S. wedding now costs $35,000, up from $19,000 in 2020, according to wedding-planning website The Knot. Some brides say they have to wear new, and sometimes more expensive outfits, to meet the expectations of their families and social media followers, and to match the extravagance of their weddings.\nJohnson says her family and friends expected her to be \"over the top,\" and felt inclined to deliver. Walsh, who had been in several of her friends' weddings before planning her own, says, \"It more felt like, 'Finally, it's my turn to be a bride.'\"\nHelp us help you: Take our survey on work, money and life goals\nAn increase in destination weddings and bigger guest lists ups the ante, too. Even local weddings, which often include welcome parties and goodbye brunches, are now \"treated as destination weddings because people come in from all over the place,\" Sabatino says.\nWalsh tied the knot just 20 miles south of her home in Ontario, California, but with family and friends flying in from all over the country, she says the celebration turned into a four-day event filled with dinners, brunches and a trip to Disneyland.\n\"It's fun to [wear] something brand new that your friends haven't seen, or your family hasn't seen,\" she says.\nThe need to wear something new doesn't always come from the bride. If Abi Garapati had the wedding of her dreams, the New York-based business strategy and operations manager would have eloped in Japan, she says. Instead, her parents and in-laws started planning — and paying for — her wedding before she was even engaged, she says.\nGarapati, 29, says she ultimately wore 11 outfits to cover both Indian traditions and her Western preferences, including a $350 Reformation dress and $700 Picchika lehenga.\n\"Typically, in Indian weddings, the parents will pay for the whole thing, and they'll save up their entire lives for this big, elaborate [celebration],\" says Garapati, who tied the knot last year. \"I did have to have outfits, but either my mother-in-law or my mom would just get it for me.\"\nAfter weddings, where do little white dresses go?\nTo reduce the number of little white dresses taking up closet space, some brides are opting to go with non-white looks they can re-wear in the future, and others are dying their dresses different colors after their wedding events, Cook says.\nJohnson says she tried to look for dresses she could see herself wearing for other events in the future. But despite shopping with intention, she says it can be hard to re-wear white when most of the nice events she attends are other weddings.\n\"[Most of the outfits] are, unfortunately, in my closet,\" says Johnson. \"I've been trying to figure out when I'm going to wear them again. Maybe for our anniversary.\"\nSourcing secondhand looks is also increasingly popular, says Sabatino, who opened a New York-based storefront called The Jul Box in July to sell custom re-made vintage gowns. Many brides just want to feel like their looks to feel both unique and personal, no matter the trends, she says.\n\"They don't want to look like every other bride on Instagram,\" Sabatino says. \"I think that opens the doors to possibilities that you can have in your closet for a long time.\"\nLast chance to save: Want to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

That’s up approximately 2 basis points from the prior day’s report, and down approximately 8 basis points from a week ago. Read on to compare average rates for a variety of conventional and government-backed mortgage types and see whether rates have increased or decreased.\nNote that Fortune reviewed Optimal Blue’s latest available data on Aug. 28, with the numbers reflecting home loans locked in as of Aug. 27.\nWhat’s happening with mortgage rates in the market?\nIf it feels as though 30-year mortgage rates have been stuck on the verge of 7% for an extended period, that’s not too far off. Many observers anticipated that rates would soften when the Federal Reserve started reducing the federal funds rate last September, but there was no sustained decrease in mortgage rates. There was a short-lived dip preceding the September Fed meeting, but rates rapidly climbed afterward.\nBy January 2025 the average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage surpassed 7% for the first time since last May, as indicated by Freddie Mac data. That’s a big jump from the historic average low of 2.65% recorded in January 2021, when the government was still working to stimulate the economy and ward off a pandemic-induced economic downturn.\nAbsent another major crisis, experts agree we won’t have mortgage rates in the 2% to 3% range in our lifetimes. Nevertheless, rates around the 6% mark are entirely possible if the U.S. manages to tame inflation and lenders feel optimistic about the economic prospects.\nIn fact, rates had a modest decline at the end of February, dropping nearer to the 6.5% mark than had been seen for some time. There was even a brief point in early April where rates dipped below 6.5%, but they rose immediately afterward.\nAt present, with uncertainty as to the extent to which President Donald Trump will pursue policies such as tariffs and deportations, some observers worry the labor market could constrict and inflation could resurface. Against this backdrop, U.S. homebuyers face high mortgage rates—although some can still find options for making their purchase more manageable, like negotiating rate buydowns with a builder when purchasing newly constructed property.\nHow to get the best mortgage rate you can\nWhile economic conditions are beyond your control, your financial profile as an applicant also has a substantial impact on the mortgage rate you’re offered. With that in mind, aim to do the following:\nMake sure you have excellent credit. The minimum credit score for a conventional mortgage is generally 620 (for FHA loans, you may qualify with a score of 580 or a score as low as 500 with a 10% down payment). However, if you’re hoping to get a low rate that could potentially save you five or even six figures in interest over the life of your loan, you’ll want a score considerably higher. For instance, lender Blue Water Mortgage notes that a score of 740 or higher is considered top tier in the context of home loan applications.\nMaintain a low debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. You can calculate your DTI by dividing your monthly debt payments by your gross monthly income, then multiplying by 100. For example, someone with a $3,000 monthly income and $750 in monthly debt payments has a 25% DTI. When applying for a mortgage, it’s typically best to have a DTI of 36% or below, though you may be approved with a DTI as high as 43%.\nGet prequalified with multiple lenders. Consider trying a mix of large banks, local credit unions, and online lenders and compare offers. Additionally, connecting with loan officers at several different institutions can help you evaluate what you’re looking for in a lender and which one will best meet your needs. Just ensure that when you’re comparing rates, you’re doing so in a consistent way—if one estimate involves purchasing mortgage discount points and another doesn’t, it’s important to recognize there’s an upfront cost for buying down your rate with points.\nMortgage interest rates historical chart\nAn important bit of context for the discussion about high mortgage rates is that rates around 7% feel high because of the recent memory of rates between 2% and 3%. Those rates were possible due to unprecedented government action aimed at preventing recession as the country grappled with a global pandemic.\nHowever, under more typical economic conditions, experts agree we’re unlikely to see such exceptionally low interest rates again. Historically, rates in the vicinity of 7% are not unusually high.\nConsider this St. Louis Fed (FRED) chart tracking Freddie Mac data on the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage average. From the 1970s through the 1990s, such rates were more or less the norm, with a significant spike in the early 1980s. In fact, September, October, and November of 1981 all saw mortgage interest rates exceeding 18%.\nNevertheless, this historical perspective offers little consolation to homeowners who may want to move but are locked in with a once-in-a-lifetime low interest rate. Such situations are common enough in the current market that low pandemic-era rates keeping homeowners from moving when they otherwise would have become known as the “golden handcuffs.”\nFactors that impact mortgage interest rates\nThe U.S. economy may well be the single largest driver of mortgage rates. When lenders fear inflation, they can raise rates to protect their long-term profits.\nPlus, the national debt is another significant factor. When the government has to borrow large sums to cover what it spends, that can drive interest rates higher.\nDemand for home loans is key too. If few people are borrowing, lenders might lower rates to attract business. But if loans are in high demand, they might raise rates to cover their costs.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve’s actions play a role. The Fed can sway rates for mortgages and other financial products by changing the federal funds rate and by managing its balance sheet.\nThe federal funds rate gets a lot of media attention. When it changes, mortgage rates often follow suit. But remember, the Fed doesn’t set mortgage rates directly, and they don’t always move in perfect sync with the fed funds rate.\nPerhaps even more importantly, the Fed influences rates through its balance sheet. In tough times, it can buy assets like mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to boost the economy.\nBut recently, the Fed has been shrinking its balance sheet, choosing not to replace assets as they mature. This tends to push interest rates up. So while everyone focuses on cuts or hikes to the fed funds rate, what the central bank does with its balance sheet might be even more important for your mortgage rate.\nWhy it’s important to compare mortgage rates\nComparing rates on different types of loans and shopping around with various lenders are both essential steps in obtaining the best mortgage for your situation.\nIf your credit is excellent, opting for a conventional mortgage might be the ideal choice for you. However, if your score is below 600, an FHA loan may give you an opportunity that a conventional loan would not.\nWhen it comes to exploring options with different banks, credit unions, and online lenders, it can make a significant difference in your overall costs. Freddie Mac research indicates that in a market with high interest rates, homebuyers may be able to save $600 to $1,200 annually if they apply with multiple mortgage lenders.","content_hash":"9cb71514b77e4f0d69213ada2cd2d16a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":7540,"method_rank":0}

The dollar was also pressured by dovish comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who stated that he supports a 25-bp rate cut at the September FOMC meeting and anticipates additional rate cuts over the next three to six months.\nThe dollar on Friday initially moved higher on signs of strength in US consumer spending after July personal spending rose by the most in four months. Also, sticky inflation pressures are hawkish for Fed policy and are supportive for the dollar after the US July core PCE price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, rose to a 5-month high.\nConcern over the Fed’s independence and fears about capital flight are negative for the dollar with President Trump’s move to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook. If Mr. Trump succeeds in firing Fed Governor Cook, foreign investors may lose faith in the Fed and the dollar and swap their dollar assets into non-dollar investments.\nUS July personal spending rose +0.5% m\/m, the most in four months, and right on expectations. Also, July personal income rose +0.4% m\/m, right on expectations.\nThe US July core PCE price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, rose to a 5-month high of +2.9% y\/y from +2.8% y\/y in June, right on expectations.\nThe US Aug MNI Chicago PMI fell -5.6 to 41.5, weaker than expectations of 46.0.\nThe University of Michigan US Aug consumer sentiment index was revised lower by -0.4 to 58.2, weaker than expectations of no change at 58.6.\nLate Thursday, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said he supports a 25 bp rate cut at the September FOMC meeting and anticipates additional rate cuts over the next three to six months. He said, “With underlying inflation close to 2%, market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, and the chances of an undesirable weakening in the labor market increased, proper risk management means the FOMC should be cutting the policy rate now.”\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 88% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and at 55% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.\nEUR\/USD (^EURUSD) on Friday rose by +0.11%. The euro recovered from early losses on Friday and turned higher after the ECB’s July CPI expectations came in higher than expected, a hawkish factor for ECB policy. Also, the stronger-than-expected German Aug CPI report is hawkish for ECB policy and supportive for the euro.\nThe euro initially moved lower on Friday due to a stronger dollar. Also, concerns over a slowdown in consumer spending in the Eurozone are negative for the euro after German July retail sales fell by the most in nearly two years.\nThe ECB Jul 1-year CPI expectations were unchanged from Jun at +2.6%, stronger than expectations of +2.5%. The ECB Jul 3-year CPI expectations unexpectedly climbed to +2.5%, stronger than expectations of no change at +2.4%.\nGerman Aug unemployment unexpectedly fell by -9,000, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of +10,000.\nGerman Jul retail sales fell -1.5% m\/m, weaker than expectations of no change and the biggest decline in almost two years.\nGerman Aug CPI (EU harmonized) rose +2.1% y\/y, stronger than expectations of +2.0% y\/y.\nOn the geopolitical front, diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine remain elusive, as the US tries to broker a peace deal between the two countries. On Friday, German Chancellor Merz and French President Macron called for secondary sanctions on Russia for its war in Ukraine and said they will push for measures targeting “companies from third countries that support Russia’s war.” On Thursday, German Chancellor Merz stated that a meeting between Russian President Putin and Ukrainian President Zelensky is unlikely to take place. The outcome of the Russian-Ukrainian war could have macroeconomic implications regarding tariffs and oil prices, and could, of course, have significant consequences for European security.\nSwaps are pricing in a 3% chance of a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\nUSD\/JPY (^USDJPY) on Friday rose by +0.07%. The yen posted modest losses on Friday due to the weaker-than-expected Japanese economic reports on July industrial production and July retail sales, which are bearish for the yen. In addition, price pressures softened in Japan after the Aug Tokyo CPI eased as expected, a dovish factor for BOJ policy. Also, Higher T-note yields on Friday were bearish for the yen.\nLosses in the yen were limited Friday after the Japanese Jul consumer confidence index rose more than expected to a 7-month high. Also, strength in Japan’s labor market is bullish for the yen after the Jul jobless rate unexpectedly fell to a 5.5-year low of 2.3%.\nThe Japan Jul consumer confidence index rose +1.2 to a 7-month high of 34.9, stronger than expectations of 34.2.\nJapan’s July industrial production fell -1.6% m\/m, weaker than expectations of -1.1% m\/m and the largest decline in 8 months.\nJapan July retail sales fell -1.6% m\/m, weaker than expectations of -0.2% m\/m and the biggest decline in 4.25 years.\nThe Japan July jobless rate unexpectedly fell -0.2 to a 5.5-year low of 2.3%, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of no change at 2.5%.\nJapan Aug Tokyo CPI eased to +2.6% y\/y from +2.9% y\/y in July, right on expectations.

Precious metal prices rallied sharply on Friday, with gold climbing to a 3-week high and silver posting a 14-year nearest-futures high. Signs of sticky global inflation pressures are boosting demand for gold as an inflation hedge, following Friday’s news that the US July core PCE price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, rose to a five-month high, and after the German August CPI rose more than expected.\nAlso, President Trump’s move to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook has sparked concerns about the Fed’s independence and increased demand for safe-haven assets, including precious metals. In addition, political uncertainty in France is driving demand for gold as a safe-haven, following French Prime Minister Bayrou’s call for a confidence vote that could bring down his government as soon as next month. Finally, dovish comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller were bullish for precious metals when he stated that he supports a 25-bp rate cut at the September FOMC meeting and anticipates additional rate cuts over the next three to six months.\nGold has continued safe-haven support related to US tariffs and geopolitical risks, including the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. The fund buying of precious metals continues to support prices, following the rise in gold holdings in ETFs to a 2-year high on Thursday and the rise in silver holdings in ETFs to a 3-year high the same day.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Oracle decided to capture that revenue by building out its own cloud services.\nOracle Integration Cloud hosts software-as-a-service offerings for financial reporting, automated workflows, human resources operations, marketing, personalization, and more. Oracle also offers artificial intelligence (AI)-powered database services. And OCI has been shown to be much more cost-effective for data-intensive operations than Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud. It's an especially ideal offering for industries like financial services and healthcare that have complex regulatory frameworks and sensitive information. On its earnings calls, Oracle often discusses how industries are choosing OCI for its security and compliance capabilities.\nOracle was already a leader in enterprise software solutions. And now, it is a major player in the cloud business. The main downside of Oracle is that its valuation is expensive, and it is spending extremely aggressively. Oracle is arguably among the higher-risk, higher-potential-reward Titans. If its investments translate to bottom-line earnings growth, it could continue to be one of the best performers in the group. If not, it wouldn't be surprising if the stock underwent a sizable sell-off.\nNetflix is an entertainment giant that is raking in the cash flow\nNetflix's outsized returns in recent years are partly due to how beaten down the stock was going into 2023. Netflix fell over 50% in 2022, outpacing the broader sell-off in the Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) that year. At the time, other streaming platforms were gaining traction, and Netflix was still inconsistently profitable.\nThe business model has remained largely unchanged over the past decade. So it's not a transformational story like Oracle. Rather, Netflix has perfected its craft.\nThe biggest change has been its content slate -- what it spends on, how it markets that content (like the global success of \"KPop Demon Hunters,\") and basically just boosting its overall content success rate. The second major change was cracking down on password sharing. This was a resounding success because a lot of new accounts opened up -- showing that customers were willing to pay for Netflix because they value the service (again, despite a lot of competition). And finally, Netflix's ad-supported tier is driving new signups, which accelerates revenue growth.\nNetflix is an industry-leading cash cow with high margins. It has become a near-perfect business. The only issue is that the valuation reflects that, as Netflix trades at 52 times trailing 12-month earnings. Netflix could still be a winning long-term stock, but it may need a year or two to grow into its valuation. Therefore, it may not be a standout performer in 2026.\nNvidia just delivered another blowout quarter\nNvidia reported exceptional second-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Aug. 27 despite the company's China business being hindered by export restrictions to China.\nEven with difficult comps from the second-quarter fiscal 2025, Nvidia grew revenue by 56% and adjusted earnings per share by 54%. Arguably, the most impressive aspect of Nvidia's results is that it continues to sustain ultra-high gross margins over 70%. Nvidia's high margins allow it to convert a substantial amount of sales into profit, which is a testament to its edge over the competition and technological leadership on the global stage.\nNvidia gets a lot of attention for its data center business -- and rightfully so, as it made up 88% of revenue in the recent quarter. But it's worth noting that the rest of the business is doing well too. Nvidia's non-data center revenue, which includes gaming and AI PC professional visualization, automotive, and robotics, was collectively $5.49 billion -- up 48% compared to $3.7 billion a year ago.\nNvidia is in its third year of what has been an uninterrupted masterclass of exponential growth on a scale unlike any business the world has ever seen. And somehow, the company still has its foot on the gas with no signs of slowing down.\nNvidia's outlook for the third-quarter fiscal 2026 calls for $54 billion in revenue even if it ships zero H20 chips to China -- all while maintaining a 73% gross margin. That would mark a 54% increase in revenue and just slightly lower gross margins than third-quarter fiscal 2025 and a near three-fold increase in revenue in just two years.\nDespite the impeccable results, Nvidia's valuation isn't cheap, as investors are pricing in a sustained breakneck growth rate. But Nvidia just keeps delivering, so its 58.4 price-to-earnings ratio is reasonable.\nIf Nvidia's stock price remained unchanged for a year but the company grew earnings by 50%, the P\/E would drop to 38.9. So even now, with the stock on track to crush the S&P 500 for the third consecutive year, Nvidia remains a top AI stock to buy now.\nI expect Nvidia to continue leading the Ten Titans higher in 2026, especially if trade policy with China eases. However, if for whatever reason there's a slowdown in AI spending from key Nvidia customers, Nvidia could drag down the Ten Titans and the broader market with it.\nShould you buy stock in Oracle right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them.

It has indeed a strong pitch, namely the ability to solve the fundamental issues of the complex and outdated payments back-end. And via a comprehensive and flexible suite of services across accounts, payments and FX, its service is tailored to meet the needs of companies with ambitious payment goals.\nMishal Ruparel, Chief Commercial Officer at Banking Circle, discusses the firm’s recent highlights and future plans with GlobalData banking and payments group editor, Douglas Blakey\nEPI: Can you summarise the Banking Circle USP? What is the Banking Circle value proposition?\nAlthough many aspects of financial services have seen rapid innovation in recent years, the global payments ecosystem has evolved much more slowly, with back-end infrastructure still largely working with timescales and costs set in the twentieth century. Without fundamental redesign, many businesses will remain stuck in a ‘slow lane’, processing transactions at a pace that no longer matches the speed of other parts of their business or the expectations of their digitally enabled customers. To address this challenge, Banking Circle has built a single global payments platform with interoperability at its core, combining pioneering technology and the established central bank clearing system to offer businesses ultra high-speed access to global, multi-currency instant payment schemes. Together with our customers and partners, we are aiming to overhaul the world’s legacy payments infrastructure – delivering truly instant payments to meet the challenge of today’s ‘real time’ age.\nEPI: Historically, Asia Pacific has led the way in payments but there is momentum in Europe thanks to regulatory action. What is Banking Circle’s take on prospects in Europe and why is the company targeting expansion in Europe?\nRuparel:\nEurope represents a core market for Banking Circle as we continue to scale our business globally. Like many markets, Europe has been experiencing a sustained increase in cross-border payment activity, with cross-border transaction volumes in the region projected to grow by 58% between 2023 and 2028. This trend is underpinned by robust economic activity between EU member states and strong trading relationships with global markets.\nThe EU has also built a regulatory environment supportive of Banking Circle’s expansion in Europe. Initiatives like PSD2 have helped to enhance innovation, competition, and security in the payments space, while SEPA has simplified euro-denominated cross-border euro transactions. Upcoming changes to the regulatory landscape, particularly the introduction of PSR and PSD3, are also set to bring about a range of benefits, including further innovation in the space and enhancements to fraud and customer protection measures. Europe’s investment in payment infrastructure – including TIPS, SEPA Instant, and domestic instant schemes like Sweden’s Swish and the UK’s Faster Payments – is also accelerating the region toward full real-time cross-border capabilities.\nDespite this progress, many cross-border, multi-currency transactions in Europe remain costly, slow, and opaque. This creates a clear opportunity for companies like Banking Circle to step in with modern, advanced infrastructure that bypasses legacy limitations. Through our next generation platform, we’re helping our clients meet rising demand while improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of international payments.\nEPI: What is the significance of Banking Circle securing access to Swiss Interbank Clearing?\nRuparel:\nSecuring access to the Swiss Interbank Clearing (SIC) system allows Banking Circle to offer clients a fully integrated, real-time connection to domestic payment schemes in Liechtenstein and Switzerland. This latest integration means Banking Circle now provides direct access to local payment schemes and account infrastructure for five of the 12 major currencies across Europe and the UK. This milestone reflects our ongoing ambition to become a super-correspondent bank for global business-to-business payments, removing legacy barriers that have restricted demand for instant payment flows among European businesses while enhancing financial inclusion across the continent.\nEPI: And why is the Visa Direct initiative noteworthy?\nRuparel:\nOur work with Visa will see Visa Direct gain access to Banking Circle’s extensive local clearing rails around the world, bolstering its global payments reach and joining the over 530 licensed financial institutions that benefit from our offering. Through this collaboration, Visa Direct will leverage Banking Circle’s single API technology to connect to multiple direct clearing systems worldwide — all through one secure, reliable, and scalable provider. This marks a significant milestone in our mission to enhance the speed, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of cross-border payments. Collaborating with a global leader in the payments space like Visa Direct not only strengthens Banking Circle’s capabilities but also underscores the trust placed in our infrastructure and the value of our single API approach. It is a clear demonstration of how Banking Circle is helping international businesses simplify access to global payment networks — delivering reach, reliability, and real-time performance through a single integration.\nEPI: It is often said that the adoption of real-time payments demands more than just updating payment rails – it requires full-scale transformation of banking infrastructure. Banks must re-engineer outdated systems and rethink legacy processes in the front-end and back-end. How realistic is that? Do banks get it?\nRuparel:\nLegacy systems built around limited operating hours are poorly suited to supporting instant settlements, requiring banks to modernise both front-end and back-end systems, rethink operational workflows, and embrace more flexible, cloud-based architectures. The necessary technology for facilitating this transformation is certainly there, like cloud-native platforms, which can provide the scalability, flexibility, and resilience needed to meet rising transaction volumes and support innovation. Yet, the degree of the transformation varies across institutions, with some pursuing incremental upgrades, while others are undertaking more comprehensive overhauls. Although 76% of European possessed a moderate degree of business and technological readiness to facilitate instant payments, just 7% are positioned as leaders in instant payment adoption. Current market conditions highlight the need for more decisive action if banks are to remain competitive in a real-time, always-on payments landscape.\n\"The next generation bank: Banking Circle’s mission gathers speed\" was originally created and published by Retail Banker International, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

The law authorizes the president to “regulate” international commerce after declaring a national emergency.\n\"In response to these declared emergencies, the President has departed from the established tariff schedules and imposed varying tariffs of unlimited duration on imports of nearly all goods from nearly every country with which the United States conducts trade,\" the court said in its ruling.\nIn a post to his social media website Truth Social, the president said, \"a Highly Partisan Appeals Court incorrectly said that our Tariffs should be removed, but they know the United States of America will win in the end. If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country.\"\nThe court emphasized that under the US Constitution, Congress is empowered to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises and to regulate commerce with foreign nations.\n\"Tariffs are a tax, and the framers of the Constitution expressly contemplated the exclusive grant of taxing power to the legislative branch,\" the ruling said.\nThe court was tasked with deciding if IEEPA is among a handful of rare exceptions that extend limited taxing power to the president, a power otherwise exclusive to Congress.\nTrump cited IEEPA when he declared two national emergencies — illegal immigration and flows of illegal drugs from overseas — as bases for the tariff orders.\nTrump’s Justice Department Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate argued in July before the appeals court that IEEPA could not limit president's method of regulation, once the president declared an emergency. Congress would have understood that when it wrote the law, Shumate said, and Congress can step in to overrule the president's tariffs.\nBrian Simmonds Marshall, a lawyer for one of 12 states that joined the importers in their challenge opposing the tariffs, argued that the term \"regulate\" was meant to permit the president to order quotas that limit the number of imported goods — and potentially order import licensing requirements and fees.\n“IEEPA doesn't even say ‘tariffs.’ It doesn't even mention it,” one judge said during the hearing in May.\n“What does ‘regulation of importation’ mean?” another judge asked. And “If ‘regulate’ doesn’t cover tariffs, what does it cover?”\nThe appeals panel that issued Friday's decision was composed of seven judges appointed by former Democratic presidents and four appointed by Republican presidents.\nTrump tariffs versus Nixon tariffs\nThe judges looked to a Nixon-era lawsuit that addressed IEEPA’s predecessor law, known as the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA), which Trump's team cited as proof that the president’s global tariffs should be allowed to stand in court.\nRoughly five decades ago, President Nixon unilaterally imposed 10% duties on imports as part of a set of economic measures dubbed the \"Nixon shock.\" Those tariffs were challenged in court in much the same way as Trump's 2025 tariffs have been.\nA Japanese zipper-making business called Yoshida International sued, saying Nixon lacked the power to set the tariff under three different laws that the government cited as justification: the Tariff Act, the Trade Expansion Act, and the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA).\nThe most controversial justification was the TWEA.\nA US Customs Court initially sided with the zipper importer, holding that none of the three laws offered adequate authority for the duty. Yet on appeal, Nixon's tariffs were upheld.\nThe court that upheld the Nixon tariffs reasoned that \"neither need nor national emergency\" justified the levies because Congress had not delegated such power and because the authority was \"not inherent\" in his office. However, the court said, TWEA carved out enough power to regulate importation during an economic emergency.\nOne of the appeals court judges hearing the Trump case referenced the 1970s case and said, “It seems pretty clear to me that Yoshida is telling us that ‘No, the president doesn't have the authority to rewrite the Tariff Schedule.’ In this case, that's what the president is trying to do.”\nA lawyer for the challengers to Trump’s duties argued that by adopting IEEPA in 1977, Congress ratified the high court’s holding in Yoshida, which he said allowed the president to impose “modest, bounded, temporary tariffs,” but did not sanction unbounded, permanent duties.\nDuring the arguments before the appeals panel, the lawyers also sparred over whether the president’s declared national emergency met IEEPA’s requirements of \"unusual\" and \"extraordinary.\"\nOne judge agreed the president did meet these requirements by identifying underlying causes contributing to the threat, including trade deficits, tariff barriers, domestic production shortfalls, and a lack of reciprocity in US trading relationships.\n“How does that not constitute what the president is expressly saying is an extraordinary threat?” the judge asked the challengers.\nAnother judge countered, “How can a trade deficit be an extraordinary and unusual threat when we've had trade deficits for decades?”\nLawyers for the administration argued that the deficit becomes extraordinary and unusual once it reaches a point where it threatens the resources that are foundational to US national security.\nOther cases involving challenges to the IEEPA-based tariffs have been filed in multiple jurisdictions.\nIn a case set for arguments in the US Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in September, two private, family-owned American toy companies, Learning Resources, Inc., and hand2mind, Inc., allege that IEEPA neither authorizes the president to impose tariffs nor authorizes the particular challenged tariffs. The companies also allege that the tariffs violate the Administrative Procedure Act.\nA district court ruled in favor of the toy companies, which import goods from China, Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, and India.\nIn a rare legal filing, the toy companies asked the high court to grant certiorari before an anticipated judgment from the US Appeals Court for the DC Circuit.\n“Whether the President has authority to impose tariffs … is of such imperative importance that it warrants review now,” the toy companies said. However, the high court declined to take up the case.\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The company is focused on owning, operating and acquiring industrial properties in Southern California infill markets. It acquires, owns, improves, redevelops, leases and manages industrial real estate principally located in Southern California infill markets, through Rexford Industrial Realty, L.P. (Operating Partnership) and its subsidiaries. The company also acquires or provides mortgage debt secured by industrial zoned property or property suitable for industrial development. It provides property management services and leasing services to related party property owners. Its property management services include performing property inspections, monitoring repairs and maintenance, maintaining tenant relations and providing financial and accounting oversight. Its portfolio consists of 424 properties with approximately 51.0 million rentable square feet.\nStock Market Value: $9.47 billion ($40.01 per share)\nActivist: Elliott Investment Management\nOwnership: n\/a\nAverage Cost: n\/a\nActivist Commentary: Elliott is a multistrategy investment firm that manages about $76.1 billion in assets (as of June 30, 2025) and is one of the oldest firms of its type under continuous management. Known for its extensive due diligence and resources, Elliott regularly follows companies for years before making an investment. Elliott is the most active of activist investors, engaging with companies across industries and multiple geographies.\nWhat's happening\nOn Aug. 27, Elliott announced that they have taken a position in Rexford Industrial Realty.\nBehind the scenes\nRexford is an internally managed industrial REIT focused on the Southern California market. The industrial REIT space has benefited from strong secular tailwinds, as the rise of e-commerce, which requires more warehouse space on average than a traditional retail business, has driven up warehousing needs over time. Moreover, Southern California is a particularly attractive location due to entitlement challenges, land scarcity, proximity to ports and its dense urban population, all of which have fueled demand and fast rent growth. Historically, this prime and irreplaceable portfolio has commanded a top of the market valuation, trading at a 20-30% premium to net asset value (NAV) and an 8-turn premium to peers on an adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) basis.\nHowever, as we have seen many times before with many activists, REITs are inherently poorly governed and attract management teams with misaligned interests. Rexford is no different. Despite being a California-based company, they are domiciled in Maryland, a state that is infamous for management friendly regulations, including the Maryland Unsolicited Takeovers Act, which allows the company to classify its board without shareholder approval.\nA California REIT incorporating in Maryland is not for convenience reasons, but more for entrenchment purposes. It is this type of company that would also have a seven-person board with a majority (including two co-CEOs) being members for over 10 years and owning approximately 1% of outstanding common stock as a group, almost all of which was granted to them. Once setup like this, the REIT playbook is generally to take on debt, issue shares and buy as much property as you can because management's upside is tied more to the level of assets managed than stock price. Also, at cocktail parties and clubs, it is \"cool\" to manage billions of dollars of properties. So, since its IPO in 2013, the company has increased its share count by over 9x, increased debt from $193 million to $3.5 billion and grew assets from $555 million to $12.6 billion. This strategy worked for a while when Rexford traded at a large premium to the underlying value of its real estate, but it finally caught up to them as sales, general and administrative expenses bloated, corporate governance eroded and executive compensation became loaded. (Two CEOs at $13 million each). As its premium to NAV started to decline, so did this strategy and Rexford now trades at a 20% discount to NAV and a 5-6 turn AFFO discount to peers with its stock price down to $40 per share (prior to Elliott's announcement) from a high of more than $80 in December 2021.\nLuckily for shareholders, the time for change has come, as Elliott Investment Management has disclosed a top five position in Rexford. While this implies a minimum of 5% economic exposure (approximately $400 million to 500 million), given Elliott's investment history, their exposure is likely at least $1 billion of their $76 billion of assets.\nElliott has a rich history of driving change at companies like Rexford, so we expect them to advocate for better corporate governance, better capital allocation, and restore the company's strategic focus on creating shareholder value.\nWhile it is important to note that activism can be more challenging in Maryland, it has not acted as a prohibition, especially for experienced and committed activists like Elliott. In fact, the tools available to the company that would ordinarily discourage activism are in this situation more of poison chalice. Any attempt by management to entrench themselves in the face of an activist would only further damage their reputation and support Elliott's case that change is warranted. So, we would expect Elliott to fare well in a proxy fight here if it came to that. But we do not think it will come to that.\nWhen an activist engages with a company, it often puts that company in pseudo-play, getting the attention of strategic investors and private equity. This dynamic is even greater for a company like Rexford that has long been the subject of takeover speculation.\nFor Rexford, their premium assets, the consolidation in the REIT industry and their present discounted valuation makes the company a natural acquisition candidate. Moreover, Elliott also has a robust history of catalyzing strategic outcomes at REITs.\nAt Healthcare Trust of America (formerly HTA), Elliott successfully pushed for a strategic review, which ultimately led to a merger between HTA and Healthcare Realty Trust to form the largest medical office property owner in the U.S.\nGiven Rexford's current 20% discount to NAV, we believe that any takeout would occur at least at NAV, but more likely at a premium given the company's historical valuation and portfolio quality.\nIf such an opportunity were to materialize, as a fiduciary to its investors and Rexford shareholders, Elliott would weigh the value from an acquisition against the long-term standalone plan and advocate for whichever path would deliver the best value for shareholders. Considering the long-term plan would likely require the time and uncertainty of a board and management reconstitution, we would think that an acquisition at a reasonable premium would be the preferred path here.\nKen Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments.","content_hash":"602de464157061f2e6fe8e2811a0618c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":7235,"method_rank":0}

The company’s rapid growth comes as Nvidia recorded no chip sales to China during its second quarter, signaling a push by local players to innovate in the tech giant’s absence, experts tell Fortune.\nCambricon, a China-based semiconductor firm, posted record profits in the first half of the year, along with revenue that surged roughly 4,300%.\nThe earnings, released late Tuesday, serve as an example of Nvidia’s growing local competition in China, as the government and market seek alternative chipmakers to gain traction in the region. Nvidia’s business in China has been tied up in U.S. export restrictions and geopolitical tensions, and the tech behemoth recorded no H20 chip sales to China in the second quarter, per its earnings release yesterday.\nCambricon’s first-half revenue surged to 2.88 billion Chinese yuan ($402.7 million), the company reported this week. The Chinese upstart, created by two “genius brothers,” is partially state-owned and headquartered in Beijing. The company’s stock is now China’s most expensive, overtaking liquor company Kweichow Moutai. Still, despite its whopping growth, Cambricon’s revenue is a far cry from that of Nvidia, which reported $46.7 billion in its second quarter alone.\nBut experts tell Fortune Cambricon’s growth reflects a larger push to create local Nvidia rivals in China—especially as the tech giant deals with increased export restrictions under the Trump administration.\n“Nvidia apparently has a better overall offering in terms of the hardware in China, but because of the export controls, right now they cannot sell, basically, to China,” Ray Wang, research director for semiconductors, supply chain, and emerging tech at the Futurum Group, told Fortune. “They leave a big market void for a Chinese competitor to fulfill.”\nWang said large Chinese tech companies like Huawei and SMIC are “catching up rapidly” to Nvidia in terms of both product and quality, as well as production capacity.\n“That’s a serious concern for both Nvidia and the U.S. government’s agenda in terms of … dominating AI globally,” he said.\nEarlier this year, the U.S. enforced stricter export controls on China, at one point banning H20 chips—which are known to be less powerful than Nvidia’s AI chips—from being sold to the country. In July, the ban was lifted, but it also allowed time for companies to invest in innovation.\n“The problem with banning [H20 chips] is you’re effectively handing the AI market and training over to companies like Huawei or Cambricon or … other local players,” Stacy Rasgon, senior analyst of U.S. semiconductors and semiconductor capital equipment at Bernstein Research, told Fortune.\nRasgon pointed out that, in Cambricon’s case, the roughly 44-fold revenue increase to $402.7 million in the first half of this year means the company went from “tiny to small.” He said he’s less focused on the percentage growth than the reason behind it.\n“There’s a big push in China for self-sufficiency,” Rasgon said.\nCambricon’s record profit was helped by a wave of demand for Chinese chips after Beijing encouraged using local technology, citing security concerns and uncertainty over the Trump administration’s export curbs. The most recent catalyst for Cambricon’s surge came from AI startup DeepSeek, which said last week its latest model comes with a feature that can optimize locally made chips.\nLast week, the Chinese government told its tech companies to stop using Nvidia’s H20 chips after U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC that China would only receive the company’s “fourth best” chips, only adding fuel to the fire.\n“You want to sell the Chinese enough that they get addicted to the American technology stack,” Lutnick added.\nDespite technology advancements by Nvidia rivals amid geopolitical tensions, demand for its H20 chips remain—even in the face of regulatory hurdles.\nIn its second-quarter earnings, Nvidia reported no H20 sales to China-based customers. In its earnings call on Wednesday, chief financial officer Colette Kress estimated $2 billion to $5 billion in H20 revenue this quarter should “geopolitical issues reside.” Nvidia did not include any revenue from H20 chips in its third-quarter guidance, which tops analysts’ expectations of $53.14 billion at $54 billion, plus or minus 2%.\n“It was inevitable there would be more entrants into this market,” Sebastien Naji, a research analyst at William Blair, told Fortune. “Near-term, I think the risks on the regulatory front are more impactful than increased competition.”\nNvidia previously warned that if not for the U.S. chip export restrictions, its top-line guidance for the July quarter would have been $8 billion higher.\n“I think the stock does not have that priced in, in terms of if that revenue were to go away,” Scott Bickley, an advisory fellow at Info-Tech Research Group, told Fortune before Nvidia’s earnings call on Wednesday.\nCFO Kress also said during the earnings call that over the past few weeks, a “select number” of China-based customers received licenses for H20 chips, though none have been shipped based on those licenses. Kress also mentioned the U.S. government and Nvidia haven’t finalized a recent agreement that will require the chipmaker to share 15% of the revenue it makes through H20 chip sales to China.\nThere are already some Chinese products that outperform Nvidia’s H20, analyst Rasgon said. He said he expects greater competition in the local market to only catalyze chip innovation.\n“Nvidia is never going to be allowed, probably, to sell better parts in China,” Rasgon said. “So for the Chinese, it takes time, but they’re going to work on improving their own stuff. And over time, maybe that gap closes.”\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has long complained about U.S. export controls, saying they will only galvanize local players to innovate in the chipmaker’s absence.\n“The China market, I’ve estimated to be about $50 billion of opportunity for us this year if we were able to address it with competitive products,” Huang said during the second-quarter earnings call.\nBut not only does Nvidia look to resume H20 chip sales in China, the company also wants to expand its product line by introducing the high-performance Blackwell chip in the country, should the U.S. agree to it.\n“We continue to advocate for the U.S. government to approve Blackwell for China,” Kress said during the earnings call. The company aims to “win the support of every developer” in highly competitive markets, she added, so Nvidia technology can be the world’s gold standard.\n“You kind of need a Blackwell chip [in China], even though it’s going to be performance-laden in nature, relative to everything else in the market,” Angelo Zino, SVP and technology equity analyst at CFRA, told Fortune.\nWhile Zino said the H20 “probably isn’t going to give you enough to offset or get back the revenue” the company had a couple of quarters ago, introducing a Blackwell chip in China just might.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com","content_hash":"75ff938b85ba79bbfd586d8a70b2b494","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":7120,"method_rank":0}

Some or all links contained within this article are paid links.\nEconomist Peter Schiff, renowned for predicting the financial crisis of 2008, supported Donald Trump during the election season. However, right before Trump moved back into the White House, Schiff sounded the alarm about his approach to a critical issue for America: trade.\nAt a press conference in Mar-a-Lago, Trump addressed trade deficits with Canada and Europe, announcing plans to impose substantial tariffs to address the imbalance. These tariffs have subsequently caused ripples through the international economy.\nSchiff, the chief economist and global strategist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, strongly disagrees with the president.\n“Trump’s take on trade deficits is all wrong,” he wrote on Instagram, sharing a clip from The Peter Schiff Show podcast where he elaborated on his critique.\n“[Trump] said we have a huge trade deficit with Canada as if somehow that’s harming the United States — it’s actually helping the United States. It’s unfortunate that we’re not productive enough to get by without all those Canadian products,” Schiff explained.\n“Donald Trump specifically said we don’t need any Canadian cars, we don’t need any Canadian timber — of course we do! I mean, we build houses, we drive cars. I mean, if we didn’t have access to Canadian lumber or Canadian cars or any of the other things that we import from Canada — America imports a lot of stuff from Canada — what does Donald Trump think would happen to the price of all that stuff? It would go way up,” he argued.\nAmerica imports a significant volume of goods from Canada — and it’s not limited to timber and cars. The list also includes crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, and electricity, among others.\nSchiff also criticized Trump’s perspective on trade deficits with Europe, pointing out that America depends on European goods as well.\nDouble-digit inflation in 2025?\nSchiff didn’t mince words, asserting that by imposing tariffs, Trump “wants to add to the inflationary problem.”\nHe’s not alone in this critique, as economists often view tariffs as a double-edged sword. On one hand, they can protect domestic industries by making imported goods more expensive, giving local manufacturers a competitive edge. On the other hand, higher tariffs may result in increased costs for consumers, as companies pass on the extra expenses. This can lead to inflation, eroding household purchasing power and raising the cost of living.\nWhile some economists — including Nobel laureate Paul Krugman — have claimed that the U.S. has won the war against inflation, Schiff strongly disagrees. “Inflation won the war,” he declared. “Inflation is going to keep getting worse.”\nHow much worse? Last year, he warned, “By 2025 inflation will likely be in double digits, and the first digit may not be a one!”\nGiven Schiff’s dire forecast of rising price levels, where should investors seek refuge?\nHis go-to answer is simple: gold.\nThe allure of investing in gold lies in its unique properties: the yellow metal can’t be printed in unlimited quantities by central banks like fiat money. And because its value isn’t tied to any one currency or economy, gold could provide protection during periods of economic uncertainty.\nAs inflation erodes the purchasing power of paper currencies, gold’s appeal as a stable store of value often grows, driving up demand. In 2024, gold prices surged by 26%, surpassing $2,600 per ounce.\nSchiff believes this is just the beginning. “If gold can go from $20 an ounce to $2,600 an ounce, it can go from $2,600 to $26,000, or even to $100,000. There’s no limit because, again, gold isn’t changing — it’s the value of the dollar that’s decreasing,” he recently stated.\nAt today’s prices, a climb to $100,000 would represent an astounding upside of over 3,600%.\nOne way to invest in gold that also provides significant tax advantages is to open a gold IRA with the help of Thor Metals.\nGold IRAs allow investors to hold physical gold or gold-related assets within a retirement account, which combines the tax advantages of an IRA with the protective benefits of investing in gold, making it an attractive option for those looking to potentially hedge their retirement funds against economic uncertainties.\nTo learn more, you can get a free information guide that includes details on how to get up to $20,000 in free metals on qualifying purchases.\nA tangible hedge with passive income\nIn addition to gold, real estate serves as another time-tested hedge against inflation — with the added benefit of generating passive income.\nWhen inflation rises, property values often increase as well, reflecting the higher costs of materials, labor and land. This makes real estate a compelling store of value for investors looking to protect their wealth.\nMoreover, real estate doesn’t just rely on appreciation for returns. Rental properties, for instance, can provide a steady stream of passive income. As inflation pushes up the cost of living, rental income typically rises alongside it, helping landlords offset the erosion of purchasing power.\nOver the last five years, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index has surged by more than 50%.\nOne way to invest in real estate is by purchasing rental properties and becoming a landlord. But for the average American who wants to avoid the need for a hefty down payment or the burden of property management, crowdfunding platforms like Arrived makes it easier to slice yourself up a piece of that pie.\nWith Arrived, you can invest in shares of rental homes with as little as $100 without worrying about mowing lawns, fixing leaky faucets, or handling difficult tenants. The process is simple: browse a curated selection of homes that have been vetted for their appreciation and income potential. Once you find a property you like, select the number of shares you’d like to purchase, and then sit back as you start receiving rental income deposits from your investment.\nAnother option is First National Realty Partners (FNRP), which requires a larger minimum investment and targets necessity-based commercial real estate.\nThe platform lets accredited investors own a share of commercial properties leased by national brands like Whole Foods, CVS, Kroger and Walmart. The FNRP offers white-glove service to investors so you can engage with experts, explore available deals, and easily make an allocation, all in one personalized secure portal. Investors can enjoy the potential to collect stable, grocery store-anchored income every quarter.","content_hash":"225b1c043ab1dbb13927a7af39d1a8ea","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6767,"method_rank":0}

That was better than the 30.2 billion yuan expected by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.\nTotal revenue rose 2 per cent to 247.7 billion yuan in the three months ended June 30, compared with the Bloomberg consensus estimate of 253.17 billion yuan. That marked the 12th consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth for the company. Excluding revenue from the disposed businesses of Sun Art and Intime, revenue on a like-for-like basis would have grown by 10 per cent.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

As of April, the company had open-sourced more than 200 Qwen models, generating more than 300 million global downloads and over 100,000 derivative models.\nEle.me food delivery riders wait for orders at a street in Beijing.

China's market regulator has called their price war \"irrational competition\".\nAlibaba's adjusted Ebita (earnings before interest, taxes and amortisation) - an alternative measure of a company's financial health - fell 14 per cent to 38.8 billion yuan in the quarter, missing analysts' estimate of 43.25 billion yuan. That was partly due to Alibaba's investment in Taobao Instant Commerce, which competes in the on-demand delivery segment.\nStill, that outlay appeared to boost the user base of its main domestic marketplace. The instant commerce operation contributed to a 25 per cent increase in monthly active consumers on the Taobao app in the first three weeks of August.\n\"Since the launch of instant commerce four months ago, growth - in order volume, user scale, merchant supplies and delivery capacity - has exceeded expectations, particularly since July,\" said Jiang Fan, head of Alibaba's E-commerce Business Group, on the earnings call.\nQuarterly revenue from Alibaba's \"quick commerce\" business rose 12 per cent year on year to 14.8 billion yuan, boosted by the instant delivery service launched at the end of April. Operations of Taobao Shangou, Alibaba's instant commerce unit, reached a peak of 120 million daily orders, with average daily orders of 80 million in August. Monthly active users climbed to 300 million, more than triple the level in April, while daily active couriers rose to 2 million.\nGiven the high-frequency usage pattern of quick commerce, Jiang said it had become a key driver of user scale and engagement on the Taobao app. Overall, Alibaba expects the instant commerce and quick commerce operations to add about 1 trillion yuan in annualised incremental gross merchandise volume within the next three years.\nAlibaba China E-commerce group, the company's domestic online retail business, saw revenue rise 10 per cent from a year ago to 140 billion yuan.\nThe company had been consolidating its sprawling e-commerce empire since late last year, as it sought greater synergies across different business units amid slowing online retail growth.\nAIDC, meanwhile, continued its growth momentum from the past few quarters, as it posted 19 per cent revenue growth to 34.7 billion yuan in the quarter.","content_hash":"a3e51d3da84bb4432b4fafb349d00676","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6759,"method_rank":0}

It prompted direct-to-consumer business models to flourish and drop-shipping to become a dominant channel for retail sales.\nDuring the whole of 2024, 1.4 billion packages—nearly 4 million per day—were brought into the United States using the trade rule, first sketched out in Section 321 of the Trade Act of 1930. The country’s forbears and trade officials could never have predicted that the provision, originally intended to ease the duty burden on travelers bringing home souvenirs and gifts, and makers to ship samples tax free, would become what it has: a superhighway for global commerce.\nBut in the eyes of President Donald Trump, de minimis represented “a big scam”—a means for foreign actors to skirt import duties and ferry huge volumes of cheap and illicit wares into the U.S. market while facing minimal customs scrutiny.\nTrump—and the Republicans—weren’t alone in that view. In recent years, as pandemic-driven online spending ratcheted up and marketplaces like Shein and Temu rose to global prominence, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle called for the trade “loophole” to be closed. The Biden administration last fall set in motion executive actions designed to restrict the use of de minimis and rein in its rapidly growing influence.\nSome members of American industry, too, called for an end to de minimis. The National Council of Textile Organizations (NCTO), a Washington-based trade group representing the interests of the country’s textile and apparel producers, lobbied against the trade provision for years, appealing to members of the Trump and Biden administrations alike. The group argued that the law undermined the competitiveness of American-made products, which couldn’t compete with the appeal of $12 dresses from Shein—especially when they weren’t subject to the same environmental or consumer safety standards that U.S. makers face.\n“For years, companies have used this loophole to avoid tariffs and customs reporting requirements on shipments valued at $800 or less, devastating U.S. manufacturers, undercutting American jobs, and opening the floodgates to unsafe and counterfeit products and goods made with forced labor,” NCTO president and CEO Kim Glas said Thursday. “The administration’s executive action closes this channel and delivers long overdue relief to the U.S. textile industry and its workers, while strengthening America’s economic and national security.”\nBut John Lash, group vice president of product strategy at supply chain platform e2open, told Sourcing Journal that there will be downsides to the new policy for both shoppers and the supply chain.\n“Aside from the postal services temporarily halting small package delivery to America, the two parties most likely to feel the pinch from this latest action are domestic consumers and small foreign businesses,” he said.\n“For consumers, higher import costs on favorite goods are one more blow to an already fragile consumer confidence. While ending de minimis is unlikely to be the tipping point, it’s a step closer to a larger and far more significant indirect economic effect from curtailed spending,” he added. “The last time I checked, consumer spending made up just shy of 70 percent of the economy, so any downturn is concerning.”\nBrookings Institute economic expert Elena Patel wrote in a memo Thursday that the issue became deeply convoluted as de minimis came into vogue. Consumers have certainly benefited from the unfettered access to a wide assortment of globally sourced products, and some U.S. enterprises have made hay by leveraging the provision—but others have indeed seen their market share erode as they’ve been held to stricter standards and forced to pay higher taxes.\n“For low-value packages, exempting duties and documentation can reduce costs for both governments and businesses. But the rule now raises deeper questions about fairness and tax neutrality,” she said. “Two sellers, one domestic and one foreign, can offer the same product but face vastly different tax and regulatory obligations. Domestic retailers must collect and remit sales taxes and comply with consumer protection laws, while foreign sellers often bypass these requirements under de minimis.”\nDespite its disproportionate burdens on U.S. business, Patel noted that the “abruptness of this change”—the wholesale axing of de minimis—is “far from ideal, sowing uncertainty for parcel carriers, postal systems, businesses, and consumers while raising questions about how the new rules will be put into practice.”\n“The magnitude of this is not only on consumers and e-commerce marketplaces. The entire supply chain will need to recalibrate itself, and that can have significant impact on costs, on delays, as well as priorities, because I would imagine some carriers will opt out of this segment entirely,” echoed Ram Ben Tzion, founder and CEO of Ultra Information Solutions.\nOver the course of the past week, a number of international mail carriers have announced their intentions to halt service to the U.S. market due to the moratorium on de minimis. And companies like DHL, FedEx and UPS, too, will face seismic shakeups.\n“They have been optimizing capacity for years. They have been hiring space on air cargo and airplanes, which is now far less relevant and necessary to the market demands,” Ben Tzion told Sourcing Journal. “If you cannot stack up a bunch of Temu packages on an airplane, and you need to consolidate them into a container, then there’s going to be a lot of capacity that will need to be redirected or recalculated.”\nIn the supply chain technology executive’s estimation, carriers are trying to apply pressure on the government by ceasing operations. “They are hoping for an outcry from both business and private consumers that will turn this [decision] way down, reverse it or reduce it,” he believes.\nIt’s unclear to everyone involved—businesses, logistics providers, even the architects of the policy and those who will carry it out—what exactly the new rules are and how they’ll be implemented. But Ben Tzion believes that’s not just par for the course for this administration, but part of its strategy.\n“This is part of the shock therapy that we’ve been seeing on all trade policies—the back and forth with the radical measures that are not necessarily completely thought through. But the momentum and the vector is still there, meaning at the end of this tunnel there’ll be a new reality.”","content_hash":"292eaeaa854ffa4d49f42b9945cdbaf7","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6697,"method_rank":0}

But when that safety net is suddenly gone, the loss can feel devastating, both financially and emotionally.\nConsider Joe. After decades of disciplined saving, he managed to build a $50,000 emergency fund. It wasn’t easy, but it gave him confidence that he could weather whatever came his way. Then two major medical bills arrived in quick succession. Almost overnight, the account he worked so hard to build was nearly emptied, leaving him anxious about how to start again.\nJoe’s story may feel dramatic, but it’s far from unusual. In fact, according to Bankrate's 2025 Annual Emergency Savings Report, only 46% of all Americans have enough saved to cover three months of expenses. Another 30% have some money saved for emergencies but not enough to pay for three months of bills, and nearly a quarter have nothing saved at all.\nBut an emergency fund is essential, and Bankrate found that 37% of adults relied on their emergency fund sometime in the past three months.\nLosing an entire emergency fund in one fell swoop can feel discouraging. But as hard as it is to see that balance disappear, it’s important to remember that the fund did exactly what it was designed to do: protect you during a crisis. Building an emergency fund once and keeping it untouched forever might be ideal, but the reality is that it exists for moments like these.\nTo start rebuilding an emergency fund, the first thing you'll want to do is to set a specific and realistic goal for rebuilding your emergency fund. What's reasonable for you will depend on what your income is. It’s generally recommended that an emergency fund will have enough money to cover 3 to 6 months of essential expenses (housing payment, utility bills, etc.).\nFor example, if your monthly essential expenses are $2,000, then six months of emergency funds would be about $12,000.\nOnce you’ve identified how much you need to save, the next step is figuring out what you need to set aside each month to get there. The timeline should fit your income and circumstances. If you aim too high, you risk leaving yourself cash-strapped and stressed, which makes the process unsustainable. A more realistic plan, even if it takes longer, will keep you motivated.\nIf your goal is to save $12,000, you could aim to save about $300 per month for three years.\nOf course, you also don't want to abandon other goals, like saving for retirement and earning your employer a match on your 401(k) funds, so look at the big picture and find a balance for how fast you can rebuild.\nThe next step is to track your spending and make a detailed budget that is both realistic and that prioritizes saving for emergencies. Living under a strict budget can feel restrictive, but while you’re rebuilding an emergency fund, it’s a necessary — and temporary — state. Once your savings are back on solid ground, you’ll be able to loosen the reins a bit and enjoy more flexibility.\nIf you look back at credit card statements and monitor what you're spending money on now, you'll get a good baseline for where your cash is going. Using this information, you can create a detailed budget that accounts for every dollar, and that includes the money you're trying to save for emergencies.\nFor example, you can specify in your budget how much you'll save, as well as how much to spend on groceries, entertainment, clothing, dining out, housing, transportation and all of your other costs.\nTreat those contributions as non-negotiable, the same way you would a rent payment or utility bill. By putting emergency savings first and building the rest of your budget around it, you make sure progress happens consistently, even if other spending categories have to tighten for a while.\nRead more: Rich, young Americans are ditching stocks — here are the alternative assets they're banking on instead\nNext, look for areas in your budget that you can cut to make sure you can meet or exceed your goals in saving for emergencies. Some of these cuts might feel small, like canceling a $10 subscription, while others, such as refinancing debt or shopping for cheaper insurance, can make a bigger impact. Here’s what you can look for:\n-\nStreaming services\n-\nUnused gym memberships\n-\nYour clothing budget (consider shopping at thrift stores or not buying new things)\n-\nYour grocery budget (you can use coupons)\n-\nYour cell phone bill (shop for a cheaper plan)\n-\nYour transportation costs (consider carpooling or public transportation)\n-\nYour utility bills (turn down the head or the AC and unplug unused appliances)\n-\nYour entertainment costs (look into free activities)\n-\nYour insurance costs (increase your deductibles or drop unnecessary coverages)\n-\nYour bank fees (switch to a bank that doesn't charge)\n-\nYour debt expenses (refinance to a loan with a lower monthly payment)*\nThe key is to examine your spending line by line and ask yourself if each expense is essential right now. Remember, this rebuilding process is temporary so you don't have to sacrifice forever.\nOnce you’ve found room in your budget, the best way to make sure you actually save it is to take the decision out of your hands. Automating contributions means the money moves into your emergency fund before you have the chance to spend it elsewhere.\nSo if you said you'd save $100 a month toward your emergency fund, set that up to happen on payday.\nYou can even use the budget cuts you found to save more money. For example, if you cancelled a streaming service and saved $10 per month, for example, set up a transfer of $110 per month to savings, instead of $100.\nAutomating the process means you won't miss a contribution, and it makes it more likely you'll build up your emergency fund faster.\nRebuilding an emergency fund after it’s been drained can feel overwhelming, but remember: the fact that you had savings to fall back on already put you ahead of the curve. Most people never get that far.\nBy setting realistic goals, sticking to a temporary budget, cutting where you can, and automating contributions, you can gradually restore the safety net that once gave you peace of mind. It won’t happen overnight, but every step forward puts you in a stronger position for the next unexpected expense.\nYour emergency fund did its job — it was there when you needed it. Now the task is to rebuild, one contribution at a time.\nStay in the know. Join 200,000+ readers and get the best of Moneywise sent straight to your inbox every week for free.

(Hint: Not Broadcom)\nBig tech companies are set to spend $375 billion on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure this year, according to estimates from analysts at UBS. That number will climb to $500 billion next year.\nThe biggest expense item in building out AI data centers is semiconductors. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been by far the biggest beneficiary of that spend so far. Its GPUs offer best-in-class capabilities for general AI training and inference. Other AI accelerator chipmakers have also seen strong sales growth, including Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), which makes custom AI chips as well as networking chips, which ensure data moves efficiently from one server to another, keeping downtime to a minimum.\nBroadcom's stock price has increased more than fivefold since the start of 2023, and the company now sports a market cap of $1.4 trillion. Another year of spectacular growth could easily place it in the $2 trillion club. But another semiconductor stock looks like a more likely candidate to reach that vaunted level, joining Nvidia and the four other members of the club by 2028.\nIs Broadcom a $2 trillion company?\nBroadcom is a massive company with operations spanning hardware and software, but its AI chips business is currently steering the ship.\nTo that end, AI revenue climbed 46% year over year last quarter to reach $4.4 billion. Management expects the current quarter to produce $5.1 billion in AI semiconductor revenue, accelerating growth to roughly 60%. AI-related revenue now accounts for roughly 30% of Broadcom's sales, and that's set to keep climbing over the next few years.\nBroadcom's acquisition of VMware last year is another growth driver. The software company is now fully integrated into Broadcom's larger operations, and it's seen strong success in upselling customers to the VMware Cloud Foundation, enabling enterprises to run their own private clouds. Over 87% of its customers have transitioned to the new subscription, resulting in double-digit growth in annual recurring revenue.\nBut Broadcom shares are extremely expensive. The stock garners a forward P\/E ratio of 45. While its AI chip sales are growing quickly and it's seeing strong margin improvement from VMware, it's important not to lose sight of how broad a company Broadcom is. Despite the stellar growth in those two businesses, the company is still only growing its top line at about 20% year over year. Investors should expect only incremental margin improvements going forward as it scales the AI accelerator business. That means the business is set up for strong earnings growth, but not enough to justify its 45 times earnings multiple.\nAnother semiconductor stock trades at a much more reasonable multiple, and is growing just as fast.\nThe semiconductor giant poised to join the $2 trillion club by 2028\nBoth Broadcom and Nvidia rely on another company to ensure they can create the most advanced semiconductors in the world for AI training and inference. That company is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), which actually prints and packages both companies' designs. Almost every company designing leading-edge chips relies on TSMC for its technological capabilities. As a result, its market share of semiconductor manufacturing has climbed to more than two-thirds.\nTSMC benefits from a virtuous cycle, ensuring it maintains and grows its massive market share. Its technology lead helps it win big contracts from companies like Nvidia and Broadcom. That gives it the capital to invest in expanding capacity and research and development for its next-generation process. As a result, it maintains its technology lead while offering enough capacity to meet the growing demand for manufacturing.\nTSMC's leading-edge process node, dubbed N2, will reportedly charge a 66% premium per silicon wafer over the previous generation (N3). That's a much bigger step-up in price than it's historically managed, but the demand for the process is strong as companies are willing to spend whatever it takes to access the next bump in power and energy efficiency. While TSMC typically experiences a significant drop off in gross margin as it ramps up a new expensive node with lower initial yields, its current pricing should help it maintain its margins for years to come as it eventually transitions to an even more advanced process next year.\nManagement expects AI-related revenue to average mid-40% growth per year from 2024 through 2029. While AI chips are still a relatively small part of TSMC's business, that should produce overall revenue growth of about 20% for the business. Its ability to maintain a strong gross margin as it ramps up the next two manufacturing processes should allow it to produce operating earnings growth exceeding that 20% mark.\nTSMC's stock trades at a much more reasonable earnings multiple of 24 times expectations. Considering the business could generate earnings growth in the low 20% range, that's a great price for the stock. If it can maintain that earnings multiple through 2028 while growing earnings at about 20% per year, the stock will be worth well over $2 trillion at that point.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

Its latest earnings beat gave Wall Street something to cheer about, lifting shares to year-to-date (YTD) highs despite an uneasy backdrop of weak consumer demand and intensifying trade headwinds.\nBut scratch beneath the surface, and the picture is not as simple. Profits slipped, weighed down by massive spending to fend off rivals, subsidize merchants, and fuel international expansion — all while tariffs and price wars keep biting. From Beijing’s push to revive spending to U.S. tariffs driving up logistics costs, PDD is taking big risks in rough waters that could either cement its dominance or erode near-term returns.\nManagement has already cautioned that these investments will create choppiness in financials, with mounting pressure in the near term as competition intensifies. With the calendar about to flip to September, does PDD stock deserve a spot in an investor’s portfolio? Or should investors sit tight — or even quietly cash out?\nAbout PDD Holdings Stock\nPDD Holdings — founded in 2015 and headquartered in Dublin Ireland — has rapidly evolved from a discount marketplace into China’s third-largest e-commerce powerhouse. Known for Pinduoduo’s low-cost shopping model and Temu’s explosive global expansion, PDD disrupted the market by connecting farmers, merchants, and consumers directly. Rising faster than giants like Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD), PDD has turned aggressive expansion and sharp pricing into its signature edge in the global retail game. Its market capitalization currently stands at $170 billion.\nPDD stock has staged a dramatic turnaround this year. After bottoming at $87.11 in April, the stock has ripped 40% off the lows and is up 26% year-to-date (YTD), breaking past the $120 mark in August and holding above it since last week. It tapped a YTD high of $133.33 after blowout second-quarter results before cooling off on management’s cautious tone.\nIn terms of valuation, PDD stock is priced at 16.2 times forward adjusted earnings, sitting below industry peers and its historical median, signaling the market has not fully priced in its ambitious growth story yet.\nPDD’s Q2 Surprise Comes with Management’s Caution Tone\nPDD Holdings delivered a mixed bag in its second-quarter results, weaving a story of solid growth and rising pressure in an increasingly cutthroat e-commerce arena. In Q2, the company reported revenue of RMB 103.98 billion ($14.52 billion), up 7% year-over-year (YOY) and slightly ahead of expectations. The top-line growth was driven by a 13% increase in online marketing services. Meanwhile, adjusted earnings of RMB 22.07 per ADS ($3.08), although down 5% annually, comfortably exceeded analyst estimates.\nShares rallied on the beat, but beneath the surface, the story was slightly complex. The top-line growth was the slowest in nearly four years. Plus, non-GAAP operating profit plunged 21% YOY to RMB 27.7 billion ($3.9 billion), while non-GAAP net income slipped 5% annually to RMB 32.7 billion ($4.6 billion) as PDD funneled billions into merchant support, marketing, and supply-chain investments. Adding to investor concerns, net cash generated from operating activities nearly halved to RMB 21.6 billion ($3 billion), mainly due to lower net income and changes in working capital.\nDespite this, PDD’s liquidity position remains strong, with cash, equivalents, and short-term investments rising to RMB 387.1 billion ($54 billion) from RMB 331.6 billion as of Dec. 31, 2024, giving the company ample firepower to sustain heavy investments.\nManagement acknowledged intensifying competition, forcing PDD to double down on promotions and subsidies to retain users and merchants. Temu, its fast-growing international arm, is pivoting to a “fully-managed” model, giving PDD greater control over pricing, product curation, and logistics to compete with giants like Amazon’s (AMZN) scale and bargaining power.\nLooking ahead, management signaled profit volatility as heavy investments continue. While China’s consumer market shows resilience, rising platform-switching behavior and regulatory uncertainties add pressure. Pro-consumption policies and online retail penetration remain strong tailwinds, but the industry’s structure is shifting fast.\nPDD’s strategy — sacrificing short-term margins to expand its merchant ecosystem and drive consumer savings — reflects its intent to secure long-term dominance. Yet, with escalating competition, global economic uncertainties, and supply-chain risks, sustaining this balance won’t be easy.\nAnalysts monitoring PDD expect its EPS to decline 27% annually to $7.63 this year, before rebounding by 33% to $10.16 in fiscal 2026.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for PDD Stock?\nAnalysts remain divided on PDD stock after yesterday’s, painting a picture of optimism tempered by a dash of caution. Jefferies analyst Thomas Chong struck an upbeat tone, raising his price target to $146 from $121 while keeping a “Buy” rating. Chong believes PDD’s RMB 100 billion merchant support program will fuel global expansion and build customer trust, positioning Temu to deepen its international reach.\nMorgan Stanley also acknowledged the “notable” profit beat despite in-line revenue, viewing the results as a sign of operational strength.\nMacquarie analyst Ellie Jiang sounded even more bullish, lifting the target to $165 from $126 and maintaining an “Outperform” rating. Jiang called the results “better-than-feared,” considering intense domestic competition and Temu’s geopolitical hurdles, suggesting PDD has showcased impressive cost flexibility amid turbulence. Yet, the analyst warned that the steep intraday swings following management’s “unsustained profitability” comments reflected investor concerns around transparency and heavy ongoing investments.\nThe consensus rating on PDD stock remains at a “Moderate Buy” based on 18 analysts covering shares. Among them, 10 recommend a “Strong Buy,” while the remaining eight analysts advise a “Hold” rating.\nPDD stock has a mean price target of $140.68, implying 15% upside potential from here. The Street-high call of $170 hints at a potential 38% rally from current levels.\nOn the date of publication, Sristi Suman Jayaswal did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Whether you built up that cash from grinding away at your job or reining in your spending, you’re well ahead of the average American, who doesn’t even have $1,000 set aside for an emergency.\nYou don’t want to blow it. You want to grow it. Stashing $5,000 in a bank account may feel like the safest option, but over time, its value will shrink with inflation. There are other ways to make that money work for you.\nAs a finance writer, I’ve picked up many of those strategies from financial experts and applied them as a DIY investor. I’ve had to. Managing money responsibly is a necessity, not an option, for freelancers like me. It means I can also relate to people who are new to investing.\nNow I want to use my personal experience to help you along the way to your best financial future — and hey, $5,000 is a great start.\nThe best strategy for you will be highly dependent on your personal situation. Let’s look at a few hypothetical scenarios to help you start thinking about how best to balance growth and risk with a pile of cash this big.\nImagine someone beginning her career, like Rachel, 25, who’s single and who just started an entry-level marketing job. The idea of investing excites her — but it also stresses her out because $5,000 is all she has saved.\nRead more: Rich, young Americans are ditching stocks — here are the alternative assets they're banking on instead\nCommon wisdom is to keep at least three months’ worth of money stashed away in an emergency fund — and that’s good advice.\nIf I were in Rachel’s situation, I might consider putting $4,000 in a high-yield savings account so I have a solid start and access to fast funds, especially for an emergency.\nI might put the other $1,000 into a broad-based ETF with a beginner-friendly brokerage with low fees — a safer alternative for beginner investors than daytrading or picking their own stocks.\nOr I could start investing in my retirement really early, investing that $1,000 in a Roth IRA account, and take advantage of the tax-free benefits.\nWhile this kind of allocation may not come with huge gains, it’s good to start a wealth-building journey on solid ground and have an emergency fund available for life’s uncertainties.\nPicture an IT tech like Raj, 30, who’s married, no kids. His company pays him a good salary and he’s managed to pay down his debt and even put some cash aside in an emergency fund. He’s ready and keen to start investing.\nIf I were Raj, I’d consider investing $3,500 of my $5,000 in a total stock market ETF with a taxable brokerage account.\nI might invest another $1,000 in a broad-based market ETF in a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA (depending on current income and future expectations) to save for retirement.\nThe remaining $500 would be “play money” to invest in a few solo stocks I feel good about. But as a beginner, I’d avoid investing in the latest trending stocks or day trading until I’m much more experienced.\nIn the meantime, I might buy more ETF shares and read up on news from reputable publications that follow the stock market. Then I could try a no-risk paper trading simulator to test day trading before diving deeper into these riskier strategies.\nPutting all $5,000 in the market as a beginner would expose me to market volatility but it would also teach the value of staying the course. At 30, Raj has time to ride out the ups and downs of the market for the long term, and historical data shows the market has always recovered from dips in the past.\nDanielle, 28, is a single mom and teacher who, when not working and raising her son, is also juggling $25,000 in federal student loans. For Danielle, every dollar has a job and she wants to be more cautious with her money.\nIn Danielle’s situation, paying off debt would be my top priority. Interest on $25,000 could mount up quickly. I might use my savings to tackle the student debt with a $2,500 lump-sum payment.\nI’d put another $1,000 of my $5,000 in savings into a high-yield savings account so I’d have instant access to the cash in an emergency — something any single parent would understandably worry about.\nIt’s clear Danielle doesn’t have the time or financial cushion to take on a ton of risks. In her position, I’d consider investing the remaining $1,500 in a low-risk, income-focused option like a bond portfolio with a robo-advisor.\nIn Danelle’s position, I’d avoid investing in ETFs until I had a solid emergency fund, was debt-free and secure with a reliable income. While this strategy wouldn’t generate growth, it’s predictable with a safety net if life gets real.\nTerry, 35, is married with one child. He’s a civil engineer and has a 401(k) through his firm. He wants to accelerate retirement and go beyond investing basics. He’s disciplined but not highly experienced when it comes to investing.\nIf I were Terry, I’d consider putting the entire $5,000 in a tax-advantaged IRA — either traditional or Roth — after crunching the numbers in an online IRA calculator to compare the tax rates for traditional and Roth IRA accounts.\nTerry doesn’t have the time to micromanage investments or the experience to “beat the market.” This novice investor has a family to support.\nIn his shoes, I’d set up my IRA account with a brokerage known for low-fee mutual funds and ETFs.\nI’d put most of my $5,000 in market ETFs and the remainder in blue-chip stocks or income-generating assets like REITs or bond ETFs. That kind of diversification is key to balancing growth and risk.\nAs for accelerating retirement, I could set up automatic monthly deposits into my Roth IRA, increasing my prospects for capital growth and income-generating investments. Like Raj, Terry has time to let his tax-sheltered investments sit for years.\nThere’s an investment strategy for everyone, whether you have $50, $5,000 or $500,000. And the strategies I’d consider might not work for somebody else.\nThat’s why it never hurts to consult a professional to talk through your own unique situation.\nIf you’ve saved up $5,000, you’ve already made great financial moves. A qualified financial advisor can help ensure you’re making all the right moves going forward, too.\nStay in the know.

U.S. healthcare stocks are now trading at their steepest discount to the rest of the market in three decades. The sector's forward price-to-earnings ratio is around 16x, well below the S&P 500’s 22x and much less than tech’s lofty 30x, which highlights just how undervalued healthcare is for the earnings offered.\nAbbVie (ABBV) has climbed 17.25% year-to-date (YTD), well ahead of its sector, while Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has returned a solid 22.04% in the same period. Both have delivered strong quarterly results; AbbVie posted $2.97 per share and Johnson & Johnson $2.77. With market values at $366.6 billion and $429.7 billion, they stand out as major players when much of the sector has struggled.\nAugust has been tagged by Evercore as a potential turnaround month for healthcare, and AbbVie’s and Johnson & Johnson’s price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratios, 17.50x and 16.51x, compare favorably to the sector average of 18.17. Could these bargains offer even more upside potential than big names like UnitedHealth (UNH) with a ratio of 18.97x, above the sector average? Let's dig deeper.\nAbbVie Inc. (ABBV)\nAbbVie is a global drugmaker that develops and sells medicines across immunology, oncology, neuroscience, and aesthetics, shifting from older blockbusters like Humira to next‑generation therapies with a broader, innovation‑driven portfolio.\nABBV stock is up 5.59% over the past 52 weeks and 9.8% in the past month, showing steady momentum that has led sector peers in recent weeks.\nA strong dividend adds support, with a 3.11% yield versus the healthcare average of 1.58%, a forward payout ratio of 59.92%, and 53 straight years of increases, signaling consistent cash generation and disciplined capital returns.\nSecond‑quarter 2025 results were solid: adjusted EPS of $2.97, up 12.1% year over year, on net revenue of $15.423 billion, up 6.6%. Immunology remains the anchor, with Skyrizi and Rinvoq together tracking toward more than $25 billion in 2025 revenue to more than offset Humira softness, while neuroscience and oncology are adding double‑digit growth that diversifies earnings and reduces concentration risk. Guidance moved higher, with full‑year adjusted EPS now $11.88–$12.08 and revenue guided to $60.5 billion, even after accounting for R&D and milestone costs tied to business development.\nRecent moves strengthen the long‑term story. The Capstan Therapeutics acquisition brings an in vivo CAR‑T platform aimed at autoimmune disease that seeks deep B‑cell depletion without lymphodepleting chemo, opening a new path beyond conventional ex vivo approaches. The planned $195 million U.S. investment to expand API manufacturing adds capacity and resilience, supports the North Chicago workforce, and aligns production with a larger pipeline, building a firmer base for growth through the decade.\nAnalyst views are constructive: all 29 surveyed rate the shares a consensus “Moderate Buy,” with a mean target of $215.81, about 3% above its recent price levels.\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ)\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) is one of the largest healthcare names, with a business built around two main areas: Innovative Medicine, which covers drugs for cancer, immune and nerve disorders, and more, plus MedTech, where it develops everything from surgical tools to orthopedic solutions.\nThe stock has shown steady growth, climbing 7.16% in the past 12 months and another 5.67% over the last month, showing strength in a market filled with uncertainty.\nIt’s known for its reliable dividend, giving a forward yield of 3.58%, well above the sector average. Its 64-year streak of increases, supported by a forward payout ratio near 50% signals confidence in cash flow durability.\nIn the second quarter of 2025, sales hit $23.7 billion (up nearly 6%), and earnings came in at $2.29 per share (GAAP) and $2.77 (adjusted). The pipeline has added wins with IMAAVY gaining approval for gMG, TAR-200 moving to priority review, strong data for CARVYKTI in multiple myeloma, and steady progress for OTTAVA in general surgery robotics. Expectations for the year have been raised, with sales now seen up 5.4% and EPS targets set at $10.85 (GAAP) and $10.68 (adjusted), showing management’s confidence as both core businesses keep performing.\nStrategically, Johnson & Johnson MedTech launched the VIRTUGUIDE AI‑powered, patient‑matched Lapidus system in the U.S. to streamline bunion surgery planning and execution, with early adopters estimating procedural time savings of at least 30 minutes, an innovation aimed at a prevalent condition affecting roughly a third of adults and a tangible example of MedTech’s software‑enabled productivity push. Separately, the company expanded its global initiative to support the nursing workforce via the J&J CareCommunity platform, targeting the projected 4.5 million nurse shortfall by 2030, which can strengthen health systems and indirectly bolster adoption and utilization across J&J’s therapeutic and procedural franchises over time.\nThe 25 analysts covering Johnson & Johnson rate the stock a consensus “Moderate Buy,” with the average target of $177.36, just a hair above the recent price of $175.92.\nConclusion\nAbbVie and Johnson & Johnson both offer what investors want right now: clear earnings momentum, durable cash returns, and tangible growth catalysts.\nAbbVie’s immunology engine (Skyrizi\/Rinvoq) is driving double‑digit adjusted EPS growth and a guidance raise, while fresh moves like the Capstan deal and new U.S. API capacity add runway and resilience. Johnson & Johnson pairs steady top‑line growth and a higher 2025 outlook with real product traction in Innovative Medicine and MedTech, plus software‑enabled tools like VIRTUGUIDE.\nWith reasonable forward multiples and reliable dividends, both names screen as smarter-value buys than UnitedHealth at this stage.\nOn the date of publication, Ebube Jones did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Simply stated, they provide traders tools that regular equity ownership can’t provide.\nIn most cases, the strategy for market participation is purely binary: either you’re long the security in question or you’re not long (as in, you’re not participating in the opportunity at all). Of course, you can choose to short a position but that comes with incredible financial risks. As such, most retail folks wisely avoid this route.\nOn the other hand, options deliver directional flexibility. Sure, many point to the leveraged long and short strategies available. However, what I appreciate is the ability to be bullish or bearish from either a debit (cash outlay) or credit (cash influx) position.\nFurther, options provide strategic flexibility. Not all ideas may offer a clear directional trajectory over an indefinite period. Or in other cases, the anticipated move may only be minimal. With the geometry of particular transactions — such as bull call spreads — traders can potentially extract huge payouts from relatively small swings.\nOf course, options tend to intimidate newcomers because of the jargon-rich environment. Here’s the deal with the Greeks and other complex concepts in the derivatives space: they provide information but they won’t automatically help you be a successful trader.\nTo actually make money trading, you have to think like a quarterback. You’re going to identify the coverage, exploit any vulnerabilities and hit your target. Here’s your game plan for the next several weeks.\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI)\nFirst up on our hit list is Super Micro Computer (SMCI). As with most technical analysts, we’re going to operate with the reasonable presupposition that the market has already priced in all publicly available information for SMCI stock. But rather than relying on interpretive signals, we’re going to look for empirical, falsifiable patterns.\nBut before we dive into the good stuff, we’ve got to establish a baseline expectation for SMCI stock. Using path-dependent analytics — which takes into account SMCI’s aggregate pricing data — we can map out the security’s expected drift. Over the next 10 weeks and assuming no special mispricing, Super Micro may fluctuate somewhere between about $42.50 and $44.20.\nHowever, in the past 10 weeks, the market has voted to buy SMCI stock six times and sell four times. Moreover, the stock incurred a downward trajectory, despite the balance of accumulative sessions outweighing distributive. Historically, this sequence — which can be classified as 6-4-D — has represented a near-term reversal.\nWhat’s more, the conditional drift associated with this sequence features a much wider range with a positive skew, landing between $44 and over $49.\nIn football terms, the market makers are positioned in an aggressive Cover 1 defense, with only one dedicated defender covering the deep ball. As such, using data provided by Barchart Premier, I’d take a look at the 42\/44 bull call spread expiring Oct. 17.\nIf SMCI stock rises 5.92% from now to the expiration date, you can collect a maximum payout of over 117%.\nCardinal Health (CAH)\nNext on our list is Cardinal Health (CAH). One of the standout names in the healthcare services industry, Cardinal has witnessed its shares rise nearly 26% since the start of this year. However, since the second half of 2025, CAH stock is down more than 11%, potentially offering contrarians a discount.\nUsing pathway-dependent analytics, the natural drift associated with CAH stock may see it range between a median low of $150.59 to a median high of $155.25 over the next 10 weeks. However, CAH has also printed a 3-7-D sequence: three up weeks, seven down weeks, with an overall downward trajectory. Historically, this sequence tends to be a sentiment reversal rather than a bearish continuation pattern.\nEven more enticing, the projected drift of the 3-7-D may see CAH stock ranging between $165 and over $175. Again, I would classify market makers as being positioned in an aggressive Cover 1 defense, with the focus being on putting more defenders in the box to stop the run.\nSuch a scheme leaves market makers vulnerable to the long ball and that’s what we’re going to aim for with the 155\/160 bull spread expiring Oct. 17. If CAH stock rises 7.54% from now to expiration, the max payout for the aforementioned trade clocks in at over 122%.\nGroupon (GRPN)\nWithout hesitation, Groupon (GRPN) is easily the riskiest idea on this list. It’s not just about the volatility and overall wildness of GRPN stock, although it’s liable to take people on quite a journey. Sure, on a year-to-date basis, GRPN is up nearly 115%. However, in the trailing month, it also slipped almost 18%. Still, there could be a case for a discount here.\nAgain, using pathway-dependent analytics, the natural drift associated with GRPN stock may see it range between a median low of roughly $24.27 and a median high of $26.42. However, GRPN has also printed a 3-7-D sequence: three up weeks, seven down weeks, negative trajectory. When this sequence flashes, there’s a 55.9% chance that the following week’s price action results in upside.\nMoreover, the conditional drift associated with the 3-7-D may see the price range from around $23 to $32. This range engulfs GRPN’s baseline or aggregate drift, which means that there’s potential opportunity on the upside but also sizable risk to the downside.\nAs mentioned earlier, in football terms, market makers are positioned in an aggressive Cover 1 defensive scheme. However, in GRPN’s case, some of the defenders are also showing blitz. That’s going to leave the middle of the field open — assuming you don’t get sacked.\nIf you’re feeling gutsy, I’d take a look at the 28\/30 bull spread expiring Oct. 17. You’ll need a 15% move but this would translate to a nearly 208% payout if successful.\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The company's shares are up over 1,500% in the past 12 months through Aug. 27.\nRigetti and other businesses in the sector are developing technology with the potential to transform industries, including medicine and artificial intelligence. Because quantum computers are powered by atomic particles, they boast computational capabilities beyond the reach of current classical computers.\nHowever, they also have shortcomings that hinder their widespread adoption. One key drawback is that errors creep into quantum computations due to the extreme difficulty of isolating and controlling quantum states. While quantum computing is inherently probabilistic (which is actually useful for many algorithms that rely on randomness), the real challenge is that environmental noise and imperfect controls corrupt these probabilities. Finding and correcting these errors -- distinguishing between intended quantum randomness and unwanted noise -- is one of the field's key issues.\nCan Rigetti's tech overcome such challenges? Discovering the answer requires diving into the company in more detail.\nRigetti's technological prowess\nRigetti's technology employs superconducting qubits, a widely used approach to quantum computing due to its advantages. This method performs faster than other quantum techniques and leverages existing semiconductor chip fabrication processes, which helps to scale up the technology.\nIn recent weeks, Rigetti unveiled its latest invention, the Cepheus-1-36Q. This multi-chip quantum machine is the largest in the industry, according to the company. Moreover, the device's calculation error rate is half that of its predecessor.\nThe Cepheus-1-36Q shows Rigetti is making progress toward overcoming the issues inherent in quantum computers. Despite that, the company isn't growing sales this year. In the second quarter, Rigetti generated $1.8 million in revenue, which was down from $3.1 million in 2024.\nA look into Rigetti's financials\nWhile the company has struggled to produce revenue, its costs are climbing. Rigetti's Q2 cost of revenue and operating expenses both ticked up from 2024, resulting in an operating loss of $19.9 million versus a loss of $16.1 million in the previous year.\nThe costly combination of rising expenses and declining sales is cause for concern. Rigetti's saving grace is that it amassed an impressive $571.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale investments with no debt on its balance sheet. The funds can sustain operations in the short term as the company builds up income.\nThe quest to increase sales relies on how quickly Rigetti's tech can achieve quantum advantage. This is the point at which a quantum device can solve useful, real-world problems more effectively than classical computers.\nAccording to CEO Dr. Subodh Kulkarni, Rigetti is about four years away from achieving quantum advantage. In the meantime, it's cobbling revenue together from organizations interested in quantum computing for research and experimentation, such as its collaboration with Montana State University announced on Aug. 20.\nFactors to consider before deciding on Rigetti stock\nAt this early stage in quantum computing's development, Rigetti's future depends on reaching quantum advantage as fast as possible. Once there, it can unlock more sales as its technology becomes a superior alternative to classical supercomputers.\nCan Rigetti achieve this goal in four years? Its shares are trading as if that's likely.\nHere's a look at the stock's valuation using the price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio, and contrasting it to other pure-play quantum computing competitors IonQ and D-Wave Quantum. This metric measures how much investors are willing to pay for every dollar of revenue generated over the trailing 12 months.\nRigetti's P\/S multiple is sky-high compared to its rivals, indicating that shares are expensive. Perhaps investors are betting the company can achieve quantum advantage.\nBut a lot can happen in four years, and if Rigetti continues to burn through cash with little revenue trickling in, the business may not survive to achieve its goal.\nIn addition, many well-heeled competitors, including Alphabet-owned Google, are actively pursuing quantum advantage. Google has already developed a quantum chip capable of completing a complex computation in five minutes that would take centuries with today's fastest supercomputers. Granted, this algorithm is a benchmark designed to be easy for quantum computers and hard for digital system, but it's still an impressive achievement.\nAlthough it's too early to tell which business will deliver the dominant technology, one or more of these rivals could build a scalable quantum computer that overcomes the obstacles to broad adoption. This competition impacts Rigetti's ability to attract customers, as evidenced by its difficulties with revenue growth.\nConsequently, only investors with a high risk tolerance should consider buying Rigetti shares. Even then, given its stock's inflated valuation, the ideal approach is to wait for the share price to drop before deciding to invest.\nShould you buy stock in Rigetti Computing right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Rigetti Computing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Rigetti Computing wasn’t one of them.

AT&T Inc. said on Tuesday it’s buying spectrum licenses from EchoStar Corp. for about $23 billion, a move that will probably be at least partly funded with bonds.\nCompanies have broadly been lifting their debt loads relative to earnings, with that leverage ratio in the second quarter close to its highest level since 2021. Corporations’ willingness to lever up represents a shift in their thinking.\nAs the Federal Reserve started raising rates in 2022 and debt became more expensive, many companies sought to cut their borrowings. AT&T’s debt load steadily declined through the first quarter of 2025, for example.\nBut the Fed is moving closer to a renewed round of rate cutting, potentially lowering the cost of borrowing. The Trump administration is seen as more likely to grant regulatory approval for corporate tie-ups. Executives are gaining more confidence that the stock market volatility has ebbed, while questions about corporate tax rates have been clarified. All of that has improved the conditions to make acquisitions.\n“We had a tremendous amount of uncertainty in the first part of the year,” said Hans Mikkelsen, a credit strategist at TD Securities. With some of it resolved, he said, “that’s really what’s unleashing all this M&A.”\nFor much of this year, credit markets have been starved of acquisition financings, debt sales that not only provide fresh supply but also often include long-dated bonds. Money managers are eager to buy longer-term securities in a world of historically elevated yields that may soon decline. This year, M&A-related financings account for around 10% of high-grade debt sales, compared with 15% in 2019, according to JPMorgan.\nSyndicate professionals expect many of the recently announced deals to make their way to the debt markets later this year or in 2026, since companies typically wait until their acquisitions close to refinance bridge loans with permanent financing. Keurig Dr Pepper’s tie-up is expected to close in the first half of next year, while AT&T said it expects to finalize its transaction in mid-2026.\nIt’s possible, however, that some firms choose to sell debt before completing their deals, especially if credit spreads stay tight and borrowing costs fall further. The companies could include a condition known as special mandatory redemption language, which would let them buy the bonds back at a small premium if their acquisition doesn’t go through.\n“Particularly if we see a gap lower in rates, there’ll be more incentive for those companies to de-risk the debt component of those acquisition financings,” said Ryan Morrell, co-head of investment grade debt capital markets at PNC Financial Services Group Inc.\nEither way, more debt-fueled acquisitions are probably coming at high-grade companies, teeing up a busy 2026.\n“Now a few months after that fear episode in April, we are getting a restart of animal spirits,” said Piers Ronan, co-head of debt capital markets and syndicate at Truist Securities. “That, I’m sure, will continue into 2026 and hopefully beyond.”\nWeek In Review\nEchoStar Corp.’s mega-sale of spectrum licenses to AT&T Inc. sent some of its $25 billion of debt soaring from distressed levels, vindicating bondholders who withstood years of brinkmanship and legal drama with the wireless and pay-TV empire led by billionaire Charlie Ergen.\nBanco Santander SA is leading a roughly $2.7 billion debt deal to support Thoma Bravo’s acquisition of customer-service automation business Verint Systems Inc.\nPrivate equity firm GTCR is in talks with direct lenders including KKR & Co. to drum up financing to support a bid to acquire generic drugmaker Zentiva.\nA group of banks led by Bank of Montreal is looking to relaunch a loan supporting HIG Capital’s buyout of Converge Technology Solutions Corp., four months after banks were forced to fund the deal when tariffs upended markets.\nSpirit Aviation Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy for the second time in less than a year after failing to turn around its cash-strapped airline.\nThe maturing loan behind a pair of commercial-property bonds tied to Saks Global Enterprises was transferred to a workout specialist and given a 60-day extension, as the struggling retailer lines up new financing.\nKeurig Dr Pepper Inc. is considering selling debt in the European bond market to finance part of its €15.7 billion ($18.4 billion) purchase of JDE Peet’s NV.\nFrench companies with limited exposure to the domestic economy managed to raise new funds in the bond market even as the country’s political risk heats up.\nThe first bond designed to bankroll Europe’s defense spending was sold by a French bank on Thursday, with over €2.8 billion in orders showing strong investor interest in the sector.\nA historic rally in perpetual bonds is raising concerns of the kind of investor trap that led to the boom-and-bust in bank capital during the global financial crisis.\nHolders of credit insurance on Altice France SA will receive an estimated payout of around $28.5 million, prompted by the telecommunications firm’s decision to undergo a French restructuring procedure.\nCountry Garden Holdings Co.’s net loss widened sharply in the first half of this year, the latest sign of China’s entrenched property woes.\nA unit of Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. is taking its legal challenge against defaulted Chinese builder Shimao Group Holdings Ltd. to Hong Kong as it seeks to recover about 1 billion yuan ($140 million) in unpaid debt.\nOn the Move\nZev Garell has left JPMorgan Chase & Co. after 23 years to join Barclays Plc in London as Head of Leveraged Finance EMEA.\nCitigroup Inc. is reshaping its UK, Europe, Middle East & Africa Debt Capital Markets team, and has hired former JPMorgan Chase & Co. banker Rob Cascarino as part of the changes.","content_hash":"1e13cec87e5e1a38ceaee57515e6d86d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6158,"method_rank":0}

As the current U.S. president ran for office, he made it very clear to U.S. voters and the world that they should expect higher tariffs. And that's exactly what his administration has offered up in dramatic fashion. Some on Wall Street worry that the tariffs could turn the bull market into a bear. Here's how a long-term investor should be thinking about this issue.\nThe tariffs are coming! The tariffs are coming!\nTo simplify what is a fairly complex issue, a tariff is a tax imposed on imported goods. The Trump administration has been using tariffs in an aggressive attempt to reshape global trade. This will have an impact on the economy and the stock market, but what that might be is hard to define today. Simply put, so many things are up in the air right now that nobody knows where the chips are going to fall.\nThat said, one concern is that higher tariffs will eventually be passed through to consumers. That would increase inflation, crimp consumption, and lead to lower earnings for corporate America. The flip side of that argument is that companies have increased prices so much in recent years that they can't easily push higher costs onto consumers, and, thus, companies are likely to absorb the tariff hit. That would mean lower profit margins. Even here, however, Wall Street could still end up in the dumps as companies earn less and investors react to that negative news.\nIt seems like nothing good can come of this whole tariff thing. Except that, so far, the market hasn't really paid much attention. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) is up more than 10% so far in 2025. Yes, there was a brief market correction early in the year, but the S&P 500 index, which is what the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF tracks, seems to have shrugged that off, as it is again trading near all-time highs.\nDon't get too caught up in the short term\nHere's the big takeaway from the tariff kerfuffle: It is shockingly hard to predict performance on Wall Street. Some people get market turns right once, but very few have been able to time the ups and downs with any consistency. For most investors, trying to jump in and out of the market -- a practice known as market timing -- is a mistake.\nIt is far better to buy and hold for the long term, perhaps including an exchange-traded fund (ETF) like Vanguard S&P 500 ETF in the mix. Indeed, focusing on a well-diversified portfolio is key, as it will help to soften the impact of the market's gyrations over time. Which brings the story back to the potential for a bear market. Simply put, there will be one.\nThat's not a prediction; it is just a statement of fact. Eventually, for some reason, investors will go from being bullish to being bearish. That's just what market history tells us is the norm on Wall Street. Why it happens will be the topic of debate, and eventually, some common cause will be determined. Maybe it will be tariffs. It could also be geopolitical tensions, which are very high today. Or maybe artificial intelligence (AI) won't turn out to be as profitable as investors expect, and that will lead the market lower, given that AI enthusiasm has helped lead the market higher.\nSomething will eventually give way, and there will be a bear market. Then, after some period of time, a bull market will arrive. It's just how the market works. You should spend more of your time thinking about ways to save money and how to invest wisely. Investing wisely means taking into consideration the ever-present risk of a bear market.\nKeep it simple and think long term\nFar too often, investors get caught up in short-term market movements. The big picture is more important, including the sometimes erratic upward march of stocks over the long term. Sticking to an investment plan is hard, but it is likely to result in better long-term performance than trying to jump in and out of the market. Which is why a simple portfolio consisting of an S&P 500 index fund and a broadly diversified bond fund or ETF -- say, in a 60% stock\/40% bond breakdown -- could be all you need.\nBonds help provide safety during market turmoil, and stocks provide growth over the long term. That combination will allow you to ride out bear markets without letting your emotions lead you into making investment mistakes (like selling everything you own and never investing again). Another option is just to buy a balanced mutual fund that does all the investing work for you. That leaves you to focus on saving money, which is where you will likely have the biggest impact on your long-term wealth, anyway.\nIf you do choose to buy individual stocks, which can be a lot of fun, don't focus on the short term. Or to put it another way, think in decades, not days. When you do that, a bear market will probably end up looking like just a small hiccup. And it won't really matter to you what precipitated the bear, anyway, because you will be too busy. You see, long-term investors often find their best investments during deep market declines.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn’t one of them.

Known as one of the league's most outspoken and passionate owners, Cuban's exit caught even commissioner Adam Silver off guard, according to CBS Sports.\nSilver later revealed that Cuban had first notified him in October 2022, about a year before the deal was finalized.\nSince the sale in November 2023, the Mavericks have seen both dramatic highs and crushing lows — from an appearance in the 2024 NBA Finals to the stunning February trade that sent Luka Doncic away, a move Cuban insists would never have happened under his leadership.\nSilver has publicly stated that Cuban's future role in basketball operations was always tied to his private arrangement with Patrick Dumont, who now oversees team decisions. According to Silver, the agreement brought before the board of governors made it clear that Dumont, not Cuban, would be in charge.\nCuban, however, maintains he has documentation proving he was supposed to retain control of basketball operations and claims the NBA forced the removal of that specific clause.\nTrending Now:\n‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones.

Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.\nWiserAdvisor makes it easier to find a financial advisor who fits your needs.

His administration has moved to deport foreign students involved in pro-Palestinian activism, and new student visa appointments were put on hold for weeks as it ramped up vetting of applicants' social media.\nOn Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security said it will propose a rule that would put new limits on the time foreign students can stay in the U.S.\nThe policies have introduced severe financial instability for colleges, said Justin Gest, a professor at George Mason University who studies the politics of immigration.\nForeign students are not eligible for federal financial aid and often pay full price for tuition — double or even triple the in-state rate paid by domestic students at public universities.\n“To put it more dollars and cents-wise, if an international student comes in and pays $80,000 a year in tuition, that gives universities the flexibility to offer lower fees and more scholarship money to American students,” Gest said.\nA Sudanese student barely made it to the US for the start of classes\nAhmed Ahmed, a Sudanese student, nearly didn't make it to the U.S. for his freshman year at the University of Rochester.\nThe Trump administration in June announced a travel ban on 12 countries, including Sudan. Diplomatic officials assured Ahmed he could still enter the U.S. because his visa was issued before the ban. But when he tried to board a flight to leave for the U.S. from Uganda, where he stayed with family during the summer, he was turned away and advised to contact an embassy about his visa.\nWith the help of the University of Rochester’s international office, Ahmed was able to book another flight.\nAt Rochester, where he received a scholarship to study electrical engineering, Ahmed, 19, said he feels supported by the staff. But he also finds himself on edge and understands why other students might not want to subject themselves to the scrutiny in the U.S., particularly those who are entirely paying their own way.\n“I feel like I made it through, but I’m one of the last people to make it through,” he said.\nColleges are taking steps to blunt the impact\nIn recent years, international students have made up about 30% of enrollment at Central Missouri, which has a total of around 12,800 students. In anticipation of the hit to international enrollment, Central Missouri cut a cost-of-living raise for employees. It has pushed off infrastructure improvements planned for its campus and has been looking for other ways to cut costs.\nSmall schools — typically classified as those with no more than 5,000 students — tend to have less financial flexibility and will be especially vulnerable, said Dick Startz, an economics professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\nLee University, a Christian institution with 3,500 students in Tennessee, is expecting 50 to 60 international students enrolled this fall, down from 82 the previous school year, representing a significant drop in revenue for the school, said Roy Y. Chan, the university’s director of graduate studies.\nThe school already has increased tuition by 20% over the past five years to account for a decrease in overall enrollment, he said.\n“Since we’re a smaller liberal arts campus, tuition cost is our main, primary revenue,” Chan said, as opposed to government funding or donations.\nThe strains on international enrollment only add to distress for schools already on the financial brink.\nColleges around the country have been closing as they cope with declines in domestic enrollment, a consequence of changing demographics and the effects of the pandemic. Nationwide, private colleges have been closing at a rate of about two per month, according to the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association.\nThe number of high school graduates in the U.S. is expected to decline through 2041, when there will be 13% fewer compared to 2024, according to projections from the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education.\n“That means that if you lost participation from international students, it’s even worse,” Startz said.\n___\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Traditional cigarette sales, however, continue to face pressure as regulations tighten, with the World Health Organization reporting that 6.1 billion people worldwide are now covered by tobacco control measures.\nAt the same time, dividend-focused investors remain drawn to established tobacco companies for their steady cash flows and reliable shareholder returns. On Aug 21, Altria Group (MO) announced a 3.9% increase to its quarterly dividend, raising it to $1.06 per share from $1.02, marking the company’s 60th dividend increase in 56 years. The new annualized dividend of $4.24 per share translates into a yield of 6.3%.\nThis move ties directly to Altria’s dividend strategy, which aims for mid-single-digit annual growth through 2028, a plan that has consistently delivered even as the industry shifts toward reduced-risk products. With regulatory pressures building and the long-term picture for tobacco still uncertain, does Altria's enhanced dividend payout and Dividend King status make it a compelling buy at current levels? Let’s take a closer look.\nHow Altria's Metrics Stack Up Post-Raise\nAltria, the parent company behind Marlboro and other smokeable and oral tobacco products, runs a business that is built on steady cash flow from its strong U.S. tobacco franchises while slowly moving into reduced-risk alternatives. That balance has supported solid stock gains in 2025, with shares climbing nearly 30% year-to-date (YTD).\nOn the valuation side, MO stock still looks fairly inexpensive. It trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of about 12.5x compared with the sector average near 17x, signaling modest growth without pricing in much of a premium.\nFinancial results from 2025 tell the full story. In the second quarter, net revenues came in at $6.1 billion, down 1.7% from the prior year, mainly due to declines in smokeable products. Still, revenues net of excise taxes edged higher by 0.2% to $5.3 billion. Reported EPS fell 36.2% to $1.41, largely due to a one-time boost in 2024 from the IQOS rights sale.\nStripping that out, adjusted EPS rose 8.3% to $1.44, driven by higher operating income and fewer shares outstanding. For the first half of the year, revenues declined 3.6% to $11.4 billion, but adjusted EPS improved 7.2% to $2.67, helped by efficiency gains, a lower adjusted tax rate, and fewer shares. Reported EPS for the half slipped 40.2% to $2.04, reflecting impairments and acquisition-related costs, though these did not impact the adjusted bottom line.\nAltria's Core Strengths and Growth Catalysts\nOne of Altria’s most important growth drivers is its push beyond cigarettes, and the on! nicotine pouch brand continues to gain traction. In Q2 2025, shipments increased 26.5% to 52.1 million cans, while its share of the oral tobacco category rose to 8.7%, up 0.7 percentage points from a year earlier. Inside the pouch segment specifically, on! now holds a 17.9% share, giving Altria a stronger position in one of the few parts of the industry still growing.\nAt the same time, Altria is working on an even bigger step forward with heated tobacco. Through Horizon Innovations, its joint venture with Japan Tobacco International, the company is preparing to seek FDA approval for its Ploom heated tobacco devices in 2025. The partnership combines JTI’s device expertise with Altria’s regulatory know-how and its broad U.S. distribution system. If approved, Ploom could open up a new revenue stream by appealing to traditional smokers who have avoided e‑vapor products.\nThese efforts matter because they strengthen Altria’s core identity as a steady dividend payer. The company has now lifted its payout for 57 years in a row, with the latest increase bringing the quarterly dividend to $1.06 per share. The yield stands at about 6.03%, supported by a forward payout ratio just above 76%, showing the dividend remains well-covered by cash flow.\nAnalyst Views and What Lies Ahead for MO\nLooking ahead, management has narrowed its 2025 full-year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.35 to $5.45. That represents 3% to 5% growth compared to the 2024 base of $5.19. Analyst estimates are in line with that target, with expectations for Q3 2025 at $1.42 versus $1.38 in the same quarter a year earlier, showing modest but steady progress year over year.\nWall Street’s view on the stock is less straightforward. BofA Securities kept its “Buy” rating on Aug. 22, 2025, and raised its price target from $64 to $72, pointing to confidence in Altria’s smoke-free strategy and dependable cash flows. The broader analyst group, however, is more cautious. Out of 15 surveyed, the consensus remains a solid “Hold,” reflecting worries about whether declining cigarette sales will limit future revenue growth.\nThis divide is clear when looking at price targets. The consensus mean target for the stock is $60, which is about 11% below Altria’s current price.\nConclusion\nSo, should you buy Altria after its latest dividend hike? If you’re an income-focused investor, the case is clear: a 6%+ yield, 57 straight years of dividend increases, and resilient cash flows make MO one of the most reliable income plays around. But for growth‑hungry investors, the story is trickier. Regulatory headwinds and flat top-line growth limit the stock’s upside, and with the consensus price target sitting below current levels, analysts don’t see much room for appreciation. Most likely, shares will tread water near current highs, rewarding investors through dividends rather than dramatic price gains.\nOn the date of publication, Ebube Jones did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Just think of Liz Truss’s mini-Budget crisis and the sackings, about-turns and resignations that followed a surge in borrowing costs.\nYet one world leader so far seems immune to the bond market’s menace: Donald Trump.\nUS 10-year Treasury yields have risen from 3.8pc to 4.2pc over the past 12 months, yet the president so far shows no sign of curbing his ambitions.\nIt is part of a broader assault on the central bank’s independence as Trump seeks to bend the Fed to his will.\nThe issue is “definitely gaining investor traction”, according to James Bilson, a fixed-income strategist at FTSE 100 fund manager Schroders.\n“We are seeing markets begin to price in moves in the direction of institutional weakening – the politicisation of the Fed.”\nBond yields fell at the end of last week after Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, hinted rate cuts were on the way.\nBut yields have gyrated this week as Trump has escalated his feud with Cook, who has refused to go and has launched a legal challenge to the president’s dismissal letter.\nInvestors fear that political capture of the Fed, once Powell’s term of office expires next May, will allow Trump to push down interest rates at the expense of tackling inflationary forces.\nUltimately, that will force higher interest rates further down the line to address the problem.\n“If Trump succeeds, we will get higher expected inflation, which may sound abstract, but it translates into higher interest rates on car loans, mortgages, student loans, business loans, and certainly Uncle Sam will pay more,” former IMF chief economist Ken Rogoff told the BBC this week.\nHe warned the world faced an “incredibly destabilising” period if Trump succeeded in watering down Fed independence.\nDavid Roberts, head of fixed income at Nedgroup Investments, says investors are “extremely worried [about the] politicisation of the Fed”.\n“Too cheap money will stoke future inflation,” he adds.\nIn her lawsuit challenging Trump, Cook’s lawyers argued that the president’s power grab at the Fed could do “irreparable harm” to the central bank in the pursuit of “short-term political interests”.\nThe gap between two-year and 30-year US bond yields – the difference in borrowing costs for shorter and longer-term debt – has now reached its widest since January 2022.\nThe rate on 30-year bonds is closing in on 5pc, even as the two-year slides to 3.6pc, close to its lowest level since 2022.\nIt is a sign of just how concerned investors are about the longer-term inflation threat and the eroding of the Fed’s independence.\nRising long-term borrowing costs carry a political risk for Trump. American mortgage rates are usually tied to longer-dated bonds as householders tend to borrow over longer terms than in the UK or elsewhere.\nHigher 10-year and 30-year Treasury yields – the return the government promises to pay a buyer of its debt – would therefore hit “Main Street” America rather quickly, harming many Maga voters in the process.\n“We think the bond market holds the real leverage,” says Lale Akoner, global market analyst at eToro.\n“If investors lose confidence that the Fed will defend price stability, or if fiscal deficits balloon despite tariffs, the bond market can punish Washington with higher yields.”\nFor now, US 10-year and 30-year Treasury yields both remain well below the highs hit in April, in the wake of Trump’s liberation day tariffs.\nWhile longer-dated bond yields are moving higher, they are doing so in an “orderly” way, according to Bilson.\nRobert Dishner, a portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman, says traders have been comforted by a recent report by the Congressional Budget Office that said the president’s tariffs had already brought in $136bn and would reduce the US primary deficit, excluding interest payment, by $3.3 trillion over the next decade.\n“The market currently appears to be a bit less fearful of the fiscal [situation] in the US as tariffs have added to government revenues and haven’t necessarily seen big impacts on growth or inflation,” he says.\n“They are more focused on places like the UK with the autumn Budget coming up as well as the potential for electoral change in France.”\nJason Borbora-Sheen, a portfolio manager at FTSE 250-listed fund manager Ninety One, says: “There’s decent revenue generation coming through from tariffs, there appears to be an acknowledgement of the importance of medium-to-longer dated bond yields.\n“I think the Federal Reserve attacks are not good, but there are elements of truth.”\nAnother reason that bond markets may be relatively calm for now may also be because Trump has shown he is vulnerable to their pressure in the past. When markets went into meltdown in the wake of “liberation day”, the president announced a 90-day pause.\n“During that tariff episode he did pivot back from the most severe version of tariffs when that 10-year yield moved,” Borbora-Sheen says.\n“The market has figured out that it matters to him.”\nWhile there is relative calm for now, sentiment can turn on a sixpence and attention will now be focused on Cook’s legal case.\n“If Cook wins, she stays in place and we achieve some semblance of stability,” Peter Conti-Brown, a professor of financial regulation at the University of Pennsylvania said in a Substack post.\n“If she loses ... that’s the end of Fed independence as it has been constructed and reconstructed over 112 years.”\nIn that case, all hell may break lose – and Trump’s resolve to face down the bond market may be truly put to the test.","content_hash":"1db72655dd65235a04a260ff436b0255","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5859,"method_rank":0}

That's not unreasonable to believe, but in true lemming fashion, investors are flocking into stocks that they believe will be AI winners. But it is still early days for the technology, so it is hard to predict which companies are best positioned to benefit.\nExcept, there is one group of companies that will definitely see demand increase. And one company in that group is better positioned than any other to take advantage: Dominion Energy(NYSE: D). Here's what you need to know.\nThe problem with artificial intelligence\nAside from AI's ability to replace human employees, the big problem with AI right now is that the technology is still evolving. It is developing quickly, for sure, but there's no way to really know how best to use it. Or which companies will have the best AI technology to offer the world.\nIf you want to understand the risk, look no further than Yahoo! It was the leading internet search company until Alphabet's Google search service came around. Nvidia is an AI icon today, but it may not always be the industry's big winner. In other words, the early winners in AI could still end up being long-term losers. And bad investments, if you buy them.\nBut there's something that is very clear about this new technology. It runs on computers, often housed in massive data centers, and computers need electricity to operate. AI, along with other electricity-dependent technology, is expected to lead to a step change in electricity demand.\nTo put some numbers on that, U.S. electricity demand from AI alone is projected to increase 300% over roughly a decade. And the overall growth in electricity demand is expected to increase from 9% between 2000 and 2020 to 55% between 2020 and 2040. That's not a step change in demand in the utility sector, it is a leap change!\nDominion Energy is better positioned than any other utility\nAs the AI tsunami washes over the world, there's one region that is going to benefit disproportionately. That region is Virginia. You might not have guessed that, but Virginia is one of the largest data center markets in the world. AI \"lives\" in data centers. Dominion Energy operates a regulated electric utility in Virginia, giving it a monopoly on serving the power needs of these data centers.\nHow big an opportunity is this for Dominion Energy? Well, in the second half of 2024 demand from data centers grew 88%. There's a problem with that number, though. Dominion can't just send out 88% more power, especially given that most of the data centers are going to be new buildings. It has to build generating capacity and construct the power lines needed to get that power from where it is generated to where it is going to be consumed.\nThat process takes time. And it requires Dominion to work with its regulators on the rates it charges and more importantly, on its capital investment plans. Slow and steady growth is the likely outcome, but AI demand suggests that growth is going to be less slow in the future than it has been in the past. Dominion isn't going to turn from an income stock into a growth stock, but it could become an attractive growth and income stock.\nThe most exciting part of Dominion's story, however, is that it is out of favor on Wall Street right now. The average utility has a dividend yield of around 2.7%. Dominion Energy's yield is 4.4%. Okay, a dividend cut and zero near-term dividend growth is part of the story, here, too. But management has slimmed down the business to where it is basically just a plain vanilla, regulated electric utility. There's a reason why the stock is unloved, but there's also a reason to expect the future to be better than the past since there's now a strong business foundation in place.\nDominion's super charged opportunity\nEssentially, Dominion Energy is a low-risk turnaround story in the utility sector. But its turnaround story has a hidden booster rocket in the form of AI, given the company's well-located Virginia operations. If you prefer to think long term while other investors are focused on the short-term profits they expect from AI stocks, you might be better off buying Dominion.\nYes, Nvidia's shares are up 50% in just six months, compared to Dominion's 6%. But how long can Nvidia keep up its stellar performance and at what point is too much good news priced into the stock? The hype is real and it could be distorting the way Wall Street sees AI companies like Nvidia.\nDominion, in comparison, is an anti-hype stock. But if you buy Dominion, you can collect a fat dividend while the business benefits from the AI revolution, helping the utility get its business back on a steady growth path.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Dominion Energy right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Dominion Energy, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Dominion Energy wasn’t one of them.

While there’s another top 25 team in action tonight -- number 12 Illinois -- the majority of top 25 teams play on Saturday. The following Thursday, NFL football begins with the Cowboys playing the Eagles in Philadelphia. Can’t wait.\nEnough about football; I'm here to discuss unusual options activity. In Thursday's trading, there were 796 calls and 533 puts, resulting in a put\/call ratio of 0.67, a slightly bullish indicator. Among the 533 puts were two Wendy’s (WEN)puts expiring in 50 days on Oct. 17.\nAs you can see above, both of the puts are OTM (out-of-the-money), with the $9 strike possessing the highest Vol\/OI (volume-to-open-interest) of any unusually active option yesterday at 150.09, almost double the put in second place.\nNot a lot has gone right for the fast food chain in recent years. Its stock is down 36% year-to-date and 52% over the past five years. Its shares are well down from the 20-year high of $29.31 set on June 1, 2021.\nWendy’s wouldn’t be the first stock I would think to invest in at the moment. That said, the two unusually active puts suggest someone could be looking to protect their downside.\nWith that in mind, here are three potential trading strategies to implement based on Wendy’s two puts.\nHave an excellent weekend.\nThe Straight Up Play\nStarting with the most obvious, you have three possibilities: buying a long put for downside protection, profiting from further correction in the share price, or selling a short put for premium income.\nIn terms of downside protection, the $10 strike is the better play with a profit probability of 25.80%. The share price must fall below $9.60 (8.57%) to make a profit from the trade. The $9 strike has to fall 15.71% over the next 50 days. The likelihood of that happening is 13.01%, so it's not likely.\nWhether you own the stock and are looking to protect on the downside or to profit from a further correction, the $10 strike is the way to go.\nNow, if you believe that the stock has fallen as far as it can go and want to generate some income by selling the put, it’s tempting to sell the $10 strike. However, the $9 strike is the better bet to avoid having to buy 100 shares at $10 at expiration, above where they might be trading.\nWhile your annualized return is considerably less than 22.6% at 8.2%, that’s still a reasonable return to augment your portfolio.\nThe Bullish Play\nIn this scenario, you expect Wendy’s share price to appreciate over the next 50 days. Utilizing a bull put spread, you sell a short put option and buy a long put option at a lower strike price, with both expiring on the same day. In this example, you sell the $10 put and buy the $9 put.\nYour maximum profit is the net credit, which is the difference between the premium income of $30 from selling the $10 short put and the cost of buying the $9 long put for $15. In this instance, it’s $15.\nOn the other hand, the maximum loss is the difference between the two strike prices, less the net credit. This occurs if Wendy’s share price is below $9 on Oct. 17. The maximum loss in this instance is $85 [$10 put strike - $9 put strike - $15 net credit].\nSo, if the share price is $9.85 at expiration, you break even. If the share price is $9.95 at expiration, for example, you make $10 [$15 net credit - ($10 strike price - $9.95 share price)]. If the share price at expiration is above $10, you make the maximum profit of $15.\nThe likelihood of this happening is 69.4%, with a risk-to-reward ratio of 5.67 to 1. I probably wouldn’t make this bet given the high risk\/reward ratio.\nThe Bearish Play\nIn this scenario, you expect Wendy’s share price to fall over the next 50 days. Utilizing a bear put spread, you buy a long put option and sell a short put option at a lower strike price, with both expiring on the same day. In this example, you buy the $10 put and sell the $9 put.\nYour maximum profit is the difference in strike values minus the net debit. The net debit is the $40 cost of buying the $10 long put, less the $10 premium received for selling the $9 short put. In this instance, it’s $30. The maximum profit is $70 [$10 strike price - $9 strike price - $30 net debit]. The maximum profit is achieved if Wendy’s share price is below $9 strike price at expiration.\nThe maximum loss is the net debit of $30. This occurs if Wendy’s share price is above $10 on Oct. 17.\nSo, if the share price is $9.70 at expiration, you break even. If the share price is $9.40 at expiration, for example, you make $30 [($10 strike price - $9.40 share price) - $30 net credit]. If the share price at expiration is below $9, you make the maximum profit of $70.\nThe likelihood of this happening is 26.4%. However, with a risk-to-reward ratio of just 0.43 to 1, the bear put spread is a better bet than the bull put spread.\nThe Bottom Line on Wendy’s Unusually Active Options\nWhen you consider that the strategy of selling the $10 short put generated $30 premium income, three times the $9 put, it’s tempting to choose the higher-priced option. As I said in the section about straight-up plays, I wouldn’t do it.\nI especially wouldn’t do it when you can generate $70 of premium income, 2.3 times more than selling the put, by utilizing the bear put spread, whose risk\/reward ratio is more than reasonable. It's the best strategy for Wendy's stock.\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Sure enough, where there used to be a \"Blank Space\" on Swift's ring finger, she was now \"Bejeweled\" with a large engagement ring (and we hope she doesn't accidentally \"Shake It Off\").\nSwift surely knew \"All Too Well\" that the announcement would make \"Sparks Fly\" among her legion of fans (to them I say, \"You Need to Calm Down\"), but even in her \"Wildest Dreams,\" she probably never expected the news to affect the stock market.\nBut it did. Here's how.\nLook what you made me do...to the market\nIn the immediate wake of the announcement, as fans were still trying to identify the exact cut of the diamond in Swift's ring (it was a \"cushion cut,\" for those who are interested), there was a brief, otherwise-unexplained 1% pop in the stock price of Signet Jewelers Limited(NYSE: SIG), one of the few publicly traded jewelry companies.\nAs the afternoon wore on, Signet's shares climbed higher in a rally continued through Wednesday and into Thursday's premarket trading, when Signet's stock briefly hit $95\/share, up nearly 10% over the pre-\"pop star pop\" price. The Swift Effect was even more pronounced for Brilliant Earth Group (NASDAQ: BRLT), which soared from $2.17\/share at 12:50 PM on Tuesday to close at $2.82\/share, a 30% gain.\nEven luxury brands only partially exposed to the jewelry market rose in the wake of the announcement: Movado Group (NYSE: MOV), which is primarily a watchmaker but does sell other jewelry items, and LVMH (OTC: LVMHF), which owns Tiffany & Co., were both up more than 4% over their pre-engagement price at Thursday's close.\nToday was a fairytale\nIt's not the first time that Taylor Swift's legions of fans -- known as \"Swifties\" -- have collectively influenced the financial world. In July 2023, the Federal Reserve's Beige Book credited Swift's \"Eras\" tour as being responsible for the strongest month of hotel revenue in Philadelphia since the pandemic. This mirrored reports from Cincinnati and Chicago, among many other cities, that credited the \"Eras\" tour for record hotel revenues.\nSo how did this happen? There was likely a noticeable spike in internet searches for various types of wedding rings in the wake of Swift's announcement as eager fans tried to identify the exact ring in question (and possibly score one for themselves). That activity may have triggered certain traders' algorithms to buy jewelry stocks...or perhaps there are just plenty of Swifties among the ranks of hedge fund managers.\nThe money question is, could this one-time pop in interest translate into a meaningful increase in jewelry sales, or lasting gains for these jewelry stocks?\nIs it over now?\nUnfortunately, it looks like the rally may already be fizzling. Although Signet Jewelers closed on Thursday at $89.86\/share, which is 3.6% above its pre-engagement price, it had fallen significantly from its post-engagement high of $95. Brilliant Earth Group also closed lower on Thursday at $2.69\/share, though that was also well above its pre-engagement price.\nGetting engaged is a much bigger commitment than buying an album or attending a concert (although the cost of some resold \"Eras\" tour tickets could have funded an entire wedding and then some). Sure, it might be fun to dream about getting a ring like Taylor Swift, or to shop for one online, but even if you idolize Swift, will her engagement really prompt legions of uncommitted Swifties to propose? (Don't get me wrong: I know the intensity of Swift's fandom is strong...but that strong?)\nMeanwhile, all of the aforementioned jewelry and jewelry-adjacent companies have significantly lagged the S&P 500 over the past five years: some by a little (Signet is trailing on a total return basis by about 35 percentage points) to a lot (Brilliant Earth is \"Down Bad,\" by a jaw-dropping 130 percentage points).\nI'd classify those returns as not just in the \"Red,\" but redder than \"Bad Blood,\" and it'll take more than a one-time surge of interest from Swifties to make me say anything besides \"I Knew You Were Trouble\" and \"We Are Never Ever Getting Together.\"\nThat said, whichever jeweler can be the first to mass-produce a Taylor Swift-inspired cushion-cut engagement ring will almost certainly have a hit on their hands.\nShould you buy stock in Signet Jewelers right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Signet Jewelers, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Signet Jewelers wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $651,599!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,067,639!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,049% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 185% for the S&P 500.

It marks Futu's eighth permanent service point in the city and the first to combine online trading services with offline, personalised advisory service for affluent clients.\n\"Hong Kong will remain a core market for us, and we see strong demand from clients for more personalised support alongside our online services,\" said Daniel Tse, managing director of Futu Securities, during a media preview on Wednesday. \"This flagship store allows us to bring that experience offline and create a dedicated space for wealth management.\"\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nTo qualify to use the advisory centre's service, clients need to hold at least HK$5 million (US$640,000) in investable assets, according to Futu's website. That is less than the US$3 million typically required by traditional private banks, according to the company.\nFutu Securities' managing director Daniel Tse (left), Futu Institutional and Private Wealth Services' executive director Kevin Fu (right) meets with the media at the Causeway Bay flagship store on August 27, 2025.

Shops along the 250-metre thoroughfare had to pay US$2,671 per square foot on average in annual rent as recently as 2018. That made it the world's costliest retail strip at that time, surpassing the Champs-Elysees boulevard in Paris, Omotesando in Tokyo and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, according to Cushman & Wakefield.\nFutu could be paying HK$1.2 million per month for its bricks-and-mortar branch, according to agents' estimates. Futu declined to comment.\nFutu Securities' Managing Director Daniel Tse (left) and Futu Institutional and Private Wealth Services' Executive Director Kevin Fu (right) on August 27, 2025.

Photo: Nora Tam>\nThe online broker's lavish physical branch serves what Futu called the need of so-called \"new wealth\" clients who seek professional, face-to-face advice on complex asset allocation needs.\nExecutives noted that high-net-worth investors are showing greater interest in fixed-income products such as bonds and structured funds, particularly against the backdrop of elevated US dollar interest rates. At the same time, equities in Hong Kong and the US remain their most actively traded products, while some are also looking at alternatives including hedge funds, quantitative strategies and gold-linked products.\nLeveraging its technology platform, Futu said it aimed to provide a differentiated service that integrates digital trading, AI-powered research and global asset allocation. Its private wealth clients can access products ranging from high-end mutual funds, private equity and structured products to virtual assets and family trusts.\nThe company has also adopted a \"1+N\" service model, with a dedicated client manager backed by a team of specialists in various fields.\nFutu's flagship store is located on Russell Street in a space formerly occupied by the Transformers Ark restaurant. Photo: SCMP alt=Futu's flagship store is located on Russell Street in a space formerly occupied by the Transformers Ark restaurant. Photo: SCMP>\nThe strategy has paid off. In the first quarter of 2025, net asset inflows surged 170 per cent from last year, while assets under management jumped 74 per cent and client numbers nearly doubled in the second quarter, Futu said.\n\"High-net-worth clients increasingly want both flexibility and depth in services,\" said Kevin Fu, executive director of Futu Institutional and Private Wealth Services. \"By combining dedicated managers with a team of specialists, we can better address those needs and strengthen long-term relationships.\"\nHong Kong's stock market has rebounded, as the Hang Seng Index jumped 25 per cent this year, the best among major global benchmarks. Brokers expect the rally to extend into next year as China's economic outlook stabilises, while more than 200 companies line up for initial public offerings in the city.\nFutu's Russell Street store will not replace its branch on Lee Garden Road, spitting distance away in Causeway Bay, which will continue to serve retail clients. Tse said the company could add more outlets in Hong Kong or other markets if demand warranted, but stressed that new locations would be guided by client needs rather than sheer scale.","content_hash":"bcf48e4f6dab3077d16f780634c3c017","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5486,"method_rank":0}

The costs will eventually reach most American families through price hikes and less competition in many product categories.\nUS businesses are reluctant to criticize Trump’s tariffs, lest Trump retaliate against them. But they’re legally obligated to tell shareholders about anything that affects their financial performance. And there was lots of tariff talk during the second quarter earnings season, which is just wrapping up.\nA Yahoo Finance analysis of earnings calls found that tariffs and other aspects of Trump’s trade war are harming profits and forcing price hikes in at least seven of the 11 sectors that comprise the S&P 500 stock index. Four sectors are relatively unscathed: Communication Services (XLC), Financials (XLF), Real Estate (XLRE), Utilities (XLU). Those sectors include 161 of the S&P 500 companies, and they generally involve services not subject to tariffs or are domestic in nature.\nThe other seven sectors are bearing most of the cost of new import taxes, which have jumped from $7 billion before Trump took office to around $30 billion now, and could go as high as $50 billion per month. Yahoo Finance’s Grace O’Donnell tracked specific mentions of tariffs in earnings calls for dozens of prominent companies during the second quarter. Here are some examples of steep tariff impacts among the seven sectors, which include 68% of the companies in the S&P 500:\nConsumer Discretionary (XLY): General Motors (GM) cited a $1.1 billion tariff hit to profits in the second quarter. Ford (F) said tariffs will shave $2 billion in profits for the year. Deckers Outdoor (DECK) plans to raise prices because of tariffs. Home Depot (HD) plans to raise prices and offer fewer promotions. Discount retailer TJX (TJX)also plans price hikes.\nConsumer Staples (XLP): Walmart (WMT) said, “We’ve continued to see our costs increase each week, which we expect will continue.” Keurig Dr. Pepper (KDP) said that \"commodity inflation will build” and “tariff impacts will become prominent.” Kraft Heinz (KHC) said tariffs could reduce profit margins this year by 1 to 1.8 percentage points.\nEnergy (XLE): SolarEdge (SEDG) said the Trump tariffs could cut profit margins by 2 percentage points. Sunrun (RUN) pegged its tariff-related losses at around $1,000 per customer. Baker Hughes (BKR) said tariffs could cost it up to $200 million this year.\nHealth Care (XLV): GE Healthcare (GEHC) said profit margins dropped by 1.8 percentage points due to tariffs. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) blamed tariffs for a $200 million hit to profits in the quarter. Medtronic (MDT), the huge medical device maker, said its tariff hit was $185 million.\nIndustrials (XLI): Caterpillar (CAT) expects tariffs to drain up to $1.5 billion from annual profits. Deere (DE) said its tariff hit will be around $600 million. Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) said it has already raised prices to offset higher tariff costs and may do so again.\nTechnology (XLK): Apple (AAPL) said it incurred $800 million in tariff-related costs in the second quarter. Nvidia (NVDA) said new export restrictions relating to China blocked $5.5 billion of sales in the second quarter. AMD (AMD) said the same export restrictions cost it $800 million during the quarter.\nMaterials (XLB): Dow (DOW) said tariff-related uncertainties cut into sales in some units. International Paper (IP) said tariff uncertainty contributed to soft sales and earnings that fell short of expectations. Alcoa (AA) said tariffs cost it $115 million in the quarter.\nSome companies are benefiting from the tariffs. Steelmaker Nucor (NUE)said less competition from imports allowed it to raise prices. Financial firms such as Citi have said greater volatility caused by Trump’s trade war is likely to be good for business, because it increases demand for their services and boosts fee income. But many economists argue that tariffs are still harmful, because the damage caused by higher costs and less competition far outweighs the benefits to a small number of protected firms and industries.\nSo if Trump’s tariffs are causing widespread damage, why do US stocks keep hitting new record highs? Three or four possible reasons.\nOne is that the artificial intelligence boom is so powerful that the upward march of Big Tech names such as Nvidia, Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) swamps the smaller effect of tariff backpedaling.\nAnother is that large-cap US stocks are not the same as the real economy. Investors bidding those shares up may think US companies can ultimately pass along most of the higher costs tariffs are causing, which could lower economic growth but keep corporate earnings intact. The biggest US firms earn about 40% of their revenue outside the United States, providing a considerable cushion against an American downturn.\nA third possibility is that the Trump tariffs really will weigh down stocks — and that it just hasn’t happened yet. It's also worth pointing out that while US stocks have risen by about 10% this year, global stocks excluding the United States have risen by 20%. American shares are underperforming, and Trump's trade war may be a big part of the reason.\nFuture earnings will provide many more clues.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

At least, that's the conclusion you'd probably reach if you compared their investment portfolios. The variety in the stocks preferred by highly wealthy investors is striking.\nHowever, that doesn't mean there aren't any common denominators in their portfolios. Several of the world's richest investors are fans of some of the same stocks. Here are three stocks billionaires are buying right now.\n1. Amazon\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) ranks as one of the most popular stocks with billionaires. Chase Coleman bought 4.1 million more shares of the e-commerce and cloud services giant in the second quarter of 2025, boosting his Tiger Global Management hedge fund's stake by 62%. David Tepper increased his Appaloosa hedge fund's position in Amazon by nearly 8%.\nThe biggest move with this stock in the billionaire community, though, came from Pershing Square's Bill Ackman. He initiated a new position in Amazon that was valued at roughly $1.28 billion at the end of Q2.\nImportantly, Amazon's shares were down significantly during part of the second quarter. It's a pretty safe bet that these wealthy investors wanted to take advantage of an opportunity to buy the stock of a great company at a discount.\nThat's definitely the case with Ackman. Pershing Square's chief investment officer, Ryan Israel, confirmed in a May conference call that Amazon had been on the hedge fund's radar for a long time but that the team was waiting for the price to become attractive enough to buy. Israel highlighted Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and noted that the Trump administration's tariffs shouldn't significantly impact Amazon's e-commerce business.\n2. Alphabet\nAckman also increased Pershing Square's stake in Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) in Q2. His hedge fund already owned both of Google's share classes. While Pershing Square didn't buy any additional class C shares, it scooped up another 925,000 class A shares -- enough to boost its holding by roughly 21%.\nColeman was less enthusiastic but still upped Tiger Global's position in Alphabet class A shares by more than 3% in Q2. Billionaire Israel \"Izzy\" Englander was more interested in Alphabet class C shares last quarter, increasing his Millennium Management hedge fund's stake by almost 32%.\nLike Amazon, Alphabet's stock fell sharply early in Q2. Ackman, Coleman, and Englander almost certainly liked the opportunity this sell-off presented to buy one of the top AI leaders. However, Tepper went in the opposite direction, slashing Appaloosa's stake in Google's parent company by around 25% in Q2.\n3. UnitedHealth Group\nAlthough Tepper seemed less bullish about Alphabet, the story was quite different with UnitedHealth Group(NYSE: UNH). He increased Appaloosa's position in the health insurance stock by a whopping 1,300% in Q2. UnitedHealth Group is now his second-largest holding.\nThe bigger news, though, was that Warren Buffett initiated a big stake in UnitedHealth Group last quarter for Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio. Buffett has been a net seller of stocks for 11 consecutive quarters. However, he saw enough to like about UnitedHealth to buy more than 5 million shares.\nIt's reasonable to conclude that Buffett and Tepper viewed UnitedHealth Group's steep plunge this year as overdone. The company has faced several challenges that weighed on its share price, including higher-than-expected Medicare Advantage plan costs and a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation.\nAre these stocks good picks for other investors?\nSeveral billionaires like Amazon, Alphabet, and UnitedHealth Group, but are these stocks good picks for investors who aren't quite so wealthy? Yes, yes, and yes.\nAmazon should have tremendous growth opportunities with AWS, especially, thanks to a strong AI tailwind. AI demand will also help Alphabet's Google Cloud unit. Both Amazon and Alphabet also have plenty of other growth drivers.\nUnitedHealth Group seems likely to return to growth next year as higher health insurance premiums take effect. Granted, it's too early to know how the DOJ investigation will unfold. However, the company has successfully navigated government probes in the past and could do so again.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Alibaba Cloud and Baidu led the market last year.\nOutside China, the Asia-Pacific region was Tencent Cloud's \"fastest-growing market\" where the company intends to increase its investments, according to Tong. He said the company was seeing \"very good progress\" in the European market.\nThe Chinese tech giant's cloud business was initially launched to serve internet services providers, including video gaming companies and video platform operators. Tong said Tencent Cloud has expanded its reach to cover more industries including finance, retail and Web3.\nEarlier this year, Tencent made sweeping changes to its AI product portfolio. It incorporated several apps - including QQ Browser, keyboard tool Sogou Pinyin and learning assistant Ima - into the CSIG from their previous home at the firm's Platform & Content Group.\nThe restructuring came about because \"we see pretty much all applications can be redone with AI, or enhanced by AI or create new versions with AI being an integral part of it\", Tong said.\n\"Because CSIG has now taken the responsibility of running some tool-based products, some of the products that moved to my group are geared towards productivity - tools that many consumers have been using for a while,\" he said. \"So we will continue to find user pain points and use AI to make many of these products easier to use.\"\nTencent Holdings' headquarters in Shenzhen.

Tong said Tencent \"works with global vendors as well as domestic vendors very closely\", and that the company has \"sufficient resources\" to meet the \"large appetite for computing power\".\nTencent's second-quarter earnings beat analysts' forecasts, as AI delivered a boost to its financial results. The company's revenue jumped 15 per cent year on year to 184.5 billion yuan, while net profit rose 16 per cent to 56 billion yuan.\nThe company was able to grow its sales and profitability because \"we invested in and also benefited from utilising AI\", the company said in its earnings release on Wednesday.\nRevenue from Tencent's fintech and business services operations, which include its cloud business, rose 10 per cent year on year, according to the company.\nTencent's Hong Kong-listed shares closed 0.83 per cent lower to HK$594 on Thursday.

Shares of the chip designer shot up 89% during this period, and that solid rally seems justified in light of the company's improving growth profile owing to its dominant position in the market for custom AI chips.\nThe company is set to release its fiscal 2025 third-quarter results on Sept. 4, and it won't be surprising to see the stock get a nice shot in the arm once it releases its report. Let's look at the reasons why it may be a good idea to buy Broadcom stock before its upcoming results.\nBroadcom can beat Wall Street's expectations once again\nBroadcom's earnings per share exceeded consensus estimates in each of the past four quarters. Investors can expect the company to deliver a market-beating performance once again, thanks to a couple of reasons.\nFirst, tech giants are expected to spend more money on AI infrastructure than previously estimated. As pointed out by Yahoo! Finance, AI spending by big tech companies -- Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms -- is expected to hit $364 billion in 2025, up by $39 billion from the original estimate.\nThe new estimate points toward an increase of 63% in AI spending this year by the big tech giants, up from the 59% increase witnessed last year. This stronger spending bodes well for Broadcom, especially considering that big tech companies are focusing on developing more in-house chips for their data centers.\nThis brings us to the second reason why Broadcom could deliver another quarter of better-than-expected results. Big tech companies are increasingly investing in custom AI processors for their data centers to reduce operational costs. This was the reason why investment bank UBS recently suggested that Broadcom is on track to exceed expectations when it releases its results and also raised its price target to $345 from $290.\nAccording to UBS, Broadcom could get a boost from the stronger-than-expected production ramp of Google's custom AI processors. The investment bank is expecting the demand for Google's latest TPU (tensor processing unit) to jump by over 50% in 2025, and that could fuel a 60% increase in Broadcom's AI revenue this year.\nBroadcom is already designing custom AI processors for Google, Meta, and ByteDance. Even better, the company is engaged with another four hyperscale customers for designing their custom AI processors. Reports indicate that these four customers could be xAI, OpenAI, Arm Holdings, and Apple.\nSo, the chances of Broadcom delivering better-than-expected results once again are quite solid thanks to stronger demand from current customers, as well as the potential ramp from new customers.\nAnother big reason to buy the stock\nAnalysts expect Broadcom to end the current fiscal year with almost $63 billion in revenue, which would be a 22% increase from the year-ago period. The company is on track to record AI-specific revenue of $13.6 billion in the first three quarters of the fiscal year, which translates into an annual run rate of just over $18 billion.\nLooking ahead, Broadcom estimates its potential revenue opportunity from its first three custom AI chip customers to land between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027. That opportunity could be much bigger when we take into account the new customers that the company is expected to bring on board.\nAs such, Broadcom seems to be on track to continue outperforming the market's expectations over the next three years since its AI business alone could be enough for it to crush Wall Street's revenue estimates in fiscal 2027.\nImportantly, Broadcom's 70% share of the custom chip market means that it is in a terrific position to capitalize on the huge end-market opportunity. All this makes Broadcom a top AI stock to buy and hold for the long run and doing that before its upcoming earnings report could be a smart move, since it could soar higher after Sept. 4.\nShould you buy stock in Broadcom right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

I would then return to the store with my mother in late September to make the official decision with her. (She already had her flights booked for that weekend).\nMore from Personal Finance:\nCouples leverage ‘something borrowed’ to cut wedding costs\nSome couples are having 'micro weddings' as average cost is over $30,000\nHow to use credit cards to pay for your wedding\nI explained all of this to the sales associate, but when I told her my wedding date, she gave me a concerned look: \"That's very soon,\" she said.\nI had no idea that when you buy your dress in relation to your wedding date can affect its pricing. But it's a great example of the kind of research and decision-making that goes into planning a wedding, especially if you're looking to stick to a budget.\nHere's what I would have done differently when it came to my big purchase, and what experts recommend.\nThe earlier you start shopping, the better\nDuring the appointment, the sales associate explained that if I waited until September to purchase the gown during my mother's visit, I would incur so-called \"rush fees,\" an added cost to make sure the dress arrived on time.\nRush fees depend on what exactly you're rushing and how close you are to the wedding date, said Lauren Kay, executive editor at The Knot, a wedding site. In my case, rush fees would have been approximately $500, the sales associate said.\nThat would have represented 20% of my dress budget.\nBrides should typically start shopping for a wedding dress about 12 months out from their wedding, according to The Knot. At that point, come up with a budget and research styles you like.\nAbout eight to 10 months out, you should purchase the dress, which involves signing a contract and putting down a deposit, according to the bridal site.\n\"Purchasing your dress about nine months ahead of your wedding date gives you a nice cushion,\" said Kay.\nI had somewhat followed that timeline: After I got engaged in March, I began to browse social media and bridal boutique websites for dresses I liked. I narrowed down my budget and thought about how much I was comfortable spending.\nBut at that point, my fiance and I did not have a venue nor a wedding date, so I held off from making an official purchase.\nFast forward to August. We've selected the venue and have sent the save-the-dates. By the time I had my dress appointment, the wedding was about nine months away.\nThe silver lining was that I was still on time, even if just barely, and I could avoid the rush fees. I had to consider the cost as my budget for the dress was roughly $2,500.\nHad I better understood that timing, I'd have booked my mom to come in much earlier.\nAcross the country, the average cost for a wedding dress is about $2,000, according to The Knot's 2025 Real Weddings Study, which surveyed about 17,000 couples in the U.S. who got married the year before.\nTo avoid the added cost, I decided I would make the call on the dress at the end of the appointment. I explained the situation to my mom, and luckily, she understood. The sales associate and I video-called her on and off during the appointment as I tried on different dresses.\nThen came the veils.\nInstead of a 'dress budget,' consider an 'attire budget'\nIn most instances, experts say, brides are not required to pay the full price of a dress immediately.\nInstead, bridal stores require an upfront deposit to order the dress, which can range from 30% to 50% of the total cost, according to the Knot. The remaining balance is due at the time of pickup.\nIn my case, I was required to pay 65% of the total cost up front.\nIf you try on veils or other accessories during your appointment, and ultimately pick one, remember that the item's price will be included in the total balance, thus making your down payment higher.\nIn my case, I wish I had remembered this detail in the moment. Looking back, I would have asked about the veil's cost as I tried it on, rather than finding out at the point of the contract.\nNo matter when in the process you buy accessories like a veil or shoes, experts say it's important to factor them into your overall budget. While veils can cost about $100 to $600, the more intricate details they have, the more expensive they can be, according to The Knot.\nTherefore, instead of a \"dress budget,\" brides may want to consider an \"attire budget,\" said Kay. Beyond the dress, factor in a veil or other headpieces, jewelry and shoes, as well as related costs like alterations.\n\"That's something that can often be forgotten and that can add a significant cost to the dress,\" she said.\nWhile alteration costs can vary depending on what your dress needs, some places require a flat fee. With some preparation, you could research different alternatives to the bridal shop alterations.","content_hash":"64416ff85768bd42713ded8c36213fbf","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5023,"method_rank":0}

Sugar prices rose on Thursday after Pakistan said it is seeking 100,000 MT of refined white sugar. Pakistan's government said back in June that it would import as much as 750,000 MT of sugar this year to ensure domestic availability at affordable prices.\nSugar also has a positive carryover from Tuesday, when Conab, Brazil's government crop forecasting agency, cut its Brazil 2025\/26 production estimate by 3.1% to 44.5 MMT from a previous estimate of 45.9 MMT.\nSugar prices have been under pressure over the past two weeks, posting 2-week lows last Monday due to the outlook for lower sugar production in Brazil. Last Monday, Covrig Analytics reported that Brazil's sugar mills are prioritizing sugar production over ethanol, crushing more cane for sugar. This trend is expected to continue as harvesting peaks, driven by drier cane crops that prompt mills to produce more sugar.\nOn August 12, NY sugar rallied to a 2.5-month high on concerns over weaker cane yields in Brazil. On August 15, Unica reported that Brazil's Center-South sugar output in the second half of July fell by -0.8% y\/y to 3,614 MT, and the 2025-26 Center-South sugar output through July fell -7.8% y\/y to 19,268 MT. However, the percentage of sugarcane crushed for sugar by Brazil's sugar mills in the second half of July increased to 54.10% from 50.32% the same time last year. Also, Conab said last month that 2024\/25 Brazil sugar production fell by -3.4% y\/y to 44.118 MMT, citing lower sugarcane yields due to drought and excessive heat.\nThe outlook for higher sugar exports from India is negative for sugar prices after Bloomberg reported that India may permit local sugar mills to export sugar in the next season, which starts in October, as abundant monsoon rains may produce a bumper sugar crop. India's Meteorological Department reported last Friday that cumulative monsoon rain in India was 650.3 mm as of August 22, or 2% above normal. Also, the Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association recently said that it will seek permission to export 2 MMT of sugar in 2025\/26.\nThe outlook for higher sugar production in India, the world's second-largest producer, is bearish for prices. On June 2, India's National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories projected that India's 2025\/26 sugar production would climb +19% y\/y to 35 MMT, citing larger planted cane acreage. That would follow a -17.5% y\/y decline in India's sugar production in 2024\/25 to a 5-year low of 26.2 MMT, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).\nSugar prices retreated through early July, with NY sugar falling to a 4.25-year low and London sugar sliding to a 4-year low, driven by expectations of a sugar surplus in the 2025\/26 season. On June 30, commodities trader Czarnikow projected a 7.5 MMT global sugar surplus for the 2025\/26 season, the largest surplus in 8 years. On May 22, the USDA, in its biannual report, projected that global 2025\/26 sugar production would increase by +4.7% y\/y to a record 189.318 MMT, with global sugar ending stocks at 41.188 MMT, up 7.5% y\/y.\nThe outlook for higher sugar production in Thailand is bearish for sugar prices. On May 2, Thailand's Office of the Cane and Sugar Board reported that Thailand's 2024\/25 sugar production rose +14% y\/y to 10.00 MMT. Thailand is the world's third-largest sugar producer and the second-largest exporter of sugar.\nThe International Sugar Organization (ISO) raised its 2024\/25 global sugar deficit forecast to a 9-year high of -5.47 MMT on May 15, up from a February forecast of -4.88 MMT. This indicates a tightening market following the 2023\/24 global sugar surplus of 1.31 MMT. ISO also cut its 2024\/25 global sugar production forecast to 174.8 MMT from a February forecast of 175.5 MMT.\nThe USDA, in its bi-annual report released May 22, projected that global 2025\/26 sugar production would climb +4.7% y\/y to a record 189.318 MMT and that global 2025\/26 human sugar consumption would increase +1.4% y\/y to a record 177.921 MMT. The USDA also forecasted that 2025\/26 global sugar ending stocks would climb +7.5% y\/y to 41.188 MMT. The USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) predicted that Brazil's 2025\/26 sugar production would rise +2.3% y\/y to a record 44.7 MMT FAS predicted that India's 2025\/26 sugar production would rise +25% y\/y to 35.3 MMT due to favorable monsoon rains and increased sugar acreage. FAS predicted that Thailand's 2025\/26 sugar production will climb +2% y\/y to 10.3 MMT.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Companies can face fines as high as 10% of their global annual revenue for breaches.\nFurther afield, landmark regulations aimed at keeping kids safer online are swiftly making their way through the U.S. Congress. One bill, known as the Kids Online Safety Act, would make social media platforms liable for preventing their products from harming children — similar to the Online Safety Act in the U.K.\nThis push from regulators is increasingly causing something of a rethink at several major tech players. Pornhub and other online pornography giants are blocking all users from accessing their sites unless they go through an age verification system.\nPorn sites haven't been alone in taking action to verify users ages, though. Spotify, Reddit and X have all implemented age assurance systems to prevent children from being exposed to sexually explicit or inappropriate materials.\nSuch regulatory measures have been met with criticisms from the tech industry — not least due to concerns that they may infringe internet users' privacy.\nDigital ID tech flourishing\nAt the heart of all these age verification measures is one company: Yoti.\nYoti produces technology that captures selfies and uses artificial intelligence to verify someone's age based on their facial features. The firm says its AI algorithm, which has been trained on millions of faces, can estimate the age of 13 to 24-year-olds within two years of accuracy.\nThe firm has previously partnered with the U.K.'s Post Office and is hoping to capitalize on the broader push for government-issued digital ID cards in the U.K. Yoti is not alone in the identity verification software space — other players include Entrust, Persona and iProov. However, the company has been the most prominent provider of age assurance services under the new U.K. regime.\n\"There is a race on for child safety technology and service providers to earn trust and confidence,\" Pete Kenyon, a partner at law firm Cripps, told CNBC. \"The new requirements have undoubtedly created a new marketplace and providers are scrambling to make their mark.\"\nYet the rise of digital identification methods has also led to concerns over privacy infringements and possible data breaches.\n\"Substantial privacy issues arise with this technology being used,\" said Kenyon. \"Trust is key and will only be earned by the use of stringent and effective technical and governance procedures adopted in order to keep personal data safe.\"\nRani Govender, policy manager for child safety online at British child protection charity NSPCC, said that the technology \"already exists\" to authenticate users without compromising their privacy.\n\"Tech companies must make deliberate, ethical choices by choosing solutions that protect children from harm without compromising the privacy of users,\" she told CNBC. \"The best technology doesn't just tick boxes; it builds trust.\"\nChild-safe smartphones\nThe wave of new tech emerging to prevent children from being exposed to online harms isn't just limited to software.\nEarlier this month, Finnish phone maker HMD Global launched a new smartphone called the Fusion X1, which uses AI to stop kids from filming or sharing nude content or viewing sexually explicit images from the camera, screen and across all apps.\nThe phone uses technology developed by SafeToNet, a British cybersecurity firm focused on child safety.\n\"We believe more needs to be done in this space,\" James Robinson, vice president of family vertical at HMD, told CNBC. He stressed that HMD came up with the concept for children's devices prior to the Online Safety Act entering into force, but noted it was \"great to see the government taking greater steps.\"\nThe release of HMD's child-friendly phone follows heightened momentum in the \"smartphone-free\" movement, which encourages parents to avoid letting their children own a smartphone.\nGoing forward, the NSPCC's Govender says that child safety will become a significant priority for digital behemoths such as Google and Meta.\nThe tech giants have for years been accused of worsening mental health in children and teens due to the rise of online bullying and social media addiction. They in return argue they've taken steps to address these issues through increased parental controls and privacy features.\n\"For years, tech giants have stood by while harmful and illegal content spread across their platforms, leaving young people exposed and vulnerable,\" she told CNBC. \"That era of neglect must end.\"","content_hash":"ba175e0f1d93ffb80be58c6b4087442f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4882,"method_rank":0}

(The Princeton Review is not associated with Princeton University.) The publication considered financial aid, academic rigor and admissions selectivity, as well as overall costs after aid, to determine the colleges that deliver the best value.\nFor the 2025-26 academic year, tuition at Princeton comes with a sticker price of $65,210, according to the school's website. But students receiving financial aid pay an average of just $10,555 a year, and go on to earn a median income of over $110,000 a year a decade after attending, according to the most recent data from the Department of Education.\nBy comparison, students at Georgia Institute of Technology, the public college with the best ROI per Princeton Review, pay a higher average net price of $13,289 and earn less, a median of $102,772. Many of the best-value public colleges have lower sticker and average net prices than the private schools, but earnings fall short of private school grads' incomes.\nHere are the 10 private colleges that deliver the best ROI, according to Princeton Review, along with tuition figures for the 2025-26 academic year, per the schools' websites; average annual net prices and median earnings among students who received financial aid 10 years after attendance, according to Department of Education data.\n1.

Princeton was the first U.S. college to institute a \"no-loan\" policy in 2001 where the school covers the cost of attendance for students who demonstrate financial need.\nNow, dozens of schools throughout the country have adopted similar policies to help students and families attend prestigious universities without the burden of student debt. And while a free education doesn't guarantee a good outcome, it can certainly help deliver a strong ROI.\nFor example, MIT meets 100% of demonstrated financial need for students, but doesn't have an explicit no-loan policy. Beginning with the 2025-26 school year, families earning $200,000 a year or less will pay $0 for tuition and families earning $100,000 or less will have fees like housing and meals covered as well.\nHarvard similarly covers all costs for students if their families earn $100,000 a year or less and tuition for families earning $200,000 or less. Families earning more than $200,000 may still get some financial aid, depending on their individual situation.\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

CRWV stock jumped on Cantor Fitzgerald’s initiation at “Overweight” with a $116 price target in reference to its strategic partnership with Nvidia (NVDA) and increasing Nvidia-based generative AI workload demand. It followed shortly after Nvidia’s record-breaking quarter, which reaffirmed its spot at the epicenter of the AI juggernaut.\nEverything is in place: hyperscale spending on data centers is skyrocketing, inference computational workloads are rising exponentially, and infrastructure investment driven by artificial intelligence is outpacing supply. That is why CoreWeave’s role as an artificial intelligence-focused hyperscaler, based entirely on Nvidia GPUs, has become a prime enabler in the artificial intelligence economy.\nCoreWeave is a New Jersey cloud computing company with a specialty in AI infrastructure. Also known as the “AI hyperscaler,” it offers access to GPU-accelerated computing power for research labs, developers, and enterprises. As it is an entirely Nvidia-powered infrastructure company, it is a partner of choice for large language model (LLM) training, inference, and other high-demanding applications for artificial intelligence. Its market capitalization is over $47 billion.\nCRWV has had a bumpy ride since the IPO, ranging between $33.51 and $187 per share over the last 52 weeks. CoreWeave now trades in the $104 handle, up more than 13% in the recent five days but still far short of its 2025 highs. That compares with a nearly 25% increase in the same period by the S&P 500 Index ($SPX), which reflects risk as well as upside potential in CoreWeave’s story of growth.\nValuation remains stretched in line with robust expectations for expansion. CoreWeave has a 13.4x price-to-sales (P\/S) multiple and 15.8x price-to-book (P\/B) multiple, but still incurs net losses on a GAAP basis since debt costs are so onerous in addition to spending for expansion. Most cloud infrastructure peers are lower-multiple compared, though its 62% adjusted EBITDA margin shows it benefits equally in scalability relative to larger hyperscalers.\nAs it does not pay a dividend at this time, it invests heavily in expansion.\nCoreWeave Beats on Earnings\nCoreWeave in Q2 2025 generated record revenue of $1.21 billion, compared with $395 million in the same quarter a year ago, which is over three times larger. Its adjusted EBITDA rose to $753 million, reflecting margin strength, whereas GAAP results reported a net loss of $290 million due to $267 million in interest expense. Its GAAP operating margin dropped sharply to a 2% result, while its adjusted margins remained robust at 16%.\nManagement hasn't provided formal EPS guidance but has indicated that demand visibility is supported by a $30.1 billion revenue backlog, including the expansion of its $11.9 billion OpenAI contract, along with new enterprise deals with BT Group, Cohere, LG CNS, and Woven, a subsidiary of major automobile maker Toyota (TM). It further revealed technology leadership achievements, including the first at-scale deployment of Nvidia’s Blackwell GB200 systems, besides announcing new developer products based on its acquisition of Weights & Biases.\nBesides financial results, CoreWeave is expanding aggressively as well. It ended Q2 with operating power capacity at 470 MW and raised total contracted power to 2.2 GW, a sign of the infrastructure race underway in AI. CoreWeave raised $2 billion in senior notes at 9.25% last month, but its liquidity is still robust enough for expansion financing.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for CRWV Stock?\nWall Street sentiment became bullish in reaction to Nvidia’s quarter and CoreWeave’s Q2. Cantor Fitzgerald’s “Overweight” rating and $116 target reflect the company's robust secular exposure to artificial intelligence trends and its unique software-driven hyperscaler position.\nCoreWeave receives a “Strong Buy” rating consensus with an average target price of $128.10, indicating a potential upside of nearly 23% compared to current levels. The street-record high target is $200, while the low is $32, which embodies both bullish conviction and increased risk.\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Wall Street had forecast sales of $2.67 billion.\nMore from WWD\n-\nEXCLUSIVE: Birkenstock Expands Its Care Essentials Line With New Body Products\n-\nEXCLUSIVE: Tilda Swinton Fronts Tom Ford Black Orchid Reserve Campaign\nNet income rose 3.3 percent to $260.9 million, compared to $252.6 million. Diluted earnings per share rose 9.1 percent to $5.78, compared to $5.30 and beating analysts’ estimates of $5.10.\nUlta is now forecasting full-year sales between $12 billion and $12.1 billion, up from $11.5 billion to $11.7 billion. Diluted earnings per share are expected to come in between $23.85 and $24.30, an increase from its previous forecast of $22.65 to $23.20.\nKecia Steelman, president and chief executive officer, said: “As we look to the future, we remain committed to executing our Ulta Beauty Unleashed strategy and strengthening our operating model. Our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects both the strength of our year-to-date performance and our caution around how consumer demand may evolve in the second half of the year. While near-term uncertainty persists, we’re staying focused on what we can control and on executing with excellence to deliver our uniquely Ulta Beauty experience.”\nUlta acquired Space NK from investment firm Manzanita Capital in July. Terms of the deal were not disclosed apart from that the purchase was funded with cash on hand and capacity under Ulta’s existing credit facility.\nPress reports from last year suggested Manzanita was searching for a deal valued between 300 million pounds and 400 million pounds.\nSpace NK has 83 stores in the U.K. and Ireland and turnover of 196.5 million pounds in 2024.\nDuring a post earnings call with analysts, Steelman said: “Our acquisition of U.K. specialty beauty retailer Space NK was a unique and strategically compelling opportunity to enter the growing U.K. market with an established and successful player, a top destination for beauty lovers. Space NK will continue to operate as a stand-alone subsidiary, with CEO Andy Lightfoot and his talented team staying at the helm leading operations from the U.K., we see opportunities to leverage each other’s strengths, talents and expertise, and over the long-term, we will focus on sharing best practices and transferring learnings between markets, particularly around assortment, guest experience and scaling growth.”\nContinuing its international expansion, Ulta just celebrated the soft opening of its first store in Mexico, with the grand opening to come in a few weeks, and remains on track to open its first store in the Middle East later this year.\nOn the end of its partnership with Target, Steelman said: “For perspective, the royalty revenue from our Target partnership in fiscal 2024 was well below 1 percent of net sales.”\nProviding a breakdown of the second-quarter sales numbers, Steelman noted that fragrance continued to be the strongest-performing category, delivering robust double-digit growth. Performance was fueled by successful Mother’s Day and Father’s Day activations, newness and strength and gift sets and men’s fragrances.\nSales in the skin care and wellness category increased in the high-single digit range, led by strong growth in body care and wellness across both mass and prestige.\nThe makeup category delivered midsingle-digit comp growth, while sales in the hair care category increased in the midsingle-digit range, supported by growth in professional hair care, accessories and hair tools.\nBest of WWD\nSign up for WWD's Newsletter.

While some retailers are leaning into worker-led personalized experiences for shoppers, other retailers are focusing more on leveraging artificial intelligence to optimize the shopping experience.\nWalmart is one of those retailers, adding new \"super agents\" that aims to save time and effort for both workers and shoppers. At its recent Retail Rewired innovation event, Walmart highlighted the launch of four \"super agents,\" which include Marty for sellers and suppliers, Sparky for shoppers, the Associate Agent and the Developer Agent.\nWith agents performing capabilities in the realm of payroll, paid time off, merchandising and finding the right products for any event, Walmart is consolidating its powerful, time-saving tools for the sake of a streamlined experience for multiple points of interaction with the company.\n\"Having a plethora of different agents can very quickly become confusing,\" Suresh Kumar, chief technology officer for Walmart Global, said at the event.\nThe Associate Agent, for example, is \"a single point of entry where any associate can find access to all of the agents we've built on the back end,\" explained David Glick, senior vice president for Enterprise Business Solutions at Walmart. \"As you speak to it more, as you work with it more, it'll know more about you.\"\nThe evolution comes alongside a broader shift for retail, an industry actively seeking to counteract cost concerns from consumers and the government, and Walmart isn't alone in its push toward all things AI. Amazon's Prime Day event over four days in July saw generative AI use jump 3,300% year over year, according to TechCrunch. Meanwhile, Google Cloud AI partnered with body care retailer Lush to visually identify projects without packaging, ultimately reducing the expense of training new hires.\nMaking digital twins of Walmart stores\nWalmart is also all-in on physical and spatial AI, specifically digital twins (a virtual copy of any physical object or space — in Walmart's case, their stores and clubs). Using digital twin technology powered by spatial AI, Walmart can \"detect, diagnose and remediate issues up to two weeks in advance,\" Brandon Ballard, group director for real estate at Walmart US, said at Retail Rewired. Using this technology comes with big savings, according to Ballard. \"Last year, we cut all of our emergency alerts by 30% and we reduced our maintenance spend in refrigeration by 19% across Walmart US,\" he added.\n\"At its core, retail is a physical business,\" said Alex de Vigan, CEO and founder of Nfinite, which generates large-scale visual data for training spatial and physical AI models. \"We've seen retailers use digital twins to reduce setup time for new promotions, reallocate labor more efficiently, and improve robotic picking accuracy, small gains that add up quickly when margins are under stress,\" he said.\nWhile the impact of digital twins may not be outwardly visible to consumers in the same way, say, Walmart's Sparky agent is, its effects will be real. \"Better stock accuracy, faster site updates and fewer order issues mean a smoother retail experience, even in a tighter economy,\" said de Vigan.\nAnother innovation on the back end is Walmart's use of machine learning to better understand how long it will take to get a delivery order on a customer's doorsteps, effectively managing expectations while increasing efficiency.\nAs for what consumers can see, Sparky is already helping shoppers generate baskets built on an intuitive understanding of their needs. Walmart is currently working on enabling the agent to take action on reordering products, ultimately reducing the mental load that shoppers deal with.\nFor retailers, AI is one way to combat any slowdown in consumer spending, but we've yet to see how a fully integrated AI shopping experience — both in person and online — will shape our relationship with retail moving forward.","content_hash":"ad23afb5757014532225c61809d69643","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4060,"method_rank":0}

The company is also recalling about 18,000 bags of Kroger-branded cooked, medium peeled, tail-off shrimp sold at stores in 17 states between July 24 and Aug. 11.\nAt the same time, H&N Group, a wholesale seafood distributor in Vernon, California, is recalling more than 17,000 cases of frozen shrimp sold to grocery stores on the East Coast, according to a notice from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. That recall began on Aug. 12.\nThe products have been pulled because they may be contaminated with Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope that is a byproduct of nuclear reactions. The risk appears to be small, but the shrimp could pose a \"potential health concern\" for people exposed to low levels of Cesium-137 over time, FDA officials said.\nThe FDA issued a safety alert this month warning consumers not to eat certain frozen shrimp imported from PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati, an Indonesian company doing business as BMS Foods. Cesium-137 was detected in shipping containers from the company sent to U.S. ports and in a sample of frozen breaded shrimp.\nFDA has also added PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati to a new import alert for chemical contamination to stop products from this firm from coming into the U.S.\nIt remains unclear how the containers or the shrimp became contaminated. Federal officials said they are investigating and declined to respond to detailed questions from The Associated Press about the source or extent of the contamination.\nNone of the shrimp that triggered alerts or tested positive for Cesium-137 was released for sale, the FDA said. But other shipments sent to stores may have been manufactured under conditions that allowed the products to become contaminated, the agency said.\nOfficials with U.S. Customs and Border Protection first detected the potential radioactive contamination in shipping containers sent to U.S. ports in Los Angeles, Houston, Miami and Savannah, Georgia. Customs officials alerted the FDA, which conducted tests of packaged shrimp and confirmed Cesium-137 in a single sample.\nExperts in nuclear radiation agreed that the health risk is low, but said it's important to determine the source of the contamination and share that information with the public.\nThe level of Cesium-137 detected in the frozen shrimp was about 68 becquerels per kilogram, a measure of radioactivity. That is far below the FDA's level of 1,200 becquerels per kilogram that could trigger the need for health protections.\nIt is unusual to see this concentration of Cesium-137 in shrimp, said Steve Biegalski, who chairs the Nuclear and Radiological Engineering and Medical Physics program at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Routine levels detected in shrimp from the Pacific Ocean are about 100 times lower than those found in the BMS shrimp, according to the American Nuclear Society.\n\"We sometimes can see Cesium-137 from historic nuclear weapons fallout, nuclear accidents such as Fukushima or Chernobyl, but the levels in the environment are super, super, super low right now and cannot explain what's going on here,\" Biegalski said.","content_hash":"934cfd7ed47831eac857353d3fcddc6f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3432,"method_rank":0}

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.4%, crossing the 6,500 level for the first time as it set a second-consecutive all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) ticked up 0.2%, enough to notch its own record.\nThe government said US GDP rose 3.3% in the second quarter, a surprise bump up from its first estimate and a broad rebound from the 0.5% dip in Q1. That was due to a variety of factors — notably, a decrease in imports that followed a Q1 import surge to \"front-run\" tariffs, as well as a healthy pickup in consumer spending. Meanwhile, jobless claims fell as layoffs remained low.\nAnother economic test looms on Friday, with the July reading on PCE consumer inflation, closely watched by the central bank, due in the morning.\nInvestors were also watching the ongoing dispute between Trump and Cook. On Thursday, Cook sued the president after refusing to bow to his termination letter earlier this week — the biggest test yet of the central bank’s independence from executive branch influence.\nMeanwhile, the initial cloud over Nvidia lifted as investors dug into its quarterly report, seen as a test of the AI trade driving stock gains this year. The chipmaker's shares closed down nearly 0.8%, paring bigger immediate post-earnings losses, as the company's disappointing data center sales and uncertainty over its future in China overshadowed its earnings beat.\nNvidia stressed that demand for its AI chips — which power applications like ChatGPT remotely from data centers — is healthy, countering recent fears of an AI bubble about to burst. CEO Jensen Huang touted \"extraordinary\" demand for the company's Blackwell AI GPUs (graphics processing units).\nHuang also told Yahoo Finance that the company is getting \"fired back up\" to sell chips into the $50 billion China AI market following a short-lived export ban, though geopolitical uncertainty remains an overhang on that opportunity.\nRead more: The latest on Trump's tariffs\nLIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 26 updatesGDP grows at 3.3% annualized pace in Q2, in bump from previous estimate\nUS GDP grew at a 3.3% annualized pace last quarter, according to the government's second estimate released Thursday. That's a bump up from the 3.0% from its first estimate, and also higher than the 3.1% forecast.\nThe GDP growth comes after the US economy shrank at a 0.5% annualized pace in the first quarter.\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis, which tracks GDP, said the Q2 bump \"primarily reflected a decrease in imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, and an increase in consumer spending.\"\nPresident Trump's tariffs have upended the economic landscape, with imports surging — thus subtracting from GDP — in Q1 as businesses and consumers attempted to \"front-run\" tariff-related price increases.\nIn other economic data, initial jobless claims fell slightly from last week, coming in at 229,000 compared to 234,000 the week prior. As layoffs remained low, however, hiring also is staying tepid.","content_hash":"e4c0ea1f572afab4f761d55a8d828991","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3290,"method_rank":0}

That's nearly 37% above where the stock is trading. \"We remain bullish on shares of DELL where we expect long term EPS growth of 15% over the next five years supported by strong growth in AI servers,\" the analyst said. \"The qtr and FY guide re-affirmed our confidence in Dell continuing to drive upside to AI server consensus rev ests.\" JPMorgan reiterates overweight rating The firm's $145 price target implies about 19% upside from Friday's close of $122.15. \"We rate shares of DELL Overweight as we are more positively inclined toward the AI-driven compute investment cycle, which should benefit branded server companies, even as the drivers for the remaining businesses are more mixed being subject to the macro backdrop,\" analyst Samik Chatterjee said. \"While DELL is unlikely to be perceived as a primary beneficiary of an AI investment cycle, we expect all server companies to benefit in relation to sale of higher-end servers with ASP [application service provider] and (operating) margin upside,\" the analyst added. Goldman Sachs maintains buy rating Analyst Michael Ng's $150 price target implies about 23% upside. \"The company's AI pipeline continues to represent multiples of its backlog and represents a mix of Blackwell and older chip generations. ISG [infrastructure solutions group] margins missed in the quarter (8.8% v. GS\/consensus 9.6%\/9.4%), in part due to higher mix of lower-margin AI server revenue, competitive pricing, as well as one-time costs incurred in F2Q26 associated with supply chain resiliency and expediting GB200 deployments,\" Ng said. Morgan Stanley reiterates overweight rating The firm's $144 price target calls for about 18% upside. \"[W]e'd still characterize the quarter as illustrating progress, with AI servers the clear standout, and DELL highlighting emerging strength in enterprise AI demand, double digit growth in traditional servers (in F2Q and FY26), and double digit growth in their midrange storage product and entire all-flash portfolio,\" analyst Erik Woodring said.\" \"Yes, margins face pressure from increasing AI server mix - this should not come as a surprise (and yet the stock is down 5% as a result) - but that is set to reverse in 2H, and if DELL can improve execution in US large enterprise and the overall PC business, then the story should get cleaner from here,\" the analyst added.","content_hash":"fc31ffc37c6f0aad1b6987bfe41f92fb","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3235,"method_rank":0}

Here's Which Dividend King Is Still Flying Under the Radar.\nKey Points\n-\nConsumer staples companies make things that people need and buy regularly.\n-\nMany consumer staples makers have been so reliable as businesses that they have achieved Dividend King status.\n-\nDiversified consumer staples giant PepsiCo has a historically high yield today as investors pass it by for better-performing stocks.\nThe Motley Fool just updated its report on the 10 largest consumer staple companies. You probably know every name on the list, which includes retail giants like Walmart (NYSE: WMT), product makers like Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), and tobacco companies like Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM). Also on that list is a Dividend King food and beverage company that has a historically high yield. Here's why it could be the best opportunity for investors today.\nWhat does PepsiCo do?\nTo get right to the crux of the topic, PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) is the company in question. It sits at No. 7 on the list of the largest consumer staple companies, with a market cap of around $200 billion. It is one of three beverage makers on the list, the other two being Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) at No. 4 and Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE: BUD) at No. 10.\nUnlike those other two, however, PepsiCo's business extends well beyond beverages. It also has leading positions in the salty snack (Frito-Lay) and packaged food (Quaker Oats) segments of the sector. It is one of the most diversified companies on the top-10 list. Only Unilever (NYSE: UL), which makes household products and food, has a similar degree of diversification.\nPepsiCo, meanwhile, stands toe to toe with every company on the list with regard to name recognition. For more direct peers, those that manage brands and are not retailers, it can compete equally on distribution, marketing, and product development. And, like all the other names on the list, PepsiCo is large enough to act as an industry consolidator, buying smaller companies to round out its brand portfolio and keep up with consumers' buying habits.\nThe proof of the business's strength and resilience is best highlighted by the fact that PepsiCo is a Dividend King. It has increased its dividend annually for 53 consecutive years, which is not something a company can achieve if it doesn't have a strong business model that gets executed well in both good times and bad. For reference, other Dividend Kings on the list include Walmart, Coca-Cola, and Procter & Gamble.\nThis is not a good time for PepsiCo\nAmong the sub-grouping of large consumer staples companies that are also Dividend Kings, PepsiCo has been the laggard in recent years. To put a number on that, PepsiCo's 2.1% organic sales growth in the second quarter was less than half the 5% growth of Coca-Cola, its closest peer. No wonder PepsiCo's stock is down more than 20% from its 2023 highs, the worst result from the Dividend Kings grouping. That also puts PepsiCo into its own personal bear market.","content_hash":"942b2da04d169ca7f38a209b6d2661f4","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3044,"method_rank":0}

Nasdaq-listed KindlyMD has filed to raise up to $5 billion to enhance its Bitcoin reserves, and Adam Back's Twenty-First Capital is manoeuvring to become the second-largest corporate holder, just behind Strategy, and ahead of Marathon Digital.\nPassive inflows from index inclusions\nPassive inflows have also expanded, thanks to index inclusions. Strategy Inc. was added to the major equity benchmarks.\nMetaplanet's status as a mid-cap company led to its inclusion in the FTSE All-World index through its promotion. Both moves have brought Bitcoin exposure to more portfolios worldwide.\nRelated: What are yield coins? Yield bearing assets explained\nJPMorgan said in its note that the dynamic is changing. At the end of 2024, Bitcoin traded at $36,000 over fair value on a risk-adjusted basis, and today trades $13,000 under fair value, implying that it could further increase.\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $112,416.05, nearly flat over the last 24 hours.\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Aug 28, 2025, where it first appeared in the MARKETS section.

The move could ratchet up a months-long legal challenge over the news outlets' fate.\nKari Lake, acting CEO of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, announced the latest round of job cuts late Friday, one day after a federal judge blocked her from removing Michael Abramowitz as VOA director.\nU.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth had ruled separately that the Republican administration had failed to show how it was complying with his orders to restore VOA's operations. His order Monday gave the administration \"one final opportunity, short of a contempt trial\" to demonstrate its compliance. He ordered Lake to sit for a deposition by lawyers for agency employees by Sept. 15.\nOn Thursday, Lamberth said Abramowitz could not be removed without the approval of the majority of the International Broadcasting Advisory Board. Firing Abramowitz would be \"plainly contrary to law,\" according to Lamberth, who was nominated to the bench by Republican President Ronald Reagan.\nLake posted a statement on social media that said her agency had initiated a reduction in force, or RIF, eliminating 532 jobs for full-time government employees. She said the agency \"will continue to fulfill its statutory mission after this RIF— and will likely improve its ability to function.\"\n\"I look forward to taking additional steps in the coming months to improve the functioning of a very broken agency and make sure America's voice is heard abroad where it matters most,\" she wrote.\nA group of agency employees who sued to block VOA's elimination said Lake's move would give their colleagues 30 days until their pay and benefits end.\n\"We find Lake's continued attacks on our agency abhorrent,\" they said in a statement. \"We are looking forward to her deposition to hear whether her plan to dismantle VOA was done with the rigorous review process that Congress requires. So far we have not seen any evidence of that.\"\nIn June, layoff notices were sent to more than 600 agency employees. Abramowitz was placed on administrative leave along with almost the entire VOA staff. He was told he would be fired effective Aug. 31.\nThe administration said in a court filing Thursday that it planned to send RIF notices to 486 employees of VOA and 46 other agency employees but intended to retain 158 agency employees and 108 VOA employees. The filing said the global media agency had 137 \"active employees\" and 62 other employees on administrative leave while VOA had 86 active employees and 512 others administrative leave.\nThe agency also houses Radio Free Europe and Asia and Radio Marti, which beams Spanish-language news into Cuba. The networks, which together reach an estimated 427 million people, date to the Cold War and are part of a network of government-funded organizations trying to extend U.S. influence and combat authoritarianism.","content_hash":"f2ecb64b49327a606d431c4d5cf7f2ab","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2994,"method_rank":0}

On the other hand, Ethereum has, on average, experienced a 6.4% increase one week after and an 8.4% decline one month after, he said.\n\"A bearish flag for crypto overall: ETH cushions short-term, but both tend to roll over,\" he said.\nWhen one user suggested that the recent divergence could be an outlier and that Bitcoin and Ethereum could both rise, Sigel said it was \"possible,\" but maintained that \"history tilts bearish.\"\nTrending: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\nA Volatile Market\nThe divergence between Bitcoin and Ethereum comes as the cryptocurrency market has faced significant volatility over the past week, with BTC oscillating between $117,000 and $110,000. MEXC Ventures Investment Director Leo Zhao attributed the recent price swings to thinning liquidity, exchange-traded fund rebalancing and heavy profit-taking from OG Bitcoin holders in a Tuesday note shared with Benzinga.\n\"In the absence of a fresh macro catalyst, such as a dovish FED policy pivot, rate cuts, or renewed ETF inflows, BTC is likely to drift into a period of market consolidation as the market digests the recent distribution,\" he said. \"The long-term picture, however, remains underpinned by institutional accumulation, which continues to outpace new supply, suggesting that once the risk-averse approach wears off and macro uncertainty headwinds subside, Bitcoin retains the structural foundation for another attempt at record highs of $130,000 before the EOY.\"\nSee Also: Kevin O'Leary Says Real Estate's Been a Smart Bet for 200 Years — This Platform Lets Anyone Tap Into It\nBut while Zhao remains optimistic in the long term, veteran commodities trader Peter Brandt warned Wednesday on X that Bitcoin could be forming a cycle top. Brandt cited the sale of 24,000 BTC by a single whale, which rocked the market over the weekend, as a sign of distribution.","content_hash":"fc3d0b6c5697bc66e4cf5b84d10693ec","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2985,"method_rank":0}

That ruling allowed the deal to proceed once the Securities and Exchange Commission gave its nod to the transaction. The SEC approval has since been received, according to Skechers and 3G on Thursday.

It released full year results. The same theme continues - with its low cost position strengthening, but its expansion being hindered by Boeing delivery delays. Interestingly, management has revealed plans to open two engine maintenance facilities at a likely cost of USD 600m. We expect its reasoning is to control this critical business function. By doing so, it will no longer be privy to the third party service agents (perhaps its recent experience with Boeing was a catalyst). Ryanair is also buying back shares, management proposed a 20% dividend increase, and its foreign ownership restrictions were lifted. This led to MSCI inclusion in the end of May, which was likely a contributing factor to the strong share price performance. Ryanair has grown to be the Fund’s largest position (7.9%). We’re comfortable with this. As we updated our analysis, our estimate of maintainable owners earnings increased as did our valuation, and it trades at a slightly lower price than that conservative valuation.\"\nRyanair Holdings plc (NASDAQ:RYAAY) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

OpenAI was one of the first mainstream AI companies due to ChatGPT, which gets more than 700 million weekly users, according to OpenAI. However, its founder, Sam Altman, isn't going to end up with the big payday that everyone expects.\nIt turns out he doesn't have any equity in OpenAI, which he revealed at the New York Times' DealBook Summit back in December.

He also said that he enjoyed \"getting to sit in the room with the smartest researchers in the world and go on this crazy adventure.\"\nNot accumulating equity in OpenAI could have helped Altman work with more talented workers and investors who wanted a slice of the pie. OpenAI was also originally a nonprofit, and he had to preserve a majority disinterested board to maintain nonprofit status. He admitted this detail during an \"All-In\" podcast interview in May 2024.\nIt is shocking to see a tech founder not own any equity in their company, especially one as large as OpenAI. However, there is speculation that Altman can receive equity in the future. Reuters reported that Altman would receive equity in the company last year after its corporate restructuring from a nonprofit to a for-profit company. CNBC reported less than a week later that Altman told OpenAI staff that he would not receive a \"giant equity stake' in the company.\nTrending: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\nSam Altman Was Already Rich\nOpenAI was Sam Altman's biggest hit, but it wasn't his first rodeo.

The overall earnings were better-than-expected, not that the market expected a different outcome from the chip designing giant's report. However, as has been the case on more than one occasion over the last few quarters, NVDA stock is slipping despite beating consensus estimates. In this article, we’ll look at the key takeaways from Nvidia’s report and examine whether it makes sense to buy the dip in the stock.\nNvidia Reported Better-Than-Expected Q2 Earnings\nNvidia reported revenues of $46.74 billion in its fiscal second quarter, up 56% year-over-year, and ahead of the company’s guidance as well as consensus estimates. It was the ninth consecutive quarter in which the company’s revenues rose by over 50% annually. While last quarter’s growth was the lowest among these quarters, it occurred at a time when the company was unable to ship its H20 chips to China.\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nDear Broadcom Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for September 4\n-\nCEO Alex Karp Just Sold $60 Million in Palantir Stock. Should You Ditch PLTR Here Too?\nMeanwhile, while Nvidia’s overall revenues came in ahead of estimates, its data center segment, which is now its biggest segment by a big margin, fell slightly short of estimates. The company guided for revenues of $54 billion at the midpoint for the fiscal third quarter, which was higher than the $53.1 billion that analysts were expecting. Importantly, the guidance does not assume any H20 sales to China in the current quarter, while some China revenues might have been built into analysts’ estimates.\nNvidia’s adjusted earnings per share of $1.05 also came in ahead of the $0.94 that analysts were modeling, and the company predicted an expansion of its gross margins in the current quarter.\nOther Key Takeaways from Nvidia’s Earnings\nHere are the other key takeaways from Nvidia’s Q2 earnings.\nChina Remains a Wild Card for Nvidia\nChina was expectedly the focus during Nvidia’s fiscal Q2 earnings call since the company was barred from exporting the H20 chip to the country in the quarter. While the U.S. government has since allowed exports to resume, pending a revenue-share deal, there is still a lot of uncertainty over the company’s China business. CFO Colette Kress said that Nvidia is “still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the [U.S. and Chinese] governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do.” Nvidia said that it could ship H20 chips worth between $2 billion-$5 billion this quarter in China, subject to regulatory clearances. However, it added that it could ship more if there is higher interest from Chinese customers or if more licenses are issued by the U.S. government.","content_hash":"a6e065760de32738693d9b35ea48bd8e","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2822,"method_rank":0}

A New Survey Shows How Much Millennials And Gen Z Are Banking On Family Wealth\nA majority of young Americans are counting on family wealth to shape their future, according to a new survey by insurance agency Choice Mutual that digs into expectations around inheritance.\nRoughly two-thirds of Americans between the ages of 18 and 43 either expect to receive or have already received an inheritance from their parents. On average, they believe they'll inherit about $334,850.\nMost Say They'll Save Or Invest The Money\n“The Great Wealth Transfer is surely on its way,” said Choice Mutual CEO Anthony Martin.

Others plan to use it for housing costs, debt repayment, or saving for their own children.\nMore than seven in 10 expect to inherit cash, and 69% believe real estate will be part of the package. Investment accounts, property, and business ownership stakes were also mentioned.\n“This is not just wishful thinking,” the study notes. “Sixty-one percent of those surveyed have had a direct conversation with their parents about an expected inheritance or have seen a will or trust.”\nStill, the optimism has limits. More than half – 53% – said they expect to be financially burdened by supporting their aging parents. About one in two said they already have or plan to support their parents financially.\nTrending: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\nThe Emotional Cost Of Financial Pressure\nThis financial stress is already shaping their lives. 60% said they feel anxious about future support responsibilities, and 52% said it's already impacting their financial plans.\nAbout one-third of those surveyed even admitted they resent their parents for not being in a stronger financial position.\nIn some cases, the anticipation of inheritance is influencing how people live now. One in 10 said they carry more debt than they otherwise would, assuming they'll use the inheritance to pay it off. Around 9% feel less pressure to save or earn money, and about one in six said just knowing the money is coming makes life less stressful.\nExperts project that nearly $100 trillion will change hands from baby boomers to younger generations over the next 25 years.

It’s not a matter of if something will happen to an organization, it’s a matter of when will it happen. Once incident can derail even the best-run supply chains. As a result technology providers are doubling down on tools that give brokers and shippers clearer visibility into carrier performance.\nA new partnership between MyCarrier Portal and Carrier Assure aims to do just that, embedding Carrier Assure’s scoring directly into the MyCarrier Portal workflow to streamline onboarding, strengthen monitoring, and help prevent costly missteps before they occur.\nThe collaboration was born out of demand from mutual customers who were already pairing MyCarrier Portal’s carrier onboarding platform with Carrier Assure’s safety and fraud rating system.\nBrokers and shippers often found themselves jumping between platforms, first running MyCarrier Portal assessments, then cross-checking Carrier Assure scores. Danielle Spinelli, Account Executive at MyCarrier Portal, said, “Everyone was already doing both steps.The partnership just brings the Carrier Assure score into the MyCarrier Portal dashboard, so users have everything in one place.”\nNow, when a user searches for a carrier in MyCarrier Portal, they see Carrier Assure’s risk score alongside their own vetting results. If needed, they can click through directly into the Carrier Assurance portal for a deeper dive into why a carrier earned its rating.\nThe experience is configurable, allowing users to set parameters that match their own risk tolerance. For example, a “B” score could be flagged as a medium alert for one broker but considered acceptable for another. “It’s about helping customers navigate the gray area of vetting with guardrails that fit their business,” Spinelli added.\nCarrier Assure’s scoring is built on a wide range of data points that go beyond surface-level safety metrics. The model incorporates factors such as business stability, DOT safety performance, inspection and violation trends, insurance and authority status, tracking reliability, and even the relationships between connected entities. This allows the system to identify unusual safety patterns, compliance gaps, or signs of business instability that may not show up in traditional checks.\nEqually important is data quality. Carrier Assure requires documentation to back up user-submitted information, which is reviewed for accuracy and authenticity. Other inputs come from trusted third-party sources, giving customers confidence that fraudulent credentials, double-brokering, or outright identity theft will be flagged before a load is put at risk. The score is not designed to make absolute judgments but rather to surface risk patterns and help customers make better-informed decisions.","content_hash":"324c33aaac8d4ef488ab745d4702526e","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2806,"method_rank":0}

The U.S. is the company’s biggest market, and despite recent record results and an order backlog that provides some cushion against a sales slowdown, Winkelmann said tariffs have the potential to deal the company a blow.\nPresident Donald Trump’s tariff instability is putting the economy on hold, and even Lamborghini’s deep-pocketed customers aren’t immune.\nCEO Stephan Winkelmann said some of its U.S. customers, who have at least $400,000 to shell out for a base model, are waiting to see where the Trump administration’s tariff rate for the EU ultimately settles. Its customers are waiting, even though the U.S. reached a deal to impose a 15% tariff on some EU products, including cars, in exchange for several pledges by the EU. This includes buying more AI chips and military equipment from the U.S.\n“Some are waiting because they want to be sure that this is the final number that is going to be in place,” Winkelmann told CNBC. “Others are fine with it, or we will have negotiations.”\nWinkelmann said while Lamborghini can resist the pressure of tariffs because of its large backlog of orders—cars delivered today were ordered a year or two ago—the company will still face pressure from U.S. tariffs on the EU. Lamborghini vehicles are made in Italy, and this point is a differentiator for the brand. While the U.S. is its largest market, the car company’s production can’t be moved there, a strategy Trump has suggested for companies to avoid tariffs.\n“For us, free trade is the right approach,” Winkelmann said. “We all know that one is what we want. The other is the reality, and we have to deal with complexity since we are in business, and we are ready to face whatever comes.”\nLamborghini, which is owned by Volkswagen’s Audi Group, reported a 16% year-over-year increase that saw it bring in more than 3 billion euros ($3.5 billion) in revenue for the first time for fiscal 2024. Its operating income also rose by double digits to 835 million euros ($974 million). The company has also launched three new plug-in hybrid models since 2023.\nLamborghini did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\nProviding another boost is Lamborghini’s increasingly diverse customer base. Younger wealthy customers from all over the world have pushed the average age of a Lambo owner below 45. In Asia, the average customer is about 30. The average buyer owns five cars, while buyers of its upscale, pricier model, the Revuelto, have 10, on average.","content_hash":"b608ca13b8b1111a0bd2bbd38e2a92f2","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2775,"method_rank":0}

As market dynamics indicate a continued low-volatility regime in the near term, 10x Research highlights the \"short strangle\" as an ideal play.\n\"Given the current dynamics in the bitcoin options market, a short strangle looks well-suited for the next month. With bitcoin trading around $113,000 and an expected range between $95,000 and $125,000, selling an out-of-the-money [September expiry] put near $95,000 alongside an out-of-the-money [September expiry] call near $125,000 provides an opportunity to capture premium,\" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a report to clients Thursday.\nShort strangle involves a simultaneous writing (selling) of out-of-the-money higher strike calls and OTM lower strike puts with the same expiry, positioned equidistant from the underlying asset's spot price.\nThe strategy is similar to selling insurance against both bullish and bearish moves in exchange for a premium, which represents the maximum profit achievable if the spot price remains between the two strike prices - $95,000 and $125,000 in this case.\nSelling options (or strangles) is a common strategy when implied volatility (IV) exceeds realized volatility, as this allows traders to capture richer premiums, and the market is expected to remain relatively stable.\n\"The strategy works because the implied volatility curve is trading above realized levels, signaling options are overpriced, and the market is unlikely to deliver large moves outside your defined range in the short run,\" Thielen noted. \"The options implied volatility term structure indicates near-term calm.\"\nThe implied volatility (IV) term structure is a graphical representation showing how volatility is expected to evolve across different future time horizons. It is typically upward sloping, reflecting increasing uncertainty and risk as the time to expiration lengthens.\nRisk-reward profile\nBTC needs to continue trading between $95,000 and $125,000 for the suggested strategy to generate profits. The rangebound trading will reduce the demand for OTM calls and puts, thereby draining premium from these options and generating a profit for strangle sellers.\nThielen’s previous recommendation from early August was also a short strangle, involving a $105,000 put and a $130,000 call. This strategy generated a yield of 3.5%.\nNote, however, that short strangles carry significant risks, particularly in the event of a sudden spike in volatility, which can lead to substantial losses. Therefore, traders must continuously monitor the position and relevant market variables to manage risk effectively.\nRead more: Bitcoin Headed to $190K on Institutional Wave, Research Firm Says","content_hash":"fedfdaf6e4992e61dbe0349e790ab9c5","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2756,"method_rank":0}

Last Monday, Covrig Analytics reported that Brazil's sugar mills are prioritizing sugar production over ethanol, crushing more cane for sugar. This trend is expected to continue as harvesting peaks, driven by drier cane crops that prompt mills to produce more sugar.\nOn August 12, NY sugar rallied to a 2.5-month high on concerns over weaker cane yields in Brazil.

This is how Nvidia captured a significant portion of the AI computing market, delivering substantial gains to its shareholders.\nSo, when Jensen Huang calls a company's stock a \"very smart buy,\" investors should listen up.\nWhat company was Huang talking about when he mentioned this? It's none other than a key Nvidia supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM).\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a key Nvidia supplier\nDuring a visit to TSMC, Jensen Huang stated:\nWell, first of all, I think TSMC is one of the greatest companies in the history of humanity, and anybody who wants to buy TSMC stock is a very smart person.\nThat's huge praise from the man who leads and founded the world's largest company. But is he right?\nTaiwan Semiconductor, widely known as TSMC, is in a strong and unique position in the chip world. It's a semiconductor foundry that produces chips for companies like Nvidia that lack the in-house capabilities to do it themselves. This fosters a strong working relationship, as they each depend on one another. Nvidia isn't the only company that uses TSMC; others, such as AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), do also.\nThis raises a key point about TSMC: It often produces chips for companies that are competing against each other. AMD and Nvidia are vying for supremacy in AI computing power, and Apple's iPhones are competing against Google's Pixel phones, which have just started using TSMC-made chips. With TSMC remaining neutral and acting only as a supplier to companies battling it out, it's in a position to capitalize on several key trends without needing to develop the winning product.\nAs long as TSMC can stay on top with the technology it offers, it will maintain its market leadership position.\nBy the end of the year, TSMC's next chip node, the 2nm (nanometer) chip, will be in production. This chip offers substantially better power consumption (25% to 30% improvement) compared to the 3nm variety when configured at the same speed. While concern grows about the power consumption of AI data centers, this innovation is expected to be a massive hit among tech companies. Additionally, TSMC has 1.6nm and 1.4nm designs in the pipeline, which are expected to offer similar power consumption improvements.","content_hash":"b99e4385d9efa7f563288e6e1754bfe0","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2747,"method_rank":0}

Despite the broader crypto market sentiment leaning bearish, where Bitcoin price slid below $110,000 and dragged top altcoins lower, LINK defied market trends this week. Trading as high as $25.50 intraday, Chainlink erased its seven-day timeframe losses, buoyed by a dual catalyst of fresh ecosystem announcements.\nAfter Bitwise filed to launch a spot LINK ETF on Wednesday, market interest intensified on Thursday as the US Department of Commerce (DOC) confirmed it will publish official macroeconomic data on-chain using Chainlink and Pyth Network.\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) will now release critical indicators such as Real GDP, the PCE Price Index, and Real Final Sales to Private Domestic Purchasers directly across multiple blockchain ecosystems.\nIn its official blog announcement, Chainlink emphasized the transformative potential of this integration: automated trading strategies, composable tokenized assets, real-time prediction markets, and DeFi risk management can now be powered by trusted government data.\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hailed the move as cementing America’s role as the blockchain capital of the world, highlighting 3.3% GDP growth as one of the first data points published on-chain. The BEA data feeds are updated monthly or quarterly and initially deployed across networks such as Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Optimism, and ZKsync, with more to come.\n“This step shows how government data on-chain can fuel a new wave of transparency, innovation, and adoption,” said Mike Cahill, founder of Douro Labs and core contributor to Pyth.\nFor Chainlink, the deal represents a milestone in its deepening government ties in 2025, following months of policy discussions with US regulators.\nChainlink Price Forecast: Can Bulls Extend Rally Beyond $27?\nFollowing the intraday rally to seven-month peaks near $26 on Thursday, LINK price now sits just below its short-term resistance cluster around $24.70. The daily chart shows that despite last week’s correction, bulls defended the $23.50 region, a level where both the 13-day SMA and MACD signal line converge, providing the base for the latest breakout.\nThe MACD histogram has just flipped green again, signaling renewed bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the 5- and 8-day SMAs are curling upward, hinting at a potential bullish crossover if sustained buying continues.\nIf Chainlink price closes above $25.50 and sustains momentum, the next upside targets lie at $27.20 and $29.50, with the latter aligning with February’s local top. A break above $30 could set the stage for a retest of $32, opening the door to a broader continuation rally.","content_hash":"f650fc5c585abcfb67ed7ad5b0b2b23c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2742,"method_rank":0}

Once a niche defense contractor, Palantir rode an AI and data analytics boom to market stardom. After soaring over 400% the past year, the AI darling collapsed in spectacular fashion, shedding more than 15% across six consecutive trading sessions and erasing a staggering $73 billion in market value.\nInvest in Gold\nThis stunning downturn handed short sellers a rare victory, generating over $1.6 billion in profits, even as these same traders had been nursing $4.5 billion in paper losses earlier in the year.\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nDear Broadcom Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for September 4\n-\nCEO Alex Karp Just Sold $60 Million in Palantir Stock. Should You Ditch PLTR Here Too?\nThe intensity of this bearish momentum has created unprecedented demand for tactical trading instruments. The Defiance Daily Target 2x Short PLTR ETF (PLTZ), has emerged as the go-to vehicle for investors seeking amplified exposure to Palantir's downside.\nWith cash-rich short sellers making headlines and ETF innovation hitting overdrive, could PLTZ be the next billion-dollar trade? Let’s find out.\nOverview of PLTZ\nThe Defiance Daily Target 2x Short PLTR ETF, hits the market with a very pointed focus: it aims to deliver -200% of Palantir Technologies’ daily share price moves. That means for every 1% Palantir drops in a day, PLTZ is designed to climb 2%; likewise, a 1% surge in Palantir can cut PLTZ's return by 2%.\nThe approach here is rooted in short-term, high-leverage exposure and not a “set and forget” affair, but a way to mirror and then amplify Palantir’s daily direction, always recalibrated at close. The strategy involves using swaps and synthetic positions, not by holding Palantir itself, but by tracking its moves through financial instruments meant to reset exposure every day.\nPLTZ comes from Defiance ETFs, a fund family known for pushing into the niche corners of the ETF universe. Since its inception on June 5, 2025, and first trade on June 6, the ETF has steadily grown its managed assets to about $27.6 million. The fund lists a $1.29% management fee, running above most traditional products but in line with similar leveraged ETFs.\nIts holdings are structured for one thing: precise, inverse exposure to Palantir, and the portfolio reflects this with swaps featuring the stock at their core, plus significant positions in cash and government obligations. The ETF’s synthetic Palantir swap forms the heart of the exposure at -199.91% of net assets, while cash and equivalents, listed at 282.15%, and a government obligations fund, First American Government Obligations Fund (FGXXX) (17.75%), balance the structure out.","content_hash":"e7b7ee41b68d5390934e7e3e0f768d73","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2741,"method_rank":0}

But in recent years, that role has shifted under the weight of litigation trends and the surge of nuclear verdicts that have redefined liability across the industry.\nMarsh, a leading insurance broker and risk advisor, is stepping in to provide freight brokers with a tailored insurance solution designed to address the heightened exposure they now face with BrokerSafe.\nFor decades, freight brokers operated under the assumption that liability largely rested with carriers, with insurance serving as a backstop for operational risks. That changed dramatically following the 2020 Miller v. C.H. Robinson case, which opened the door for plaintiffs to pursue brokers directly in negligence claims.\nJanelle Griffith, North American logistics practice leader at Marsh said in an interview with FreightWaves. “Historically, brokers weren’t responsible for anything outside of F4A safety. But after 2020, brokers were being pulled into litigation, and nuclear verdicts automatically started to rise.”\nThese verdicts, often exceeding $10 million, have upended traditional insurance practices and made brokers prime targets for plaintiff attorneys who view them as the deeper pockets in the supply chain. Griffith said. “Exposure in the past was minimal. Now it’s expanded, negligent hiring, carrier vetting, and other gray areas are being pushed into courtrooms.”\nThe result has been a wave of insurance challenges. Many insurance carriers in the market either reduced their appetite for liability policies or withdrew altogether, just as brokers were becoming more exposed.\nMarsh recognized that gap and developed BrokerSafe as a domestic insurance facility to give brokers coverage that reflects their true level of exposure. Unlike many policies traditionally written out of London, BrokerSafe’s structure is rooted in U.S. underwriting, providing brokers access to markets that had previously been reluctant to participate.\nAt its core, BrokerSafe is not about eliminating risk but about giving brokers tools to manage it. “What we do doesn’t make the exposure change,” Griffith said. “It’s how you protect yourself and mitigate against the exposure. We looked at the landscape, saw that brokers needed coverage, and brought together technology and relationships to create an insurance facility where underwriters are well-versed in freight brokerage.”\nTechnology plays a central role in BrokerSafe’s value proposition. By leveraging data transparency, Marsh has been able to help underwriters understand the nuances of broker operations. That visibility builds confidence and enables more comprehensive coverage.","content_hash":"ba71a853bec964034f4b4d0ad89b021c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2737,"method_rank":0}

(NYSE:CRM) is one of the Top Technology Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. On August 25, Monness analyst Brian White maintained a “Neutral” stance on the company’s stock, providing a “Hold” rating. The analyst’s rating is backed by a combination of factors, which include Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)’s strategic positioning in the broader AI sector and efforts to capitalize on the digital labor movement via initiatives such as Agentforce.\nPepsiCo has announced its plans to deploy Agentforce – the digital labor platform from Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) for bringing trusted, autonomous AI agents into the workflow. While Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) continues to make significant strides with innovations and acquisitions, its growth remains lackluster in the competitive and challenging macroeconomic environment, added the firm’s analyst. However, the company remains optimistic about its momentum as it capitalizes on the opportunities presented by agentic AI. Overall, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)’s performance demonstrates robust execution, thanks to the continued focus on innovation and operational excellence.\nOakmark Funds, advised by Harris Associates, released its Q2 2025 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a leading technology company that offers a collection of software products aimed at providing businesses with a full front office productivity suite. We believe Salesforce is a wonderful business going through a transformation into a profitable, shareholder-focused enterprise. Since management announced their renewed focus on operating discipline a couple years ago, Salesforce’s margins have increased substantially. In our view, there is further room to improve as the company leverages its unique position to help businesses deploy AI and continues to restructure its sales organization. Since exiting our position in Salesforce in December, the stock price has declined by over 30% despite continuing to report fundamental results that are in line with our expectations. We were pleased to buy the stock, but we first established our position using a put writing strategy to lower our entry price. We believed the puts were overvalued as they implied that Salesforce was among the most volatile large companies, which was completely at odds with our assessment of its business value.”\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of CRM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

One area where many Americans have monitored tariff impact is with automobiles. It’s understandable, as cars are a major purchase for most. One unfortunate side effect of Trump’s auto tariffs is they are driving up the costs of auto insurance.\nUp Next: Mark Cuban: Trump’s Tariffs Will Affect This Class of People the Most\nCheck Out: 10 Used Cars That Will Last Longer Than the Average New Vehicle\nInflationary pressures have made auto insurance increasingly expensive for Americans, according to Yahoo Finance. Worse yet, a recent report from Insurify revealed Trump’s tariffs could raise auto insurance rates 280% faster.\nBelow, we’ll explain just how that might happen, and why tariffs are at the center of expected rising insurance costs.\nTariffs Increase Vehicle Costs\nPurchasing a car is often the second most expensive purchase Americans make. Tariffs can increase that already high cost. Trump imposed a 25% on imported cars, but some modifications allow for no stacking of levies, and cars finished in America will qualify for some reimbursements, according to CNBC.\nCombined with aluminum and steel tariffs, this will cause auto insurance premiums to increase to $2,759 annually, on average, according to Insurify. This represents a 19% increase from 2024 — or increasing 280% faster. This assumes full coverage on the car in question. If it weren’t for the tariffs, Insurify reported that coverage would increase a mere $122 annually to $2,435, for an increase of 5%.\nWith new vehicles expected to rise in price by at least $6,000 for cars under $40,000, this makes buying a new car more painful.\nRead More: I Asked ChatGPT What the Point of Trump’s Tariffs Are\nHigher Repair Costs\nTrump’s tariffs don’t just impact the price you pay for the car; they also impact many of the car parts. Roughly 75% of what goes into making a car comes from international suppliers, according to The White House. Much of what goes into a car is made from steel or aluminum, so neither new nor used cars are immune.\nMost of these parts will incur some sort of levy. Americans will see higher repair costs and, in turn, increased auto insurance rates. “As a result of higher part costs, insurers will pay more for repair claims and eventually pass those costs on to consumers through higher insurance premiums,” according to Insurify.\nMore Expensive Claims\nTrump’s tariffs will likely have a direct impact on the pricing of cars. It’s not surprising that more expensive cars result in more expensive claims to repair those cars. Pricier cars can often be more expensive to repair, and someone has to pay for that increase in cost.","content_hash":"e04564945df74b2efa6e903685ad81a9","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2724,"method_rank":0}

The stock has slipped nearly 18% from its recent high of $190, a sharp move lower that raises questions about whether it’s time to buy the dip.\nEven with the recent pullback, Palantir remains the year’s best performer in the S&P 500 Index ($SPX), soaring more than 107% since January. Moreover, it has increased by over 415% in the past 12 months. However, such dramatic gains raise valuation concerns, and here Palantir stands out in ways that could prompt even the most bullish investors to pause.\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nDear Broadcom Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for September 4\n-\nCEO Alex Karp Just Sold $60 Million in Palantir Stock. Should You Ditch PLTR Here Too?\nPalantir Stock: The Valuation Concern\nPalantir’s price-sales ratio has skyrocketed to 133.2x, a level that not only dwarfs its peers in the artificial intelligence and software space, but also surpasses some of the largest and most profitable technology companies in the world. Snowflake (SNOW), UiPath (PATH), and C3.ai (AI), all prominent names in AI-driven software, trade at far more modest multiples of 17.9x, 4.1x, and 5.8x, respectively. Even the large tech giants with high profitability look inexpensive by comparison. For instance, Alphabet (GOOGL) stock trades at a P\/S ratio of 7.2x, Microsoft (MSFT) at 13.3x, and Nvidia(NVDA), despite its dominance in the AI hardware space, trades at 34x.\nThis stark contrast highlights the market’s lofty expectations for Palantir. Investors are effectively betting that the company will deliver explosive growth for years to come, justifying today’s price tag. So far, Palantir has given them reason to believe. Its government contracts remain robust, while its commercial business is expanding rapidly as more enterprises turn to AI-driven solutions.\nPalantir’s Strong Fundamentals Back the Rally\nFor instance, Palantir just delivered one of its strongest quarters to date, surpassing $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time. The momentum in its business is accelerating, with overall revenue climbing 48% year-over-year in the second quarter. This surge comes as demand for its AI Platform (AIP) remains strong and is driving growth in its customer base.\nEvery major metric of Palantir’s business remains solid, suggesting strong growth ahead. Palantir recorded its highest-ever bookings in Q2, with $2.3 billion in total contract value (TCV) and $684 million in annual contract value (ACV). Deal activity also remained robust, providing a solid platform for long-term growth. It closed 157 deals worth $1 million or more, including 66 worth at least $5 million and 42 exceeding $10 million.","content_hash":"5391f60d9114725f0d387976bf74b5ea","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2716,"method_rank":0}

The data is due on Sunday.\nThis trifecta of problems - pressure on China's exports, a property slump squeezing household spending and rising job uncertainty - is just China's headline concerns, economists say. Extreme weather and cash-strapped local authorities are also putting Beijing's ambitious 2025 growth target of \"around 5%\" in jeopardy.\nThe highest poll reading was 49.5, cited by more than half the respondents, while the Economist Intelligence Unit gave the lowest forecast of 49.0.\n\"The summer months tend to be the low point in the year, and this year there's additional pressure from extreme weather and production limitation,\" said Xu Tianchen, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\"Activity should improve in September and October.\"\nWhile July exports beat forecasts, the gain was supported by a low base and driven by a surge in shipments to Southeast Asia, as Chinese exporters scramble to grow market share there amid fears of losing access to the U.S., the world's top consumer market - a push some producers have called a \"mad rat race.\"\nEarlier this month, the U.S. and China extended their tariff truce for another 90 days, locking in place levies of 30% on Chinese imports and 10% Chinese duties on U.S. goods, but the uncertainty is eroding confidence on both sides of the Pacific.\nProfits at China's industrial firms fell for a third straight month in July, official data showed on Wednesday, highlighting how businesses are also struggling with subdued demand and persistent factory-gate deflation at home, keeping the pressure on Beijing to roll out more stimulus.\nPolicymakers have ramped up consumer subsidies, but a prolonged property slump is still crimping spending, with real estate a key store of household wealth.\nHouseholds' reluctance to take out mortgages was reflected in July bank lending data, which unexpectedly contracted for the first time in 20 years.\nAnd consumer spending could take a further hit if a recent ruling by China's top court banning firms and employees from skirting social insurance payments leads to job losses, with many companies and workers already struggling to make ends meet.

Now, under the terms of his contract, he fears that it could put his future at risk. But Dave Ramsey insists that's not true.\n“You have to look at who’s using this, saying, ‘Listen, if you guys are so corporate and stupid, that the only measure of financial wellness that you have is a FICO score … and you’re calling me financially irresponsible — you’re stupid,” Dave Ramsey said. “When you get up in their grill, they’re going to cave like a Walmart tent.”\nThe Missouri caller’s concerns raise a bigger question that matters for many workers: Could a credit score actually cost you your job?\nCan you get fired over a credit score?\nHere’s the nuance: employers or clients cannot access your actual FICO score, though they may request a version of your credit report. And that requires your written permission.\nThat said, some industries, especially finance, defense and government contracting, do tie employment eligibility to creditworthiness. Companies may use credit reports to evaluate “character” or “financial responsibility,” particularly for roles involving access to sensitive data or money, as in Ren's case.\nWhile rare, these reviews can influence hiring, contracting or retention in regulated fields. So technically, Ren’s client isn’t checking his score but rather his credit report shows closed accounts and a less active credit history, which they could still interpret negatively.\nWhy did his score drop after paying off debt?\nRen’s frustration comes from an ironic reality: Paying off loans can hurt your score in the short term.\nAccording to myFICO, closing a long-standing account, like an auto loan, reduces both your credit mix and your length of credit history, which make up 10% and 15% of your score.","content_hash":"c8b8f2771f654b957766fe0bc1d1d0c3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2707,"method_rank":0}

Store-based sales fell 1% while e-commerce — about a third of net sales — rose 3%.\n-\nOld Navy net sales rose 1% to $2.2 billion, with comps up 2%; Gap rose 1% to $772 million, with comps up 4%; Banana Republic fell 1% to $475 million, with comps up 4%; and Athleta fell 11% to $300 million, with comps down 9%.\n-\nGross margin contracted 140 basis points to 41.2%, and merchandise margin contracted 150 basis points. Net income rose nearly 5% to $216 million. Inventory was up 9%, mostly due to higher tariffs and the effort to import merchandise before duties increased.\nDive Insight:\nRichard Dickson, who arrived in August 2023 as CEO with Gap Inc. in the doldrums, touted the company’s progress on a call with analysts Thursday.\n“We still have plenty of work to do, because transformation of this scale takes time. However, it's clear we're now operating from a position of strength, one that's proving essential as we navigate an increasingly dynamic and complex environment,” he said. “Our strategic priorities define the framework that has enabled us to perform while we've been transforming over the last two years, first maintaining financial and operational rigor.”\nThis has become fundamental to the company’s operations, and showed up in Q2 with gross margin expansion of 360 basis points to 41.2% compared to two years ago, he also said.\nDickson also called out a return to cultural relevance, especially at Gap, which had long ceded its status by the time he arrived.\n“The Gap brand is building momentum, reclaiming its place in the cultural conversation with credibility,” he said. “We see a clear path forward for this brand, and are confident in our ability to build on this position of strength, fueling sustained growth for the brand over time.”\nGap Inc. hit a nerve about a week ago with its “Better in Denim” spot, featuring Katseye dancing to “Milkshake” in early aughts-inspired denim pieces. That was fueled in part by lingering controversy over American Eagle’s earlier denim ad featuring Sydney Sweeney, as well as dance moves that inspired TikTok users.\n\"Gap has been riding a wave of momentum from the flagship brand’s renewed cultural relevance, supported by a consistent showing by Old Navy and significant improvement in Banana Republic’s comp sales,” Emarketer Principal Analyst Sky Canaves said in emailed comments.","content_hash":"2c0d5bf27bfeb19134d5815c44a2210f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2684,"method_rank":0}

U.S. GDP grew at a 3.3% annual rate in Q2, topping the average economist forecast for growth of 3% in the period.

As of this writing, the stock is up 164% across 2025's trading.\nWhile Cramer's comments on the stock could come across as negative or ambivalent, they may have also had the effect of bringing more attention to the company. Additionally, many meme-stock traders seem to have a negative view on the Mad Money host's coverage in general -- and some intentionally make trades that are contrary to his positions. On the other hand, Opendoor stock has been prone to making big moves on little or no news recently -- so it's impossible to definitively state that the stock's recent feature on Cramer's show is a driving factor in its move today.\nShould you buy stock in Opendoor Technologies right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Opendoor Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Opendoor Technologies wasn’t one of them.

By some estimates, the Chancellor needs to raise as much as £50bn to get the finances back on track.\nCarsten Jung, from the IPPR, said the BoE money printing scheme used to buy £895bn of bonds – known as quantitative easing (QE) – was “bungled” at the taxpayers’ expense.\nThat is because the BoE pays the base rate of interest to high street banks on the reserves they hold at the central bank. Those reserves ballooned in the past 15 years because of QE.\nCashflows from the Bank of England to commercial banks were of little consequence when the base rate was as low as 0.1pc in the pandemic. But when the base rate shot up to 5.25pc, it became a major financial burden on the public sector.\nOn top of that, the Bank is selling bonds under QT for less than it paid to buy them under QE, making a loss.\nIt means a scheme which initially made a profit for the Bank - which was passed on to the Treasury - is now forecast to make a loss of more than £130bn, to be covered by the Government.\nMr Jung said: “What started as a programme to boost the economy is now a massive drain on taxpayer money. Public money is flowing straight into commercial banks’ coffers because of a flawed policy design.\n“While families struggle with rising costs, the government is effectively writing multi-billion-pound cheques to bank shareholders.\n“This is not how QE was meant to work – and no other major economy does it this way.”\nThe IPPR is highly influential in Labour circles. Carys Roberts, formerly the think tank’s executive director, is now a special adviser to Sir Keir Starmer.\nA raid on bank reserves held at the BoE has united Left and Right. Last year Reform UK called for the Bank to cease paying interest on reserves, arguing it could save as much as £35bn.\nAndrew Bailey has disputed this estimate, arguing the move would not be that lucrative.","content_hash":"42e7b53762f318d34a521cafe3dab6ed","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2634,"method_rank":0}

For comparison, the average Wall Street analyst estimate had called for adjusted per-share earnings of $0.41 on revenue of $2.98 billion.

That balance sheet strength has drawn institutional attention, with billionaire investor Peter Thiel taking a 9.1% stake in the company last month.\nThe endorsement, combined with ARK’s sustained buying, has fueled market speculation that BitMine could become a leading proxy for Ethereum exposure among traditional investors.\nThe timing of ARK’s latest purchase comes amid heightened volatility in both equities and crypto markets.\nEthereum itself has struggled to break higher in recent weeks after reaching an all-time high, but the strategic bet on BitMine reflects Wood’s long-term focus on decentralized finance as a driver of growth.\nSocial media reaction from traders and crypto enthusiasts has framed the move as a bullish sign, pointing to BitMine’s role as a key corporate holder of ether.","content_hash":"26f66751c1d3ae32bd7368e479083438","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2630,"method_rank":0}

And while it looked as though slightly underwhelming guidance for next quarter initially led to a sell-off, investors who took time to listen to management's comments and view the longer-term picture eventually sent the stock higher.\nCrowdStrike strikes again with a quarterly beat\nIn its fiscal second quarter, CrowdStrike delivered revenue growth of 21.4% to $1.17 billion, ahead of expectations, with adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings per share of $0.93, up just 5.7%, but also ahead of expectations.\nCrowdStrike is a high-performing, artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled cybersecurity disruptor that typically beats expectations; however, there was a bit of a post-earnings hiccup when the company only guided for $1.21 billion to $1.22 billion in revenue for the current quarter, which was a tad short of the $1.23 billion estimated by Wall Street analysts. Additionally, CrowdStrike announced a bolt-on acquisition of Onum, a real-time data telemetry company that CrowdStrike will add to its next-gen SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) products. While the acquisition could be a positive, it will likely mean either more dilution or cash used for the purchase. CrowdStrike didn't disclose a purchase price.\nWhile those details may have spurred a short sell-off given CrowdStrike's high valuation, commentary from CEO George Kurtz was very positive, with an emphasis on revenue and annualized recurring revenue (ARR) acceleration in the coming quarters. For instance, while net new ARR was over 20% last quarter, Kurtz sees new ARR accelerating to at least 40% year-over-year growth in the second half of the year.\nCrowdStrike is a thematic leader, but at a price\nNo doubt, customers are flocking to CrowdStrike, which built its cybersecurity software platform from the ground up as a data mining AI-inspired platform in which the data it generates consistently reinforces CrowdStrike's algorithms in a virtuous flywheel of constant improvement.

The EU introduced many import and export restrictions, leading to a 61% fall in exports to Russia and an 89% fall in imports from Russia between the first quarter of 2022 and the second quarter of 2025.\nAccording to Euronews research based on Eurostat data, trade in the second quarter of 2025 dropped to the lowest level since 2002, when records began. In the same quarter, the EU also recorded its first trade surplus with Russia in more than 20 years.\nSo, what are the main export and import flows in 2025? How has trade between the EU and Russia changed since the invasion of Ukraine? And how important is trade with Russia for the EU?\nEU trade with Russia\nAccording to Eurostat, in the second quarter of 2025 imports from Russia fell, while exports to Russia rose compared with the previous quarter. As a result, the EU’s trade balance with Russia, which had always shown a deficit, turned into a small surplus of €0.5 billion. Imports were worth €7 billion, while exports to Russia reached €7.5 billion, bringing total trade to €14.5 billion.\nThis represents an 82% drop in trade volume compared with the first quarter of 2022, when the Russian invasion began and trade stood at €81.9 billion. That quarter marked the third-highest level since records began in 2002, with the peak reached in the first quarter of 2013 at €82.9 billion.\nThe EU, together with the G7 countries and other like-minded partners, stopped treating Russia as 'a Most-Favoured-Nation' and implemented a fourth package of sanctions on 15 March 2022. This removed key trade benefits that Russia enjoyed as a World Trade Organization (WTO) member. Instead of raising import tariffs, the EU chose to act through sanctions, including bans and restrictions on both imports and exports of certain goods.\nRelated\n-\nEU Commission's US trade deal set for rocky reception in Parliament\n-\nWho really pays for what in the war on Ukraine? A tale of three burdens\nThe share of trade with Russia since the invasion of Ukraine\nUntil 24 February 2022, when it invaded Ukraine, Russia was one of the EU’s main trading partners. Since then, its role has diminished dramatically, as shown by the decline in its share of extra-EU trade rather than nominal figures alone.\nExtra-EU trade refers to transactions with all countries outside the EU.\nRussia’s share of extra-EU exports fell from 3.2% in the first quarter of 2022 to 1.2% in the second quarter of 2025. Over the same period, its share of extra-EU imports dropped from 9.3% to just 1.1%.

Nu sports a market capitalization of $71 billion, and in the past 24 months, its shares have jumped by nearly 200%.\nThere still might be more to get excited about the bank. After the market close on Aug. 27, this fintech stock trades at $14.64. Should you buy shares while they're below $15?\nStill a big opportunity ahead\nSince its founding in 2013, Nu has quickly become one of the largest digital banks on the planet. By leaning on technology to provide a great user experience and serving up various financial services, it has found rapid adoption. Revenue climbed 40% year over year in the second quarter (ended June 30). Nu added 4.1 million net new customers in the last three months, bringing its total to 122.7 million.\nThe growth thus far has been nothing short of excellent. However, investors would have a flawed view if they believed the gains were over. That couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, Nu appears to have a long runway for expansion ahead. Nu is established in its home country of Brazil, and it's making tremendous progress in Mexico and Colombia. In the future, the leadership team could enter new markets.\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates call for revenue to rise at a compound annual rate of 30.7% between 2024 and 2027. This is a stellar outlook that should add some bullishness to the story.\nNu operates in a developing region of the world. To be clear, this comes with risks, like geopolitical turmoil or macroeconomic volatility. But as internet and smartphone penetration increase, it creates a more favorable backdrop for the business to keep thriving.\nAdd in the fact that Latin America has a huge unbanked and underbanked population. As the economy grows here, incomes rise, and the need for more people to have financial services emerges, Nu is poised to be a much larger company five or 10 years down the road.\nAt a bigger scale, Nu's competitive position will be extremely difficult to disrupt. Established banks, such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, have developed wide economic moats that stem from cost advantages and switching costs. Nu could be well on its way to building these compelling traits.","content_hash":"003dfe172b0d917ea19b39271ed185b5","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2613,"method_rank":0}

The company stands out as one of the few pure-play quantum stocks available to investors, and it’s making waves with its innovative trapped-ion technology, an approach praised for its potential to scale qubits while minimizing error rates, two of the biggest hurdles in building commercially viable quantum computers.\nWith quantum breakthroughs seen as the next leap in computing power, IonQ’s unique position in the ecosystem has drawn plenty of attention from growth-focused investors. Analysts are also starting to take bold positions. Rosenblatt’s Kevin Garrigan maintains a Street-high price target of $70 for IonQ, highlighting the stock as a promising way to ride the quantum wave.\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nChina's AI Plans, Employment Data and Other Key Things to Watch this Week\n-\nNvidia Could Give This Under-the-Radar AI Stock a Major Boost\nHis bullish call reflects growing confidence in the company’s long-term roadmap, but with IonQ still far from that target, can the company’s technology and execution catch up with the market’s high hopes by 2025?\nAbout IonQ Stock\nIonQ is leading the charge in quantum innovation, drawing on over 20 years of academic research to bring trapped-ion quantum computing into practical use. Unlike other approaches, IonQ’s method leverages ionized atoms, enabling longer and more accurate computations with significantly fewer errors.\nThe company has quickly become a key player in the quantum race, with its Forte and Forte Enterprise systems already driving major performance gains for partners like Amazon (AMZN), AstraZeneca (AZN), and Nvidia (NVDA). With bold plans to scale up to 2 million qubits by 2030, IonQ aims to tackle complex challenges across various industries, from drug discovery to defense.\nValued at roughly $12.9 billion by market capitalization, IonQ has seen its stock surge an astonishing 509% over the past year, blowing past the broader S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX)15.5% gain in the same timeframe.\nWhat Do Analysts Think About IonQ Stock?\nWall Street’s confidence in IonQ is gaining momentum, with analysts growing increasingly bullish on its quantum potential. On July 29, Rosenblatt initiated coverage with a “Buy” rating and a Street-high $70 price target, calling IonQ a prime way to tap into what analysts describe as the “next era of computing.” Led by Kevin Garrigan, the analyst team believes the quantum market won’t be dominated by a single winner, and IonQ is firmly in the race to be one of the frontrunners.","content_hash":"758d0c3f40e97dd69717c6f5baf93bce","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2593,"method_rank":0}

The former two companies have also put an emphasis on global expansion into markets that still have duty-free provisions in place.\nWhile some Millennial and Gen Z favorites will have to grapple with the change, others see it as an opportunity.\nOn URBN’s earnings call Wednesday, CEO Dick Hayne said the end of the provision is likely to benefit the company’s core brand, Urban Outfitters.

Next month, investors will have to grapple with the latest government hiring report and two readings on inflation before the Federal Reserve makes its highly anticipated policy decision. In the background is President Donald Trump’s continued criticism of the central bank’s independence as he clamors for sharp rate cuts.\nBulls roll into September in a particularly precarious position, given the S&P 500’s 17% surge since early May. Valuations have hit 22 times projected earnings, levels associated with the end days of the dot-com bubble. Computer-driven traders, whose strategies ignore fundamentals to focus on trends, are near maximum allocation to US stocks. And hedge fund equity exposure hit the 80th percentile in recent days, leaving positioning extended, according to Barclays (BCS) strategists including Emmanuel Cau.\n“We’re in a very dangerous spot,” said Brandon Yarckin, chief operating officer of Universa Investments. “It’s a difficult thing to navigate this market by owning diversifiers like bonds or hedge funds instead of being fully invested in stocks.”\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) has fallen 56% of the time in September, by an average 1.17%, according to Bank of America Corp.’s Paul Ciana, who cited data going back to 1927. In the first year of a president’s term, the S&P 500 is down 58% of Septembers by an average of 1.62%.\nSelling pressure is likely to arise from pension funds and mutual funds, as they rebalance portfolios at the end of the quarter. The largest exchanged-traded fund that tracks the S&P 500 has gained almost 5% since the end of June, while a broad bond ETF has lost nearly 2%.

These 3 ETFs Flash Mixed Signals as Bitcoin, Ethereum Fall Off Highs.\nCryptocurrency is finally mainstream. Everyone from celebrities to the U.S. president are in the game. So are many, many investors and traders. Some are there for a quick flip, while others are committed to it as essentially an investment lifestyle.\nI’m not here to solve the crypto arguments, such as whether it will eventually be a true medium of exchange, a store of value, a fiat currency replacement, or the scam of the century. I just want to make money and not lose big along the way.\nInvest in Gold\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nDear Broadcom Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for September 4\n-\nCEO Alex Karp Just Sold $60 Million in Palantir Stock. Should You Ditch PLTR Here Too?\nBut crypto is a different animal. It trades differently, and 24\/7. It charts differently (to me, at least), as it is subject to reversals in either direction at any time, and seemingly for any reason. It is as much a supply-demand play as any other asset I know, even gold (GCZ25). And that makes it a nice trading vehicle. For me personally, it’s done in small sizes.\nOne reason for that is I’m a risk manager above all else. And Bitcoin (BTCUSD), the leading crypto asset, has a habit of dipping 20% with some frequency. In just the past 5 years, it has doubled in a flash, yet also spent nearly 3 years going nowhere. It’s experienced no shortage of volatility along the way.\nWhat Does Crypto Look Like Now?\nWhile crypto assets galore now exist to trade, my focus here will be on three ETFs, all from iShares, which help me track a trio of crypto areas: iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), and iShares Blockchain and Tech ETF (IBLC), which invests in stocks related to the cryptocurrency business.\nHere are the three of them, side by side. They have delivered different degrees of “awesome” in terms of return over the past 6 months. But that’s in the past. And like all past performances, there’s only one guarantee: that I can’t have it unless I already own it!\nSo let’s look at the charts and see if there’s any daylight between these. And, if they stand a good chance of continuing their torrid pace.\nStarting with Bitcoin, I see an unmistakable downtrend in progress. That could be temporary, part of one of those “pause that refreshes” moments. The 20-day and 50-day moving averages are now heading south, and the PPO at the bottom is just crossed below the 0 line. All conspire to make a “high risk versus reward” situation to me.","content_hash":"8e66286ca63e1ac0f1e4c40f8de4fa10","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2564,"method_rank":0}

One of the more prominent developers, clinical-stage biotech Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX), saw its share price rise by almost 4% on Thursday on the back of encouraging research about a certain property of such treatments.\nThe stock's rise was more than good enough to convincingly beat the 0.3% bump higher of the benchmark S&P 500 index on the day.\nUnexpected benefits\nNot only are obesity drugs effective in reducing body weight, it seems they have knock-on effects on certain health conditions, too -- which is one of the major reasons investors have been hot on companies selling or developing them.\nThursday morning, a report published on Fox News's website detailed a new study indicating that GLP-1 agonists (substances that mimic a hormone that produces a feeling of satiety after eating) can have a positive effect on a particularly bothersome skin condition. This is hidradenitis suppurativa, which is characterized by small lumps that develop under the skin.\nCiting research conducted by a group of French doctors and published in the JAMA Dermatology medical journal, the media outlet wrote that GLP-1 agonists appear to have general anti-inflammatory properties. At the very least it seems they might help in the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa; the researchers found that administration of GLP-1s were \"beneficial\" to the condition.\nDouble barreled\nViking's VK2735 is actually a dual agonist, as it targets not only the GLP-1 receptor but also a receptor known as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP).\nRegardless, since it's partially a GLP-1 agonist, it's likely, if this research is accurate, to benefit those with hidradenitis suppurativa. That would add significantly to its value if Viking manages to fully develop and ultimately commercialize the very promising drug.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Viking Therapeutics right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Viking Therapeutics, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Viking Therapeutics wasn’t one of them.

I was a college student studying accounting in the mid-1990s, and one of my projects was to decide if the Internet could become a viable platform for commerce. My group and I researched, ran the numbers, made the presentations and gave the answer that felt obvious: No, the Internet would not work.\nAt the time, we couldn’t imagine using a credit card online. Or buying shoes on a computer. Like many people then, we underestimated what would become the most important technological advancement of our lives. How wrong we were.\nIn the long run, though, my college experience would give me a deeper understanding of the forces of innovation. When I first encountered crypto in 2017, I saw parallels to the internet, including what I missed the first time. I saw a similar structure, incentives and also a sense of inevitability. That insight led me to found Pure Crypto, a digital asset investment firm which was the best-performing hedge fund-of-funds globally between 2018 and 2025.\nSince launching Pure Crypto, I’ve watched digital assets transform from a fringe experiment into a Wall Street-approved asset class. Despite this, I believe crypto is still in its early days. It sounds counterintuitive to call something “early” when it’s created trillions in value, but consider how few people own crypto — only about 6.8% of people globally at the end of 2024. For comparison, at the time of the dot-com crash, less than 7% of the world was online, and some of the Internet’s most transformative platforms hadn’t even arrived yet. Facebook didn’t exist until 2004.\nWhat that tells me is simple: When a transformative technology arrives, the window of opportunity is longer and bigger than it looks.\nHow I learned to take the long view of technology\nOne of the biggest shifts in my approach — and maybe the reason I didn’t misjudge crypto like I did the Internet — was learning to dig deeper. When I initially dismissed the Internet as a viable commercial platform, I didn’t understand the infrastructure. I looked at the surface — what seemed possible then — instead of understanding what might come next. With crypto, I’ve made an effort to be more tenaciously curious. I ask different questions now:\nWhat’s the architecture? What does this protocol actually enable? Is it solving a real-world problem or is it just noise? I’m not a computer scientist or developer, and I don’t pretend to be. But I’ve learned that understanding the fundamentals changes the way you see the space.","content_hash":"58cad9cb49ebddfcf79707fb39461419","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2562,"method_rank":0}

However, experts say this would risk reducing the Fed's credibility and ability to control inflation.\nIf President Donald Trump is successful in removing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, his appointees could control the central bank for years to come.\nTrump escalated his efforts to exert control over the nation's central bank this week when he said he was firing Cook, a member of the committee that sets the Fed's key interest rate, amid allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook sued to keep her position Thursday, claiming her dismissal was \"unprecedented and illegal.\"\nShould Trump prevail in the legal case, his nominees would have the power to deliver Trump the rate cuts he has demanded. Some experts have warned that the move could diminish the Fed's reputation for making decisions based on economics rather than politics, as well as hurt its ability to control inflation.\nTrump said he would soon control the board and implied that mortgage rates, which are influenced by the federal funds rate, would soon fall.\n\"We'll have a majority very shortly,\" Trump said Tuesday at a cabinet meeting. \"So that'll be great. Once we have a majority, housing is going to swing, and it's going to be great. People are paying too high an interest rate.\"\nThe Fed has held its key rate steady throughout 2025, which has led Trump to repeatedly lambaste Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term as chair expires next May.

NO MORE RATE CUTS\nEven if earnings momentum ebbs, banks should draw support as European Central Bank rate cuts near an end while the negative-rates era appears firmly in the past.\n\"People really underestimated the damage that zero and negative interest rates, that we had for a decade, did to European banks,\" said Morningstar's Scholtz.\nA recent European Parliament study found that European banks are especially sensitive to rates compared to U.S. peers, with NII making up 60% of net operating income.\nWhile rates have fallen from a peak of 4%, they are not expected to drop much below 2% as an EU-U.S. tariff deal eases economic uncertainty.\n\"We're almost in a sweet spot where banks are able to finally benefit from these deposit franchises that they have, but at the same time, you're not seeing that stress on the credit side,\" said MFS Investment portfolio manager Shanti Das Wermes.\n3. WINNERS, LOSERS\nA sign of confidence in banks' prospects of generating more shareholder value is a rise in the price-to-book ratio for the average lender in the STOXX Europe 600 Banks index, comparing a lender's market value with the value of its assets. It's risen to 1.12, after years of trading below one.","content_hash":"edb98e424ad9051a5df5021999dd4edb","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2551,"method_rank":0}

His recent statement that “$60 trillion in retirement funds want access to Bitcoin” underscores both the scale of traditional investment capital and his belief that digital assets can no longer be ignored in long-term financial planning. By framing the launch of Cardone Capital’s “real estate bitcoin hybrid funds” as a bridge between stability and innovation, Cardone highlights a central theme in his career: creating vehicles for investors to participate in opportunities that were previously difficult to access.\nCardone’s Quote and Its Implications\nCardone’s message stresses two key ideas: the massive pool of untapped retirement savings and the growing demand for exposure to digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTCUSD). He argues that retirement vehicles like IRAs and 401(k)s could benefit from diversification beyond traditional equities and bonds, combining the predictable cash flow of real estate with the volatility-driven potential of cryptocurrency. The assertion that retirees can enjoy “dependable growth” through real estate while gaining exposure to the “explosive potential of Bitcoin” reflects his view that both asset classes offer complementary strengths.\nMore News from Barchart\nContext Behind the Statement\nCardone’s reputation was built on real estate, where his company, Cardone Capital, manages billions of dollars in multifamily properties across the United States. His rise from modest beginnings to a leading voice in real estate investment has given him credibility in markets traditionally associated with stability and long-term value. By pairing that experience with an embrace of Bitcoin, he is signaling confidence in cryptocurrency as a legitimate component of modern wealth strategies rather than a speculative trend.\nThis approach reflects a broader shift in financial markets. Institutional interest in Bitcoin has grown significantly in recent years, with pension funds, hedge funds, and large asset managers exploring ways to integrate digital currencies into their portfolios. Cardone’s framing of a hybrid fund recognizes both the risk aversion of retirement investors and the inevitability of change as digital assets move further into the mainstream.","content_hash":"b91b7184184294906cb2aa1b207e141d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2542,"method_rank":0}

Although the company posted second quarter of fiscal 2026 results that topped analyst estimates, it signaled that it remains vulnerable to the tariffs being imposed by the Trump administration.\nAs a result, its shares lost nearly 4% of their value that trading session, while the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) inched up by 0.3%.\nThinking about tariffs\nBest Buy's revenue for the period was slightly under $9.44 billion, which was up from the nearly $9.29 billion in the same quarter of fiscal 2025.

The company offers a secure and user-friendly platform to trade digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTCUSD) and Ethereum (ETHUSD). Coinbase was one of the first crypto trading platforms to go public. The company has played a role in making digital currencies mainstream. It serves millions of users worldwide. With a market cap of $80 billion, the company aims to build a more accessible financial system.\nThis year, cryptocurrencies have been experiencing a rise, with Bitcoin gaining 15.4% year-to-date (YTD). This was driven by progress on cryptocurrency legislation and the adoption of digital currencies by financial institutions. For instance, President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law on July 18, creating a new framework for stablecoin regulation.\nAs a part of a partnership with Circle Internet Group (CRCL), a non-bank operator of the stablecoin USDC, Coinbase generates a considerable amount of revenue from the stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. This new legislation ensures that stablecoin revenue continues to flow in for Coinbase.\nCoinbase was also lauded for establishing a European crypto hub in Luxembourg under the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework. This milestone enables the company to offer its cryptocurrency products and services to 450 million people across all 27 member states of the European Union (EU).\nA Look Inside Coinbase’s Q2 Results\nCoinbase reported $1.5 billion in total revenue for Q2 2025, down 26% quarter-over-quarter. Transaction revenue dropped 39% to $764 million, and subscription and services revenue decreased 6% to $656 million.","content_hash":"9e357d703541febaa5bdee8d744707bd","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2476,"method_rank":0}

(NASDAQ:AAPL) and OpenAI’s exclusive setup has effectively locked up markets to maintain monopolistic power, mirroring concerns raised by regulators and the U.S. Department of Justice in ongoing antitrust actions against Apple.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has already drawn regulatory scrutiny worldwide for how it runs the App Store, most notably during its extended clash with Epic Games. Earlier this year, the U.S. government filed a separate lawsuit accusing the company of using its dominance in app distribution to block competition and slow the rise of so-called “super apps.”\nEven with the latest legal challenges, investor sentiment has not wavered much. On August 26, Goldman Sachs reiterated its Buy rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) with a $266 target price, pointing to catalysts such as design changes expected in the iPhone 17, potential adjustments in pricing, and stronger carrier-led promotions.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) designs, manufactures, and markets innovative products, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. The company also offers a range of software and services, such as the iOS and macOS operating systems, iCloud, advertising, payment services, Apple Music, and the App Store.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

That was a bit of distance up from his preceding $305. In making that change he maintained his outperform (buy, in other words) recommendation on the shares.\nIt's no coincidence that Schafer's updated take came one week before the company is scheduled to post its third-quarter results. His new analysis addressed both that quarter and the following frame, according to reports, with Schafer predicting that both will be impressive given the monster appetite for artificial intelligence (AI) solutions.\nOne of Broadcom's major appeals these days is its expertise in application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), essentially custom chips for advanced functionalities like AI. Schafer pointed out that the company is a leader in this product category.\nLooking good next to the big peer\nOn Thursday, Broadcom also benefited from the fact that it is not Nvidia.

That’s despite words of caution from Chinese state media and moves by some brokerages and fund managers to cool things down.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nBullish investors are expressing confidence that authorities will keep sentiment supported before the Sept. 3 military parade, which is set to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. China has a history of propping up its stock market ahead of major political events to project an image of stability. Bears, meanwhile, are pointing to overstretched technical indicators and high margin-financing levels.\n“Animal spirits have burst out in China’s market, with traders piling into everything from chips to Labubu,” said Hebe Chen, an analyst at Vantage Markets in Melbourne. “The upcoming parade is fanning the frenzy, acting as a psychological safety net much like Chinese New Year or National Day, when authorities are expected to keep skies — and sentiment — clear.”\nThe relentless surge has also divided opinion among Wall Street strategists. Those at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised their CSI 300 target to flag a potential upside of about 10% over 12 months. They cited supportive valuations and favorable market positioning. A team at Morgan Stanley pointed to early signs of overheating, cautioning improving corporate fundamentals and stronger policy support are needed to sustain the rally.\n“Normally, when we see divergent views we’re approaching a top. I think we may see a bit more market euphoria driven by a positive sentiment, but I don’t think it’s warranted in the longer term,” said Nick Twidale, chief analyst at ATFX Global Markets. “Investor appetite is still relatively strong but it could now turn swiftly and with it the market.”\nStill mired in deflation and trade tensions, the stock boom this month that has added $1.3 trillion in onshore market’s value has caught many by surprise and spurred questions on the durability of the rally.

The yield is about three times that on 10-year JGBs, according to Bloomberg calculations.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nThe latest issuance comes as SoftBank and its founder Masayoshi Son push ahead with the $500 billion Stargate artificial intelligence initiative. The program is fueling record funding needs, with SoftBank’s domestic bond sales already at ¥820 billion this fiscal year, the most among Japanese firms. That jumbo supply has pushed up borrowing costs, reflected in the record coupon of its five-year debt.\nSo-called hybrid bonds are debt securities that have some features similar to equity. SoftBank’s hybrid bonds have an optional interest payment deferral provision and are subordinated to senior debt. The company expects credit rating firms to classify about half of the principal as equity.\nThe ¥200 billion issuance was SoftBank’s largest for domestic institutional investors. Final demand reached ¥270 billion, Daiwa said. The company initially planned to raise about ¥100 billion, but increased the size to ¥150 billion and ultimately to ¥200 billion.\nSupply of subordinated bonds in Japan is “limited” and their “high yields were appealing,” said Rina Suzuki, vice president in debt syndication at Daiwa. SoftBank’s solid earnings and high share price also acted as a “plus” in attracting investors, she added.\n“Interest rates are still on an upward trend and amid expectations of further increases, they likely moved to secure funds without delay despite wider spreads,” said Taketoshi Tsuchiya, chief executive officer at Tsuchiya Asset Management Co.

Colt does not produce it itself at this point but may aim to step into the business in future, the company said.\n\"The acquisition ... fits into our strategy of expanding the group's activities into medium and large-calibre ammunition while strengthening our position in a critical element of our supply chain,\" Colt Chairman Jan Drahota said in a statement.\n\"We intend to continue the vertical integration of ammunition manufacturing, thereby contributing to the strategic independence and self-sufficiency of the Czech Republic and NATO countries in defence supplies.\"\nSynthesia Nitrocellulose is among the top three energetic nitrocellulose producers in Europe and North America, with a 6,000 metric ton capacity and an expansion to 7,000 tons underway, Colt said.\nThe transaction gives Synthesia Nitrocellulose an enterprise value of 22 billion crowns, or about 8.2 times expected 2025 core profit, Colt said.\nIn the first stage, Colt will take a 51% stake in a cash-and-shares deal, pending regulatory approvals expected by the end of the first quarter of 2026, it said.\nThe initial cash payment will be 5.5 billion crowns, with stock accounting for about 40% of the first stage of the deal. This will make Synthesia owner Kaprain the third largest shareholder in Colt with between 5% and 10%, Colt said.\nColt and Kaprain have options to buy and sell the remaining 49% stake, respectively.\nColt said it may issue bonds in the fourth quarter to help finance the deal, which also includes Synthesia's power production business.\nColt shares were up 0.14% at 1000 GMT, against a 0.4% drop in the Prague PX index.\n($1 = 20.9570 Czech crowns)\n(Reporting by Jan Lopatka.

It is best known for its vast online marketplace, offering millions of products across various categories, including electronics, apparel, home goods, and groceries. Services like Amazon Prime provide fast delivery, streaming content, and exclusive deals.

The move could mark a major upgrade for Apple’s voice assistant as it seeks to catch up in the generative AI race. The goal is to create a more capable foundation for a new Siri, with a potential debut as early as 2026.\nApple is conducting an internal “bake-off” to compare its own AI model, code-named Linwood, with external models, including Google’s Gemini, code-named Glenwood. No final decision has been made on whether to use an external partner or stick with Apple’s in-house model, with a decision expected in the coming weeks. Earlier in the year, the company held discussions with OpenAI and Anthropic to explore using their AI models for this task. However, negotiations stalled due to high fees, prompting the current talks with Google.\nApple’s software engineering chief, Craig Federighi, described the Siri project as a “second-generation” architecture, stating, “This has put us in a position to not just deliver what we announced, but to deliver a much bigger upgrade than that we envisioned,” emphasizing an “end-to-end revamp” for advanced personalization features.\nApple Inc.

COST stock has declined nearly 6.7% over the past three months, notably underperforming the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLP) 1.9% dip during the same time frame.\nHowever, over the long term, Costco has notably outperformed the consumer staples sector.

Moreover, the stock has also remained mostly below its 50-day moving average since mid-June.\nCostco Wholesale’s stock prices gained 3.1% in the trading session following the release of its better-than-expected Q3 results on May 29.

Further, its EPS for the quarter surged 13.2% year-over-year to $4.28, exceeding the consensus estimates by 71 bps.\nWhile Costco’s financials have remained impressive in recent quarters, the company faces a serious threat of macro slowdown. The consumer spending in the US has substantially slowed down in recent months, and the job market has also remained pale, alongside the new tariffs can further dampen prospects for the discount retail industry.","content_hash":"1c8b9a6f8b57072adcd30a34ee9abfc5","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2170,"method_rank":0}

Zinsner said he expects that warrant to expire.\n“I think from the government’s perspective, they were aligned with that; they didn’t want to see us take the business and spin it off or sell it to somebody,” he said.\nZinsner added that the company received $5.7 billion in cash on Wednesday, as a result of last week’s deal, according to Reuters. (That cash comes from the remaining grants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act.)\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters today that the deal was still being ironed out.\nIntel declined to comment on the deal beyond Zinsner’s remarks.\nThis deal structure is clearly a testament to the Trump administration’s desire to bring more chip manufacturing to the United States as many players in the industry turn to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s offshore manufacturing instead.\nBut this warrant also forces Intel to keep a business unit that is losing money. Intel Foundry reported an operating income loss of $3.1 billion during the second quarter and has been a source of strife for the semiconductor business.\nThere have been calls from analysts, board members, and investors alike to spin out the struggling foundry unit, which looked like it might actually happen last fall, before Intel Foundry’s architect, former CEO Pat Gelsinger, retired suddenly in December.","content_hash":"b7f34cd412cc14738380d79c5acca5cb","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2155,"method_rank":0}

You will earn more money on top of your money in savings without having to do anything. Right now, a high-yield savings account can earn you over 4% interest, which is a good return and could even increase as federal rates rise. At 4%, if you save $10,000 in a year, you’ll earn an extra $400.\nCheck Out: 3 Best Ways to Prioritize Your Savings Goals\nPay Attention to Credit Card Rates\nIf you carry credit card debt, you might see interest rates or required minimum payments go up. That’s why it’s important to prioritize paying off this debt as fast as you can, so you’re not stuck paying an ever increasing amount.\nIt may be good to pay off the credit card with the highest interest rate first and then go in descending order from there.\nKeep an Eye on Your Investments\nThe good thing about having money in savings is that it’s a sure thing. If you don’t spend what’s in the account, it will still be there in a few months. With interest, you’ll probably even have a little more than you started with. On the flip side, there is more risk investing money in stocks.\nWhile investing is still a good bet over the long term, when interest rates are higher, things like high-yield savings accounts can be another attractive option.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: I Asked ChatGPT How Rising Interest Rates Affect My Savings","content_hash":"611b073183213b8f821d5ae8a28cd972","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2119,"method_rank":0}

Later that month, it said that it was \"working with urgency\" to evaluate strategic options for some of its brands.\nKraft Heinz is betting that two separate units would worth, in total, more than the company's roughly $33 billion market value, the report added, noting that plans and timing could still change at the last minute.\nThe split would leave the company with products such as its namesake Heinz ketchup and Dijon mustard brand Grey Poupon, according to the Journal.\nKraft Heinz did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\nThe company was formed in 2015 after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital combined the former Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz, which they bought in 2013. Berkshire Hathaway left Kraft's board in May.\nThe Heinz ketchup maker, in late July, reported a quarterly results beat, helped by resilient demand for its pantry staples and condiments in the United States.\nShares of the company were up 2% in afternoon trading.\n(Reporting by Neil J Kanatt in Bengaluru; Editing by Alan Barona)","content_hash":"be023afa1f1c6d1f848332d6b1614f8a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":1612,"method_rank":0}
