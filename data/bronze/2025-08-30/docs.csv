In the U.K., a new piece of legislation called the Online Safety Act imposes a duty of care on tech companies to protect children from age-inappropriate material, hate speech, bullying, fraud, and child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Companies can face fines as high as 10% of their global annual revenue for breaches.
Further afield, landmark regulations aimed at keeping kids safer online are swiftly making their way through the U.S. Congress. One bill, known as the Kids Online Safety Act, would make social media platforms liable for preventing their products from harming children — similar to the Online Safety Act in the U.K.
This push from regulators is increasingly causing something of a rethink at several major tech players. Pornhub and other online pornography giants are blocking all users from accessing their sites unless they go through an age verification system.
Porn sites haven't been alone in taking action to verify users ages, though. Spotify, Reddit and X have all implemented age assurance systems to prevent children from being exposed to sexually explicit or inappropriate materials.
Such regulatory measures have been met with criticisms from the tech industry — not least due to concerns that they may infringe internet users' privacy.
Digital ID tech flourishing
At the heart of all these age verification measures is one company: Yoti.
Yoti produces technology that captures selfies and uses artificial intelligence to verify someone's age based on their facial features. The firm says its AI algorithm, which has been trained on millions of faces, can estimate the age of 13 to 24-year-olds within two years of accuracy.
The firm has previously partnered with the U.K.'s Post Office and is hoping to capitalize on the broader push for government-issued digital ID cards in the U.K. Yoti is not alone in the identity verification software space — other players include Entrust, Persona and iProov. However, the company has been the most prominent provider of age assurance services under the new U.K. regime.
""There is a race on for child safety technology and service providers to earn trust and confidence,"" Pete Kenyon, a partner at law firm Cripps, told CNBC. ""The new requirements have undoubtedly created a new marketplace and providers are scrambling to make their mark.""
Yet the rise of digital identification methods has also led to concerns over privacy infringements and possible data breaches.
""Substantial privacy issues arise with this technology being used,"" said Kenyon. ""Trust is key and will only be earned by the use of stringent and effective technical and governance procedures adopted in order to keep personal data safe.""
Rani Govender, policy manager for child safety online at British child protection charity NSPCC, said that the technology ""already exists"" to authenticate users without compromising their privacy.
""Tech companies must make deliberate, ethical choices by choosing solutions that protect children from harm without compromising the privacy of users,"" she told CNBC. ""The best technology doesn't just tick boxes; it builds trust.""
Child-safe smartphones
The wave of new tech emerging to prevent children from being exposed to online harms isn't just limited to software.
Earlier this month, Finnish phone maker HMD Global launched a new smartphone called the Fusion X1, which uses AI to stop kids from filming or sharing nude content or viewing sexually explicit images from the camera, screen and across all apps.
The phone uses technology developed by SafeToNet, a British cybersecurity firm focused on child safety.
""We believe more needs to be done in this space,"" James Robinson, vice president of family vertical at HMD, told CNBC. He stressed that HMD came up with the concept for children's devices prior to the Online Safety Act entering into force, but noted it was ""great to see the government taking greater steps.""
The release of HMD's child-friendly phone follows heightened momentum in the ""smartphone-free"" movement, which encourages parents to avoid letting their children own a smartphone.
Going forward, the NSPCC's Govender says that child safety will become a significant priority for digital behemoths such as Google and Meta.
The tech giants have for years been accused of worsening mental health in children and teens due to the rise of online bullying and social media addiction. They in return argue they've taken steps to address these issues through increased parental controls and privacy features.
""For years, tech giants have stood by while harmful and illegal content spread across their platforms, leaving young people exposed and vulnerable,"" she told CNBC. ""That era of neglect must end.""",ba175e0f1d93ffb80be58c6b4087442f,trafilatura

S . ,2025-08-30 12:45:00+00:00,gdelt_cnbc_com,cnbc.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Executive Chef Vikas Khanna has plated hundreds of thousands of dinners over the past 20 years — and he's seen firsthand just how much Indian cuisine has evolved in the U.S.
Khanna, a world-renowned Indian restaurateur, created Junoon, his high-end Indian restaurant in New York City, more than a decade ago to wade deeper into sophisticated Indian dining, ultimately earning a Michelin star for the restaurant — one of the first Indian restaurants to earn the distinction.
As an immigrant in a post-9/11 America, Khanna said his bosses early in his career had been hesitant to branch out and experiment deeper with the broad canvas of Indian cuisine. Instead, he stuck to what he knew worked for the American palette: stereotypical menus and flavors like butter chicken and tikka masala.
But when American chef Anthony Bourdain visited Junoon for the first time, Khanna said he got the wakeup call of his career.
""He said, 'I don't understand why you guys want to camouflage your food to please the Western world,'"" Khanna told CNBC. ""He was saying, 'You need to patronize the cuisine.' And that became the foundation of Bungalow in many ways.""
Bungalow, Khanna's next and highly popular venture in New York, is one of a growing number of Indian upscale and fine-dining restaurants popping up in the U.S. What was once takeout menus and buffets, Khanna said, has transformed into a business segment aiming to rival that of Italian and French cuisine and is garnering growing interest by the day.
According to Jimmy Rizvi, Khanna's business partner at Bungalow, reservations for the restaurant sell out within 30 to 90 seconds of going live, with nightly waitlists averaging more than 1,000 people. The restaurant opened less than two years ago but consistently serves 300 to 400 dinners each night, becoming a top 10 restaurant in New York City on reservations platform Resy, Rizvi said.
""I definitely think that there's a knowledge base that's increasing; there's more awareness with Indian food,"" Rizvi, who also owns the restaurant Gupshup, told CNBC. ""And there's different cuisines within the Indian cuisine … that people are getting aware about.""
Tracking the rise
Khanna, who has been in the American restaurant scene for more than two decades, said he's seen the entire landscape shift from ""cheap food and curry houses"" to sophisticated sit-down establishments.
Fine dining overall has seen a significant upswing over the past few years, Circana foodservice analyst David Portalatin told CNBC, as a post-pandemic appetite for a dining experience beyond just food has seen a boom.
Despite macroeconomic pressure with inflation and a pullback in consumer spending, Portalatin said customer visits to fine dining restaurants in July were up 5% year-over-year.
""One of the bright spots across the restaurant landscape right now is fine dining,"" he said. ""It's evidence that the American consumer is once again desiring these unique and differentiated experiences outside the home.""
Along with that, Portalatin said younger consumers, like Generation Z and millennials, have a growing interest in global dishes with their ""quest for flavors."" That opens the door for exploring cuisines like Indian food.
According to data from market research firm Datassential, new Indian restaurant openings in December 2024 hit 115, up from just 54 in September 2018. Currently, the firm counts 154 upscale Indian dining restaurants in the U.S. compared with 101 in January 2018.
Resy CEO Pablo Rivero told CNBC that he's also seen demand for high-end Indian restaurants widen over the past few years.
""Modern Indian restaurants are redefining the category with ambitious menus and inventive formats — and diner demand for these elevated experiences shows no signs of slowing down,"" Rivero said. ""It's a clear sign that diners are eager to explore experience-driven, innovative expressions of Indian cuisine at the highest level.""
And while growing American interest in global cuisines has taken off, the Indian American population has also mirrored that growth. According to the Pew Research Center, the Indian population in the U.S. has increased by roughly 3.1 million, growing about 174% since 2000.
That population has also seen a rise in affluence, making a high median household income of more than $151,000 in 2023, compared with just a median of over $105,000 for Asian American households overall, according to Pew.
Growing investor interest
As reservations at Indian restaurants begin to sell out even faster, investors are also looking to secure a seat at the table.
Just this month, popular U.K. Indian restaurant chain Dishoom gained private equity backing as it prepares to scale to the U.S. next year.
L Catterton, backed by LVMH, announced it was acquiring a minority stake for an undisclosed amount in Dishoom, marking the restaurant group's first outside investment. The firm adds Dishoom to its growing slate of restaurant investments, including Japanese Kobe beef chain Kisshokichi and Spanish casual dining brand Goiko.
The new deal reportedly values the restaurant at roughly $400 million. L Catterton and Dishoom did not respond to CNBC's requests for comment.
Roni Mazumdar, with the James Beard Award-winning Indian restaurant Semma, said he's seen a direct increase in investor interest as upscale Indian restaurants have boomed over the past few years.
Unapologetic Foods — the company behind many popular New York restaurants including Semma, Dhamaka, Adda and more — is having ""continuous conversations"" with outside investors, Mazumdar told CNBC, but even having those talks marks a significant change from when the group first entered the restaurant scene.
""I don't think anyone saw Indian cuisine as a viable option until now,"" Mazumdar said. ""There are folks who we have consistent dialogues with who I don't think five years ago would have even thought about the idea of, 'Oh, it could be an interesting business model to look at.'""
Mazumdar said the landscape is ""shifting rapidly"" as more investors take notice.
""I wouldn't call this a trend,"" he added. ""To take one of the oldest cuisines in the world – I think it's an inevitability. It's a matter of time.""
Emphasizing regional specificity
The Indian Restaurant Association of America identified hyper-regional flavors as one of its top 2025 Indian restaurant trends as chefs dig into the hundreds of local cuisines that dot the subcontinent.
Each of the restaurants from Mazumdar and Unapologetic Foods Chef Chintan Pandya, including Semma, emphasizes regional cuisines, rather than the typical northwestern Indian menus of decades past.
""I think we see a very interesting pattern where there's a sense of curiosity towards finding out what a community is about through the lens of food,"" Mazumdar said. ""And I don't think 20 years ago that was the case.""
Semma, for example, which was ranked No. 1 on The New York Times' 2025 best restaurants list, explores the cuisine of South India, specifically the state of Tamil Nadu.
""I think one of the glorifying reasons that Semma is doing insanely great or something path-breaking is because it touches that nerve of Indian food which is cooked in India,"" Pandya said. ""That's the entire belief, or the standard, or the vision of our company, where we will touch and cook the actual Indian food which we ourselves love to eat.""
Avtar Walia, the owner of Tamarind in Tribeca, has been in the American restaurant scene for decades. When he first immigrated to America in the '70s, he couldn't figure out why Indian restaurants weren't at the same level as Italian and French restaurants.
By adding in more regional dishes and classic Indian street food, Walia said he began to see Indian restaurants — including his own eateries — change from typical buffets to sleek, elegant dining.
""From the last 47 years, I still follow the same pattern. Every month, month and a half, I change my lunch menu,"" Walia said. ""We take one of the regions … so that people can try different dishes, authentic dishes, and they don't have to go anywhere else. And this worked very well for me.""
Walia estimated that nearly 95% of his clientele are regulars, with his restaurant becoming a staple for Wall Street business meetings.
And for Khanna over at Bungalow, the lines outside the restaurant just keep getting longer.
His rattan chairs have seated famed Indian celebrities like members of India's billionaire Ambani family and Bollywood stars, as well as American bigwigs like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who visited the restaurant last year.
""When he came, he kept saying, 'I know why every Indian in Seattle is on the phones at 8 a.m. PT to snag a reservation, because for them, this is not just visiting a restaurant — it's a pilgrimage back home,'"" Khanna said. ""And that really stayed with me.""",5b65af6639ee5cdbdccf4b035343c3e1,trafilatura

In mid-August, I had an appointment at a bridal boutique in New York City.
My goal for the appointment was to narrow down the dress options from five to two. I would then return to the store with my mother in late September to make the official decision with her. (She already had her flights booked for that weekend).
More from Personal Finance:

How to use credit cards to pay for your wedding
I explained all of this to the sales associate, but when I told her my wedding date, she gave me a concerned look: ""That's very soon,"" she said.
I had no idea that when you buy your dress in relation to your wedding date can affect its pricing. But it's a great example of the kind of research and decision-making that goes into planning a wedding, especially if you're looking to stick to a budget.
Here's what I would have done differently when it came to my big purchase, and what experts recommend.
The earlier you start shopping, the better
During the appointment, the sales associate explained that if I waited until September to purchase the gown during my mother's visit, I would incur so-called ""rush fees,"" an added cost to make sure the dress arrived on time.
Rush fees depend on what exactly you're rushing and how close you are to the wedding date, said Lauren Kay, executive editor at The Knot, a wedding site. In my case, rush fees would have been approximately $500, the sales associate said.
That would have represented 20% of my dress budget.
Brides should typically start shopping for a wedding dress about 12 months out from their wedding, according to The Knot. At that point, come up with a budget and research styles you like.
About eight to 10 months out, you should purchase the dress, which involves signing a contract and putting down a deposit, according to the bridal site.
""Purchasing your dress about nine months ahead of your wedding date gives you a nice cushion,"" said Kay.
I had somewhat followed that timeline: After I got engaged in March, I began to browse social media and bridal boutique websites for dresses I liked. I narrowed down my budget and thought about how much I was comfortable spending.
But at that point, my fiance and I did not have a venue nor a wedding date, so I held off from making an official purchase.
Fast forward to August. We've selected the venue and have sent the save-the-dates. By the time I had my dress appointment, the wedding was about nine months away.
The silver lining was that I was still on time, even if just barely, and I could avoid the rush fees. I had to consider the cost as my budget for the dress was roughly $2,500.
Had I better understood that timing, I'd have booked my mom to come in much earlier.
Across the country, the average cost for a wedding dress is about $2,000, according to The Knot's 2025 Real Weddings Study, which surveyed about 17,000 couples in the U.S. who got married the year before.
To avoid the added cost, I decided I would make the call on the dress at the end of the appointment. I explained the situation to my mom, and luckily, she understood. The sales associate and I video-called her on and off during the appointment as I tried on different dresses.
Then came the veils.
Instead of a 'dress budget,' consider an 'attire budget'
In most instances, experts say, brides are not required to pay the full price of a dress immediately.
Instead, bridal stores require an upfront deposit to order the dress, which can range from 30% to 50% of the total cost, according to the Knot. The remaining balance is due at the time of pickup.
In my case, I was required to pay 65% of the total cost up front.
If you try on veils or other accessories during your appointment, and ultimately pick one, remember that the item's price will be included in the total balance, thus making your down payment higher.
In my case, I wish I had remembered this detail in the moment. Looking back, I would have asked about the veil's cost as I tried it on, rather than finding out at the point of the contract.
No matter when in the process you buy accessories like a veil or shoes, experts say it's important to factor them into your overall budget. While veils can cost about $100 to $600, the more intricate details they have, the more expensive they can be, according to The Knot.
Therefore, instead of a ""dress budget,"" brides may want to consider an ""attire budget,"" said Kay. Beyond the dress, factor in a veil or other headpieces, jewelry and shoes, as well as related costs like alterations.
""That's something that can often be forgotten and that can add a significant cost to the dress,"" she said.
While alteration costs can vary depending on what your dress needs, some places require a flat fee. With some preparation, you could research different alternatives to the bridal shop alterations.",64416ff85768bd42713ded8c36213fbf,trafilatura

Dell reported second-quarter results on Thursday that surpassed analyst estimates, but its outlook for the current quarter soured investor sentiment and kept shares under pressure. Third-quarter earnings are estimated to be $2.45 per share, 10 cents shy of the $2.55 per share LSEG estimate. DELL 5D mountain Dell Technologies stock this week. Shares of Dell closed down 8.9% on Friday. But analysts think the pullback is overdone and that Dell's potential growth trajectory can outweigh the near-term concerns thanks to artificial intelligence. Here's a look at what analysts said after Dell's earnings. Bank of America calls Dell an 'AI server juggernaut' Analyst Wamsi Mohan raised his price target to $167 from $165 and reiterated a buy rating on the stock. That's nearly 37% above where the stock is trading. ""We remain bullish on shares of DELL where we expect long term EPS growth of 15% over the next five years supported by strong growth in AI servers,"" the analyst said. ""The qtr and FY guide re-affirmed our confidence in Dell continuing to drive upside to AI server consensus rev ests."" JPMorgan reiterates overweight rating The firm's $145 price target implies about 19% upside from Friday's close of $122.15. ""We rate shares of DELL Overweight as we are more positively inclined toward the AI-driven compute investment cycle, which should benefit branded server companies, even as the drivers for the remaining businesses are more mixed being subject to the macro backdrop,"" analyst Samik Chatterjee said. ""While DELL is unlikely to be perceived as a primary beneficiary of an AI investment cycle, we expect all server companies to benefit in relation to sale of higher-end servers with ASP [application service provider] and (operating) margin upside,"" the analyst added. Goldman Sachs maintains buy rating Analyst Michael Ng's $150 price target implies about 23% upside. ""The company's AI pipeline continues to represent multiples of its backlog and represents a mix of Blackwell and older chip generations. ISG [infrastructure solutions group] margins missed in the quarter (8.8% v. GS/consensus 9.6%/9.4%), in part due to higher mix of lower-margin AI server revenue, competitive pricing, as well as one-time costs incurred in F2Q26 associated with supply chain resiliency and expediting GB200 deployments,"" Ng said. Morgan Stanley reiterates overweight rating The firm's $144 price target calls for about 18% upside. ""[W]e'd still characterize the quarter as illustrating progress, with AI servers the clear standout, and DELL highlighting emerging strength in enterprise AI demand, double digit growth in traditional servers (in F2Q and FY26), and double digit growth in their midrange storage product and entire all-flash portfolio,"" analyst Erik Woodring said."" ""Yes, margins face pressure from increasing AI server mix - this should not come as a surprise (and yet the stock is down 5% as a result) - but that is set to reverse in 2H, and if DELL can improve execution in US large enterprise and the overall PC business, then the story should get cleaner from here,"" the analyst added.",fc31ffc37c6f0aad1b6987bfe41f92fb,trafilatura

Princeton University delivers the best ROI among private colleges in the U.S., according to The Princeton Review's latest rankings. (The Princeton Review is not associated with Princeton University.) The publication considered financial aid, academic rigor and admissions selectivity, as well as overall costs after aid, to determine the colleges that deliver the best value.
For the 2025-26 academic year, tuition at Princeton comes with a sticker price of $65,210, according to the school's website. But students receiving financial aid pay an average of just $10,555 a year, and go on to earn a median income of over $110,000 a year a decade after attending, according to the most recent data from the Department of Education.
By comparison, students at Georgia Institute of Technology, the public college with the best ROI per Princeton Review, pay a higher average net price of $13,289 and earn less, a median of $102,772. Many of the best-value public colleges have lower sticker and average net prices than the private schools, but earnings fall short of private school grads' incomes.

'No-loan' policies may contribute to strong ROI
Private schools, especially those like Princeton with large endowments and a number of wealthy donors, often give a generous amount of financial aid. Princeton was the first U.S. college to institute a ""no-loan"" policy in 2001 where the school covers the cost of attendance for students who demonstrate financial need.
Now, dozens of schools throughout the country have adopted similar policies to help students and families attend prestigious universities without the burden of student debt. And while a free education doesn't guarantee a good outcome, it can certainly help deliver a strong ROI.
For example, MIT meets 100% of demonstrated financial need for students, but doesn't have an explicit no-loan policy. Beginning with the 2025-26 school year, families earning $200,000 a year or less will pay $0 for tuition and families earning $100,000 or less will have fees like housing and meals covered as well.
Harvard similarly covers all costs for students if their families earn $100,000 a year or less and tuition for families earning $200,000 or less. Families earning more than $200,000 may still get some financial aid, depending on their individual situation.

After 39 drawings without a winner, the $1 billion prize ranks as the sixth-largest jackpot in the game's history, according to the consortium that runs the lottery. The last $1 billion jackpot was claimed in April 2024, and the biggest since then was a $526.5 million win in March.
To claim the prize, you'll need to beat odds of 1 in 292,201,338 and match all six numbers, including the red Powerball. Smaller prizes are also available, including $1 million for matching all five white balls without the Powerball.
Winners can choose between two payout options: the full jackpot spread out as annual payments over 30 years or a lump-sum cash option worth just under half the advertised prize.
No matter which option you select, the Internal Revenue Service takes a cut. Winnings are considered taxable income, so 24% is withheld immediately. But the windfall would almost certainly put you in the top 37% federal tax bracket, so expect to pay the rest when you file your 2025 tax return.

On top of that, most states levy their own income taxes, ranging from 2.5% to 10.9%. Eight states don't tax lottery winnings at all: California, Florida, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming.
It's worth noting that five states don't participate in Powerball: Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada and Utah.

She repeated the routine for two months, just to finalize her wardrobe for her two-day bachelorette party, she says.
Shopping for her other wedding events, including her bridal shower, wedding ceremony in Hawaii and reception in Bali, took similar amounts of dedication. She wanted to have a different look for every single photographed event, she says.
The 32-year-old real estate consultant from Upper Marlboro, Maryland, spent nearly $18,000 on 15 unique white outfits during her time as a bride, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.
""I felt an immense amount of pressure on what I needed to wear ... This is my wedding, the moment I've been dreaming about,"" Johnson says.
For many brides, tying the knot is no longer a single-day, or single outfit, affair. It can be an entire multi-event season that spans months, sometimes years. Fueled by social media and the growing extravagance of weddings, brides with disposable income are hosting more events than ever — and buying more outfits as a result, experts and brides tell CNBC Make It.
Pop culture and social media compel brides to host more events
Brides buy an average of 12 looks for wedding-related events, says David's Bridal CEO Kelly Cook, up from eight outfits in 2021. Some brides wear little white dresses for their bridal showers and bachelorette parties, or even to go wedding dress shopping in.
The growing number of pre-wedding events, and the trend of buying a new outfit for each one, isn't necessarily new, says bridal stylist Julie Sabatino, who has worked with high net worth clients since 2001. The concept of hosting multiple pre-wedding events has long been advertised on TV and in pop culture — but recently, the concept has become more of a norm thanks to social media.
Brides are now bombarded with wedding event-related content on Instagram and TikTok, giving them the inspiration to plan more elaborate celebrations with outfits and accessories that match the occasion, Cook says.
Even smaller events like engagements now require planners and vendors so the couple can be Instagram-ready, Brian A.M. Green, an Atlanta-based upscale event planner, told CNBC Make It in November 2024.
David's Bridal is just one of the many companies to meet the increasing demand, launching a ""Little White Dresses"" page on its website in 2021, Cook says. The company also sells little white bikinis, little white sunglasses and little white tote bags. Other retailers offering similar items include Revolve and Anthropologie.
California-based bride Chiara Walsh spent nearly $4,000 on 16 bridal looks before her ceremony in June, including a $19 white powered wig off Amazon for a ""Founding Fathers"" theme night on her bachelorette. Wedding planning itself became an event: She bought a $168 blue Faherty dress to go shopping for her ceremony gown, she says.
""It was exciting, but I did feel like I needed something new for every single thing. If I already had a picture in it, I didn't really want to wear it again,"" says Walsh, 34.
Philadelphia-based bride Hailey McLaughlin, who got married in May, estimates she spent $800 buying outfits for her four-day bachelorette trip in Park City, Utah.
""For the bachelorette, I felt like I needed to be the best-dressed person in the room,"" McLaughlin, 29, says. ""Because of the location I picked, I had to get ski pants and coats and accessories and scarves.""
Brides can be pressured by wedding size, photos-ops and family to wear new outfits
Weddings, generally, have gotten more lavish in just the last five years. The average U.S. wedding now costs $35,000, up from $19,000 in 2020, according to wedding-planning website The Knot. Some brides say they have to wear new, and sometimes more expensive outfits, to meet the expectations of their families and social media followers, and to match the extravagance of their weddings.
Johnson says her family and friends expected her to be ""over the top,"" and felt inclined to deliver. Walsh, who had been in several of her friends' weddings before planning her own, says, ""It more felt like, 'Finally, it's my turn to be a bride.'""
Help us help you: Take our survey on work, money and life goals
An increase in destination weddings and bigger guest lists ups the ante, too. Even local weddings, which often include welcome parties and goodbye brunches, are now ""treated as destination weddings because people come in from all over the place,"" Sabatino says.
Walsh tied the knot just 20 miles south of her home in Ontario, California, but with family and friends flying in from all over the country, she says the celebration turned into a four-day event filled with dinners, brunches and a trip to Disneyland.
""It's fun to [wear] something brand new that your friends haven't seen, or your family hasn't seen,"" she says.
The need to wear something new doesn't always come from the bride. If Abi Garapati had the wedding of her dreams, the New York-based business strategy and operations manager would have eloped in Japan, she says. Instead, her parents and in-laws started planning — and paying for — her wedding before she was even engaged, she says.
Garapati, 29, says she ultimately wore 11 outfits to cover both Indian traditions and her Western preferences, including a $350 Reformation dress and $700 Picchika lehenga.
""Typically, in Indian weddings, the parents will pay for the whole thing, and they'll save up their entire lives for this big, elaborate [celebration],"" says Garapati, who tied the knot last year. ""I did have to have outfits, but either my mother-in-law or my mom would just get it for me.""
After weddings, where do little white dresses go?
To reduce the number of little white dresses taking up closet space, some brides are opting to go with non-white looks they can re-wear in the future, and others are dying their dresses different colors after their wedding events, Cook says.
Johnson says she tried to look for dresses she could see herself wearing for other events in the future. But despite shopping with intention, she says it can be hard to re-wear white when most of the nice events she attends are other weddings.
""[Most of the outfits] are, unfortunately, in my closet,"" says Johnson. ""I've been trying to figure out when I'm going to wear them again. Maybe for our anniversary.""
Sourcing secondhand looks is also increasingly popular, says Sabatino, who opened a New York-based storefront called The Jul Box in July to sell custom re-made vintage gowns. Many brides just want to feel like their looks to feel both unique and personal, no matter the trends, she says.
""They don't want to look like every other bride on Instagram,"" Sabatino says. ""I think that opens the doors to possibilities that you can have in your closet for a long time.""

While some retailers are leaning into worker-led personalized experiences for shoppers, other retailers are focusing more on leveraging artificial intelligence to optimize the shopping experience.
Walmart is one of those retailers, adding new ""super agents"" that aims to save time and effort for both workers and shoppers. At its recent Retail Rewired innovation event, Walmart highlighted the launch of four ""super agents,"" which include Marty for sellers and suppliers, Sparky for shoppers, the Associate Agent and the Developer Agent.
With agents performing capabilities in the realm of payroll, paid time off, merchandising and finding the right products for any event, Walmart is consolidating its powerful, time-saving tools for the sake of a streamlined experience for multiple points of interaction with the company.
""Having a plethora of different agents can very quickly become confusing,"" Suresh Kumar, chief technology officer for Walmart Global, said at the event.
The Associate Agent, for example, is ""a single point of entry where any associate can find access to all of the agents we've built on the back end,"" explained David Glick, senior vice president for Enterprise Business Solutions at Walmart. ""As you speak to it more, as you work with it more, it'll know more about you.""
The evolution comes alongside a broader shift for retail, an industry actively seeking to counteract cost concerns from consumers and the government, and Walmart isn't alone in its push toward all things AI. Amazon's Prime Day event over four days in July saw generative AI use jump 3,300% year over year, according to TechCrunch. Meanwhile, Google Cloud AI partnered with body care retailer Lush to visually identify projects without packaging, ultimately reducing the expense of training new hires.
Making digital twins of Walmart stores
Walmart is also all-in on physical and spatial AI, specifically digital twins (a virtual copy of any physical object or space — in Walmart's case, their stores and clubs). Using digital twin technology powered by spatial AI, Walmart can ""detect, diagnose and remediate issues up to two weeks in advance,"" Brandon Ballard, group director for real estate at Walmart US, said at Retail Rewired. Using this technology comes with big savings, according to Ballard. ""Last year, we cut all of our emergency alerts by 30% and we reduced our maintenance spend in refrigeration by 19% across Walmart US,"" he added.
""At its core, retail is a physical business,"" said Alex de Vigan, CEO and founder of Nfinite, which generates large-scale visual data for training spatial and physical AI models. ""We've seen retailers use digital twins to reduce setup time for new promotions, reallocate labor more efficiently, and improve robotic picking accuracy, small gains that add up quickly when margins are under stress,"" he said.
While the impact of digital twins may not be outwardly visible to consumers in the same way, say, Walmart's Sparky agent is, its effects will be real. ""Better stock accuracy, faster site updates and fewer order issues mean a smoother retail experience, even in a tighter economy,"" said de Vigan.
Another innovation on the back end is Walmart's use of machine learning to better understand how long it will take to get a delivery order on a customer's doorsteps, effectively managing expectations while increasing efficiency.
As for what consumers can see, Sparky is already helping shoppers generate baskets built on an intuitive understanding of their needs. Walmart is currently working on enabling the agent to take action on reordering products, ultimately reducing the mental load that shoppers deal with.
For retailers, AI is one way to combat any slowdown in consumer spending, but we've yet to see how a fully integrated AI shopping experience — both in person and online — will shape our relationship with retail moving forward.",ad23afb5757014532225c61809d69643,trafilatura

Activist Commentary: Elliott is a multistrategy investment firm that manages about $76.1 billion in assets (as of June 30, 2025) and is one of the oldest firms of its type under continuous management. Known for its extensive due diligence and resources, Elliott regularly follows companies for years before making an investment. Elliott is the most active of activist investors, engaging with companies across industries and multiple geographies.
What's happening
On Aug. 27, Elliott announced that they have taken a position in Rexford Industrial Realty.
Behind the scenes
Rexford is an internally managed industrial REIT focused on the Southern California market. The industrial REIT space has benefited from strong secular tailwinds, as the rise of e-commerce, which requires more warehouse space on average than a traditional retail business, has driven up warehousing needs over time. Moreover, Southern California is a particularly attractive location due to entitlement challenges, land scarcity, proximity to ports and its dense urban population, all of which have fueled demand and fast rent growth. Historically, this prime and irreplaceable portfolio has commanded a top of the market valuation, trading at a 20-30% premium to net asset value (NAV) and an 8-turn premium to peers on an adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) basis.
However, as we have seen many times before with many activists, REITs are inherently poorly governed and attract management teams with misaligned interests. Rexford is no different. Despite being a California-based company, they are domiciled in Maryland, a state that is infamous for management friendly regulations, including the Maryland Unsolicited Takeovers Act, which allows the company to classify its board without shareholder approval.
A California REIT incorporating in Maryland is not for convenience reasons, but more for entrenchment purposes. It is this type of company that would also have a seven-person board with a majority (including two co-CEOs) being members for over 10 years and owning approximately 1% of outstanding common stock as a group, almost all of which was granted to them. Once setup like this, the REIT playbook is generally to take on debt, issue shares and buy as much property as you can because management's upside is tied more to the level of assets managed than stock price. Also, at cocktail parties and clubs, it is ""cool"" to manage billions of dollars of properties. So, since its IPO in 2013, the company has increased its share count by over 9x, increased debt from $193 million to $3.5 billion and grew assets from $555 million to $12.6 billion. This strategy worked for a while when Rexford traded at a large premium to the underlying value of its real estate, but it finally caught up to them as sales, general and administrative expenses bloated, corporate governance eroded and executive compensation became loaded. (Two CEOs at $13 million each). As its premium to NAV started to decline, so did this strategy and Rexford now trades at a 20% discount to NAV and a 5-6 turn AFFO discount to peers with its stock price down to $40 per share (prior to Elliott's announcement) from a high of more than $80 in December 2021.
Luckily for shareholders, the time for change has come, as Elliott Investment Management has disclosed a top five position in Rexford. While this implies a minimum of 5% economic exposure (approximately $400 million to 500 million), given Elliott's investment history, their exposure is likely at least $1 billion of their $76 billion of assets.
Elliott has a rich history of driving change at companies like Rexford, so we expect them to advocate for better corporate governance, better capital allocation, and restore the company's strategic focus on creating shareholder value.
While it is important to note that activism can be more challenging in Maryland, it has not acted as a prohibition, especially for experienced and committed activists like Elliott. In fact, the tools available to the company that would ordinarily discourage activism are in this situation more of poison chalice. Any attempt by management to entrench themselves in the face of an activist would only further damage their reputation and support Elliott's case that change is warranted. So, we would expect Elliott to fare well in a proxy fight here if it came to that. But we do not think it will come to that.
When an activist engages with a company, it often puts that company in pseudo-play, getting the attention of strategic investors and private equity. This dynamic is even greater for a company like Rexford that has long been the subject of takeover speculation.
For Rexford, their premium assets, the consolidation in the REIT industry and their present discounted valuation makes the company a natural acquisition candidate. Moreover, Elliott also has a robust history of catalyzing strategic outcomes at REITs.
At Healthcare Trust of America (formerly HTA), Elliott successfully pushed for a strategic review, which ultimately led to a merger between HTA and Healthcare Realty Trust to form the largest medical office property owner in the U.S.
Given Rexford's current 20% discount to NAV, we believe that any takeout would occur at least at NAV, but more likely at a premium given the company's historical valuation and portfolio quality.
If such an opportunity were to materialize, as a fiduciary to its investors and Rexford shareholders, Elliott would weigh the value from an acquisition against the long-term standalone plan and advocate for whichever path would deliver the best value for shareholders. Considering the long-term plan would likely require the time and uncertainty of a board and management reconstitution, we would think that an acquisition at a reasonable premium would be the preferred path here.

AquaStar USA Corp. of Seattle is recalling more than 26,000 packages of refrigerated cocktail shrimp sold at Walmart stores in 27 states between July 31 and Aug. 16. The company is also recalling about 18,000 bags of Kroger-branded cooked, medium peeled, tail-off shrimp sold at stores in 17 states between July 24 and Aug. 11.
At the same time, H&N Group, a wholesale seafood distributor in Vernon, California, is recalling more than 17,000 cases of frozen shrimp sold to grocery stores on the East Coast, according to a notice from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. That recall began on Aug. 12.
The products have been pulled because they may be contaminated with Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope that is a byproduct of nuclear reactions. The risk appears to be small, but the shrimp could pose a ""potential health concern"" for people exposed to low levels of Cesium-137 over time, FDA officials said.
The FDA issued a safety alert this month warning consumers not to eat certain frozen shrimp imported from PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati, an Indonesian company doing business as BMS Foods. Cesium-137 was detected in shipping containers from the company sent to U.S. ports and in a sample of frozen breaded shrimp.
FDA has also added PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati to a new import alert for chemical contamination to stop products from this firm from coming into the U.S.
It remains unclear how the containers or the shrimp became contaminated. Federal officials said they are investigating and declined to respond to detailed questions from The Associated Press about the source or extent of the contamination.
None of the shrimp that triggered alerts or tested positive for Cesium-137 was released for sale, the FDA said. But other shipments sent to stores may have been manufactured under conditions that allowed the products to become contaminated, the agency said.
Officials with U.S. Customs and Border Protection first detected the potential radioactive contamination in shipping containers sent to U.S. ports in Los Angeles, Houston, Miami and Savannah, Georgia. Customs officials alerted the FDA, which conducted tests of packaged shrimp and confirmed Cesium-137 in a single sample.
Experts in nuclear radiation agreed that the health risk is low, but said it's important to determine the source of the contamination and share that information with the public.
The level of Cesium-137 detected in the frozen shrimp was about 68 becquerels per kilogram, a measure of radioactivity. That is far below the FDA's level of 1,200 becquerels per kilogram that could trigger the need for health protections.
It is unusual to see this concentration of Cesium-137 in shrimp, said Steve Biegalski, who chairs the Nuclear and Radiological Engineering and Medical Physics program at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Routine levels detected in shrimp from the Pacific Ocean are about 100 times lower than those found in the BMS shrimp, according to the American Nuclear Society.
""We sometimes can see Cesium-137 from historic nuclear weapons fallout, nuclear accidents such as Fukushima or Chernobyl, but the levels in the environment are super, super, super low right now and cannot explain what's going on here,"" Biegalski said.",934cfd7ed47831eac857353d3fcddc6f,trafilatura

The move could ratchet up a months-long legal challenge over the news outlets' fate.
Kari Lake, acting CEO of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, announced the latest round of job cuts late Friday, one day after a federal judge blocked her from removing Michael Abramowitz as VOA director.
U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth had ruled separately that the Republican administration had failed to show how it was complying with his orders to restore VOA's operations. His order Monday gave the administration ""one final opportunity, short of a contempt trial"" to demonstrate its compliance. He ordered Lake to sit for a deposition by lawyers for agency employees by Sept. 15.
On Thursday, Lamberth said Abramowitz could not be removed without the approval of the majority of the International Broadcasting Advisory Board. Firing Abramowitz would be ""plainly contrary to law,"" according to Lamberth, who was nominated to the bench by Republican President Ronald Reagan.
Lake posted a statement on social media that said her agency had initiated a reduction in force, or RIF, eliminating 532 jobs for full-time government employees. She said the agency ""will continue to fulfill its statutory mission after this RIF— and will likely improve its ability to function.""
""I look forward to taking additional steps in the coming months to improve the functioning of a very broken agency and make sure America's voice is heard abroad where it matters most,"" she wrote.
A group of agency employees who sued to block VOA's elimination said Lake's move would give their colleagues 30 days until their pay and benefits end.
""We find Lake's continued attacks on our agency abhorrent,"" they said in a statement. ""We are looking forward to her deposition to hear whether her plan to dismantle VOA was done with the rigorous review process that Congress requires. So far we have not seen any evidence of that.""
In June, layoff notices were sent to more than 600 agency employees. Abramowitz was placed on administrative leave along with almost the entire VOA staff. He was told he would be fired effective Aug. 31.
The administration said in a court filing Thursday that it planned to send RIF notices to 486 employees of VOA and 46 other agency employees but intended to retain 158 agency employees and 108 VOA employees. The filing said the global media agency had 137 ""active employees"" and 62 other employees on administrative leave while VOA had 86 active employees and 512 others administrative leave.
The agency also houses Radio Free Europe and Asia and Radio Marti, which beams Spanish-language news into Cuba. The networks, which together reach an estimated 427 million people, date to the Cold War and are part of a network of government-funded organizations trying to extend U.S. influence and combat authoritarianism.",f2ecb64b49327a606d431c4d5cf7f2ab,trafilatura

Pros
- Above-average APY
- No minimum deposit required to open account
- No monthly fees
Cons
- No welcome offer
- No physical branches to do in-person banking
- No checking account option
APY
The Live Oak Business Savings account currently offers 3.15% APY on your account balance. You must deposit at least $0.01 to begin earning interest. Unlike some other business banking options, Live Oak doesn't offer a tiered APY system for earning the highest return.
Access to your cash
Customers can link an external bank account (like a personal checking account) to their Live Oak Business account in order to transfer their cash. If the transfer is initiated before 4pm EST then funds should be available in your personal bank account within 1–2 business days.
And to add funds to your account, you can have clients send you an ACH transfer, which will be immediately available to you in your account. You can also deposit checks mailed by your clients (either through the mobile app or by mailing the check to the bank's physical headquarters), but these will be held for up to five days before you can use it, even if it is posted to your account the same day. This is so the bank can verify the details of the transfer.
Keep in mind that you won't be able to deposit physical cash into your account.
Perks
Live Oak doesn't offer much in the way of perks for its business savings account, but users can connect QuickBooks to their account for easy expense tracking.
You can also add up to five authorized signers to your business savings account. An authorized signer is someone who given permission to manage account transactions on behalf of the business. So they can typically sign checks, close accounts and make deposits and withdrawals, so you'll want to be very discerning about who you choose as an authorized signer for your account, if this is something you choose to use.
Another standout feature is that while Live Oak does offer FDIC insurance up to the standard $250,000, it also offers extended coverage. Extended coverage entails putting money beyond the $250,000 into Live Oak's Insured Cash Sweep account, which provides FDIC insurance up to $10 million. Live Oak is able to offer this because it's part of the IntraFi Network Deposits. At least 3,000 banks are also part of this network. So while it's not technically a feature built into the business account, it is still something offered to you as a Live Oak customer.
In order to use the Insured Cash Sweep program, you'll need a minimum balance of $350,000.
Fees
The Live Oak Business Savings account doesn't charge a monthly maintenance fee and also doesn't have a minimum balance requirement.
However, there is a dormant account fee you should be aware of. Accounts are considered dormant if they have a balance of less than $10.01 and haven't had any activity for more than 24 straight months. Live Oak defines ""no activity"" as no withdrawals, no deposits, no contact with a Customer Success Manager, and no customer log-ins to their online banking site.
The dormant account fee is equivalent to the account balance or $10, whichever is less, but the fee will not overdraw your account. Once you're charged the fee, your account will be closed.
If you need to stop a payment from going through from your account, you'll be charged a $25 stop payment fee. And if customers return an item that you're selling there will be a $5 returned item fee. You'll also be charged fees for wires — a $10 incoming wire fee, a $19 fee for an outgoing domestic standard wire, $40 for an outgoing international standard wire and a $35 returned wire fee.
How does it compare?
If you still aren't convinced the Live Oak Business Savings account is for you, it helps to see how it stacks up against other accounts on the market.
The Capital One Business Savings Account, for instance, might be appealing if you value going with an account behind a strong household name like Capital One. But this account has several key differences that set it apart from Live Oak's Business Savings account. For starters, the Capital One account has a $3 monthly maintenance fee whereas the Live Oak account doesn't have that fee at all (though, there is the option to waive the Capital One fee as long as you keep a minimum monthly balance of at least $300.
Also, the Capital One account has a $250 minimum deposit required to open the account — again, Live Oak doesn't have a minimum open amount. So the trade off of going with Capital One's household recognition and access to in-person branches may be having to meet higher minimums and possibly pay more in fees if you can't reach those minimums.

Cons
- The above-average APY is only available for the first 6 months
- Minimum deposit required to open account
- There is a $3 monthly fee if you don't maintain a $300 balance
- No welcome offer
The Axos Bank Business Premium Savings account is another option that doesn't charge a monthly maintenance fee and doesn't have a minimum deposit required to open the account — all much like the Live Oak account. Axos Bank also doesn't have physical locations, unlike Capital One, but Axos Bank currently offers a higher APY on the savings account than Live Oak does, which means you can earn more for your deposits. If you're prioritizing APY earnings, the Axos Bank savings account may be the more appealing option.

FAQs
Can my LLC have a high-yield savings account?
LLCs can have high-yield savings accounts — in fact, opening one is beneficial because it lets you earn more for your balance thanks to the higher APY. Of course, the best savings account for your business is the one that has all the features you need to keep your operations running smoothly.
How do you open a business savings account?
Opening a business savings account is pretty much the same as opening a personal savings account, however, you'll just need to provide additional information relevant to your business like your business name, Employer Identification Number (EIN) and business address.
How much should I keep in a business savings account?
You should move 20–30% of your business income into a business savings account so you can pay what you owe in taxes when the time comes. Experts also recommend keeping 3–6 months' worth of operating expenses in your business savings account.

The move alarmed the agency's workforce, the sources said, and is the latest example of simmering tensions and crossed signals between Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. The two have clashed previously over her decisions, including earlier this month when Gabbard declassified a lightly redacted document related to Russian election interference.
Two former government officials said their read of the situation is that Gabbard is under pressure to regain President Donald Trump's confidence. Gabbard fell out of favor with Trump and his aides earlier this year after she posted a video and delivered testimony about Iran's nuclear capabilities.
But the tensions between Gabbard and Trump seem to have subsided for now. When Gabbard announced the security clearance removals last week, she said some of the 37 current and former officials were engaged in ""politicization or weaponization of intelligence"" and that she was acting on the president's orders.
More from NBC News:
And on Tuesday, as he presided over a Cabinet meeting before television cameras, Trump praised Gabbard. ""You found some interesting things, Tulsi,"" Trump said. ""She's becoming a bigger and bigger star every day.""
One of the former government officials said Gabbard appeared to be trying to show the president she was exposing Democrats and political enemies, including some purportedly inside the CIA. The security clearance removals reflected ""a battle between Gabbard and Ratcliffe,"" the former official said.
The director of national intelligence position was created after the Sept. 11 attacks in an effort to ensure close coordination among the country's spy agencies.
There have been turf wars and personality clashes in the past between some DNIs and CIA directors. During Barack Obama's presidency, Dennis Blair was often at loggerheads with the CIA chief, Leon Panetta, and he ultimately resigned after 16 months on the job.
But in this case, the current director of national intelligence appears to be seeking the president's support, former officials said, by doubling down on accusations against former Democratic administrations and punishing members of a perceived ""deep state"" of anti-Trump government bureaucrats.
Apart from highlighting the divide between Gabbard and Ratcliffe, the episode also illustrates the effect of a widening and unpredictable purge of career government officials deemed insufficiently loyal.
The fired analyst
The CIA officer whom Gabbard publicly identified and stripped of her security clearance was a veteran analyst. NBC News is not naming the employee for her protection. A former colleague said she is declining interviews.
Days earlier, she had worked intensely to help prepare the White House team for a summit in Alaska between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, former intelligence agency colleagues said. She was due to take up a new assignment for the CIA in Europe, according to three sources with knowledge of the matter.
After the summit, the CIA informed the analyst that she had lost her security clearance, effectively ending her career. ""She did most of the prep for the Putin summit and to this day has no idea why her clearance was removed,"" said a former colleague, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing fear of retaliation from the Trump administration.
Gabbard and her office failed to properly coordinate the move with the CIA before revoking the security clearances of the 37 current and former officials, said a U.S. official and a source with knowledge of the matter. It appeared that Gabbard and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence were unaware of the CIA employee's covert mission, the official added.
""ODNI didn't meaningfully consult with the agency,"" the official told NBC News.
ODNI spokesperson Olivia Coleman defended Gabbard's decision, saying in an email it was designed to ensure ""individuals who have violated the trust placed in them by weaponizing, politicizing, manipulating, or leaking classified intelligence are no longer allowed to do so.""
In a social media post, Coleman added: ""No one was 'blindsided.' We coordinated with all agencies before sending the letter."" Coleman said the memo from Gabbard revoking security clearances ""listed names and not agency affiliations, meaning @DNIGabbard did not out any 'undercover' officer.""
Asked about relations between the two spy chiefs, CIA spokeswoman Liz Lyons said: ""Director Ratcliffe and the president's entire elite national security team are committed to eradicating the politicization of intelligence and are focused on executing President Trump's national security priorities, and keeping the American people safe.""
The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal first reported the incident.
The fired CIA analyst had previously worked as a national intelligence officer specializing in Russia and Eurasia and had been ordered to help organize the assessment of Russia's interference in the 2016 election. Since Trump returned to the White House in January, the administration has taken action against officials who took part in the Russia investigation, those who prosecuted Jan. 6 rioters and those who pursued criminal cases against Trump.
A former senior intelligence official, Larry Pfeiffer, said it would be reckless not to confer with the employee's spy agency before rescinding their security clearance and revealing their identity. He said that could put an officer at risk and jeopardize relations with a foreign government.
""Look, it's just common sense to consult with the agency that would be most impacted by a decision to pull the clearance of one of their employees,"" Pfeiffer said, ""especially in such a public manner.""
Ongoing friction
The episode underscored continuing friction between Gabbard and Ratcliffe. The rift has been apparent across Washington, known to lawmakers, intelligence community employees and Pentagon officials.
In July, Gabbard declassified a 2020 report from the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee on Russia's interference in the 2016 election. She did this over the objections of some CIA officials, who argued the details should remain secret to protect sensitive spying sources and methods, NBC News previously reported.
Gabbard also raised eyebrows at the CIA when she unveiled plans to move preparation of the president's daily intelligence briefing from CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, to the national intelligence director's office a few miles away, in McLean.
Presidents regularly receive a classified intelligence briefing, a digital document presented by senior officials that can shape a commander in chief's decision-making. While Gabbard oversees and approves the presidential daily brief, a large staff of analysts and other employees at the CIA compiles the briefing, creating detailed text, graphics and videos based on the latest intelligence.
Dozens of intelligence officials fired
Former intelligence officials say the CIA analyst is one of dozens of career employees at the country's spy agencies who have been abruptly fired or forced out in recent months for purported disloyalty. They have been ousted without being told of the evidence for the decision or having a chance to defend themselves.
Legal experts say Trump has wielded his authority over security clearances unlike any previous president, using it as a tool to punish former officials who have criticized him and to silence dissent in the government.
The administration has defended its actions, saying those who were stripped of their security clearance had allegedly politicized intelligence for partisan purposes, had failed to safeguard classified material, had failed to adhere to professional intelligence ""analytic tradecraft standards"" or engaged in unspecified ""detrimental"" conduct. Gabbard, in announcing the move, did not provide evidence for these claims.
The 37 people targeted by Gabbard last week were mostly former officials who worked in national security roles during the Obama and Biden administrations. Of the 37 listed, 25 had signed a letter in 2019, when they were private citizens, backing efforts by Democratic lawmakers to launch an impeachment inquiry into whether Trump abused his power when he asked Ukraine's government to look for derogatory information about his political rival, Joe Biden.
Right-wing activist and Trump ally Laura Loomer, who portrays herself as exposing ""disloyal"" government officials and civil servants, had flagged the 2019 letter in a recent social media post.
Revoking former intelligence officials' security clearances could damage their reputation and limit their long-term ability to find jobs, former officials said. Security clearances are a standard requirement for many senior posts at defense and technology companies with federal contracts.
Apart from the CIA analyst, there were at least two other current intelligence officers on Gabbard's list. One was Vinh Nguyen at the National Security Agency, who colleagues say was recognized as the intelligence community's top mind on cutting-edge technology such as artificial intelligence. The government recruited Nguyen at the age of 17 and he was the youngest NSA employee ever promoted to a senior position, former colleagues said.
Former intelligence officers described him as a generational genius who could not be replaced. ""The U.S. government is the big loser here,"" said a former senior intelligence official, referring to Nguyen's ouster.
In 2016, when Nguyen was a national intelligence officer overseeing cybersecurity, he was asked to help direct the intelligence assessment of Russia's interference in the 2016 elections. The assessment by U.S. spy agencies concluded that Russia had waged information warfare to try to undermine Hillary Clinton's candidacy and help Trump.
But Trump and Gabbard have dismissed the assessment as false and part of a conspiracy they claim Obama and his aides orchestrated. A bipartisan Senate investigation overseen by then-Sen. Marco Rubio later endorsed the findings of the intelligence assessment that Putin sought to help Trump win. The Russian leader also later said himself that he wanted to see Trump prevail.
The officials who lost their security clearances also included two former career intelligence officers who delivered the daily intelligence briefing to Trump during his first term. Several others on the list said they no longer have active security clearances and learned that they were on the roster from social media.
'No rhyme or reason'
Yael Eisenstat, a former CIA officer, wrote on social media that she was among those on Gabbard's list, though her last name was misspelled. Eisenstat said she left government more than a decade ago and did not need any security clearance for her work.
But she expressed outrage at Gabbard's action. In her social media post, she said ""the notion that the government can target former and current officers' clearances for political purposes without due process demonstrates yet another direct attack on democratic norms.""
Mark Zaid, an attorney who is representing Eisenstat and several other people on the list, said the revocation of the security clearances ""literally has no rhyme or reason"" and carried echoes of the McCarthy era. The move was undertaken without due process, and the announcement from Gabbard employed ""defamatory generalized allegations,"" according to Zaid, who himself had his security clearance removed in a previous action.
""This act was nothing short of unlawful and disregarded decades of established precedent. Given the last six months, it is clear this administration has chosen to weaponize the security clearance process, which would make the late Senator Joseph McCarthy proud,"" Zaid said.",07c67aae12e3330803c96fe32019f8bd,trafilatura

-
Lamborghini CEO Stephan Winkelmann said some of its moneyed customers are holding back on new car purchases as tariffs remain unstable between the U.S. and EU. The U.S. is the company’s biggest market, and despite recent record results and an order backlog that provides some cushion against a sales slowdown, Winkelmann said tariffs have the potential to deal the company a blow.
President Donald Trump’s tariff instability is putting the economy on hold, and even Lamborghini’s deep-pocketed customers aren’t immune.
CEO Stephan Winkelmann said some of its U.S. customers, who have at least $400,000 to shell out for a base model, are waiting to see where the Trump administration’s tariff rate for the EU ultimately settles. Its customers are waiting, even though the U.S. reached a deal to impose a 15% tariff on some EU products, including cars, in exchange for several pledges by the EU. This includes buying more AI chips and military equipment from the U.S.
“Some are waiting because they want to be sure that this is the final number that is going to be in place,” Winkelmann told CNBC. “Others are fine with it, or we will have negotiations.”
Winkelmann said while Lamborghini can resist the pressure of tariffs because of its large backlog of orders—cars delivered today were ordered a year or two ago—the company will still face pressure from U.S. tariffs on the EU. Lamborghini vehicles are made in Italy, and this point is a differentiator for the brand. While the U.S. is its largest market, the car company’s production can’t be moved there, a strategy Trump has suggested for companies to avoid tariffs.
“For us, free trade is the right approach,” Winkelmann said. “We all know that one is what we want. The other is the reality, and we have to deal with complexity since we are in business, and we are ready to face whatever comes.”
Lamborghini, which is owned by Volkswagen’s Audi Group, reported a 16% year-over-year increase that saw it bring in more than 3 billion euros ($3.5 billion) in revenue for the first time for fiscal 2024. Its operating income also rose by double digits to 835 million euros ($974 million). The company has also launched three new plug-in hybrid models since 2023.
Lamborghini did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.
Providing another boost is Lamborghini’s increasingly diverse customer base. Younger wealthy customers from all over the world have pushed the average age of a Lambo owner below 45. In Asia, the average customer is about 30. The average buyer owns five cars, while buyers of its upscale, pricier model, the Revuelto, have 10, on average.",b608ca13b8b1111a0bd2bbd38e2a92f2,trafilatura

NVDA stock is already trading at a premium valuation
However, the post-earnings pullback may be an opportunity for long-term investors to initiate or expand their positions in Nvidia stock, which is still up roughly 108% versus its year-to-date low.
How High Could Nvidia Stock Fly in the Long Run?
According to Ben Reitzes, a renowned tech industry expert, NVDA stock could even “double from here, if not more” over the longer term.
His optimism hinges on the company’s dominant AI ecosystem and developer base, which he likened to Apple’s (AAPL) App Store advantage.
“You win the developers, you win the race,” Reitzes told CNBC in an interview today, adding the company’s platform is the most monetizable for AI applications, giving it a durable competitive edge.
On “Squawk Box,” the head of tech research at Melius also said Nvidia’s total addressable market (TAM) will surpass a whopping $600 billion by the end of this decade.
China Overhang May Ease for NVDA Shares
Ben Reitzes recommends sticking with Nvidia shares for the long term as sovereign AI initiatives in Europe and Middle East will meaningfully benefit the semiconductor giant as well.
On China, he remains cautiously optimistic, believing geopolitical tensions will ease and unlock significant further upside in NVDA shares moving forward.
“We’d be buyers on weakness,” the Melius expert concluded on CNBC.
According to him, Nvidia will likely see even stronger momentum in its fiscal Q4 since “we’re all systems go.”

Cryptocurrency is finally mainstream. Everyone from celebrities to the U.S. president are in the game. So are many, many investors and traders. Some are there for a quick flip, while others are committed to it as essentially an investment lifestyle.
I’m not here to solve the crypto arguments, such as whether it will eventually be a true medium of exchange, a store of value, a fiat currency replacement, or the scam of the century. I just want to make money and not lose big along the way.

CEO Alex Karp Just Sold $60 Million in Palantir Stock. Should You Ditch PLTR Here Too?
But crypto is a different animal. It trades differently, and 24/7. It charts differently (to me, at least), as it is subject to reversals in either direction at any time, and seemingly for any reason. It is as much a supply-demand play as any other asset I know, even gold (GCZ25). And that makes it a nice trading vehicle. For me personally, it’s done in small sizes.
One reason for that is I’m a risk manager above all else. And Bitcoin (BTCUSD), the leading crypto asset, has a habit of dipping 20% with some frequency. In just the past 5 years, it has doubled in a flash, yet also spent nearly 3 years going nowhere. It’s experienced no shortage of volatility along the way.
What Does Crypto Look Like Now?
While crypto assets galore now exist to trade, my focus here will be on three ETFs, all from iShares, which help me track a trio of crypto areas: iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), and iShares Blockchain and Tech ETF (IBLC), which invests in stocks related to the cryptocurrency business.
Here are the three of them, side by side. They have delivered different degrees of “awesome” in terms of return over the past 6 months. But that’s in the past. And like all past performances, there’s only one guarantee: that I can’t have it unless I already own it!
So let’s look at the charts and see if there’s any daylight between these. And, if they stand a good chance of continuing their torrid pace.
Starting with Bitcoin, I see an unmistakable downtrend in progress. That could be temporary, part of one of those “pause that refreshes” moments. The 20-day and 50-day moving averages are now heading south, and the PPO at the bottom is just crossed below the 0 line. All conspire to make a “high risk versus reward” situation to me.",8e66286ca63e1ac0f1e4c40f8de4fa10,trafilatura

The overall earnings were better-than-expected, not that the market expected a different outcome from the chip designing giant's report. However, as has been the case on more than one occasion over the last few quarters, NVDA stock is slipping despite beating consensus estimates. In this article, we’ll look at the key takeaways from Nvidia’s report and examine whether it makes sense to buy the dip in the stock.
Nvidia Reported Better-Than-Expected Q2 Earnings
Nvidia reported revenues of $46.74 billion in its fiscal second quarter, up 56% year-over-year, and ahead of the company’s guidance as well as consensus estimates. It was the ninth consecutive quarter in which the company’s revenues rose by over 50% annually. While last quarter’s growth was the lowest among these quarters, it occurred at a time when the company was unable to ship its H20 chips to China.

Meanwhile, while Nvidia’s overall revenues came in ahead of estimates, its data center segment, which is now its biggest segment by a big margin, fell slightly short of estimates. The company guided for revenues of $54 billion at the midpoint for the fiscal third quarter, which was higher than the $53.1 billion that analysts were expecting. Importantly, the guidance does not assume any H20 sales to China in the current quarter, while some China revenues might have been built into analysts’ estimates.
Nvidia’s adjusted earnings per share of $1.05 also came in ahead of the $0.94 that analysts were modeling, and the company predicted an expansion of its gross margins in the current quarter.
Other Key Takeaways from Nvidia’s Earnings
Here are the other key takeaways from Nvidia’s Q2 earnings.
China Remains a Wild Card for Nvidia
China was expectedly the focus during Nvidia’s fiscal Q2 earnings call since the company was barred from exporting the H20 chip to the country in the quarter. While the U.S. government has since allowed exports to resume, pending a revenue-share deal, there is still a lot of uncertainty over the company’s China business. CFO Colette Kress said that Nvidia is “still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the [U.S. and Chinese] governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do.” Nvidia said that it could ship H20 chips worth between $2 billion-$5 billion this quarter in China, subject to regulatory clearances. However, it added that it could ship more if there is higher interest from Chinese customers or if more licenses are issued by the U.S. government.",a6e065760de32738693d9b35ea48bd8e,trafilatura

Moreover, it has increased by over 415% in the past 12 months. However, such dramatic gains raise valuation concerns, and here Palantir stands out in ways that could prompt even the most bullish investors to pause.

Palantir Stock: The Valuation Concern
Palantir’s price-sales ratio has skyrocketed to 133.2x, a level that not only dwarfs its peers in the artificial intelligence and software space, but also surpasses some of the largest and most profitable technology companies in the world. Snowflake (SNOW), UiPath (PATH), and C3.ai (AI), all prominent names in AI-driven software, trade at far more modest multiples of 17.9x, 4.1x, and 5.8x, respectively. Even the large tech giants with high profitability look inexpensive by comparison. For instance, Alphabet (GOOGL) stock trades at a P/S ratio of 7.2x, Microsoft (MSFT) at 13.3x, and Nvidia(NVDA), despite its dominance in the AI hardware space, trades at 34x.
This stark contrast highlights the market’s lofty expectations for Palantir. Investors are effectively betting that the company will deliver explosive growth for years to come, justifying today’s price tag. So far, Palantir has given them reason to believe. Its government contracts remain robust, while its commercial business is expanding rapidly as more enterprises turn to AI-driven solutions.
Palantir’s Strong Fundamentals Back the Rally
For instance, Palantir just delivered one of its strongest quarters to date, surpassing $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time. The momentum in its business is accelerating, with overall revenue climbing 48% year-over-year in the second quarter. This surge comes as demand for its AI Platform (AIP) remains strong and is driving growth in its customer base.
Every major metric of Palantir’s business remains solid, suggesting strong growth ahead. Palantir recorded its highest-ever bookings in Q2, with $2.3 billion in total contract value (TCV) and $684 million in annual contract value (ACV). Deal activity also remained robust, providing a solid platform for long-term growth. It closed 157 deals worth $1 million or more, including 66 worth at least $5 million and 42 exceeding $10 million.",5391f60d9114725f0d387976bf74b5ea,trafilatura

-
Following two days of sell-offs, Opendoor stock is bounding higher in today's trading.
-
Opendoor has been highly volatile lately, but the stock may be getting a boost from stronger-than-expected U.S. GDP data.
-
A recent feature on CNBC's ""Mad Money"" could also be helping to push Opendoor higher today.
Opendoor (NASDAQ: OPEN) stock is seeing substantial gains in Thursday's trading. The iBuying real estate company's share price was up 4.1% as of 1 p.m. ET and had been up as much as 11.7% earlier in the session.
After big sell-offs in Tuesday's and Wednesday's daily sessions, Opendoor stock is seeing some recovery momentum in today's trading. While there are no clear-cut, business-specific catalysts behind the move, there are a couple of factors that could be playing a role in the company's gains today.
Opendoor stock rises as Q2 GDP comes in higher than expected
The U.S. Commerce Department published gross domestic product (GDP) data for this year's second quarter this morning, and growth came in stronger than anticipated. U.S. GDP grew at a 3.3% annual rate in Q2, topping the average economist forecast for growth of 3% in the period. While the real estate market has been seeing some mixed indicators lately, stronger GDP growth could help support home sales and create a more favorable operating backdrop for Opendoor.
Did Opendoor stock inadvertently get a boost from Mad Money's Jim Cramer?
In yesterday's episode of Mad Money on CNBC, host Jim Cramer said that Opendoor was a ""meme stock"" and said that he wouldn't be jumping into the stock in hopes of profiting from the surge in bullish momentum it's seen this year. As of this writing, the stock is up 164% across 2025's trading.
While Cramer's comments on the stock could come across as negative or ambivalent, they may have also had the effect of bringing more attention to the company. Additionally, many meme-stock traders seem to have a negative view on the Mad Money host's coverage in general -- and some intentionally make trades that are contrary to his positions. On the other hand, Opendoor stock has been prone to making big moves on little or no news recently -- so it's impossible to definitively state that the stock's recent feature on Cramer's show is a driving factor in its move today.

The regulator said in a blog post that it had put out new guidance regarding its foreign board of trade registration framework, which would apply equally to both traditional and crypto markets.
In a statement, Acting CFTC Chair Caroline D. Pham described the move as a way to dispel a lack of regulatory clarity marked by “regulation through enforcement” in recent years—a strategy employed by former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, under President Joe Biden, that had been widely criticized across the crypto industry.
“American companies that were forced to set up shop in foreign jurisdictions to facilitate crypto asset trading now have a path back to U.S. markets,” she said, calling the move “another example of how the CFTC will continue to deliver wins for President Trump.”
Crypto exchanges like Binance have been precluded from U.S. markets in recent years because they are not registered with U.S. regulators. Under the terms of a $4.3 billion settlement in 2023, the exchange agreed to ""completely exit” U.S. markets.
The CFTC’s guidance comes days after Commissioner Kristin Johnson announced her departure from the agency, saying in a statement that it is “critical not to dismantle the foundational resilience that supports financial stability and protects the broader economy.”
US Commerce Dept. Puts GDP Data on Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana Blockchains
Under the previous Securities and Exchange Commission, U.S.-based exchanges faced some limitations compared to foreign counterparts. Their ability to offer perpetual futures trading, staking, and leverage to customers was relatively constrained.
As a result, the largest crypto derivatives exchanges are based outside of the U.S., with Binance, Bybit, and Bitget leading the charge, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Binance has facilitated $94 billion in derivatives volume over the past day.
On X, Pham described the CFTC’s new guidance as something that could shape markets. Welcoming traders back to the U.S., she said the regulator’s latest move “opens up U.S. markets to the rest of the world.”
Cheryl Isaac, a partner at K&L Gates LLP., who specializes in derivatives and commodities law, told Decrypt that the CFTC’s guidance amounts to a “a reminder of the CFTC’s existing rules.”",e4274f3e0a5a52f636dafd2353d8a8c5,trafilatura

Personal finance expert Dave Ramsey is pushing back against the idea that real estate generates effortless wealth, warning investors that owning property requires ongoing work and responsibility.
Ramsey Calls Passive Real Estate Income A ‘Myth‘
In a video shared Tuesday on X, Ramsey dismissed the notion that rental properties qualify as passive income.
""People who say passive income on real estate are morons. There is nothing passive about owning real estate,"" Ramsey said. He added that landlords must deal with ""tenants, repairs, and real work"" and argued that anyone claiming otherwise is likely ""trying to sell you a get-rich-quick seminar on TikTok.""

Real Estate Requires Work, Mutual Funds Offer True Passive Income
While stressing the challenges, Ramsey emphasized he is not anti–real estate. ""Real estate is a wonderful investment. But do not go into it with rose-colored glasses thinking it's going to be easy,"" he said.
Ramsey contrasted property ownership with investing in mutual funds, which he called a genuine source of passive income. ""They send me a statement in my inbox,"" he noted, highlighting the hands-off nature of stock market investments compared with the day-to-day demands of property management.

The acquired sites are located in the Alliance submarket of Fort Worth and sit in close proximity to a nearby cargo airport, two Class I railroads and a BNSF Railway (NYSE: BRK.B) intermodal terminal.
The New York-based private equity firm highlighted anticipated growth in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, noting that its population of more than 8 million is projected to grow at a rate three times the national average through 2030.
“We are excited to add these assets to our growing portfolio and to expand our footprint in DFW,” said Phill Solomond, Stonepeak’s head of real estate, in a news release. “We believe that high-quality real estate adjacent to transport infrastructure will continue to outperform given its mission-critical role in local and national supply chains.”
Stonepeak has acquired 7.7 million square feet of logistics space since April 2024, including notable additions in major freight corridors like Dallas, Houston and Chicago. The firm’s latest acquisitions follow a flurry of activity from 3PLs in the warehouse leasing market.
The logistics industry has replaced retailers and e-commerce companies as the most active buyer group of industrial space, according to recent industry research reports. Further, 3PLs were occupiers of more 1-million-square-foot-plus properties than any other industrial vertical during the first half of this year.
Stonepeak touts $76 billion in assets under management. In April, it closed on a $3.1 billion acquisition of Air Transport Services Group. A week later, it acquired energy transportation provider Dupre Logistics and its fleet of over 700 trucks.
Eastdil Secured served as financial adviser to Stonepeak on the Fort Worth property acquisitions.

According to an Aug. 28 press release, launching USDT via RGB “opens the door for stablecoins to exist natively on Bitcoin” and will allow users to transact directly on the Bitcoin network, hold USDT and Bitcoin in the same wallet, and “send and receive value offline.”
While no timeframe has been given for USDT’s RGB-backed Bitcoin support rollout, RGB Protocol Association said, in a post on X, that the collaboration will soon unlock deeper integrations between the Lightning Network, a second-layer solution for transacting on the Bitcoin network, and the Bitcoin network itself.
These include the ability to leverage Lightning’s privacy, client-side validation as well as instant settlements via RGB’s built-in transport extension.This news comes amid a flurry of activity from Tether during the second quarter of 2025 that includes a record-setting net profit margin as well as new all-time issuance highs for USDT, which now holds $167.33 billion in market capitalization as of the time of this article’s publication, according to CoinMarketCap.
Based on available information, USDT is the largest stablecoin in the world by market cap.
Record Profits Fuel Tether’s Innovation Spree
As Coinspeaker recently reported, Tether has also shored up its staffing in the month of August, adding former US crypto official Bo Hines as strategic advisor just two weeks after resigning from his post within the Trump administration.
The firm is also working on the “QVAC Keyboard,” an AI-powered device purported to take advantage of the “Quick, Value, and Anonymous Contracts” service announced by Tether in May 2025.

Sugar prices settled higher on Thursday, with London sugar reaching a six-week high. Sugar prices rose on Thursday after Pakistan said it is seeking 100,000 MT of refined white sugar. Pakistan's government said back in June that it would import as much as 750,000 MT of sugar this year to ensure domestic availability at affordable prices.
Sugar also has a positive carryover from Tuesday, when Conab, Brazil's government crop forecasting agency, cut its Brazil 2025/26 production estimate by 3.1% to 44.5 MMT from a previous estimate of 45.9 MMT.
Sugar prices have been under pressure over the past two weeks, posting 2-week lows last Monday due to the outlook for lower sugar production in Brazil. Last Monday, Covrig Analytics reported that Brazil's sugar mills are prioritizing sugar production over ethanol, crushing more cane for sugar. This trend is expected to continue as harvesting peaks, driven by drier cane crops that prompt mills to produce more sugar.
On August 12, NY sugar rallied to a 2.5-month high on concerns over weaker cane yields in Brazil. On August 15, Unica reported that Brazil's Center-South sugar output in the second half of July fell by -0.8% y/y to 3,614 MT, and the 2025-26 Center-South sugar output through July fell -7.8% y/y to 19,268 MT. However, the percentage of sugarcane crushed for sugar by Brazil's sugar mills in the second half of July increased to 54.10% from 50.32% the same time last year. Also, Conab said last month that 2024/25 Brazil sugar production fell by -3.4% y/y to 44.118 MMT, citing lower sugarcane yields due to drought and excessive heat.
The outlook for higher sugar exports from India is negative for sugar prices after Bloomberg reported that India may permit local sugar mills to export sugar in the next season, which starts in October, as abundant monsoon rains may produce a bumper sugar crop. India's Meteorological Department reported last Friday that cumulative monsoon rain in India was 650.3 mm as of August 22, or 2% above normal. Also, the Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association recently said that it will seek permission to export 2 MMT of sugar in 2025/26.
The outlook for higher sugar production in India, the world's second-largest producer, is bearish for prices. On June 2, India's National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories projected that India's 2025/26 sugar production would climb +19% y/y to 35 MMT, citing larger planted cane acreage. That would follow a -17.5% y/y decline in India's sugar production in 2024/25 to a 5-year low of 26.2 MMT, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).
Sugar prices retreated through early July, with NY sugar falling to a 4.25-year low and London sugar sliding to a 4-year low, driven by expectations of a sugar surplus in the 2025/26 season. On June 30, commodities trader Czarnikow projected a 7.5 MMT global sugar surplus for the 2025/26 season, the largest surplus in 8 years. On May 22, the USDA, in its biannual report, projected that global 2025/26 sugar production would increase by +4.7% y/y to a record 189.318 MMT, with global sugar ending stocks at 41.188 MMT, up 7.5% y/y.
The outlook for higher sugar production in Thailand is bearish for sugar prices. On May 2, Thailand's Office of the Cane and Sugar Board reported that Thailand's 2024/25 sugar production rose +14% y/y to 10.00 MMT. Thailand is the world's third-largest sugar producer and the second-largest exporter of sugar.
The International Sugar Organization (ISO) raised its 2024/25 global sugar deficit forecast to a 9-year high of -5.47 MMT on May 15, up from a February forecast of -4.88 MMT. This indicates a tightening market following the 2023/24 global sugar surplus of 1.31 MMT. ISO also cut its 2024/25 global sugar production forecast to 174.8 MMT from a February forecast of 175.5 MMT.
The USDA, in its bi-annual report released May 22, projected that global 2025/26 sugar production would climb +4.7% y/y to a record 189.318 MMT and that global 2025/26 human sugar consumption would increase +1.4% y/y to a record 177.921 MMT. The USDA also forecasted that 2025/26 global sugar ending stocks would climb +7.5% y/y to 41.188 MMT. The USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) predicted that Brazil's 2025/26 sugar production would rise +2.3% y/y to a record 44.7 MMT FAS predicted that India's 2025/26 sugar production would rise +25% y/y to 35.3 MMT due to favorable monsoon rains and increased sugar acreage. FAS predicted that Thailand's 2025/26 sugar production will climb +2% y/y to 10.3 MMT.

But in recent years, that role has shifted under the weight of litigation trends and the surge of nuclear verdicts that have redefined liability across the industry.
Marsh, a leading insurance broker and risk advisor, is stepping in to provide freight brokers with a tailored insurance solution designed to address the heightened exposure they now face with BrokerSafe.
For decades, freight brokers operated under the assumption that liability largely rested with carriers, with insurance serving as a backstop for operational risks. That changed dramatically following the 2020 Miller v. C.H. Robinson case, which opened the door for plaintiffs to pursue brokers directly in negligence claims.
Janelle Griffith, North American logistics practice leader at Marsh said in an interview with FreightWaves. “Historically, brokers weren’t responsible for anything outside of F4A safety. But after 2020, brokers were being pulled into litigation, and nuclear verdicts automatically started to rise.”
These verdicts, often exceeding $10 million, have upended traditional insurance practices and made brokers prime targets for plaintiff attorneys who view them as the deeper pockets in the supply chain. Griffith said. “Exposure in the past was minimal. Now it’s expanded, negligent hiring, carrier vetting, and other gray areas are being pushed into courtrooms.”
The result has been a wave of insurance challenges. Many insurance carriers in the market either reduced their appetite for liability policies or withdrew altogether, just as brokers were becoming more exposed.
Marsh recognized that gap and developed BrokerSafe as a domestic insurance facility to give brokers coverage that reflects their true level of exposure. Unlike many policies traditionally written out of London, BrokerSafe’s structure is rooted in U.S. underwriting, providing brokers access to markets that had previously been reluctant to participate.
At its core, BrokerSafe is not about eliminating risk but about giving brokers tools to manage it. “What we do doesn’t make the exposure change,” Griffith said. “It’s how you protect yourself and mitigate against the exposure. We looked at the landscape, saw that brokers needed coverage, and brought together technology and relationships to create an insurance facility where underwriters are well-versed in freight brokerage.”
Technology plays a central role in BrokerSafe’s value proposition. By leveraging data transparency, Marsh has been able to help underwriters understand the nuances of broker operations. That visibility builds confidence and enables more comprehensive coverage.",ba71a853bec964034f4b4d0ad89b021c,trafilatura

",2025-08-30 01:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"PDD Holdings (PDD) has become the talk of the e-commerce world, operating China’s Pinduoduo and the fast-rising global disruptor Temu. Its latest earnings beat gave Wall Street something to cheer about, lifting shares to year-to-date (YTD) highs despite an uneasy backdrop of weak consumer demand and intensifying trade headwinds.
But scratch beneath the surface, and the picture is not as simple. Profits slipped, weighed down by massive spending to fend off rivals, subsidize merchants, and fuel international expansion — all while tariffs and price wars keep biting. From Beijing’s push to revive spending to U.S. tariffs driving up logistics costs, PDD is taking big risks in rough waters that could either cement its dominance or erode near-term returns.
Management has already cautioned that these investments will create choppiness in financials, with mounting pressure in the near term as competition intensifies. With the calendar about to flip to September, does PDD stock deserve a spot in an investor’s portfolio? Or should investors sit tight — or even quietly cash out?
About PDD Holdings Stock
PDD Holdings — founded in 2015 and headquartered in Dublin Ireland — has rapidly evolved from a discount marketplace into China’s third-largest e-commerce powerhouse. Known for Pinduoduo’s low-cost shopping model and Temu’s explosive global expansion, PDD disrupted the market by connecting farmers, merchants, and consumers directly. Rising faster than giants like Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD), PDD has turned aggressive expansion and sharp pricing into its signature edge in the global retail game. Its market capitalization currently stands at $170 billion.
PDD stock has staged a dramatic turnaround this year. After bottoming at $87.11 in April, the stock has ripped 40% off the lows and is up 26% year-to-date (YTD), breaking past the $120 mark in August and holding above it since last week. It tapped a YTD high of $133.33 after blowout second-quarter results before cooling off on management’s cautious tone.
In terms of valuation, PDD stock is priced at 16.2 times forward adjusted earnings, sitting below industry peers and its historical median, signaling the market has not fully priced in its ambitious growth story yet.
PDD’s Q2 Surprise Comes with Management’s Caution Tone
PDD Holdings delivered a mixed bag in its second-quarter results, weaving a story of solid growth and rising pressure in an increasingly cutthroat e-commerce arena. In Q2, the company reported revenue of RMB 103.98 billion ($14.52 billion), up 7% year-over-year (YOY) and slightly ahead of expectations. The top-line growth was driven by a 13% increase in online marketing services. Meanwhile, adjusted earnings of RMB 22.07 per ADS ($3.08), although down 5% annually, comfortably exceeded analyst estimates.
Shares rallied on the beat, but beneath the surface, the story was slightly complex. The top-line growth was the slowest in nearly four years. Plus, non-GAAP operating profit plunged 21% YOY to RMB 27.7 billion ($3.9 billion), while non-GAAP net income slipped 5% annually to RMB 32.7 billion ($4.6 billion) as PDD funneled billions into merchant support, marketing, and supply-chain investments. Adding to investor concerns, net cash generated from operating activities nearly halved to RMB 21.6 billion ($3 billion), mainly due to lower net income and changes in working capital.
Despite this, PDD’s liquidity position remains strong, with cash, equivalents, and short-term investments rising to RMB 387.1 billion ($54 billion) from RMB 331.6 billion as of Dec. 31, 2024, giving the company ample firepower to sustain heavy investments.
Management acknowledged intensifying competition, forcing PDD to double down on promotions and subsidies to retain users and merchants. Temu, its fast-growing international arm, is pivoting to a “fully-managed” model, giving PDD greater control over pricing, product curation, and logistics to compete with giants like Amazon’s (AMZN) scale and bargaining power.
Looking ahead, management signaled profit volatility as heavy investments continue. While China’s consumer market shows resilience, rising platform-switching behavior and regulatory uncertainties add pressure. Pro-consumption policies and online retail penetration remain strong tailwinds, but the industry’s structure is shifting fast.
PDD’s strategy — sacrificing short-term margins to expand its merchant ecosystem and drive consumer savings — reflects its intent to secure long-term dominance. Yet, with escalating competition, global economic uncertainties, and supply-chain risks, sustaining this balance won’t be easy.
Analysts monitoring PDD expect its EPS to decline 27% annually to $7.63 this year, before rebounding by 33% to $10.16 in fiscal 2026.
What Do Analysts Expect for PDD Stock?
Analysts remain divided on PDD stock after yesterday’s, painting a picture of optimism tempered by a dash of caution. Jefferies analyst Thomas Chong struck an upbeat tone, raising his price target to $146 from $121 while keeping a “Buy” rating. Chong believes PDD’s RMB 100 billion merchant support program will fuel global expansion and build customer trust, positioning Temu to deepen its international reach.
Morgan Stanley also acknowledged the “notable” profit beat despite in-line revenue, viewing the results as a sign of operational strength.
Macquarie analyst Ellie Jiang sounded even more bullish, lifting the target to $165 from $126 and maintaining an “Outperform” rating. Jiang called the results “better-than-feared,” considering intense domestic competition and Temu’s geopolitical hurdles, suggesting PDD has showcased impressive cost flexibility amid turbulence. Yet, the analyst warned that the steep intraday swings following management’s “unsustained profitability” comments reflected investor concerns around transparency and heavy ongoing investments.
The consensus rating on PDD stock remains at a “Moderate Buy” based on 18 analysts covering shares. Among them, 10 recommend a “Strong Buy,” while the remaining eight analysts advise a “Hold” rating.
PDD stock has a mean price target of $140.68, implying 15% upside potential from here. The Street-high call of $170 hints at a potential 38% rally from current levels.

Dive Brief:
-
Fresh off the release of its viral ad featuring global girl group Katseye in Gap denim, Gap Inc. on Thursday reported Q2 net sales flat to last year at $3.7 billion, with comps up 1%. Store-based sales fell 1% while e-commerce — about a third of net sales — rose 3%.
-
Old Navy net sales rose 1% to $2.2 billion, with comps up 2%; Gap rose 1% to $772 million, with comps up 4%; Banana Republic fell 1% to $475 million, with comps up 4%; and Athleta fell 11% to $300 million, with comps down 9%.
-
Gross margin contracted 140 basis points to 41.2%, and merchandise margin contracted 150 basis points. Net income rose nearly 5% to $216 million. Inventory was up 9%, mostly due to higher tariffs and the effort to import merchandise before duties increased.
Dive Insight:
Richard Dickson, who arrived in August 2023 as CEO with Gap Inc. in the doldrums, touted the company’s progress on a call with analysts Thursday.
“We still have plenty of work to do, because transformation of this scale takes time. However, it's clear we're now operating from a position of strength, one that's proving essential as we navigate an increasingly dynamic and complex environment,” he said. “Our strategic priorities define the framework that has enabled us to perform while we've been transforming over the last two years, first maintaining financial and operational rigor.”
This has become fundamental to the company’s operations, and showed up in Q2 with gross margin expansion of 360 basis points to 41.2% compared to two years ago, he also said.
Dickson also called out a return to cultural relevance, especially at Gap, which had long ceded its status by the time he arrived.
“The Gap brand is building momentum, reclaiming its place in the cultural conversation with credibility,” he said. “We see a clear path forward for this brand, and are confident in our ability to build on this position of strength, fueling sustained growth for the brand over time.”
Gap Inc. hit a nerve about a week ago with its “Better in Denim” spot, featuring Katseye dancing to “Milkshake” in early aughts-inspired denim pieces. That was fueled in part by lingering controversy over American Eagle’s earlier denim ad featuring Sydney Sweeney, as well as dance moves that inspired TikTok users.
""Gap has been riding a wave of momentum from the flagship brand’s renewed cultural relevance, supported by a consistent showing by Old Navy and significant improvement in Banana Republic’s comp sales,” Emarketer Principal Analyst Sky Canaves said in emailed comments.",2c0d5bf27bfeb19134d5815c44a2210f,trafilatura

The shares have pulled back from their Aug. 12, record high of $117.70, but the $100 level has been providing support since late July. It looks like a historically bullish signal currently flashing might help the equity to more record highs soon enough, though.
According to Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, HOOD is within 0.75 of the 50-day trendline's 20-day average true range (ATR), after spending at least 80% of the last 10 days, and 80% of the last two months above it. This has happened eight other times in the past three years, after which the equity was higher one month later 63% of the time, averaging a 16% gain. A move of similar magnitude from the equity's current perch would put it at $120.09 -- a new all-time peak.
Short-term options traders lean overwhelmingly bearish toward HOOD. This is per its Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR), which ranks in the 98th percentile of annual readings. An unwinding of this pessimism could create even more tailwinds for Robinhood stock.
Now looks like an excellent opportunity to bet on the equity's next moves, as its Schaeffer’s Volatility Scorecard (SVS) ranks at 85 out of 100. In other words, HOOD has tended to exceed volatility expectations in the past year -- a boon for options buyers.",389e4e4d5780e456b31fad602de009c9,trafilatura

The costs will eventually reach most American families through price hikes and less competition in many product categories.
US businesses are reluctant to criticize Trump’s tariffs, lest Trump retaliate against them. But they’re legally obligated to tell shareholders about anything that affects their financial performance. And there was lots of tariff talk during the second quarter earnings season, which is just wrapping up.
A Yahoo Finance analysis of earnings calls found that tariffs and other aspects of Trump’s trade war are harming profits and forcing price hikes in at least seven of the 11 sectors that comprise the S&P 500 stock index. Four sectors are relatively unscathed: Communication Services (XLC), Financials (XLF), Real Estate (XLRE), Utilities (XLU). Those sectors include 161 of the S&P 500 companies, and they generally involve services not subject to tariffs or are domestic in nature.
The other seven sectors are bearing most of the cost of new import taxes, which have jumped from $7 billion before Trump took office to around $30 billion now, and could go as high as $50 billion per month. Yahoo Finance’s Grace O’Donnell tracked specific mentions of tariffs in earnings calls for dozens of prominent companies during the second quarter. Here are some examples of steep tariff impacts among the seven sectors, which include 68% of the companies in the S&P 500:
Consumer Discretionary (XLY): General Motors (GM) cited a $1.1 billion tariff hit to profits in the second quarter. Ford (F) said tariffs will shave $2 billion in profits for the year. Deckers Outdoor (DECK) plans to raise prices because of tariffs. Home Depot (HD) plans to raise prices and offer fewer promotions. Discount retailer TJX (TJX)also plans price hikes.
Consumer Staples (XLP): Walmart (WMT) said, “We’ve continued to see our costs increase each week, which we expect will continue.” Keurig Dr. Pepper (KDP) said that ""commodity inflation will build” and “tariff impacts will become prominent.” Kraft Heinz (KHC) said tariffs could reduce profit margins this year by 1 to 1.8 percentage points.
Energy (XLE): SolarEdge (SEDG) said the Trump tariffs could cut profit margins by 2 percentage points. Sunrun (RUN) pegged its tariff-related losses at around $1,000 per customer. Baker Hughes (BKR) said tariffs could cost it up to $200 million this year.
Health Care (XLV): GE Healthcare (GEHC) said profit margins dropped by 1.8 percentage points due to tariffs. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) blamed tariffs for a $200 million hit to profits in the quarter. Medtronic (MDT), the huge medical device maker, said its tariff hit was $185 million.
Industrials (XLI): Caterpillar (CAT) expects tariffs to drain up to $1.5 billion from annual profits. Deere (DE) said its tariff hit will be around $600 million. Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) said it has already raised prices to offset higher tariff costs and may do so again.
Technology (XLK): Apple (AAPL) said it incurred $800 million in tariff-related costs in the second quarter. Nvidia (NVDA) said new export restrictions relating to China blocked $5.5 billion of sales in the second quarter. AMD (AMD) said the same export restrictions cost it $800 million during the quarter.
Materials (XLB): Dow (DOW) said tariff-related uncertainties cut into sales in some units. International Paper (IP) said tariff uncertainty contributed to soft sales and earnings that fell short of expectations. Alcoa (AA) said tariffs cost it $115 million in the quarter.
Some companies are benefiting from the tariffs. Steelmaker Nucor (NUE)said less competition from imports allowed it to raise prices. Financial firms such as Citi have said greater volatility caused by Trump’s trade war is likely to be good for business, because it increases demand for their services and boosts fee income. But many economists argue that tariffs are still harmful, because the damage caused by higher costs and less competition far outweighs the benefits to a small number of protected firms and industries.
So if Trump’s tariffs are causing widespread damage, why do US stocks keep hitting new record highs? Three or four possible reasons.
One is that the artificial intelligence boom is so powerful that the upward march of Big Tech names such as Nvidia, Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) swamps the smaller effect of tariff backpedaling.
Another is that large-cap US stocks are not the same as the real economy. Investors bidding those shares up may think US companies can ultimately pass along most of the higher costs tariffs are causing, which could lower economic growth but keep corporate earnings intact. The biggest US firms earn about 40% of their revenue outside the United States, providing a considerable cushion against an American downturn.
A third possibility is that the Trump tariffs really will weigh down stocks — and that it just hasn’t happened yet. It's also worth pointing out that while US stocks have risen by about 10% this year, global stocks excluding the United States have risen by 20%. American shares are underperforming, and Trump's trade war may be a big part of the reason.
Future earnings will provide many more clues.

According to ARK’s daily trading update on August 27, the firm acquired 339,113 shares of BitMine across three of its exchange-traded funds.
The ARK Innovation ETF added 227,569 shares worth $10.48 million; the Next Generation Internet ETF picked up 70,991 shares valued at $3.27 million; and the Fintech Innovation ETF bought 40,553 shares for $1.87 million.
BMNR closed at $46.03 before slipping another 7.85% in after-hours trading, according to Google Finance.
Cathie Wood Shows Confidence in Ethereum With Fresh BitMine Buys
The investment builds on ARK’s earlier accumulation of BitMine stock, which has surpassed $200 million in purchases this summer.
The decision shows Wood’s growing confidence in BitMine’s Ethereum-focused strategy, even as the firm continues to adjust its portfolios by trimming holdings in Coinbase, Roblox, and other fintech names.
Late last month, ARK offloaded $90.5 million worth of Coinbase shares and $57.7 million in Roblox stock, while adding exposure to BitMine as well as companies like AMD, DoorDash, and Airbnb.
BitMine, chaired by Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, has quickly emerged as one of the most talked-about names in the digital asset sector. The company shifted from a Bitcoin mining model to an Ethereum-focused treasury strategy earlier this summer, a move that triggered a dramatic surge in its stock price.
Shares of BitMine soared more than 3,000% to a record high of $135 in early July before retreating, though the stock is still up over 400% year-to-date.
The firm now holds 1.71 million ether, worth about $8 billion as of August 24, making it the single largest Ethereum treasury globally. That balance sheet strength has drawn institutional attention, with billionaire investor Peter Thiel taking a 9.1% stake in the company last month.
The endorsement, combined with ARK’s sustained buying, has fueled market speculation that BitMine could become a leading proxy for Ethereum exposure among traditional investors.
The timing of ARK’s latest purchase comes amid heightened volatility in both equities and crypto markets.
Ethereum itself has struggled to break higher in recent weeks after reaching an all-time high, but the strategic bet on BitMine reflects Wood’s long-term focus on decentralized finance as a driver of growth.
Social media reaction from traders and crypto enthusiasts has framed the move as a bullish sign, pointing to BitMine’s role as a key corporate holder of ether.",26f66751c1d3ae32bd7368e479083438,trafilatura

The intensity of this bearish momentum has created unprecedented demand for tactical trading instruments. The Defiance Daily Target 2x Short PLTR ETF (PLTZ), has emerged as the go-to vehicle for investors seeking amplified exposure to Palantir's downside.
With cash-rich short sellers making headlines and ETF innovation hitting overdrive, could PLTZ be the next billion-dollar trade? Let’s find out.
Overview of PLTZ
The Defiance Daily Target 2x Short PLTR ETF, hits the market with a very pointed focus: it aims to deliver -200% of Palantir Technologies’ daily share price moves. That means for every 1% Palantir drops in a day, PLTZ is designed to climb 2%; likewise, a 1% surge in Palantir can cut PLTZ's return by 2%.
The approach here is rooted in short-term, high-leverage exposure and not a “set and forget” affair, but a way to mirror and then amplify Palantir’s daily direction, always recalibrated at close. The strategy involves using swaps and synthetic positions, not by holding Palantir itself, but by tracking its moves through financial instruments meant to reset exposure every day.
PLTZ comes from Defiance ETFs, a fund family known for pushing into the niche corners of the ETF universe. Since its inception on June 5, 2025, and first trade on June 6, the ETF has steadily grown its managed assets to about $27.6 million. The fund lists a $1.29% management fee, running above most traditional products but in line with similar leveraged ETFs.
Its holdings are structured for one thing: precise, inverse exposure to Palantir, and the portfolio reflects this with swaps featuring the stock at their core, plus significant positions in cash and government obligations. The ETF’s synthetic Palantir swap forms the heart of the exposure at -199.91% of net assets, while cash and equivalents, listed at 282.15%, and a government obligations fund, First American Government Obligations Fund (FGXXX) (17.75%), balance the structure out.",e7b7ee41b68d5390934e7e3e0f768d73,trafilatura

The firm’s strategy was approved by its board of directors, allowing it to allocate a portion of its treasury to acquire LINK—the token that powers a Chainlink’s oracle network, which brings real-world data to blockchain apps. Caliber will use its balance sheet and existing access to capital to acquire LINK, though the firm has not shared how much it intends to acquire.
“This strategy combines what Caliber already does best—raising and managing capital in private equity real estate funds—with one of the most promising financial technologies of our time,” Caliber CEO Chris Loeffler told Decrypt.
“That technology, Chainlink, is directly applicable to our existing real estate business and it will help us to better automate our real estate value calculations (NAV automation), help better administer our funds, and it can help us potentially provide stronger liquidity options for our suite of private funds,"" he added.
In addition to the digital asset treasury, the board of directors approved the creation of the Caliber Crypto Advisory Board—a group of crypto and blockchain experts that will help guide the firm’s digital asset treasury strategy. Loeffler told Decrypt that the board’s composition would be announced soon.
Shares in Caliber (CWD) are up 59% since the opening bell on Thursday, now trading hands at $2.70. However, the stock has traded down nearly 4% in the last month and 78% in the last year.
As for why investors would choose CWD shares over buying LINK itself, Loeffler told Decrypt that “it’s a leverage play.”
“We’re going to give them leverage through our consistent acquisition, through the staking process,” he said. “If they’re a big investor in Chainlink already and they want to take a position in Caliber to get sort of a levered play on that, that would be the way to think about it.”
US Commerce Dept. Puts GDP Data on Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana Blockchains
In the near future, it may not be eligible for trading on the Nasdaq, though. A filing with the SEC from Wednesday indicates that Caliber received a letter stating it was no longer in compliance with Nasdaq’s Stockholder Equity Requirement, and therefore has 45 days to provide a plan to Nasdaq which would satisfy that requirement. If it fails to do so, its stock could be delisted from the exchange.
Chainlink (LINK) is up around 2.5% in the last 24 hours and more than 41% on the month.",b6c0bd4271416e0d05446811b4dbea4b,trafilatura

Dive Brief:
-
Despite industry headwinds, Ulta Beauty’s second quarter net sales increased 9.3% to $2.8 billion, according to a company release Thursday. The growth was due in part to the acquisition of U.K. retailer Space NK.
-
The company’s comparable sales jumped 6.7% in the quarter due to a 3.7% increase in transactions and a 2.9% increase in average ticket. Ulta’s gross profit increased 11.6% and net income grew 3.3%.
-
The beauty retailer raised its full-year financial outlook, now expecting net sales in a range from $12 billion to $12.1 billion and comp growth from 2.5% to 3.5%.
Dive Insight:
Ulta’s latest results show that at least some consumers continue to shop for discretionary goods despite macro pressures.
“As we look to the future, we remain committed to executing our Ulta Beauty Unleashed strategy and strengthening our operating model,” CEO Kecia Steelman said in a statement. “Our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects both the strength of our year-to-date performance and our caution around how consumer demand may evolve in the second half of the year. While near-term uncertainty persists, we’re staying focused on what we can control and on executing with excellence to deliver our uniquely Ulta Beauty experience.”
During the quarter, Ulta opened 24 new stores and now expects to open 63 new stores for the year (compared to the previously expected 60 new locations). On a call with analysts, Steelman noted that fragrance continued to be Ulta’s strongest category with double-digit growth in the quarter, and the retailer began selling 24 new brands in Q2.
The retailer’s latest earnings results follow news earlier this month that it mutually agreed to end the Ulta Beauty at Target shop-in-shop partnership next year. Steelman said on the call that revenue from the shop-in-shops contributed to “well below 1%” of Ulta’s net sales for fiscal 2024.
The company instead is investing more into its international growth. Acquiring the already established Space NK business allowed Ulta to take a capital sensitive approach to entering a large beauty market, Steelman said.
Both Steelman and interim CFO Chris Lialios acknowledged the existing dynamic economic environment and evolving trade policies. However, consumer engagement with beauty and wellness remains healthy, per the executives.
The company saw low-single-digit growth with its mass offerings and mid-single-digit growth in prestige beauty during the quarter, per Steelman.",2fe53aca30b340a3911838f2525f6de4,trafilatura

Standard car insurance typically does not cover aftermarket parts that are added to a vehicle to boost its performance or appeal. Insurers price their coverage based on costs to repair or replace a vehicle as it came from the original manufacturer.
If you want to insure your aftermarket modifications — things like amped-up stereos or suspension systems, custom rims, tinted windows, cosmetic paint jobs, and more — you’ll need to add an optional endorsement to your auto insurance policy called custom parts and equipment (CPE) coverage.
This embedded content is not available in your region.
Learn more: How does car insurance work? The basics explained.
What is custom parts and equipment coverage?
Custom parts and equipment coverage is optional insurance that covers aftermarket modifications made to enhance your vehicle’s looks or performance. It is not for aftermarket parts — a term used for non-manufacturer parts — that your mechanic finds and installs to keep the car running.
A custom parts and equipment endorsement, or rider, can be added to your car insurance policy for as little as several dollars a month. The coverage will specify a maximum payout amount per event or car accident, usually between $2,000 and $10,000. The typical coverage limit is $5,000.
The CPE endorsement is added to your comprehensive or collision insurance policy and covers your aftermarket “mods” under the same terms. If you have an accident that’s covered by comprehensive or collision, replacement or repair of your custom upgrades will be included in your claim. Likewise, the same single car insurance deductible applies.
Learn more: Most common types of car insurance explained
What modifications need extra insurance?
Any part you install on the car that did not come from the factory as part of the original model is considered a modification and could require custom parts and equipment coverage. Common examples include:
-
Custom wheels and rims
-
Oversized and custom tires
-
Speakers, TVs, DVD players, and other electronic equipment
-
Leather seat covers
-
Roll bars
-
Trailer hitches
-
Bed liners
-
Running boards
-
Tinting
-
Custom paint jobs
-
Strut bars
-
Spoilers
-
Navigation systems
-
Undercarriage lighting, fog lights, and other custom lights
What is not covered by custom parts and equipment insurance?
A CPE rider will not cover:
-
Illegal or homemade modifications
-
Certain suspension modifications
-
Snow plowing equipment
-
Custom part repairs that exceed your coverage limit
Does regular insurance cover aftermarket parts?
In a few states, aftermarket parts are automatically covered up to $1,000 in comprehensive and collision policies. In addition, some insurers may include certain types of modifications in your comprehensive or collision coverage, particularly if those modifications are considered safety components. An example might be an anti-theft device or rear-view camera. In fact, some of these can potentially lead to auto insurance discounts.
In general, though, you’ll want to assume that the insurer is not going to cover any modifications or enhancements you make to your car. Review the policy’s fine print or call your insurance company to ask. It’s important to note that “full coverage” does not mean aftermarket parts are included.
Having “full coverage” simply means having all three categories of insurance:
-
Comprehensive insurance
-
Collision insurance
When the insurer prices standard auto insurance policies, it assumes you drive a model that includes only factory parts.
Informing your insurance company about modifications
In most cases, aftermarket parts do not void your regular insurance coverage. But if you use aftermarket parts that could compromise safety, the insurance company could conceivably void your policy and refuse to make any payouts at all. Examples include changes to the suspension system that affect the way the car handles, spoilers or scoops that make the car faster, or engine modifications that boost its speed.
That’s why it’s a good idea to inform your auto insurer of any changes you make to the vehicle. In addition, if you want the insurer to cover an added part, it’s a good bet the insurer will need to know about the part before you file a claim.
Custom parts and equipment frequently asked questions
Does insurance cover rim damage?
Original rims that came with the car, or that were installed to the manufacturer’s specifications, are covered just like other parts of the car under your comprehensive and collision insurance. If the rims are damaged in a covered event — say you hit rocks or a pothole — standard rims will be covered, though repairs in many cases may not exceed your deductible amount.
However, if you have added aftermarket rims, then you will need to add a custom parts and equipment endorsement to your policy to cover them.
The tire and wheel insurance marketed by car dealers often covers 100% of the cost of repairs or replacement of damaged rims and tires on the car at the time of sale. Many insurers offer similar plans at a much-reduced cost.
Which insurance companies offer custom parts and equipment coverage?
Not all insurance companies offer custom parts and equipment insurance. If your provider doesn’t have this option, shop for quotes with Progressive, Elephant Insurance, Farmers Insurance, among others.
What does custom parts insurance cost?
According to Insurance Panda, you will likely pay a few dollars more per month after adding a CPE rider to your auto policy. You can assume the added annual premium will be about 10% of the value of your modifications.",706cdf8191d6c1d12b4b459d7244c221,trafilatura

One of two daily shifts building each of those nameplates at Factory Zero will be idled from Sept. 2 until Oct. 6, a person familiar with the plan told Automotive News.
The cutback does not affect production of the Chevrolet Silverado EV and GMC Sierra EV full-size pickups also built at Factory Zero, the person said.

The 360 affected employees include about 200 who were supposed to be on layoff during the week of Aug. 25 and return Sept. 2. Those workers now will remain off until Oct. 6.
In a statement, GM spokesperson Kevin Kelly said the shift reductions are “temporary adjustments to production to align to market dynamics.”
“General Motors updates schedules as part of our standard process of aligning production to manage vehicle inventory,” the statement said. “Impacted employees will be placed on a temporary layoff and may be eligible for subpay and benefits in accordance with the GM-UAW national contract.”
The Detroit Free Press reported the production slowdown earlier Aug. 28.

Factory Zero has had temporary layoffs multiple times this year. In April, GM idled about 200 of the plant’s 4,000 employees. Roughly 150 have returned to work since then, the source said.
In the first half of the year, GM sold 3,766 of the Escalade IQ full-size SUV in the U.S. and 7,987 of the Hummer EV, which comes in pickup and SUV form. Industrywide, EV demand has lagged expectations, and a federal tax credit for purchases and leases of new EVs is set to end Sept. 30.

In the middle of this storm, Apple (AAPL) is gearing up for its biggest moment of the year.
On Sept. 9, all eyes will be on Apple Park in Cupertino, where CEO Tim Cook will unveil the much-hyped iPhone 17 lineup at the company’s annual fall event. The invite teases an “awe dropping” experience, hinting at a redesigned, ultra-thin iPhone alongside refreshed Pro models, upgraded cameras, and next-gen Apple Watches.
But this launch is not just about shiny new gadgets. With slowing upgrade cycles, retiring Plus models, and analysts hinting at a possible AAPL stock selloff, the event could be a defining moment. For fans, it’s about the magic, but for investors, it’s about momentum. Sept. 9 will decide which side wins.
About Apple Stock
California-based Apple needs no introduction. Founded in 1976, the tech titan revolutionized personal computing with the Macintosh in 1984, reshaped music with the iPod, and transformed communication with the iPhone. Boasting a $3.4 trillion market capitalization, Apple leads innovation with the iPhone, iPad, Mac, AirPods, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro.
Its six platforms — iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, visionOS, and tvOS — deliver seamless integration, fueling services like the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud, and Apple TV+. Known for its ecosystem, brand loyalty, and global scale, Apple remains a defining force in consumer technology and digital ecosystems, setting trends the world continues to follow.
Apple might be the king of innovation, but its shares have not been spared from the market headwinds in 2025. AAPL stock is down 7% year-to-date (YTD) and trades 10% below its 52-week high of $260.10. Escalating trade tensions, looming tariffs, and regulatory headwinds have forced Apple to rethink its manufacturing footprint, while intensifying AI competition adds to investor jitters.
Technically, though, AAPL stock is showing signs of strength. After bottoming near the $200 level in early August, the stock has staged a rebound over the past few weeks, breaking above its 50-day moving average and challenging the $235–$237 resistance band. A breakout here could trigger a momentum run back toward the $255-$260 zone. The 14-day RSI has bounced off oversold levels, suggesting buyers are regaining control, while volume upticks confirm institutional nibbling.
Apple stock trades at a lofty 31.1 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, well above the sector — a premium that signals both power and pressure. While its ecosystem, dominance, and brand loyalty justify some of that markup, with single-digit earnings growth projected for fiscal 2026, much of the optimism is already priced in. Investors are paying up for certainty, but the upside may depend on Apple’s next big innovation play.
That same confidence shows in shareholder returns. The iPhone-maker has boosted payouts for 13-straight years, with a recent $0.26 dividend in August. This takes the annual payout to $1.04, offering a modest 0.44% forward yield. Yet with a lean 13.8% payout ratio, Apple has ample firepower to keep rewarding investors. For now, its premium price reflects both trust in its empire and expectations of what’s still to come.
A Snapshot of Apple’s Q3 Results
On July 31, Apple released its third-quarter earnings report, and it was nothing short of a blockbuster. Revenue surged 10% year-over-year (YOY) to $94 billion. EPS climbed 12% to $1.57, surpassing Wall Street’s projections by 10.6%. Across the board, Apple smashed Street estimates, underscoring its strong fundamentals despite a shaky macro backdrop.
The iPhone led the charge with a 13% YOY jump to $44.6 billion, reflecting a solid iPhone 16 lineup sale. Meanwhile, services revenue soared to an all-time high of $27.4 billion, also up by 13% annually. Mac generated $8.05 billion in revenue, and iPad brought in $6.6 billion. Apple’s gross margin came in at a healthy 46.5% at the high end of Apple’s guidance range.
Plus, Apple’s growth was not confined to one region — the company reported gains across the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Asia Pacific, pushing its installed device base to new highs globally.
Shareholders also reaped the rewards, with Apple returning over $27 billion to shareholders — $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $21 billion through open market repurchases of 104 million Apple shares. Despite the substantial outflows, the company concluded the quarter with a robust $36.3 billion cash reserve, underscoring its balance sheet strength and sustained liquidity position.
But beyond the headlines, a different narrative brews — geopolitical pressures. CEO Tim Cook revealed Apple absorbed $800 million in tariff-related costs in Q3 and expects that to swell to $1.1 billion next quarter if trade tensions persist. While Apple is expanding manufacturing in India and Vietnam, China remains its dominant production hub, making diversification a long, capital-intensive road.
The U.S. administration’s stance complicates matters further. While iPhone imports from India are exempt from the 50% tariff and proposed chip tariffs won’t hit Apple, calls for domestic manufacturing could inflate costs and risk pricing Apple’s flagship products out of reach for many U.S. consumers.
Despite stellar numbers, AAPL stock closed in the red on Aug. 1, dragged down by broader market selloffs, tariff fears, and concerns about demand pull-forward ahead of potential policy shifts.
Looking ahead, Apple anticipates momentum to continue into the current quarter. Management is guiding for mid-to-high single-digit annual revenue growth this quarter, with services expected to keep clocking double-digit gains. Gross margins are projected to be between 46% and 47% even after absorbing the tariff hit flagged by the CEO.
Analysts monitoring the company remain optimistic, predicting EPS to be around $7.35 for fiscal 2025, up 8.9% YOY, before surging by another 6.3% annually to $7.81 in fiscal 2026.
What Do Analysts Expect for Apple Stock?
As the countdown to Apple’s Sept. 9 event begins, Wall Street’s outlook is split. Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan expects the event to deliver only incremental updates over the iPhone lineup, with the spotlight on a super-thin iPhone Air. The analyst maintains a “Buy” rating on AAPL with a $250 price target but warns of a potential “sell-the-news” dip, a familiar trend in which Apple stock retreats after launch before rebounding within 30 to 60 days.
On the other hand, Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani sees an opportunity beyond the iPhone 17 itself. While he does not expect a major upgrade cycle from this launch, he is bullish on Apple’s AI roadmap, especially reports of a potential tie-up with Google’s (GOOGL) Gemini to revamp Siri. Daryanani rates AAPL stock as an “Outperform” with a $250 target, believing AI integration — not hardware tweaks — could reignite consumer excitement.
AAPL stock has a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating overall, a vote of confidence tempered with caution. Out of 38 analysts covering the tech stock, 19 recommend a “Strong Buy,” two give a “Moderate Buy,” 15 analysts stay cautious with a “Hold” rating, and two have a “Strong Sell” rating.
The average analyst price target for AAPL stock is $235.44, indicating a potential upside of 1%. The Street-high target price of $300 suggests that the stock could rally as much as 29% from here.
Final Thoughts on Apple
Apple has long been synonymous with cutting-edge innovation, yet in the fast-moving AI arena, its measured pace has raised eyebrows on Wall Street. Competitors are pushing boundaries, while Apple quietly taps allies to maintain its edge.
As the Sept. 9 iPhone 17 unveiling nears, experts express caution over a typical post-launch pullback, given the modest upgrades. Still, past patterns hint at a rebound within weeks if Apple delivers unexpected flair — like daring AI features, strategic pricing, or a sleek, attention-grabbing iPhone Air.

Despite the broader crypto market sentiment leaning bearish, where Bitcoin price slid below $110,000 and dragged top altcoins lower, LINK defied market trends this week. Trading as high as $25.50 intraday, Chainlink erased its seven-day timeframe losses, buoyed by a dual catalyst of fresh ecosystem announcements.
After Bitwise filed to launch a spot LINK ETF on Wednesday, market interest intensified on Thursday as the US Department of Commerce (DOC) confirmed it will publish official macroeconomic data on-chain using Chainlink and Pyth Network.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) will now release critical indicators such as Real GDP, the PCE Price Index, and Real Final Sales to Private Domestic Purchasers directly across multiple blockchain ecosystems.
In its official blog announcement, Chainlink emphasized the transformative potential of this integration: automated trading strategies, composable tokenized assets, real-time prediction markets, and DeFi risk management can now be powered by trusted government data.
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hailed the move as cementing America’s role as the blockchain capital of the world, highlighting 3.3% GDP growth as one of the first data points published on-chain. The BEA data feeds are updated monthly or quarterly and initially deployed across networks such as Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Optimism, and ZKsync, with more to come.
“This step shows how government data on-chain can fuel a new wave of transparency, innovation, and adoption,” said Mike Cahill, founder of Douro Labs and core contributor to Pyth.
For Chainlink, the deal represents a milestone in its deepening government ties in 2025, following months of policy discussions with US regulators.
Chainlink Price Forecast: Can Bulls Extend Rally Beyond $27?
Following the intraday rally to seven-month peaks near $26 on Thursday, LINK price now sits just below its short-term resistance cluster around $24.70. The daily chart shows that despite last week’s correction, bulls defended the $23.50 region, a level where both the 13-day SMA and MACD signal line converge, providing the base for the latest breakout.
The MACD histogram has just flipped green again, signaling renewed bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the 5- and 8-day SMAs are curling upward, hinting at a potential bullish crossover if sustained buying continues.
If Chainlink price closes above $25.50 and sustains momentum, the next upside targets lie at $27.20 and $29.50, with the latter aligning with February’s local top. A break above $30 could set the stage for a retest of $32, opening the door to a broader continuation rally.",f650fc5c585abcfb67ed7ad5b0b2b23c,trafilatura

CrowdStrike beat revenue and adjusted earnings expectations in its second fiscal quarter.
-
Third-quarter revenue guidance came in a tad light, and management also announced a bolt-on acquisition.
-
However, AI-based commentary on a second-half reacceleration in ARR appears to be encouraging investors today.
Shares of CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) initially dipped this morning, as much as 3.2%, before rebounding to a 4.3% gain as of 2:08 p.m. ET.
CrowdStrike delivered earnings last night that beat expectations, as has been the pattern for the formidable cybersecurity company. And while it looked as though slightly underwhelming guidance for next quarter initially led to a sell-off, investors who took time to listen to management's comments and view the longer-term picture eventually sent the stock higher.
CrowdStrike strikes again with a quarterly beat
In its fiscal second quarter, CrowdStrike delivered revenue growth of 21.4% to $1.17 billion, ahead of expectations, with adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings per share of $0.93, up just 5.7%, but also ahead of expectations.
CrowdStrike is a high-performing, artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled cybersecurity disruptor that typically beats expectations; however, there was a bit of a post-earnings hiccup when the company only guided for $1.21 billion to $1.22 billion in revenue for the current quarter, which was a tad short of the $1.23 billion estimated by Wall Street analysts. Additionally, CrowdStrike announced a bolt-on acquisition of Onum, a real-time data telemetry company that CrowdStrike will add to its next-gen SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) products. While the acquisition could be a positive, it will likely mean either more dilution or cash used for the purchase. CrowdStrike didn't disclose a purchase price.
While those details may have spurred a short sell-off given CrowdStrike's high valuation, commentary from CEO George Kurtz was very positive, with an emphasis on revenue and annualized recurring revenue (ARR) acceleration in the coming quarters. For instance, while net new ARR was over 20% last quarter, Kurtz sees new ARR accelerating to at least 40% year-over-year growth in the second half of the year.
CrowdStrike is a thematic leader, but at a price
No doubt, customers are flocking to CrowdStrike, which built its cybersecurity software platform from the ground up as a data mining AI-inspired platform in which the data it generates consistently reinforces CrowdStrike's algorithms in a virtuous flywheel of constant improvement. That appears to be resonating in today's cloud-based AI-driven era.",cceb5dfcdfa36533a98e90075e1c6ab2,trafilatura

Acting Chair Caroline Pham positioned the guidance as a remedy for trading activity that departed during previous enforcement actions.
The advisory reaffirms the CFTC’s framework established in the 1990s, which allows foreign exchanges to register and serve US traders across all asset classes, including digital assets.
Pham stated the guidance provides “regulatory clarity needed to legally onshore trading activity that was driven out of the United States due to the unprecedented regulation by enforcement approach of the past several years.”
The Division of Market Oversight received an increased number of inquiries about FBOT registration requirements and procedures as global derivatives markets expanded into new asset classes and trading platforms.
Recent enforcement actions created confusion about whether non-US exchanges should register as designated contract markets or foreign boards of trade, prompting the clarification.
Path to US markets
The advisory addresses disruption caused by what CFTC describes as novel enforcement interpretations inconsistent with decades of precedent.
American companies forced to establish operations in foreign jurisdictions for crypto asset trading now have a defined path to return to US markets through FBOT registration.
Foreign exchanges must demonstrate comparable regulatory supervision in their home countries and establish information-sharing agreements with US authorities.
Registered FBOTs can provide direct access to eligible US participants, including proprietary traders and registered intermediaries like futures commission merchants.
Universal application
The framework applies universally across traditional and digital asset markets, requiring no distinction between asset classes for registration purposes.
To maintain the highest standards of customer protection, all trades must be cleared through CFTC-registered firms or entities exempt under Regulation 30.10.
Pham characterized the advisory as delivering wins for President Donald Trump’s crypto sprint initiative, stating Americans can now “trade efficiently and safely under CFTC regulations” while opening US markets to global participants.
Notably, the advisory comes one day after the CFTC announced the integration of Nasdaq’s surveillance system, aiming to ramp up the oversight of crypto and derivatives trading.",8611a0a0df8b5e74d90eb59e5598aac9,trafilatura

-
Hormel posted a slight sales beat in fiscal Q3, but earnings were weaker than expected.
-
The foods giant guided for a significant slowdown for organic sales growth in the current quarter.
-
Hormel's earnings guidance also disappointed investors.
Hormel (NYSE: HRL) stock is falling fast in Thursday's trading. The company's share price was down 12.9% as of 2:40 p.m. ET despite relatively little movement for the broader market. The stock had been down as much as 18.3% shortly after stocks started trading today.
Before the market opened this morning, Hormel published results for the third quarter of its 2025 fiscal year, which concluded July 27. While sales for the period beat Wall Street's forecast, the company posted a substantial earnings miss. Management's forward guidance also suggests more headwinds are on the horizon.
Hormel stock sinks on soft Q2 profit
Hormel recorded non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $0.35 on sales of $3.03 billion in fiscal Q3. For comparison, the average Wall Street analyst estimate had called for adjusted per-share earnings of $0.41 on revenue of $2.98 billion. Organic sales were up 6% year over year in the period, and total revenue was up 4.5%. Meanwhile the company's earnings per share declined 5.4% compared to the prior-year period. Making matters worse, the foods giant issued disappointing forward guidance.
What's next for Hormel?
For the current quarter, Hormel is guiding for revenue between $3.15 billion and $3.25 billion. For reference, the business posted sales of $3.1 billion in last year's quarter. Meanwhile, organic net sales growth is projected to come in between 1% and 4% -- marking a substantial deceleration from last quarter's growth rate.
The company guided for adjusted earnings per share to be between $0.38 and $0.40 this quarter -- suggesting a dip from last year's per-share profit of $0.42. Along with the disappointing sales outlook, Hormel expects that progression on its profit recovery will lag into next year.

U.S. healthcare stocks are now trading at their steepest discount to the rest of the market in three decades. The sector's forward price-to-earnings ratio is around 16x, well below the S&P 500’s 22x and much less than tech’s lofty 30x, which highlights just how undervalued healthcare is for the earnings offered.
AbbVie (ABBV) has climbed 17.25% year-to-date (YTD), well ahead of its sector, while Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has returned a solid 22.04% in the same period. Both have delivered strong quarterly results; AbbVie posted $2.97 per share and Johnson & Johnson $2.77. With market values at $366.6 billion and $429.7 billion, they stand out as major players when much of the sector has struggled.
August has been tagged by Evercore as a potential turnaround month for healthcare, and AbbVie’s and Johnson & Johnson’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, 17.50x and 16.51x, compare favorably to the sector average of 18.17. Could these bargains offer even more upside potential than big names like UnitedHealth (UNH) with a ratio of 18.97x, above the sector average? Let's dig deeper.
AbbVie Inc. (ABBV)
AbbVie is a global drugmaker that develops and sells medicines across immunology, oncology, neuroscience, and aesthetics, shifting from older blockbusters like Humira to next‑generation therapies with a broader, innovation‑driven portfolio.
ABBV stock is up 5.59% over the past 52 weeks and 9.8% in the past month, showing steady momentum that has led sector peers in recent weeks.
A strong dividend adds support, with a 3.11% yield versus the healthcare average of 1.58%, a forward payout ratio of 59.92%, and 53 straight years of increases, signaling consistent cash generation and disciplined capital returns.
Second‑quarter 2025 results were solid: adjusted EPS of $2.97, up 12.1% year over year, on net revenue of $15.423 billion, up 6.6%. Immunology remains the anchor, with Skyrizi and Rinvoq together tracking toward more than $25 billion in 2025 revenue to more than offset Humira softness, while neuroscience and oncology are adding double‑digit growth that diversifies earnings and reduces concentration risk. Guidance moved higher, with full‑year adjusted EPS now $11.88–$12.08 and revenue guided to $60.5 billion, even after accounting for R&D and milestone costs tied to business development.
Recent moves strengthen the long‑term story. The Capstan Therapeutics acquisition brings an in vivo CAR‑T platform aimed at autoimmune disease that seeks deep B‑cell depletion without lymphodepleting chemo, opening a new path beyond conventional ex vivo approaches. The planned $195 million U.S. investment to expand API manufacturing adds capacity and resilience, supports the North Chicago workforce, and aligns production with a larger pipeline, building a firmer base for growth through the decade.
Analyst views are constructive: all 29 surveyed rate the shares a consensus “Moderate Buy,” with a mean target of $215.81, about 3% above its recent price levels.
Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)
Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is one of the largest healthcare names, with a business built around two main areas: Innovative Medicine, which covers drugs for cancer, immune and nerve disorders, and more, plus MedTech, where it develops everything from surgical tools to orthopedic solutions.
The stock has shown steady growth, climbing 7.16% in the past 12 months and another 5.67% over the last month, showing strength in a market filled with uncertainty.
It’s known for its reliable dividend, giving a forward yield of 3.58%, well above the sector average. Its 64-year streak of increases, supported by a forward payout ratio near 50% signals confidence in cash flow durability.
In the second quarter of 2025, sales hit $23.7 billion (up nearly 6%), and earnings came in at $2.29 per share (GAAP) and $2.77 (adjusted). The pipeline has added wins with IMAAVY gaining approval for gMG, TAR-200 moving to priority review, strong data for CARVYKTI in multiple myeloma, and steady progress for OTTAVA in general surgery robotics. Expectations for the year have been raised, with sales now seen up 5.4% and EPS targets set at $10.85 (GAAP) and $10.68 (adjusted), showing management’s confidence as both core businesses keep performing.
Strategically, Johnson & Johnson MedTech launched the VIRTUGUIDE AI‑powered, patient‑matched Lapidus system in the U.S. to streamline bunion surgery planning and execution, with early adopters estimating procedural time savings of at least 30 minutes, an innovation aimed at a prevalent condition affecting roughly a third of adults and a tangible example of MedTech’s software‑enabled productivity push. Separately, the company expanded its global initiative to support the nursing workforce via the J&J CareCommunity platform, targeting the projected 4.5 million nurse shortfall by 2030, which can strengthen health systems and indirectly bolster adoption and utilization across J&J’s therapeutic and procedural franchises over time.
The 25 analysts covering Johnson & Johnson rate the stock a consensus “Moderate Buy,” with the average target of $177.36, just a hair above the recent price of $175.92.
Conclusion
AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson both offer what investors want right now: clear earnings momentum, durable cash returns, and tangible growth catalysts.
AbbVie’s immunology engine (Skyrizi/Rinvoq) is driving double‑digit adjusted EPS growth and a guidance raise, while fresh moves like the Capstan deal and new U.S. API capacity add runway and resilience. Johnson & Johnson pairs steady top‑line growth and a higher 2025 outlook with real product traction in Innovative Medicine and MedTech, plus software‑enabled tools like VIRTUGUIDE.
With reasonable forward multiples and reliable dividends, both names screen as smarter-value buys than UnitedHealth at this stage.

Cambricon, a China-based semiconductor firm, just posted its greatest profit to date and a roughly 44-fold revenue surge. The company’s rapid growth comes as Nvidia recorded no chip sales to China during its second quarter, signaling a push by local players to innovate in the tech giant’s absence, experts tell Fortune.
Cambricon, a China-based semiconductor firm, posted record profits in the first half of the year, along with revenue that surged roughly 4,300%.
The earnings, released late Tuesday, serve as an example of Nvidia’s growing local competition in China, as the government and market seek alternative chipmakers to gain traction in the region. Nvidia’s business in China has been tied up in U.S. export restrictions and geopolitical tensions, and the tech behemoth recorded no H20 chip sales to China in the second quarter, per its earnings release yesterday.
Cambricon’s first-half revenue surged to 2.88 billion Chinese yuan ($402.7 million), the company reported this week. The Chinese upstart, created by two “genius brothers,” is partially state-owned and headquartered in Beijing. The company’s stock is now China’s most expensive, overtaking liquor company Kweichow Moutai. Still, despite its whopping growth, Cambricon’s revenue is a far cry from that of Nvidia, which reported $46.7 billion in its second quarter alone.
But experts tell Fortune Cambricon’s growth reflects a larger push to create local Nvidia rivals in China—especially as the tech giant deals with increased export restrictions under the Trump administration.
“Nvidia apparently has a better overall offering in terms of the hardware in China, but because of the export controls, right now they cannot sell, basically, to China,” Ray Wang, research director for semiconductors, supply chain, and emerging tech at the Futurum Group, told Fortune. “They leave a big market void for a Chinese competitor to fulfill.”
Wang said large Chinese tech companies like Huawei and SMIC are “catching up rapidly” to Nvidia in terms of both product and quality, as well as production capacity.
“That’s a serious concern for both Nvidia and the U.S. government’s agenda in terms of … dominating AI globally,” he said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. enforced stricter export controls on China, at one point banning H20 chips—which are known to be less powerful than Nvidia’s AI chips—from being sold to the country. In July, the ban was lifted, but it also allowed time for companies to invest in innovation.
“The problem with banning [H20 chips] is you’re effectively handing the AI market and training over to companies like Huawei or Cambricon or … other local players,” Stacy Rasgon, senior analyst of U.S. semiconductors and semiconductor capital equipment at Bernstein Research, told Fortune.
Rasgon pointed out that, in Cambricon’s case, the roughly 44-fold revenue increase to $402.7 million in the first half of this year means the company went from “tiny to small.” He said he’s less focused on the percentage growth than the reason behind it.
“There’s a big push in China for self-sufficiency,” Rasgon said.
Cambricon’s record profit was helped by a wave of demand for Chinese chips after Beijing encouraged using local technology, citing security concerns and uncertainty over the Trump administration’s export curbs. The most recent catalyst for Cambricon’s surge came from AI startup DeepSeek, which said last week its latest model comes with a feature that can optimize locally made chips.
Last week, the Chinese government told its tech companies to stop using Nvidia’s H20 chips after U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC that China would only receive the company’s “fourth best” chips, only adding fuel to the fire.
“You want to sell the Chinese enough that they get addicted to the American technology stack,” Lutnick added.
Despite technology advancements by Nvidia rivals amid geopolitical tensions, demand for its H20 chips remain—even in the face of regulatory hurdles.
In its second-quarter earnings, Nvidia reported no H20 sales to China-based customers. In its earnings call on Wednesday, chief financial officer Colette Kress estimated $2 billion to $5 billion in H20 revenue this quarter should “geopolitical issues reside.” Nvidia did not include any revenue from H20 chips in its third-quarter guidance, which tops analysts’ expectations of $53.14 billion at $54 billion, plus or minus 2%.
“It was inevitable there would be more entrants into this market,” Sebastien Naji, a research analyst at William Blair, told Fortune. “Near-term, I think the risks on the regulatory front are more impactful than increased competition.”
Nvidia previously warned that if not for the U.S. chip export restrictions, its top-line guidance for the July quarter would have been $8 billion higher.
“I think the stock does not have that priced in, in terms of if that revenue were to go away,” Scott Bickley, an advisory fellow at Info-Tech Research Group, told Fortune before Nvidia’s earnings call on Wednesday.
CFO Kress also said during the earnings call that over the past few weeks, a “select number” of China-based customers received licenses for H20 chips, though none have been shipped based on those licenses. Kress also mentioned the U.S. government and Nvidia haven’t finalized a recent agreement that will require the chipmaker to share 15% of the revenue it makes through H20 chip sales to China.
There are already some Chinese products that outperform Nvidia’s H20, analyst Rasgon said. He said he expects greater competition in the local market to only catalyze chip innovation.
“Nvidia is never going to be allowed, probably, to sell better parts in China,” Rasgon said. “So for the Chinese, it takes time, but they’re going to work on improving their own stuff. And over time, maybe that gap closes.”
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has long complained about U.S. export controls, saying they will only galvanize local players to innovate in the chipmaker’s absence.
“The China market, I’ve estimated to be about $50 billion of opportunity for us this year if we were able to address it with competitive products,” Huang said during the second-quarter earnings call.
But not only does Nvidia look to resume H20 chip sales in China, the company also wants to expand its product line by introducing the high-performance Blackwell chip in the country, should the U.S. agree to it.
“We continue to advocate for the U.S. government to approve Blackwell for China,” Kress said during the earnings call. The company aims to “win the support of every developer” in highly competitive markets, she added, so Nvidia technology can be the world’s gold standard.
“You kind of need a Blackwell chip [in China], even though it’s going to be performance-laden in nature, relative to everything else in the market,” Angelo Zino, SVP and technology equity analyst at CFRA, told Fortune.
While Zino said the H20 “probably isn’t going to give you enough to offset or get back the revenue” the company had a couple of quarters ago, introducing a Blackwell chip in China just might.

The company announced Wednesday that it was cutting 3% of its global workforce. Of the 350 laid off, 196 workers were based in San Diego. Most of the San Diego employees affected were in operations and manufacturing.
""Dexcom is taking proactive steps to position ourselves for long-term success through strategic changes to our organizational model and operating structure. This includes a reduction in force as we realign our structure to enhance our ability to deliver on our commitments,"" a Dexcom spokesperson wrote in a statement to The Times.
The layoffs follow the company’s recent move to manufacture outside California. Last year, it announced a shift to centralize manufacturing in Arizona and eliminated 536 positions in San Diego.
Founded in 1999, Dexcom has become a leading developer of the continuous glucose monitor. For people with diabetes, wearing a glucose monitor eliminates the need for fingerstick tests and allows their blood sugar levels to be tracked around the clock. When a patient’s blood sugar shifts dangerously, Dexcom will alert them.
Initially, the company's products primarily served people with Type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease that typically develops in adolescence. Over time, its research expanded to include those with Type 2 diabetes as well.
The company also aims to expand its services to support customers with pre-diabetes and those who wish to monitor their glucose levels for wellness purposes.
Most recently, it announced a new monitor that will be wearable for up to 15 days. Previously, the monitor was wearable for 10 days at most. The new version is scheduled for release in the next few months.
This year, Dexcom also faced two recalls amid problems with the alerts on some of its glucose monitors.
Dexcom’s shares fell about 2% Thursday.
The company's net income from the second quarter was $179.8 million, up from $143.5 million in the previous period last year, and revenue grew 15%, from $1.004 billion to $1.157 billion.

In a conversation with The Block, Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou suggests that the cryptocurrency can rise to $126,000 by the end of 2025.
Key takeaways:
-
Bitcoin's volatility has dropped to 30%
-
Strategy and Metaplanet's inclusion in equity indices are boosting passive Bitcoin exposure
-
Bitcoin's volatility-to-gold ratio has dropped to 2.0, the lowest ever
The prediction comes at a time when Bitcoin's volatility has collapsed to historic lows, which should help institutions start thinking of Bitcoin similarly to gold as an asset class for portfolios.
""Yes, this is the upside we highlighted in our note, which we envisage to be reached by year-end,"" said Panigirtzoglou, managing director of JP Morgan.
The bank observed that Bitcoin's volatility in relation to gold has reportedly fallen to a record-low ratio of 2.0, meaning it requires only twice as much risk capital in portfolios as gold, as per the report.
Assuming the metric is in order, the $2.2 trillion market capitalization of Bitcoin would need to increase by roughly 13% to approximately $2.5 trillion to set a fair value at $126,000 per coin.
Corporate treasuries are locking up supply
He attributes much of the decline in volatility to a boom in corporate treasury buys, which now account for over 6% of Bitcoin's supply.
The trend has further locked up a huge amount of the asset in a manner similar to JPMorgan's comparison to central bank quantitative easing after 2008, which reduced volatility in bond markets.

Passive inflows from index inclusions
Passive inflows have also expanded, thanks to index inclusions. Strategy Inc. was added to the major equity benchmarks.
Metaplanet's status as a mid-cap company led to its inclusion in the FTSE All-World index through its promotion. Both moves have brought Bitcoin exposure to more portfolios worldwide.

Including the post-earnings surge, Pure Storage stock is trading at more than double its price in the first week of April.
Is Valuation Really a Concern for Pure Storage Stock?
PSTG stock is now going for an overly stretched forward price-earnings (P/E) multiple of 107x.
However, valuation may still not be a major concern for Pure Storage given “this market is addicted to easy money,” said Dan Niles, a renowned portfolio manager in a CNBC interview today.
In the current environment, he added, “you’re paid to take risks.”
On Thursday, Fundstrat’s top strategist Tom Lee also revealed the momentum trade isn’t showing any signs of fading, at least anytime soon.
His remarks further substantiate that investors shouldn’t be overly concerned about Pure Storage’s valuation, especially after the company recorded a blockbuster quarter and raised its guidance for the future.
What Could Drive PSTG Shares Higher in 2025
Pure Storage shares remain attractive also because they offer a means of “playing into the artificial intelligence environment in multiple ways,” according to the company’s chief executive Charles Giancarlo.
In a post-earnings interview, Giancarlo said an AI environment is all about “performance,” touting his company’s “FlashBlade Exa,” whose industry-leading benchmarks continue to attract massive demand.
PSTG is the primary storage supplier for Meta Platforms (META). On Thursday, the NYSE-listed firm said it’s on track to deploy as much as 2 exabyte of capacity with the tech titan by year-end.
That made UBS analysts increase their price objective on PSTG shares today to $85, indicating potential for another 6% upside from here.

Sweeping tariffs have raised costs across Caterpillar's supply chain, as the company imports key components such as sensors, even as manufacturers race to localize production.
The Trump administration's latest tariffs, announced on July 31, target imports from dozens of countries, including major trading partners such as Canada, the European Union, Japan, India and several Southeast Asian nations.
""While the company continues to take initial mitigating actions to reduce this impact, trade and tariff negotiations continue to be fluid,"" Caterpillar said in a regulatory filing on Thursday.
Caterpillar now expects a tariff hit of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion this year, up from its prior forecast of up to $1.5 billion.
The company had issued its previous expectations along with its second-quarter earnings results earlier this month.
On Thursday, it said the higher costs will push its adjusted operating profit margin toward the bottom of its target range, though it left its full-year sales and revenue outlook unchanged.
Industrial machinery makers are grappling with higher costs from Trump's expansive tariffs on imports, while weak demand and elevated interest rates limit their ability to pass on the burden to customers.
The heavy equipment maker also raised its estimate for third-quarter tariff costs to as much as $600 million, from a prior forecast of up to $500 million.

-
If courts allow President Donald Trump to remove a key Federal Reserve official, his nominees could have the power to set interest rates as Trump wishes.
-
Trump will have appointed five of the seven Fed governors if he replaces Lisa Cook on the Fed board.
-
That would not constitute a majority on the 12-member policy committee that sets interest rates, but the governors are empowered to influence who the remaining five voters are.
-
Trump has repeatedly demanded that the Fed lower interest rates, which could boost the economy. However, experts say this would risk reducing the Fed's credibility and ability to control inflation.
If President Donald Trump is successful in removing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, his appointees could control the central bank for years to come.
Trump escalated his efforts to exert control over the nation's central bank this week when he said he was firing Cook, a member of the committee that sets the Fed's key interest rate, amid allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook sued to keep her position Thursday, claiming her dismissal was ""unprecedented and illegal.""
Should Trump prevail in the legal case, his nominees would have the power to deliver Trump the rate cuts he has demanded. Some experts have warned that the move could diminish the Fed's reputation for making decisions based on economics rather than politics, as well as hurt its ability to control inflation.
Trump said he would soon control the board and implied that mortgage rates, which are influenced by the federal funds rate, would soon fall.
""We'll have a majority very shortly,"" Trump said Tuesday at a cabinet meeting. ""So that'll be great. Once we have a majority, housing is going to swing, and it's going to be great. People are paying too high an interest rate.""
The Fed has held its key rate steady throughout 2025, which has led Trump to repeatedly lambaste Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term as chair expires next May. The Fed has been reluctant to cut rates until it's clear that tariffs aren't spurring inflation, though Powell signaled last week that economic conditions could warrant a policy change when the policy committee meets next month.
How Trump Could Take Over The Fed
The Fed is set up to resist the president's influence but is not completely immune, especially in the face of the kind of attacks that Trump has launched.
""While some safeguards are there, the challenges to Fed independence have been unprecedented,"" said Victor Li, an emeritus professor of economics at Villanova and expert on the Fed.",5df2e161b99213e999f74478ebcb1b45,trafilatura

When asked at the Deutsche Bank Technology Conference whether government incentives for chipmakers would boost Applied's demand forecast, Hill said such support may shift where factories are built but would not increase overall demand.
""We don't think anybody's going to build extra fabs that don't have designs.""
He added more competition could slightly lower average factory use, but not enough to change Applied's five-year forecast.

That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.
A health savings account (HSA) and a high-yield savings account (HYSA) can both help you prepare for medical expenses — but they work very differently.
One offers tax advantages and long-term growth potential, while the other provides flexibility and easy access to cash. So, which option is better for covering your healthcare bills? Here's what you need to know.
This embedded content is not available in your region.
What is a health savings account?
A health savings account is an account you can use to save money for medical expenses, including dental and vision care.
In 2024, over 39 million people in the U.S. had HSAs, and for good reason. Here are the main features and benefits you get from using an HSA:
-
Major tax advantages: HSA contributions can reduce your income taxes. Plus, unlike some retirement accounts, you're not taxed on the interest you earn or the money you withdraw to pay for qualified medical expenses. So HSAs can be great for supplementing your long-term retirement savings.
-
Earn interest: Your HSA might earn around 2.5% a year, but you can increase that figure significantly by switching to a financial institution that lets you invest the money in ETFs or mutual funds.
-
No expiration: Unlike Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs), 100% of the unused money in your HSA can be carried over from year to year with no expiration date.
-
No balance limits: While there is an annual limit on HSA contributions, there's no limit on the total balance you can accrue. In 2024, adults over 54 had an average HSA balance of $6,564.
-
Family expenses: You can use the money in your HSA to pay for eligible medical expenses for yourself, your spouse, and your dependents.
-
Less skimping on care: HSA users are less likely to skip out on preventative care and other essential medical services.
Who can open an HSA?
You can only qualify for an HSA if you have a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). That's an insurance plan with a low monthly premium but high out-of-pocket costs. As of January 2026, all Bronze and Catastrophic Marketplace plans will be eligible, and people who use direct primary care (DPC) will qualify as well.
What is a high-yield savings account?
A high-yield savings account (HYSA) is a savings account that pays a higher interest rate than the average savings account. Right now, the national average rate on savings accounts is just 0.39% APY, but you can earn over 4% APY with an HYSA.
Aside from their high interest rates, HYSAs function just like other savings accounts. So yes, you can use them to save money for medical expenses. But unlike HSAs, they don't help you lower your income taxes. In fact, you may have to pay taxes on the savings account interest you earn.
HSA vs. HYSA: Key differences
HSAs and HYSAs can both help you save money for medical expenses. But where HYSAs simply offer high interest rates, HSAs allow you to earn interest and save money on taxes.
Let's say, for example, your effective income tax rate is 12%. If you contribute the maximum annual amount to your HSA ($4,300 for individuals), you can potentially reduce your 2025 tax bill by $516 (that's 12% of $4,300).
If you contribute the same amount each year for five years, and you earn a modest 2% in interest, you could end up with an estimated tax savings of roughly $2,580 and earn up to $1,300 in interest (depending on how much and how often you withdraw funds).
By comparison, if you invest $4,300 a year into a HYSA that earns 4% APY, you'll earn an extra $2,679 in five years. Since that interest is taxable, your real returns would be closer to $2,374.
When should you use an HSA?
If you have a qualifying healthcare plan, an HSA is the ideal place to save money for healthcare expenses. For those who can afford to leave money in an HSA long-term, these accounts are also great for supplementing retirement savings and helping cover medical costs during retirement.
According to the Brookings Institute, HSAs benefit people with higher tax rates the most. That's because those individuals not only get larger tax breaks for their HSA contributions, but they can also afford to leave money in their accounts for longer periods.
When should you use an HYSA?
HYSAs are a great place to save money for most short- to medium-term needs and goals, as there are no restrictions on how or when you can use the funds.
Whether you’re building up an emergency fund, saving for a down payment, putting away money for a wedding, or saving for another purpose, an HYSA allows you to earn a competitive interest rate on your balance and enjoy penalty-free access to your money.
HYSAs are also a good option for saving money for medical expenses if you don't qualify for an HSA.",fe457960dbce71016be6d3fc05a319de,trafilatura

Despite XRP’s (CRYPTO: XRP) $180 billion market cap surpassing BlackRock, crypto investors remain skeptical, citing its centralized structure, lack of fundamental value, and outdated bridge currency model.
What Happened: Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, sparked a heated discussion on X by questioning why XRP remains one of the most disparaged crypto assets, prompting responses from investors and analysts who outlined several reasons for their skepticism.
Many in the crypto community argue that XRP's centralized nature undermines its credibility.
One user, Hiphopsince19, pointed out that XRP operates on a permissioned blockchain where a small, approved group controls the network, requiring 80% consensus for major changes, concentrating power among a select few.
Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.
They also noted that the public ledger begins at record 32,570, leaving early transactions unverifiable, raising transparency concerns.
Critics also question XRP's utility as a bridge currency.
Another user argued that bridge currencies like XRP do not accrue value due to equal buying and selling in transactions, and modern alternatives—smart contract blockchains paired with stablecoins and Chainlink (CRYPTO: LINK), have rendered XRP obsolete for cross-border payments.
This sentiment was echoed by jazzappreciator, who recently sold their XRP for Chainlink, citing banks' shift toward stablecoins and Chainlink's live infrastructure in capital markets.
Technical shortcomings further fuel doubts.
Materkel highlighted XRP's permissioned blockchain, which prevents trustless validator participation, a core principle of decentralized crypto.
They noted XRP's low transaction throughput of 16 TPS despite claims of higher capacity, and a mere 59 full-time developers compared to thousands on Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH).
Additionally, Ripple holds roughly 50% of XRP's supply, allegedly using it to manipulate markets and fund enterprise value for shareholders rather than token holders.

ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) -TRADING DAY
Making sense of the forces driving global markets
By Jamie McGeever, Markets Columnist
Wall Street rose on Thursday as investors looked favorably on tech despite a mixed reaction to Nvidia's results, while the prospect of U.S. rate cut next month from a more dovish Fed pushed the dollar lower against nearly every major and emerging currency in the world.
More on that below. In my column today, I look at the rotation out of tech stocks and into small caps that accelerated in August, and ask whether it can continue into September.
If you have more time to read, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today.
1. Fed Governor Cook sues Trump over his attempt to fireher 2. Dollar drop on politicized Fed may be part of Trumpdeal: Mike Dolan 3. Nvidia CEO says AI boom far from over after tepid salesforecast 4. For bruised bond markets, turbulence persists as debtsales ramp up again 5. EU to scrap tariffs on U.S. goods to pave way for lowercar duties
Today's Key Market Moves
* STOCKS: S&P 500 hits new high, Nasdaq outperforms.Europe, Asia, emerging markets more mixed. * SHARES/SECTORS: Nvidia slips 0.8%, but recovers fromafter-market lows overnight. Tech and communications lead U.Smarkets higher though, small caps lag. * FX: Dollar falls against nearly every currency in theworld, dollar index -0.4%. China's offshore yuan hits 2025 high. * BONDS: Long-dated yields in Japan, France, and UK easeback from this week's multi-year peaks. U.S. curve bullflattens, $44 billion auction of 7-year notes goes pretty well. * COMMODITIES: Copper has biggest rise in two weeks, up1.5% to a 2-week high. Nvidia, U.S. GDP help lift prices.
Today's Talking Points:
* U.S. GDP resilience
Second-quarter U.S. GDP growth was unexpectedly revised up to an annualized 3.3% from 3.1% and PCE inflation in the quarter was revised slightly lower to 2.5% from 2.6%. On the margins, this may point to more of a 'Goldilocks' scenario and temper some of the 'stagflation' fears that continue to swirl.
Does this alter Fed expectations? Probably not - there are some key data before the September 17 decision, starting with July PCE inflation on Thursday, that will have much bigger sway. But it does show that the impact from tariffs on activity and prices hasn't been properly felt yet.
* Big government
Contrary to what we were told on the campaign trail and led to believe with Elon Musk's 'DOGE' moment in the Washington sun, the Trump administration is taking a very active role in many aspects of U.S. economic, policymaking and industrial life.
From taking stakes in big companies like Intel and others to letting Nvidia sell its H20 chips to China in exchange for 15% of those sales, and from trying to stuff the Fed board with loyalists to targeting law firms and academic institutions, the administration's footprint seems to be expanding, not shrinking.
* Yuan steps beyond
The Chinese yuan - onshore spot and offshore - leapt to its highest level against the U.S. dollar this year, precisely since November 6, the day after the U.S. election. The PBOC's USD/CNY fixing is on course for its biggest weekly move since September.
Beijing is clearly steering the yuan higher, not lower, as many observers predicted would be its response to the economy's deflationary pressures and looming trade war with the U.S. Maybe Beijing is focusing more on bolstering domestic demand than exports?
U.S. small caps quietly notch historic outperformance vs tech
Amid the Federal Reserve drama and deluge of corporate earnings in August, one clear but overlooked trend emerged in U.S. equities: the rotation out of expensive tech stocks and into cheaper small caps. As the month draws to a close, the big question is whether this can continue.
The Nasdaq 100 is currently on track for a monthly gain of 1.5% while the Russell 2000 small cap index is headed for a 7.3% rise, signaling an underperformance of 580 basis points for the tech-heavy index.
According to Stuart Kaiser, head of equity trading strategy at Citi, that relative monthly performance for the Nasdaq 100 is in the bottom 5% since 1985.
And if we look at ETFs, tech's underperformance looks even more striking. This month, the Invesco QQQ exchange-traded fund tracking the Nasdaq 100 is flat, while the iShares Russell 2000 ETF is up 7%.
FED BOOST
So what's responsible for this dramatic divergence?
It may partly just reflect investors seeking to rebalance their concentrated and lopsided portfolios. But the split was clearly turbo-charged by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's Jackson Hole speech on August 22, when he opened the door to an interest rate cut next month.
Manish Kabra, head of U.S. equity strategy at Societe Generale, says the Russell 2000 index's outperformance against the broader S&P 500 that day was the biggest since the U.S. election on November 6 last year that returned Donald Trump to the White House.
Powell's dovish pivot is helping small caps outperform because these companies tend to benefit more from lower interest rates given that they rely on borrowing to grow and expand. Larger firms, especially 'Big Tech' megacaps, often have huge cash reserves and easier access to other sources of financing.
To be sure, lower rates wouldn't just be good news for small caps. The rising tide of liquidity and investor sentiment would typically be expected to lift all boats, including the 'Magnificent Seven' megaships.
As analysts at UBS point out, past equity bubbles have often been burst by rising interest rates, so a resumption of the central bank's easing cycle would appear to minimize that particular risk for high-priced tech stocks.
But, regardless, small caps may still continue to get more of a Fed boost in the near term.
AI DOUBTS
Another catalyst for the rotation has been creeping doubts about AI's ability to deliver returns commensurate with the bubble-like frenzy surrounding the new technology.
Tech stocks remain on the pricey side. That's justified, argue UBS analysts, by the potential revenue from AI-generated efficiencies, which they estimate could reach around $1.5 trillion a year globally.
Others are less optimistic. If value creation on this massive scale fails to materialize, then tech companies will struggle to generate a return on the trillions of dollars of global capex expected in the coming years.
That's why all eyes were on $4.4 trillion Nvidia's earnings on Wednesday. How investors interpret the global AI leader's results will help determine whether tech's underperformance continues into September. The company's revenue, profit and forecasts looked solid, but uncertainty surrounding the suspension of its business with China and skepticism around the revenue outlook are giving investors pause.
UNDER THE RADAR
For now, market momentum remains with smaller firms. Francis Gannon, co-CIO and managing director at Royce Investment Partners, calls it a ""stealth summer"" for small caps, the recent outperformance of which has gone ""mostly unnoticed"" amid the daily headlines centered on economic uncertainty, geopolitical worries, and new highs in the larger cap-led indices.
Indeed, the Russell 2000 has yet to revisit last November's peak, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have been printing new highs for weeks.
Whether or not small caps start hitting new records will likely be determined by what happens at the Fed.
So the big macroeconomic events to watch next month will be the August employment report due on September 5, August CPI inflation data on September 11, and then, of course, the Fed's policy decision on September 17.
Small caps have enjoyed a pleasant end to the summer. Let's see what happens when investors all get back to their desks next month.
What could move markets tomorrow?
* China corporate earnings, including Alibaba, BYD, CITIC,China Construction Bank, ICBC, Bank of China * Japan retail sales, unemployment, industrial production(July) * Japan Tokyo inflation (August) * India GDP (Q2) * Germany retail sales (July) * Germany inflation (August, prelim) * ECB board member Luis de Guindos speaks * Canada GDP (Q2) * U.S. PCE inflation (July) * U.S. Chicago PMI (August)

CRWV stock jumped on Cantor Fitzgerald’s initiation at “Overweight” with a $116 price target in reference to its strategic partnership with Nvidia (NVDA) and increasing Nvidia-based generative AI workload demand. It followed shortly after Nvidia’s record-breaking quarter, which reaffirmed its spot at the epicenter of the AI juggernaut.
Everything is in place: hyperscale spending on data centers is skyrocketing, inference computational workloads are rising exponentially, and infrastructure investment driven by artificial intelligence is outpacing supply. That is why CoreWeave’s role as an artificial intelligence-focused hyperscaler, based entirely on Nvidia GPUs, has become a prime enabler in the artificial intelligence economy.
CoreWeave is a New Jersey cloud computing company with a specialty in AI infrastructure. Also known as the “AI hyperscaler,” it offers access to GPU-accelerated computing power for research labs, developers, and enterprises. As it is an entirely Nvidia-powered infrastructure company, it is a partner of choice for large language model (LLM) training, inference, and other high-demanding applications for artificial intelligence. Its market capitalization is over $47 billion.
CRWV has had a bumpy ride since the IPO, ranging between $33.51 and $187 per share over the last 52 weeks. CoreWeave now trades in the $104 handle, up more than 13% in the recent five days but still far short of its 2025 highs. That compares with a nearly 25% increase in the same period by the S&P 500 Index ($SPX), which reflects risk as well as upside potential in CoreWeave’s story of growth.
Valuation remains stretched in line with robust expectations for expansion. CoreWeave has a 13.4x price-to-sales (P/S) multiple and 15.8x price-to-book (P/B) multiple, but still incurs net losses on a GAAP basis since debt costs are so onerous in addition to spending for expansion. Most cloud infrastructure peers are lower-multiple compared, though its 62% adjusted EBITDA margin shows it benefits equally in scalability relative to larger hyperscalers.
As it does not pay a dividend at this time, it invests heavily in expansion.
CoreWeave Beats on Earnings
CoreWeave in Q2 2025 generated record revenue of $1.21 billion, compared with $395 million in the same quarter a year ago, which is over three times larger. Its adjusted EBITDA rose to $753 million, reflecting margin strength, whereas GAAP results reported a net loss of $290 million due to $267 million in interest expense. Its GAAP operating margin dropped sharply to a 2% result, while its adjusted margins remained robust at 16%.
Management hasn't provided formal EPS guidance but has indicated that demand visibility is supported by a $30.1 billion revenue backlog, including the expansion of its $11.9 billion OpenAI contract, along with new enterprise deals with BT Group, Cohere, LG CNS, and Woven, a subsidiary of major automobile maker Toyota (TM). It further revealed technology leadership achievements, including the first at-scale deployment of Nvidia’s Blackwell GB200 systems, besides announcing new developer products based on its acquisition of Weights & Biases.
Besides financial results, CoreWeave is expanding aggressively as well. It ended Q2 with operating power capacity at 470 MW and raised total contracted power to 2.2 GW, a sign of the infrastructure race underway in AI. CoreWeave raised $2 billion in senior notes at 9.25% last month, but its liquidity is still robust enough for expansion financing.
What Do Analysts Expect for CRWV Stock?
Wall Street sentiment became bullish in reaction to Nvidia’s quarter and CoreWeave’s Q2. Cantor Fitzgerald’s “Overweight” rating and $116 target reflect the company's robust secular exposure to artificial intelligence trends and its unique software-driven hyperscaler position.
CoreWeave receives a “Strong Buy” rating consensus with an average target price of $128.10, indicating a potential upside of nearly 23% compared to current levels. The street-record high target is $200, while the low is $32, which embodies both bullish conviction and increased risk.

A double beat on analyst estimates didn't compensate for tariff uncertainty.
-
On a brighter note, the retailer managed to grow its revenue and post the highest ""comps"" in years.
It's safe to say many investors felt that Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) stock wasn't an especially good buy on Thursday. Although the company posted second quarter of fiscal 2026 results that topped analyst estimates, it signaled that it remains vulnerable to the tariffs being imposed by the Trump administration.
As a result, its shares lost nearly 4% of their value that trading session, while the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) inched up by 0.3%.
Thinking about tariffs
Best Buy's revenue for the period was slightly under $9.44 billion, which was up from the nearly $9.29 billion in the same quarter of fiscal 2025. That improvement was on the back of a 1.6% year-over-year rise in comparable sales -- the company's highest growth rate in three years. This, in turn, was fueled by a relatively sharp (5%) increase in online commerce.
However, net income on both a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and non-GAAP (adjusted) basis went south during the quarter. Under the former standard, it was $186 million, well down from the $291 million of fiscal 2025's second frame. On an adjusted, per-share basis, it slid to $1.28 from $1.34.
At least Best Buy topped the consensus analyst estimates. On average, pundits tracking the retailer's stock were estimating it would book $9.23 billion in revenue, and a $1.22 per share figure for adjusted net income.
In the conference call discussing the quarter, company CEO Corie Barry intimated that the tariffs, which have affected pricing, are expected to remain an issue.
""Given the uncertainty of potential tariff impacts in the back half, both on consumers overall as well as our business, we feel it is prudent to maintain the annual guidance we provided last quarter,"" she said.
In-line guidance
That guidance calls for revenue of $41.1 billion to $41.9 billion this fiscal year, and adjusted net income of $6.15 to $6.30. The consensus analyst top-line estimate is a touch over $41.4 billion, while that for adjusted profitability stands at $6.19.

International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM), one of the world's oldest and largest technology companies, finds itself at a crossroads in 2025. The company continues to transition from legacy hardware toward hybrid cloud, artificial intelligence (AI), and consulting services, positioning itself as a partner for digital transformation among Fortune 500 clients. Yet the market's confidence in IBM's growth prospects has fluctuated, which is reflected in its volatile stock and mixed analyst ratings.
This article provides a full overview of IBM's current share price, long-range forecasts for 2025, 2026, and 2030, and an assessment of the headwinds and upside scenarios shaping IBM's story today.
IBM is trading at $239 as of August 2025, reflecting moderation from recent highs as the tech sector faces ongoing rotation and macro uncertainty. The stock has swung substantially, trading well below its 50-day SMA of $272 and slightly under its 200-day SMA, mirroring a growing sense of bearish sentiment on Wall Street. The one-year Fear & Greed Index reading of 39 (Fear) indicates prevailing caution about IBM's short- and mid-term outlooks. Despite a trailing P/E of nearly 39 and forward P/E of roughly 22, IBM's valuation is notably above its historical tech peer averages, a sign that investors are cautiously optimistic about cloud transition but wary of near-term earnings risk.
IBM's price has fluctuated with sector and market sentiment, showing only 11 green days out of the last 30 and 7.2% volatility, according to CoinCodex. While the company continues to ride macro themes like AI adoption, digitalization, and cybersecurity, investors are weighing these opportunities against a backdrop of competition from more nimble cloud-native firms and threats from legacy business erosion.
Don’t Miss:
Analyst sentiment remains mixed. IBM currently has a consensus Hold rating based on Benzinga's poll of 22 analysts. The consensus price target sits at $236.48, bracketed by a high of $325 (Wedbush, June 2025) and a low of $140 (MoffettNathanson, January 2023). The three most recent ratings by UBS, JP Morgan, and BofA Securities in July 2025 average a $266.67 target, implying an 11.3% potential upside from current levels for investors expecting IBM to execute on its transition strategy.
The forecast range in this table is based on algorithmic projections provided by CoinCodex. These models use historical price trends, volatility patterns, and moving averages to estimate future stock prices over multiple time horizons.
IBM's road ahead remains deeply debated as the company balances its legacy, brand recognition, and enterprise relationships with the need to adapt to fast-changing tech realities.
-
IBM's continued investment in cloud, AI, and cybersecurity bolstered by its Red Hat acquisition positions it for recurring revenue and long-term relevance in digital transformation.
-
Strategic partnerships and legacy client renewals support stable cash flows, giving management leeway to drive innovation and evolve service lines.
-
Steady dividend payouts and relative earnings stability provide downside protection, attracting income-focused investors.
-
Legacy business headwinds persist, with mainframe and hardware revenue under ongoing pressure as clients shift to public cloud solutions.
-
IBM faces intense competition from cloud-first giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, limiting its pricing power and growth momentum.
-
Consistently high volatility and a lack of strong, sustained profitability dampen broad institutional interest and cap the company's valuation.
Forecast Range: $213 – $262
For 2025, CoinCodex forecasts a price range between $213 and $262, with an average projection of $237. The outlook highlights a market grappling with IBM's execution risk: While ongoing cloud growth could move the stock toward the upper band, any delays in business transformation or competitive stumbles might keep the price soft. The bearish consensus, combined with cautious analyst ratings, reflects near-term skepticism even as IBM remains strategically positioned in several high-potential sectors.
Forecast Range: $175 – $279
Looking to 2026, price targets widen quite a bit, spanning $175 to $279 with a steady average estimate of $216. The bull narrative contends that IBM's hybrid cloud and AI integration will yield compounding growth if successfully executed. Competitive headwinds and margin pressures continue to represent sizable risks to upside.
Forecast Range: $130 – $285
By 2030, projections stretch further, from $130 at the low end to $285 at the high, with an average around $171. This spread underscores the uncertainty surrounding IBM's transformation and market adaptability. Investors banking on IBM for long-term exposure to enterprise tech must be prepared for ongoing volatility and periodic business model reinvention.
IBM continues to attract a diverse set of investors, from traditional value seekers who appreciate its longstanding dividend history and embedded relationships with Fortune 500 clients to those aiming for exposure to transformative trends in cloud computing and artificial intelligence. The company's resilient cash flow and continued presence in critical enterprise IT sectors offer a sense of stability, making it a reliable choice for investors focused on income and defensive positioning during periods of market uncertainty. Meanwhile, IBM's strategic moves such as acquiring Red Hat and building out its AI offerings give growth-minded investors a reason to monitor the name even if the payoff may require more patience than its tech peers.
Despite these advantages, meaningful risks cloud IBM's investment appeal. The ongoing transition from legacy mainframe and hardware businesses to higher-growth areas has proven slow and occasionally costly. The company faces persistent competitive threats from cloud-native giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google which have faster innovation cycles, broader SaaS portfolios, and deeper cloud infrastructure penetration. At the same time, IBM's heavy investments in R&D and M&A often pressure margins, raising further questions about how quickly the company can reap rewards from these initiatives and satisfy shareholder expectations for growth.
With IBM trading at an elevated valuation compared to its historical average and carrying only a Hold consensus among analysts, most market observers recommend patience. The bull thesis largely rests on the company's ability to accelerate cloud and AI adoption while delivering operational leverage and integrating acquired assets successfully. Speed of execution, strength in next-generation technologies, and the ability to maintain or grow its iconic dividend will dictate whether IBM can overcome current headwinds and regain sustained momentum in a crowded and fast-evolving tech landscape.

American Bitcoin’s merger with Gryphon Digital Mining is nearly completed, he told Reuters. Hut 8 owns 80% of American Bitcoin, while Eric Trump and his brother Donald Trump Jr. are expected to own 19% of the company that was unveiled in March.
The firm is striving to become one of the country’s largest Bitcoin miners, scaling up operations as the president pushes forward with his crypto-friendly regime. The stock is expected to trade under the ticker symbol ABTC.
Hut 8’s stock price rose 0.6% on Thursday to $26.51, according to Yahoo Finance. Year-to-date, the Miami-based firm’s share price has increased 29% from $21.10 in January.
Earlier this month, Genoot said during Hut 8’s second-quarter earnings broadcast that Gemini founders and Bitcoin billionaires Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss have invested in American Bitcoin. They decided to invest in the company with Bitcoin instead of cash, Genoot said.
Decrypt has reached out to Hut 8 and Gemini for comment.
Although American Bitcoin is expected to mine Bitcoin, it has also padded its balance sheet with Bitcoin purchases, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company has accumulated 215 Bitcoin, the firm signaled in June.
Bitcoin changed hands around $112,000 on Thursday, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. That means that American Bitcoin’s stash would be worth around $24 million.

If it became a public company today, American Bitcoin would be the 30th largest publicly traded Bitcoin holder in the U.S., according to Bitcoin Treasuries. Hut 8 owns 10,667 Bitcoin worth $1.2 billion. The firm has held Bitcoin on its balance sheet since 2017.
Hut 8 raised $220 million last month to purchase Bitcoin and mining infrastructure, alongside its expansion into Dubai. The firm already has offices in Texas, New York, and Alberta, Canada.",b65b0a6b1235eae5e3b05a9fbf283a3f,trafilatura

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way higher, rising 0.5% to close just shy of a fresh record. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.4%, crossing the 6,500 level for the first time as it set a second-consecutive all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) ticked up 0.2%, enough to notch its own record.
The government said US GDP rose 3.3% in the second quarter, a surprise bump up from its first estimate and a broad rebound from the 0.5% dip in Q1. That was due to a variety of factors — notably, a decrease in imports that followed a Q1 import surge to ""front-run"" tariffs, as well as a healthy pickup in consumer spending. Meanwhile, jobless claims fell as layoffs remained low.
Another economic test looms on Friday, with the July reading on PCE consumer inflation, closely watched by the central bank, due in the morning.
Investors were also watching the ongoing dispute between Trump and Cook. On Thursday, Cook sued the president after refusing to bow to his termination letter earlier this week — the biggest test yet of the central bank’s independence from executive branch influence.
Meanwhile, the initial cloud over Nvidia lifted as investors dug into its quarterly report, seen as a test of the AI trade driving stock gains this year. The chipmaker's shares closed down nearly 0.8%, paring bigger immediate post-earnings losses, as the company's disappointing data center sales and uncertainty over its future in China overshadowed its earnings beat.
Nvidia stressed that demand for its AI chips — which power applications like ChatGPT remotely from data centers — is healthy, countering recent fears of an AI bubble about to burst. CEO Jensen Huang touted ""extraordinary"" demand for the company's Blackwell AI GPUs (graphics processing units).
Huang also told Yahoo Finance that the company is getting ""fired back up"" to sell chips into the $50 billion China AI market following a short-lived export ban, though geopolitical uncertainty remains an overhang on that opportunity.

LIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 26 updatesGDP grows at 3.3% annualized pace in Q2, in bump from previous estimate
US GDP grew at a 3.3% annualized pace last quarter, according to the government's second estimate released Thursday. That's a bump up from the 3.0% from its first estimate, and also higher than the 3.1% forecast.
The GDP growth comes after the US economy shrank at a 0.5% annualized pace in the first quarter.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis, which tracks GDP, said the Q2 bump ""primarily reflected a decrease in imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, and an increase in consumer spending.""
President Trump's tariffs have upended the economic landscape, with imports surging — thus subtracting from GDP — in Q1 as businesses and consumers attempted to ""front-run"" tariff-related price increases.
In other economic data, initial jobless claims fell slightly from last week, coming in at 229,000 compared to 234,000 the week prior. As layoffs remained low, however, hiring also is staying tepid.",e4c0ea1f572afab4f761d55a8d828991,trafilatura

The transaction, first disclosed on May 5, has the clearance to proceed to closing now that “all regulatory approvals required to complete” the deal have been received, the parties said on Thursday. The expected closing date is Sept. 12, 2025, subject to the completion of customary closing conditions.

Stockholders of record of Skechers common stock as of July 29, 2025, have until 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Sept. 5 to make their merger election. 3G Capital is offering $63 a share for each Skechers share. Skechers shareholders have the option of receiving $57 per share in cash and one unlisted, non-transferable equity unit in a newly formed entity that will become the parent of Skechers when the deal closes.
A Skechers investor lost a bid to delay the closing of the deal on the grounds that it needed more information regarding the shareholder elections. A California federal district court judge in Los Angeles in July ruled against the investor. That ruling allowed the deal to proceed once the Securities and Exchange Commission gave its nod to the transaction. The SEC approval has since been received, according to Skechers and 3G on Thursday. The two had previously garnered antitrust approval in June.
The value of the deal — the biggest in shoe buyout history — reflects the business prowess of Robert and Michael Greenberg, the father-son duo tht has taken the company from a start-up to a global powerhouse over the past three decades. Both Greenbergs will remain with the company after the transaction closes, as will other members of the senior management team. In addition, Skechers will remain headquartered in its hometown of Manhattan Beach, Calif.
3G Capital is a Brazilian private-equity firm founded in 2004 by Jorge Paulo Lemann, Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marcel Herrmann Telles. It includes in its portfolio consumer brands Kraft Heinz, Burger King, Tim Horton and Hunter Douglas. The private equity firm’s playbook includes boosting margins through cost-cutting and efficiencies. TD Cowen retail analyst John Kernan expects that Skechers won’t remain private for long. He believes Skechers will become “public again in the distant future,” the analyst said at the time the deal was announced.
When the deal closes, Skechers will become a private company. Existing Skechers shares will be extinguished and will no longer trade on the New York Stock exchange.
The shoe firm reported earnings for the last time on Aug. 8. For the second quarter, Skechers posted a 21.5 percent increase in net income to $170.5 million, or $1.13 a diluted share, versus net income of $140.3 million, or 91 cents, in the same year-ago period. Net sales rose 13.1 percent to $2.44 billion from $2.16 billion.

An analyst cranked his price target higher on the shares.
-
He also maintained his equivalent of a buy recommendation.
Hardly for the first time in this ""year of the chip stock"" on the back of eager artificial intelligence (AI) adoption, Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) was the subject of an analyst's price target raise on Thursday. This was compounded by the disappointment about a peer company's recent performance, resulting in some investors fleeing to Broadcom.
Ultimately, Broadcom stock closed Thursday's trading session nearly 3% higher, easily trouncing the S&P 500 index's 0.3% increase.
A $20 change
Thursday's Broadcom booster was Oppenheimer's Rick Schafer, who upped his fair value assessment on the company to $325 per share. That was a bit of distance up from his preceding $305. In making that change he maintained his outperform (buy, in other words) recommendation on the shares.
It's no coincidence that Schafer's updated take came one week before the company is scheduled to post its third-quarter results. His new analysis addressed both that quarter and the following frame, according to reports, with Schafer predicting that both will be impressive given the monster appetite for artificial intelligence (AI) solutions.
One of Broadcom's major appeals these days is its expertise in application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), essentially custom chips for advanced functionalities like AI. Schafer pointed out that the company is a leader in this product category.
Looking good next to the big peer
On Thursday, Broadcom also benefited from the fact that it is not Nvidia. The chip giant stumbled that day, tripped up by a second quarter of fiscal 2026 earnings report that left many investors disappointed. It's likely more than a few of these folks defected to Broadcom as a better play on AI processing hardware.

The provision, set to close Friday, has long allowed parcels valued under $800 to enter the U.S. without duties. President Donald Trump and the Republicans quickly targeted what some have called a “loophole” as part of their economic agenda. Trump first closed the loophole for goods inbound from China and Hong Kong in April, but has since extended that to all countries; Republican lawmakers’ tax bill, which passed in July, also collapses de minimis by law effective 2027.

De Minimis Draw Down Ushers in Uncertain Future for 1.4B Packages
That has seen some e-commerce companies, like Shein, Temu and AliExpress, raising their prices and changing their advertising strategies as they prepared to pay import duties on direct-to-consumer parcels, specifically those from China. The former two companies have also put an emphasis on global expansion into markets that still have duty-free provisions in place.
While some Millennial and Gen Z favorites will have to grapple with the change, others see it as an opportunity.
On URBN’s earnings call Wednesday, CEO Dick Hayne said the end of the provision is likely to benefit the company’s core brand, Urban Outfitters. URBN also owns Anthropologie, Free People and Nuuly.
In response to an analyst question about how the de minimis change will influence URBN’s business, co-president and chief operating officer, said the provision was “really immaterial,” noting that only a small amount of the company’s sales were benefited by the exemption.
Hayne echoed that statement and went as far as to say that low-value e-commerce marketplaces adjusting to the collapse is likely to aid Urban Outfitters’ sales.
“As far as the Urban brand is concerned, it can only help,” he said. “Some of the folks who were big into this—Shein and some others—are obviously having a little bit harder time coping with some of the new regulations. So to the degree that they’re shipping less, it should help us.”
Despite the benefit that the company could reap from the de minimis change, its leadership has previously noted that it expects to be impacted by tariffs. On a May earnings call, leaders noted that they would frontload inventory to avoid disruptions to its fall assortment, and on Wednesday, the company noted that it has higher-than-average inventory stock because it intentionally brought products in sooner.",e60366e279ec7859c03f38356d1ee920,trafilatura

Expectations Are Sky-High—And So Are The Risks
Wall Street is betting big on a blockbuster quarter.
According to Benzinga Pro estimates, Nvidia is expected to post earnings per share of $1.01, up a staggering 48.5% from the 68 cents it reported in the second quarter last year. Revenue is forecast to reach $46.02 billion, which would mark a 53.2% jump from the $30.04 billion recorded in the same quarter of 2024.
Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.
Options markets are bracing for a volatile move. According to Goldman Sachs, Nvidia options are pricing in a swing of 6.2%, either up or down, following the report.
That's slightly above the stock's average earnings-day move of 5.9% over the past eight quarters.
What Could Move Nvidia?
Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider said the key to Nvidia's stock reaction won't just be whether it beats estimates, but how much it raises guidance—and what it says about China.
""Expectations are high and investors we have spoken with are almost universally long heading into the print,"" Schneider said. ""That raises the degree of difficulty for second-half commentary and guidance.""
Schneider flagged three major areas to watch on the call. First, the shape and pace of the Blackwell chip ramp will be critical, as any upside in third-quarter guidance is likely to hinge on shipments of these new AI chips, particularly outside of China.

The medical device specialist unveiled its fiscal third-quarter results.
-
Some analysts and investors had been hoping for better performance from the company's leading division.
The stock of medical device specialist Cooper Companies (NASDAQ: COO) was hurting on the second-to-last trading day of the week. It sank to a 13% loss on the day, following the publication of the company's latest quarterly earnings release. In contrast, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) successfully treaded water, with a 0.3% increase.
Cloudy vision?
Cooper's third quarter of fiscal 2025 saw the company book slightly over $1.06 billion in revenue, representing a year-over-year improvement of 6%. Of its two divisions, the larger one, CooperVision (CVI), matched that percentage increase by contributing more than $718 million to the top line. CooperSurgical's (CSI) sales, meanwhile, rose 4% to almost $342 million.
That $1.06 billion was broadly in line with the consensus analyst estimate, but the company admitted that it didn't meet its own expectations.
On the bottom line, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) adjusted net income also headed higher. It came in at a bit over $220 million ($1.10 per share), bettering the year-ago result by 15%. That per-share number was also a shade higher than the $1.06 average estimate of pundits tracking Cooper stock.
It was clear that the market was expecting better. In a post-earnings research update, Piper Sandler analyst Jason Bednar wrote that Cooper's leading division didn't live up to many hopes. According to reports, its organic growth figure was the lowest since the Great Recession.
Annual growth on the way, company says
Cooper proffered guidance for both its current (fourth) quarter and the entirety of fiscal 2025. For the latter period, it's modeling just under $4.08 billion to nearly $4.1 billion in revenue, and adjusted net income of $4.08 to $4.12 per share. The company earned slightly below $3.9 billion on the top line in fiscal 2024, and $3.69 per share for adjusted net income.

Boosted by its acquisition of British beauty retailer Space NK and shrugging off the end of its partnership with Target Corp., Ulta Beauty beat Wall Street forecasts on both the top and bottom lines in the second quarter and lifted its full-year forecast.
Net sales increased 9.3 percent to $2.8 billion in its second quarter, compared to $2.6 billion, primarily due to increased comparable sales, the acquisition of Space NK, and new store contribution. Wall Street had forecast sales of $2.67 billion.

Net income rose 3.3 percent to $260.9 million, compared to $252.6 million. Diluted earnings per share rose 9.1 percent to $5.78, compared to $5.30 and beating analysts’ estimates of $5.10.
Ulta is now forecasting full-year sales between $12 billion and $12.1 billion, up from $11.5 billion to $11.7 billion. Diluted earnings per share are expected to come in between $23.85 and $24.30, an increase from its previous forecast of $22.65 to $23.20.
Kecia Steelman, president and chief executive officer, said: “As we look to the future, we remain committed to executing our Ulta Beauty Unleashed strategy and strengthening our operating model. Our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects both the strength of our year-to-date performance and our caution around how consumer demand may evolve in the second half of the year. While near-term uncertainty persists, we’re staying focused on what we can control and on executing with excellence to deliver our uniquely Ulta Beauty experience.”
Ulta acquired Space NK from investment firm Manzanita Capital in July. Terms of the deal were not disclosed apart from that the purchase was funded with cash on hand and capacity under Ulta’s existing credit facility.
Press reports from last year suggested Manzanita was searching for a deal valued between 300 million pounds and 400 million pounds.
Space NK has 83 stores in the U.K. and Ireland and turnover of 196.5 million pounds in 2024.
During a post earnings call with analysts, Steelman said: “Our acquisition of U.K. specialty beauty retailer Space NK was a unique and strategically compelling opportunity to enter the growing U.K. market with an established and successful player, a top destination for beauty lovers. Space NK will continue to operate as a stand-alone subsidiary, with CEO Andy Lightfoot and his talented team staying at the helm leading operations from the U.K., we see opportunities to leverage each other’s strengths, talents and expertise, and over the long-term, we will focus on sharing best practices and transferring learnings between markets, particularly around assortment, guest experience and scaling growth.”
Continuing its international expansion, Ulta just celebrated the soft opening of its first store in Mexico, with the grand opening to come in a few weeks, and remains on track to open its first store in the Middle East later this year.
On the end of its partnership with Target, Steelman said: “For perspective, the royalty revenue from our Target partnership in fiscal 2024 was well below 1 percent of net sales.”
Providing a breakdown of the second-quarter sales numbers, Steelman noted that fragrance continued to be the strongest-performing category, delivering robust double-digit growth. Performance was fueled by successful Mother’s Day and Father’s Day activations, newness and strength and gift sets and men’s fragrances.
Sales in the skin care and wellness category increased in the high-single digit range, led by strong growth in body care and wellness across both mass and prestige.
The makeup category delivered midsingle-digit comp growth, while sales in the hair care category increased in the midsingle-digit range, supported by growth in professional hair care, accessories and hair tools.

That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.
Imagine scrolling through your phone when suddenly, you receive a text from your bank alerting you to an unusual transaction. A sizable amount of money has been taken out of your account, but you definitely didn’t authorize it.
You were likely the victim of identity theft — an increasingly common problem. Last year, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) received more than 1.1 million complaints of identity theft and about 2.6 million complaints of related fraud for the same period, resulting in total financial losses of more than $12.7 billion.
While having your identity stolen can be a stressful experience, understanding how to spot the signs of fraud and knowing what to do if you’re a victim can help you recover your personal information and money.
This embedded content is not available in your region.
What is identity theft?
Identity theft happens when someone uses your personal information — such as your name, Social Security number, credit card number, or bank account details — without your permission to commit fraud or other crimes.
For example, an identity thief might:
-
Open credit cards or loans in your name
-
Drain your bank account or make unauthorized purchases
-
File false tax returns to collect refunds
-
Use your identity to receive medical care or government benefits
Fraudsters may also use your personal information to carry out other illegal activities, including insurance and mail fraud, creating a synthetic identity combining aspects of your real data with false data, or even using your driver’s license number to create fake IDs for sale on the dark web.

How does identity theft happen?
Identity thieves can access your personal information through direct theft, such as stealing your ID from your wallet, retrieving sensitive documents from the trash, or snatching up a lost debit card.
Online, thieves can also illegally access your bank account or credit card information by hacking into databases that store large amounts of customer information. That information can then be used to commit fraud or be sold to other criminals for the same purpose.
Thieves will also deceive people into sharing their financial information through “phishing.” This involves sending a fake email, text message, or social media message that looks like it’s coming from a trusted source (such as your bank, a familiar retailer, or a government agency) with a link that takes you to a look-alike website or asks you to download an attachment.
Once you enter your information or download the file, the scammers steal your data and/or install malware on your device that records keystrokes or accesses stored passwords.
Identity theft risks and red flags
While it can be difficult to pinpoint exactly when identity theft occurs, there are a few warning signs that should prompt you to take action:
-
Missing wallet/cards: A lost wallet or debit/credit card increases the likelihood that your information will fall into the wrong hands. As soon as you notice you’ve lost your wallet or its contents, contact your financial institution to freeze and replace any cards that may have been compromised.
-
Unusual/fraudulent charges: If you discover any debit or credit card transactions that you don’t recall making, it could be a sign that your identity has been stolen.
-
New accounts or loans in your name: Similarly, if a new account or loan application appears on your credit reports, but you haven’t applied for new credit recently, it’s likely the result of identity theft.
-
Lower credit score: If you haven’t applied for new credit or missed any payments, a sudden drop in your credit score could be a sign that someone else is mishandling fraudulent accounts in your name.
-
Issues with your mail: If you aren’t receiving bills, statements, or other expected mail, it could be due to an identity thief changing your mailing address. Alternatively, if you start receiving bills or collection notices for accounts you don’t recognize, or getting medical bills for services you never received, identity theft could be the culprit.

How to protect yourself against identity theft
While identity theft is common, it’s also preventable in many cases. Here are a few steps you can take to lower your odds of becoming a victim of identity theft.
Use secure passwords and PINs
Using strong and unique passwords for your financial accounts makes it harder for online hackers to steal your account information. Avoid passwords that contain easy-to-guess information, such as birthdates, family names, maiden names, or other personal details that can be found online. Also, avoid using common words or number combinations, such as “1234” as your PIN or “password” for your online banking login.
And don’t worry if you can’t memorize all of these unique passwords — you can use an online password manager to securely store them. Periodically changing your passwords can also help keep your accounts safe. McAfee, a well-known cybersecurity company, recommends changing your passwords every three months. Adding two-factor authentication creates another layer of security.
Read more: Is it safe to link your bank accounts to financial tools and apps?
Keep your cards and documents secure
One of the simplest ways to lower your risk is by safeguarding sensitive information. Avoid carrying unnecessary documents, like your Social Security card, in your wallet. Store important papers such as birth certificates and passports in a safe place at home. When discarding old mail, bank statements, or bills, shred them instead of tossing them in the trash, where they could be recovered.
Avoid over-sharing on social media
Be mindful of what you share online. Social media can make it easy for criminals to piece together details like your birthday, address, or even answers to common security questions. So, limit the amount of personal information you post publicly.
Monitor your accounts and credit
Early detection is one of the best defenses against identity theft. Regularly review your credit card and bank statements for unauthorized transactions. Also, consider setting up account alerts that notify you of unusual purchases, large withdrawals, or changes to your account settings.
You should also keep an eye on your credit report. Federal law entitles you to a free report from each of the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) through AnnualCreditReport.com. Checking your reports helps you spot accounts you didn’t open or errors that could signal fraud.
What to do if your identity is stolen
If, despite your best efforts, you end up the victim of identity theft, there are a few immediate steps you should take. Remember, acting quickly can limit the damage and help you recover more of your money.
-
Freeze your credit: You can contact each of the three major credit bureaus to report fraudulent activity and place a security freeze on your credit. When you freeze your credit, your credit file gets locked, and creditors can’t see your report unless you temporarily “unfreeze” it. Since most companies require a credit check before issuing a loan or credit card, this stops identity thieves from opening new credit in your name.
-
Contact financial institutions: Call the fraud departments of any bank, credit card issuer, lender, or utility company where your information was misused, and ask them to close or freeze fraudulent accounts and send you written confirmation. Also, dispute any unauthorized charges immediately — the sooner you do, the lower your financial liability.
-
File a report with the FTC: You can report theft to the Federal Trade Commission online at IdentityTheft.gov or by calling 1-877-438-4338. The site will generate a personalized recovery plan and pre-filled letters/forms you can use when disputing fraudulent activity.

Boosted by its acquisition of British beauty retailer Space NK and shrugging off the end of its partnership with Target Corp., Ulta Beauty beat Wall Street forecasts on both the top and bottom lines in the second quarter and lifted its full-year forecast.
Net sales increased 9.3 percent to $2.8 billion in its second quarter, compared to $2.6 billion, primarily due to increased comparable sales, the acquisition of Space NK, and new store contribution. Wall Street had forecast sales of $2.67 billion.

Net income rose 3.3 percent to $260.9 million, compared to $252.6 million. Diluted earnings per share rose 9.1 percent to $5.78, compared to $5.30 and beating analysts’ estimates of $5.10.
Ulta is now forecasting full-year sales between $12 billion and $12.1 billion, up from $11.5 billion to $11.7 billion. Diluted earnings per share are expected to come in between $23.85 and $24.30, an increase from its previous forecast of $22.65 to $23.20.
Kecia Steelman, president and chief executive officer, said: “As we look to the future, we remain committed to executing our Ulta Beauty Unleashed strategy and strengthening our operating model. Our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects both the strength of our year-to-date performance and our caution around how consumer demand may evolve in the second half of the year. While near-term uncertainty persists, we’re staying focused on what we can control and on executing with excellence to deliver our uniquely Ulta Beauty experience.”
Ulta acquired Space NK from investment firm Manzanita Capital in July. Terms of the deal were not disclosed apart from that the purchase was funded with cash on hand and capacity under Ulta’s existing credit facility.
Press reports from last year suggested Manzanita was searching for a deal valued between 300 million pounds and 400 million pounds.
Space NK has 83 stores in the U.K. and Ireland and turnover of 196.5 million pounds in 2024.
During a post earnings call with analysts, Steelman said: “Our acquisition of U.K. specialty beauty retailer Space NK was a unique and strategically compelling opportunity to enter the growing U.K. market with an established and successful player, a top destination for beauty lovers. Space NK will continue to operate as a stand-alone subsidiary, with CEO Andy Lightfoot and his talented team staying at the helm leading operations from the U.K., we see opportunities to leverage each other’s strengths, talents and expertise, and over the long-term, we will focus on sharing best practices and transferring learnings between markets, particularly around assortment, guest experience and scaling growth.”
Continuing its international expansion, Ulta just celebrated the soft opening of its first store in Mexico, with the grand opening to come in a few weeks, and remains on track to open its first store in the Middle East later this year.
On the end of its partnership with Target, Steelman said: “For perspective, the royalty revenue from our Target partnership in fiscal 2024 was well below 1 percent of net sales.”
Providing a breakdown of the second-quarter sales numbers, Steelman noted that fragrance continued to be the strongest-performing category, delivering robust double-digit growth. Performance was fueled by successful Mother’s Day and Father’s Day activations, newness and strength and gift sets and men’s fragrances.
Sales in the skin care and wellness category increased in the high-single digit range, led by strong growth in body care and wellness across both mass and prestige.
The makeup category delivered midsingle-digit comp growth, while sales in the hair care category increased in the midsingle-digit range, supported by growth in professional hair care, accessories and hair tools.

That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.
Imagine scrolling through your phone when suddenly, you receive a text from your bank alerting you to an unusual transaction. A sizable amount of money has been taken out of your account, but you definitely didn’t authorize it.
You were likely the victim of identity theft — an increasingly common problem. Last year, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) received more than 1.1 million complaints of identity theft and about 2.6 million complaints of related fraud for the same period, resulting in total financial losses of more than $12.7 billion.
While having your identity stolen can be a stressful experience, understanding how to spot the signs of fraud and knowing what to do if you’re a victim can help you recover your personal information and money.
This embedded content is not available in your region.
What is identity theft?
Identity theft happens when someone uses your personal information — such as your name, Social Security number, credit card number, or bank account details — without your permission to commit fraud or other crimes.
For example, an identity thief might:
-
Open credit cards or loans in your name
-
Drain your bank account or make unauthorized purchases
-
File false tax returns to collect refunds
-
Use your identity to receive medical care or government benefits
Fraudsters may also use your personal information to carry out other illegal activities, including insurance and mail fraud, creating a synthetic identity combining aspects of your real data with false data, or even using your driver’s license number to create fake IDs for sale on the dark web.

How does identity theft happen?
Identity thieves can access your personal information through direct theft, such as stealing your ID from your wallet, retrieving sensitive documents from the trash, or snatching up a lost debit card.
Online, thieves can also illegally access your bank account or credit card information by hacking into databases that store large amounts of customer information. That information can then be used to commit fraud or be sold to other criminals for the same purpose.
Thieves will also deceive people into sharing their financial information through “phishing.” This involves sending a fake email, text message, or social media message that looks like it’s coming from a trusted source (such as your bank, a familiar retailer, or a government agency) with a link that takes you to a look-alike website or asks you to download an attachment.
Once you enter your information or download the file, the scammers steal your data and/or install malware on your device that records keystrokes or accesses stored passwords.
Identity theft risks and red flags
While it can be difficult to pinpoint exactly when identity theft occurs, there are a few warning signs that should prompt you to take action:
-
Missing wallet/cards: A lost wallet or debit/credit card increases the likelihood that your information will fall into the wrong hands. As soon as you notice you’ve lost your wallet or its contents, contact your financial institution to freeze and replace any cards that may have been compromised.
-
Unusual/fraudulent charges: If you discover any debit or credit card transactions that you don’t recall making, it could be a sign that your identity has been stolen.
-
New accounts or loans in your name: Similarly, if a new account or loan application appears on your credit reports, but you haven’t applied for new credit recently, it’s likely the result of identity theft.
-
Lower credit score: If you haven’t applied for new credit or missed any payments, a sudden drop in your credit score could be a sign that someone else is mishandling fraudulent accounts in your name.
-
Issues with your mail: If you aren’t receiving bills, statements, or other expected mail, it could be due to an identity thief changing your mailing address. Alternatively, if you start receiving bills or collection notices for accounts you don’t recognize, or getting medical bills for services you never received, identity theft could be the culprit.

How to protect yourself against identity theft
While identity theft is common, it’s also preventable in many cases. Here are a few steps you can take to lower your odds of becoming a victim of identity theft.
Use secure passwords and PINs
Using strong and unique passwords for your financial accounts makes it harder for online hackers to steal your account information. Avoid passwords that contain easy-to-guess information, such as birthdates, family names, maiden names, or other personal details that can be found online. Also, avoid using common words or number combinations, such as “1234” as your PIN or “password” for your online banking login.
And don’t worry if you can’t memorize all of these unique passwords — you can use an online password manager to securely store them. Periodically changing your passwords can also help keep your accounts safe. McAfee, a well-known cybersecurity company, recommends changing your passwords every three months. Adding two-factor authentication creates another layer of security.
Read more: Is it safe to link your bank accounts to financial tools and apps?
Keep your cards and documents secure
One of the simplest ways to lower your risk is by safeguarding sensitive information. Avoid carrying unnecessary documents, like your Social Security card, in your wallet. Store important papers such as birth certificates and passports in a safe place at home. When discarding old mail, bank statements, or bills, shred them instead of tossing them in the trash, where they could be recovered.
Avoid over-sharing on social media
Be mindful of what you share online. Social media can make it easy for criminals to piece together details like your birthday, address, or even answers to common security questions. So, limit the amount of personal information you post publicly.
Monitor your accounts and credit
Early detection is one of the best defenses against identity theft. Regularly review your credit card and bank statements for unauthorized transactions. Also, consider setting up account alerts that notify you of unusual purchases, large withdrawals, or changes to your account settings.
You should also keep an eye on your credit report. Federal law entitles you to a free report from each of the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) through AnnualCreditReport.com. Checking your reports helps you spot accounts you didn’t open or errors that could signal fraud.
What to do if your identity is stolen
If, despite your best efforts, you end up the victim of identity theft, there are a few immediate steps you should take. Remember, acting quickly can limit the damage and help you recover more of your money.
-
Freeze your credit: You can contact each of the three major credit bureaus to report fraudulent activity and place a security freeze on your credit. When you freeze your credit, your credit file gets locked, and creditors can’t see your report unless you temporarily “unfreeze” it. Since most companies require a credit check before issuing a loan or credit card, this stops identity thieves from opening new credit in your name.
-
Contact financial institutions: Call the fraud departments of any bank, credit card issuer, lender, or utility company where your information was misused, and ask them to close or freeze fraudulent accounts and send you written confirmation. Also, dispute any unauthorized charges immediately — the sooner you do, the lower your financial liability.
-
File a report with the FTC: You can report theft to the Federal Trade Commission online at IdentityTheft.gov or by calling 1-877-438-4338. The site will generate a personalized recovery plan and pre-filled letters/forms you can use when disputing fraudulent activity.

Even though demand was just as high as ever, half as many new international graduate students showed up for fall classes compared to last year.
The decline represents a hit to the bottom line for Central Missouri, a small public university that operates close to its margins with an endowment of only $65 million. International students typically account for nearly a quarter of its tuition revenue.
“We aren’t able to subsidize domestic students as much when we have fewer international students who are bringing revenue to us,” said Roger Best, the university's president.
Signs of a decline in international students have unsettled colleges around the U.S. Colleges with large numbers of foreign students and small endowments have little financial cushion to protect them from steep losses in tuition money.
International students represent at least 20% of enrollment at more than 100 colleges with endowments of less than $250,000 per student, according to an Associated Press analysis. Many are small Christian colleges, but the group also includes large universities such as Northeastern and Carnegie Mellon.
The extent of the change in enrollment will not be clear until the fall, Some groups have forecast a decline of as much as 40%, with a huge impact on college budgets and the wider U.S. economy.
International students face new scrutiny on several fronts
As part of a broader effort to reshape higher education, President Donald Trump has pressed colleges to limit their numbers of international students and heightened scrutiny of student visas. His administration has moved to deport foreign students involved in pro-Palestinian activism, and new student visa appointments were put on hold for weeks as it ramped up vetting of applicants' social media.
On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security said it will propose a rule that would put new limits on the time foreign students can stay in the U.S.
The policies have introduced severe financial instability for colleges, said Justin Gest, a professor at George Mason University who studies the politics of immigration.
Foreign students are not eligible for federal financial aid and often pay full price for tuition — double or even triple the in-state rate paid by domestic students at public universities.
“To put it more dollars and cents-wise, if an international student comes in and pays $80,000 a year in tuition, that gives universities the flexibility to offer lower fees and more scholarship money to American students,” Gest said.
A Sudanese student barely made it to the US for the start of classes
Ahmed Ahmed, a Sudanese student, nearly didn't make it to the U.S. for his freshman year at the University of Rochester.
The Trump administration in June announced a travel ban on 12 countries, including Sudan. Diplomatic officials assured Ahmed he could still enter the U.S. because his visa was issued before the ban. But when he tried to board a flight to leave for the U.S. from Uganda, where he stayed with family during the summer, he was turned away and advised to contact an embassy about his visa.
With the help of the University of Rochester’s international office, Ahmed was able to book another flight.
At Rochester, where he received a scholarship to study electrical engineering, Ahmed, 19, said he feels supported by the staff. But he also finds himself on edge and understands why other students might not want to subject themselves to the scrutiny in the U.S., particularly those who are entirely paying their own way.
“I feel like I made it through, but I’m one of the last people to make it through,” he said.
Colleges are taking steps to blunt the impact
In recent years, international students have made up about 30% of enrollment at Central Missouri, which has a total of around 12,800 students. In anticipation of the hit to international enrollment, Central Missouri cut a cost-of-living raise for employees. It has pushed off infrastructure improvements planned for its campus and has been looking for other ways to cut costs.
Small schools — typically classified as those with no more than 5,000 students — tend to have less financial flexibility and will be especially vulnerable, said Dick Startz, an economics professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Lee University, a Christian institution with 3,500 students in Tennessee, is expecting 50 to 60 international students enrolled this fall, down from 82 the previous school year, representing a significant drop in revenue for the school, said Roy Y. Chan, the university’s director of graduate studies.
The school already has increased tuition by 20% over the past five years to account for a decrease in overall enrollment, he said.
“Since we’re a smaller liberal arts campus, tuition cost is our main, primary revenue,” Chan said, as opposed to government funding or donations.
The strains on international enrollment only add to distress for schools already on the financial brink.
Colleges around the country have been closing as they cope with declines in domestic enrollment, a consequence of changing demographics and the effects of the pandemic. Nationwide, private colleges have been closing at a rate of about two per month, according to the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association.
The number of high school graduates in the U.S. is expected to decline through 2041, when there will be 13% fewer compared to 2024, according to projections from the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education.
“That means that if you lost participation from international students, it’s even worse,” Startz said.

According to reporting from the Financial Times, at a Deutsche Bank conference on Thursday, Intel’s CFO David Zinsner shared new details about the company’s recent deal with the Trump administration, which gave the U.S. government a 10% equity stake.
The deal was structured in a way to penalize Intel if it spins out its foundry business unit, which makes custom chips for outside customers, within the next few years.
Last week’s deal included a five-year warrant that would allow the U.S. government to take an additional 5% of Intel, at $20 a share, if the company held less than 51% equity in its foundry business. Zinsner said he expects that warrant to expire.
“I think from the government’s perspective, they were aligned with that; they didn’t want to see us take the business and spin it off or sell it to somebody,” he said.
Zinsner added that the company received $5.7 billion in cash on Wednesday, as a result of last week’s deal, according to Reuters. (That cash comes from the remaining grants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act.)
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters today that the deal was still being ironed out.
Intel declined to comment on the deal beyond Zinsner’s remarks.
This deal structure is clearly a testament to the Trump administration’s desire to bring more chip manufacturing to the United States as many players in the industry turn to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s offshore manufacturing instead.
But this warrant also forces Intel to keep a business unit that is losing money. Intel Foundry reported an operating income loss of $3.1 billion during the second quarter and has been a source of strife for the semiconductor business.
There have been calls from analysts, board members, and investors alike to spin out the struggling foundry unit, which looked like it might actually happen last fall, before Intel Foundry’s architect, former CEO Pat Gelsinger, retired suddenly in December.",b7f34cd412cc14738380d79c5acca5cb,trafilatura

-
Two accountants said the ""biggest surprise"" of earnings season was how many companies beat expectations.
-
Four fifths of S&P 500 companies beat analysts' revenue forecasts in Q2, per FactSet.
-
A host of the ""Stocks and Savings"" podcast said the AI boom was overpowering the fear of tariffs.
A couple of accountants broke down how earnings season has been — and found a surprise.
""Stocks and Savings"" podcast co-hosts Andreea Ion and James Galbin discussed on a recent episode how their portfolios fared in second-quarter earnings.
""I think the biggest surprise was actually how strong the reports were,"" Ion said, citing data from financial data platform FactSet that 81% of companies in the S&P 500 beat analysts' revenue forecasts in Q2.
Galvin said this was surprising given fears of how tariffs would upset the global economy.
""On one hand, you have the boom in artificial intelligence that companies are pouring money into left, right, and center,"" he said. ""But then on the other hand, you've got US tariffs that are at their highest since the Great Depression and are slowly but surely making themselves felt in the economy.""
""I think it was a case of Big Tech and the AI boom simply overpowering any downside caused by tariffs,"" Galvin added.
FactSet's report was issued in early August and was based on 90% of S&P 500 firms that announced results at that time. It found that the proportion of those surpassing Wall Street expectations for earnings per share and revenue was above both the five-year average of 78% and the 10-year average of 75% for earnings per share, per FactSet.
""If 81% is the final number for the quarter, it will mark the highest percentage of S&P 500 companies reporting a positive EPS surprise for a quarter since Q3 2023 (also 81%),"" John Butters, vice president and senior earnings analyst and author of the report, wrote.
He said that, in aggregate, the companies that beat analysts' estimates did so by 8.4%.
The financial, communication services, information, tech, and consumer discretionary services sectors have been the largest contributors to the earnings surprises that drove an overall rise in the index's year-on-year growth rate during this period, which FactSet estimated to be 11.8%.
Some of the best performers were Warner Bros. Discovery, which achieved $0.63 earnings per share compared to analysts' consensus of a loss per share of $0.24; Coinbase Global, which had $5.14 versus $1.19; and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which had $12.89 versus $8.43.

The analysts said that the price of the leading digital coin should be at $126,000 per coin, although they believe that BTC could still climb that high year-end.
Bitcoin was recently trading at about $111,950, according to CoinGecko data, virtually unmoved over a 24-hour and seven-day period. BTC hit a new all-time high of $124,128 earlier this month.
""The Bitcoin price looks too low compared to gold as Bitcoin volatility reaches historically low levels,"" the note authored by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou read.
The huge price swings characteristic of Bitcoin in previous cycles have become rarer since institutions flooded into the space and spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds started trading in the U.S. last year.
Analysts have previously told Decrypt that as the asset matures, it's less likely to experience dramatic drops and surges.
""One of the striking developments this year has been the collapse in Bitcoin [volatility] from close to 60% at the beginning of the year to a historically low level of 30% currently,"" the note added.
""We believe a factor behind the collapse in Bitcoin volatility has been the acceleration of Bitcoin purchases by corporate treasuries.""
The report added: ""It is thus realistic to expect that the allocations to bitcoin by institutional investors could match those of competing asset classes such as gold if there is convergence in volatilities.""
A number of publicly-traded companies have this year followed Nasdaq-listed Strategy—formerly MicroStrategy—and bought Bitcoin to get better results for shareholders. Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) started buying Bitcoin in 2020 and its stock has soared as a result.
Gold Is Still the Safe-Haven King, While Bitcoin Loses Out: JP Morgan
The Bitcoin versus gold debate has raged for years since Bitcoin in the past has correlated to the precious metal. Advocates describe the top cryptocurrency as ""digital gold.""
But the asset—which debuted in 2009—has also in recent years correlated with U.S. equities, especially tech stocks.",11315185a561a554ec384004e9a1cbbf,trafilatura

(Reuters) -Star Entertainment reported a narrower full-year loss on Friday, but high remediation costs and weak patron spending kept the cash-strapped casino operator dependent on lenders, regulators and the government to fend off any ""challenges"".
The casino operator posted a statutory net loss after tax of A$471.5 million ($306.4 million) for the year ended June 30, compared with a loss of A$1.69 billion a year earlier.
The result, however, fell short of analysts' estimate of a A$244.5 million loss, according to data from Visible Alpha.
""Group continues to require significant support from a range of its stakeholders, including governments, regulators, lenders and investors,"" said group CEO and managing director, Steve McCann.
""Without that support, it will be difficult to navigate the various challenges facing the Group.""
The company's lackluster performance underscores the regulatory challenges facing the group since 2021, when authorities launched probes into potential breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws.
""Star Entertainment's long-delayed FY25 results confirmed the dire picture already painted by analysts... Star remains pinned under debt disputes and regulatory headwinds, leaving investors staring at dilution risks or worse,"" said Mark Gardner, founder & CEO of MPC markets.
According to the company, soft trading conditions persisted through July, particularly at its suspended Star Sydney property, the firm's flagship property, which logged an annual operating loss of A$86.3 million.
The cash-strapped firm said it had A$234 million in capital as of June 30, up from A$98 million in available cash reported during interim results on April 11.
It has been exploring asset sales to shore up its dwindling cash reserves, with the latest move being a partial selldown of its stake in the Brisbane resort.
However, its efforts to stay afloat have faced setbacks, as refinancing proposals from U.S.-based Oaktree Capital Management and Melbourne-based investment firm Salter Brothers failed to materialise.

-
Kohl’s reported Q2 EPS of $0.56 on $3.35 billion in sales, topping Wall Street’s expectations.
-
Cost cutting and leaner inventory improved margins, though comparable-store sales still fell 4.2% year over year.
-
Shares spiked over 24% Wednesday on meme-stock momentum but are retreating as investors take profits.
Shares of Kohl's Corp (NYSE: KSS) fell on Thursday, finishing the day down 5%. The drop comes as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3% and 0.5%, respectively.
The retailer saw its stock spike yesterday after reporting earnings that beat Wall Street's expectations. Shares are retreating today after the initial excitement fades.
Kohl's did better than many expected
Kohl's reported second-quarter earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 on revenue of $3.35 billion, exceeding consensus targets of $0.29 per share on revenue of $3.32 billion.
Margins improved for the Wisconsin-based retailer after implementing cost-cutting measures and reducing inventory. Although comparable-store sales continued to fall year over year, declining by 4.2%, the rate of that decline is slowing.
Kohl's has captured the attention of a retail audience
Still, the fact it topped estimates helped send shares soaring yesterday as retail investors took the earnings as proof positive a true turnaround is possible. Kohl's has become one of the latest meme stocks whose success has been driven in large part by the retail audience. That means it's likely to see outsized spikes and drops that are larger than those experienced by most retail stocks. Today's retreat isn't being driven by specific news; rather, it's a natural response following yesterday's more than 24% jump as investors take profits.
I'm not sure I share the same sentiment fueling its meme-stock status. I think there are too many headwinds.
Should you invest $1,000 in Kohl's right now?

This bear looked awfully mighty following its latest earnings release.
-
It had a beat-and-raise second quarter, after all.
Investors sure were bullish on Build-A-Bear Workshop (NYSE: BBW) on Thursday, as they bid the custom plushie retailer's stock up in excess of 14% that trading session. In retrospect, that wasn't a stunning development, as the company posted convincing beats in its second quarter and raised certain guidance items in the process. That performance crushed the 0.3% rise of the S&P 500 index.
An ever-growing bear
Build-A-Bear Workshop, which, as its name implies, allows customers to design and create their own stuffed toys, published that period's figures Thursday morning. They revealed the company's revenue notched a new all-time record for the second quarter at over $124 million. That number was 11% higher year over year.
Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income enjoyed a far more sprightly double-digit bounce, increasing nearly 41% to almost $12.4 million, or $0.94 per share.
Both headline figures easily beat the consensus analyst estimates of $116 million for revenue and $0.74 per share for net profit.
Build-A-Bear Workshop had success on several fronts, which contributed to the surprisingly high revenue and profitability growth. The company said its consolidated e-commerce demand (online orders fulfilled by either its stores or warehouses) surged 15% higher, as did its revenue from franchising.
Puffed-up guidance
With those kinds of improvements, Build-A-Bear Workshop clearly felt confident enough to raise certain full-year guidance items. For the entirety of 2025, it now anticipates that revenue will rise in the mid- to high-single-digit percentage rates, with pre-tax income landing at $62 million to $70 million. The company also expects to add 50 to 60 new ""experience locations; these total over 600 at present. Build-A-Bear Workshop did not proffer net income guidance.

Should You Buy the Stock Here ? ,2025-08-30 06:15:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"The global tobacco market is expected to reach $411.35 billion in output in 2025, supported by a compound annual growth rate of 2.37% through 2029. Traditional cigarette sales, however, continue to face pressure as regulations tighten, with the World Health Organization reporting that 6.1 billion people worldwide are now covered by tobacco control measures.
At the same time, dividend-focused investors remain drawn to established tobacco companies for their steady cash flows and reliable shareholder returns. On Aug 21, Altria Group (MO) announced a 3.9% increase to its quarterly dividend, raising it to $1.06 per share from $1.02, marking the company’s 60th dividend increase in 56 years. The new annualized dividend of $4.24 per share translates into a yield of 6.3%.
This move ties directly to Altria’s dividend strategy, which aims for mid-single-digit annual growth through 2028, a plan that has consistently delivered even as the industry shifts toward reduced-risk products. With regulatory pressures building and the long-term picture for tobacco still uncertain, does Altria's enhanced dividend payout and Dividend King status make it a compelling buy at current levels? Let’s take a closer look.
How Altria's Metrics Stack Up Post-Raise
Altria, the parent company behind Marlboro and other smokeable and oral tobacco products, runs a business that is built on steady cash flow from its strong U.S. tobacco franchises while slowly moving into reduced-risk alternatives. That balance has supported solid stock gains in 2025, with shares climbing nearly 30% year-to-date (YTD).
On the valuation side, MO stock still looks fairly inexpensive. It trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 12.5x compared with the sector average near 17x, signaling modest growth without pricing in much of a premium.
Financial results from 2025 tell the full story. In the second quarter, net revenues came in at $6.1 billion, down 1.7% from the prior year, mainly due to declines in smokeable products. Still, revenues net of excise taxes edged higher by 0.2% to $5.3 billion. Reported EPS fell 36.2% to $1.41, largely due to a one-time boost in 2024 from the IQOS rights sale.
Stripping that out, adjusted EPS rose 8.3% to $1.44, driven by higher operating income and fewer shares outstanding. For the first half of the year, revenues declined 3.6% to $11.4 billion, but adjusted EPS improved 7.2% to $2.67, helped by efficiency gains, a lower adjusted tax rate, and fewer shares. Reported EPS for the half slipped 40.2% to $2.04, reflecting impairments and acquisition-related costs, though these did not impact the adjusted bottom line.
Altria's Core Strengths and Growth Catalysts
One of Altria’s most important growth drivers is its push beyond cigarettes, and the on! nicotine pouch brand continues to gain traction. In Q2 2025, shipments increased 26.5% to 52.1 million cans, while its share of the oral tobacco category rose to 8.7%, up 0.7 percentage points from a year earlier. Inside the pouch segment specifically, on! now holds a 17.9% share, giving Altria a stronger position in one of the few parts of the industry still growing.
At the same time, Altria is working on an even bigger step forward with heated tobacco. Through Horizon Innovations, its joint venture with Japan Tobacco International, the company is preparing to seek FDA approval for its Ploom heated tobacco devices in 2025. The partnership combines JTI’s device expertise with Altria’s regulatory know-how and its broad U.S. distribution system. If approved, Ploom could open up a new revenue stream by appealing to traditional smokers who have avoided e‑vapor products.
These efforts matter because they strengthen Altria’s core identity as a steady dividend payer. The company has now lifted its payout for 57 years in a row, with the latest increase bringing the quarterly dividend to $1.06 per share. The yield stands at about 6.03%, supported by a forward payout ratio just above 76%, showing the dividend remains well-covered by cash flow.
Analyst Views and What Lies Ahead for MO
Looking ahead, management has narrowed its 2025 full-year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.35 to $5.45. That represents 3% to 5% growth compared to the 2024 base of $5.19. Analyst estimates are in line with that target, with expectations for Q3 2025 at $1.42 versus $1.38 in the same quarter a year earlier, showing modest but steady progress year over year.
Wall Street’s view on the stock is less straightforward. BofA Securities kept its “Buy” rating on Aug. 22, 2025, and raised its price target from $64 to $72, pointing to confidence in Altria’s smoke-free strategy and dependable cash flows. The broader analyst group, however, is more cautious. Out of 15 surveyed, the consensus remains a solid “Hold,” reflecting worries about whether declining cigarette sales will limit future revenue growth.
This divide is clear when looking at price targets. The consensus mean target for the stock is $60, which is about 11% below Altria’s current price.
Conclusion
So, should you buy Altria after its latest dividend hike? If you’re an income-focused investor, the case is clear: a 6%+ yield, 57 straight years of dividend increases, and resilient cash flows make MO one of the most reliable income plays around. But for growth‑hungry investors, the story is trickier. Regulatory headwinds and flat top-line growth limit the stock’s upside, and with the consensus price target sitting below current levels, analysts don’t see much room for appreciation. Most likely, shares will tread water near current highs, rewarding investors through dividends rather than dramatic price gains.

Ethena led the percentage gains with a 243% revenue surge, jumping from $9.46 million to $32.48 million, as its synthetic dollar USDe captured market share from traditional stablecoins.
The protocol’s revenue expansion of $23 million represented the second-largest absolute increase among tracked applications.
Pump.fun posted the second-highest percentage growth at 79%, with revenue climbing from $22.55 million to $40.39 million.
The Solana-based memecoin launchpad benefited from continued speculation in newly created tokens, generating an additional $17.84 million in monthly fees.
Stablecoin dominance continues
Tether maintained market leadership despite modest 2.9% growth, with revenue rising from $614.79 million to $632.91 million.
The stablecoin issuer’s $18.12 million increase represented the largest absolute gain among protocols, reinforcing its position as the sector’s primary revenue generator.
Circle ranked second with revenue growing 4.5% from $197.59 million to $206.4 million, adding $8.81 million in monthly fees. Combined, the two stablecoin issuers accounted for 70% of total crypto protocol revenue during the tracking period.
Hyperliquid recorded substantial growth with revenue expanding 25.9% from $82.86 million to $104.3 million. The decentralized perpetual exchange captured an additional $21.43 million as trading volumes increased across its platform.
Mixed performance across sectors
Sky Protocol achieved 77.5% revenue growth, rising from $10.1 million to $17.93 million. Jupiter reported 23.5% growth, with revenue increasing from $21.95 million to $27.1 million, driven by activity in the Solana ecosystem.
Tron recorded moderate gains of 11.6%, with revenue climbing from $56.21 million to $62.73 million. Phantom wallet generated $22.82 million, up 9.5% from $20.84 million in the previous period.
Axiom provided the sole negative performance among top protocols, with revenue declining 13.9% from $62.11 million to $53.46 million. The cross-chain infrastructure provider lost $8.65 million in monthly fees, the only one in the group with a negative result.
Revenue growth occurs alongside the broader crypto market recovery, with protocols benefiting from increased user activity and higher fee generation across decentralized finance applications and trading platforms.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Major stock indexes fell on Friday, with technology shares including Dell Technologies leading declines, while the dollar weakened against the euro after U.S. inflation data kept alive expectations of a September interest rate cut.
Dell dropped 8.9% after it reported results late Thursday that included high manufacturing costs for artificial intelligence-optimized servers. Other AI-related shares fell in the broader tech selloff including Nvidia, down 3.3%, and Broadcom, down 3.6%. The Nasdaq fell more than 1% and the S&P 500 technology index fell 1.6%.
The U.S. Commerce Department said on Friday its Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) rose 0.2% in July, versus an unrevised 0.3% increase in June and matching the estimate of economists polled by Reuters.
In the 12 months through July, PCE inflation increased 2.6% after climbing 2.6% in June. Stripping out the volatile food and energy components, the so-called core PCE Price Index increased 0.3% last month. That followed a 0.3% rise in core inflation in June.
""You have to love it when a plan comes together. Today's numbers on both the personal consumption, expenditure, and income, and spending, were right down the middle of the fairway,"" Art Hogan, chief markets strategist for B. Riley Wealth in Boston, said via email.
""This leaves the door wide open for the Fed to cut rates in September and likely again in October and in December.""
Traders are now pricing in 89% odds of a cut by the Federal Reserve next month, up from 84% before the data.
Traders had increased bets on more cuts after Fed Chair Jerome Powell last Friday adopted an unexpectedly dovish tone.

Cronos kept rallying today thanks to excitement surrounding a new SPAC merger connected to Trump Media.
-
Crypto.com, which created the Cronos token, is merging with Yorkville Acquisition.
-
The combination of Crypto.com and Yorkville Acquisition will become Trump Media Group CRO -- a company with a crypto treasury strategy centered around Cronos.
Cronos (CRYPTO: CRO) is recording another day of explosive gains this Thursday. The cryptocurrency's token price was up 30.1% over the past 24 hours as of 6:15 p.m. ET. Over the same period, Bitcoin was up 1%, and Ethereum was flat.
Cronos is a cryptocurrency launched and maintained by Crypto.com, a crypto website and trading exchange platform. The token has seen massive gains recently following news of an expanded partnership with Trump Media and news that the company connected to President Donald Trump is making moves to launch a new cryptocurrency treasury. As of this writing, the token is up 131% over the last week of trading.
Cronos keeps soaring thanks to the Trump deal
On Tuesday, Trump Media announced that it had entered into a partnership with Yorkville Acquisition Corp. that will create a large new cryptocurrency treasury company. Yorkville Acquisition is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) and will be merging with Crypto.com to create Trump Media Group CRO -- a new publicly traded company built around crypto holdings.
The new company will purchase roughly $1 billion worth of the Cronos token, and investors have been bidding up the coin in response to the news. At the time of the announcement, a $1 billion position represented a roughly 19% stake in Cronos.
What's next for Cronos?
In addition to its $1 billion Cronos treasury, Trump Media Group CRO will have $200 million in cash and $220 million cash-in mandatory exercise warrants as well as a credit offering worth up to $5 billion from one of Yorkville's affiliates.
Trump Media is poised to own a majority stake in Trump Media Group CRO upon the completion of the SPAC merger. While the Cronos token seems to be attracting some powerful new allies, it remains to be seen if the cryptocurrency will be able to sustain bullish momentum or lose steam if its fundamentals are unable to support recent gains.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar weakened against the euro and Swiss franc on Friday, on course for a 2% decline in August against a basket of currencies, as traders prepared for a U.S. interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve next month.
The dollar, which initially firmed after U.S. inflation data came in as expected, later gave up gains, failing to break a three-day losing streak.
The U.S. Commerce Department reported on Friday that its Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index rose 0.2% last month after an unrevised 0.3% rise in June.
The data keeps the Fed on track for a widely expected rate cut at its upcoming meeting on September 16-17. Money markets are pricing in an 87% chance of an easing, up from 63% a month earlier, CME's FedWatch tool showed.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was down 0.09% at 97.803 in afternoon trading.
""FX markets remain range bound as investors await the next U.S. labor market report on September 5th,"" said Dan Tobon, head of G10 FX strategy at Citi.
Weak consumer sentiment continues to hang over an anxious market, which is rebalancing and hedging portfolios at month's end after U.S. equities rallied throughout August, said Uto Shinohara, senior investment strategist at Mesirow Currency Management.
Moreover, U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign to exert more influence over monetary policy, including this week's attempt to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, has weighed on the dollar.
A federal judge said on Friday she would set an expedited briefing schedule in Cook's bid to temporarily block Trump from firing her while she pursues a lawsuit that says he has no valid reason to remove her.
""Market instability remains in focus, further fueled by media coverage surrounding Fed Governor Cook's hearing regarding her contested dismissal,"" Shinohara said.
Trump is trying to reshape the Fed after repeatedly criticizing the central bank and its chair, Jerome Powell, for not cutting interest rates.
Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who is said to be under consideration by Trump to succeed Powell as the Fed chair, said on Thursday he wanted to start cutting rates next month and ""fully expects"" more rate cuts to follow to bring the central bank's policy rate closer to a neutral setting.
""Interestingly, the FX reaction function to policy announcements and developments with the Fed seems fairly muted – this could be a function of illiquid summer markets,"" said Citi's Tobon. ""Or it could be a function of markets expecting any changes at the Fed will lead to a cutting cycle similar to what is already priced. That reinforces our view it will be all about the data.""",e619b179dff71409aa494b659eca4007,trafilatura

Launched in 2009, Bitcoin is the world’s largest cryptocurrency today. With a market cap of $2.2 trillion, it accounts for more than 55% of the total crypto market.
In fact, BTC has grown more than 870% over the last five years. Several stocks riding the Bitcoin wave, such as MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR), have, in fact, soared 2,200% during the same period.
However, not every company tied to Bitcoin has achieved such an extraordinary success.
Block stock falls 50% in 5 years
One such example is Twitter founder Jack Dorsey's fintech firm Block, Inc. (NYSE: XYZ), which offers products such as Cash App for Bitcoin transfers, the self-custody Bitcoin wallet called Bitkey, and the Bitcoin mining unit called Proto, among others.
Over the last five years, the company's stock has fallen 48% due to slow growth amid a highly competitive market.
So, a trader who invested $10,000 in this stock five years ago would today be left with a little more than $5,000 only.
More News:
Coinbase stock falls 20%
Founded in 2012, Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) is the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., and it went public in April 2021. Notably, the stock joined the coveted S&P 500 club in May. However, it has lost 18% of its value over the last five years.
The decline can be attributed to shrinking transaction fees due to the highly competitive nature of the crypto industry.
Bitcoin mining stock that escaped bankruptcy loses all
Argo Blockchain (Nasdaq: ARBK) is one of the oldest Bitcoin mining firms that escaped bankruptcy in 2022 after receiving $35 million from Galaxy Digital (Nasdaq: GLXY) and selling its Helios mining facility to the investment firm for $65 million.
In July, it even received a delisting notice from the Nasdaq exchange due to ""a consistently low share price.""

The company ended its 2025 in style with an outstanding fourth-quarter earnings report.
-
This despite a slight decline in adjusted profitability.
Next-generation fintech Bill Holdings (NYSE: BILL), which specializes in cloud-based software solutions that assist with complex financial operations, was a hot stock on Thursday. It's little wonder, as the company delivered fiscal fourth-quarter results that obliterated analyst estimates.
Investors rewarded this by pushing the stock's price up by 18% on the day, far more than the S&P 500 index's 0.3% gain.
High billings
For the quarter, its final frame of fiscal 2025, Bill Holdings earned total revenue of $383 million for a sturdy year-over-year increase of 12%. The company's ""core"" revenue, consisting of its bread-and-butter subscription and transaction fees, advanced 15% to almost $346 million. Of the two components, transaction fees saw the higher growth, at 18% versus subscription's 5%.
As for profitability, Bill Holdings landed comfortably in the black, although profitability eroded a bit. Its non-GAAP (adjusted) net income was $61.6 million ($0.53 per share), against $63.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2024.
Both of those headline figures were more than good enough to top the consensus analyst projections. The prognosticators following Bill Holdings's stock were modeling revenue slightly above $376.5 million and adjusted net income of only $0.41 per share.
Management attributed the considerable improvements to several factors, including the rollout of new software and payment products, plus market expansion. The company now counts roughly 500,000 small and midsize businesses as its users, as well as 9,000 accounting firms.
1.6 billion reasons for optimism
Those factors should keep fueling growth, if Bill Holdings's guidance is accurate. For full-year fiscal 2026, the company is expecting revenue of just under $1.59 billion to almost $1.63 billion. This would represent an increase of at least 9% on the fiscal 2025 result.
Bill Holdings also forecast adjusted net income of $236 million to $260 million, which would translate to between $2 and $2.20 per share.

It's becoming increasingly apparent that the current crop of obesity drugs can treat other conditions, too.
-
A team of French medical researchers has been somewhat successful in treating a particular skin condition.
Numerous companies in the healthcare sector are feverishly busy developing obesity drugs, as these products have taken the medical world by storm. One of the more prominent developers, clinical-stage biotech Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX), saw its share price rise by almost 4% on Thursday on the back of encouraging research about a certain property of such treatments.
The stock's rise was more than good enough to convincingly beat the 0.3% bump higher of the benchmark S&P 500 index on the day.
Unexpected benefits
Not only are obesity drugs effective in reducing body weight, it seems they have knock-on effects on certain health conditions, too -- which is one of the major reasons investors have been hot on companies selling or developing them.
Thursday morning, a report published on Fox News's website detailed a new study indicating that GLP-1 agonists (substances that mimic a hormone that produces a feeling of satiety after eating) can have a positive effect on a particularly bothersome skin condition. This is hidradenitis suppurativa, which is characterized by small lumps that develop under the skin.
Citing research conducted by a group of French doctors and published in the JAMA Dermatology medical journal, the media outlet wrote that GLP-1 agonists appear to have general anti-inflammatory properties. At the very least it seems they might help in the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa; the researchers found that administration of GLP-1s were ""beneficial"" to the condition.
Double barreled
Viking's VK2735 is actually a dual agonist, as it targets not only the GLP-1 receptor but also a receptor known as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP).
Regardless, since it's partially a GLP-1 agonist, it's likely, if this research is accurate, to benefit those with hidradenitis suppurativa. That would add significantly to its value if Viking manages to fully develop and ultimately commercialize the very promising drug.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Oil prices fell on Friday as traders looked toward weaker demand in the U.S., the world's largest oil market, and a boost in supply this autumn from OPEC and its allies.
Brent crude futures for October delivery, which expired on Friday, settled at $68.12 a barrel, down 50 cents, or 0.73%. The more active contract for November finished down 53 cents, or 0.78%, at $67.45.
West Texas Intermediate crude futures settled at $64.01, down 59 cents, or 0.91%.
The market was in part shifting its focus toward next week's OPEC+ meeting, said Tamas Varga, analyst at PVM Oil Associates.
Crude output has increased from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, as the group has accelerated output hikes to regain market share, raising the supply outlook and weighing on global oil prices.
""Overall, the bottom line is we're going to see a jump in supply feeding into a lackluster demand market,"" said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates.
The U.S. summer driving season ends on Monday's Labor Day holiday, signalling the end of the highest demand period in the United States, which is the largest fuel market.
""The market is beginning to wonder what effect the tariffs might have on the economic outlook next year,"" Lipow said, referring to tariffs imposed by the administration of President Donald Trump on U.S. imports from many trading partners.
Crude supply increases have not made their way into the U.S. market yet, raising the possibility supply and demand will be in a tighter balance, said Phil Flynn, senior analyst with Price Futures Group.
""The pessimism about demand, I'm just not seeing it,"" Flynn said. ""Supply from OPEC is supposed to increase, but we're not seeing it in the U.S. I think things are going to stay tight.""
Prices rose earlier in the week due to Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil export terminals, but reports of talks between Ukraine's European allies about a possible ceasefire helped tamp down prices, Flynn said.
U.S. crude inventories for the week ending August 22 showed higher-than-expected draws, implying late-summer demand was still firm, particularly in industrial and freight-related sectors, analyst Ole Hvalbye at SEB bank said in a note. [EIA/S]
Investors are also watching for India's response to pressure from the United States to stop buying Russian oil, after Trump doubled tariffs on imports from India to as much as 50% on Wednesday.
So far, India has defied the U.S. and Russian oil exports to India are set to rise in September, traders said.",a9790f10650d24f16e74691dcb411f05,trafilatura

The EU introduced many import and export restrictions, leading to a 61% fall in exports to Russia and an 89% fall in imports from Russia between the first quarter of 2022 and the second quarter of 2025.
According to Euronews research based on Eurostat data, trade in the second quarter of 2025 dropped to the lowest level since 2002, when records began. In the same quarter, the EU also recorded its first trade surplus with Russia in more than 20 years.
So, what are the main export and import flows in 2025? How has trade between the EU and Russia changed since the invasion of Ukraine? And how important is trade with Russia for the EU?
EU trade with Russia
According to Eurostat, in the second quarter of 2025 imports from Russia fell, while exports to Russia rose compared with the previous quarter. As a result, the EU’s trade balance with Russia, which had always shown a deficit, turned into a small surplus of €0.5 billion. Imports were worth €7 billion, while exports to Russia reached €7.5 billion, bringing total trade to €14.5 billion.
This represents an 82% drop in trade volume compared with the first quarter of 2022, when the Russian invasion began and trade stood at €81.9 billion. That quarter marked the third-highest level since records began in 2002, with the peak reached in the first quarter of 2013 at €82.9 billion.
The EU, together with the G7 countries and other like-minded partners, stopped treating Russia as 'a Most-Favoured-Nation' and implemented a fourth package of sanctions on 15 March 2022. This removed key trade benefits that Russia enjoyed as a World Trade Organization (WTO) member. Instead of raising import tariffs, the EU chose to act through sanctions, including bans and restrictions on both imports and exports of certain goods.

Extra-EU trade refers to transactions with all countries outside the EU.
Russia’s share of extra-EU exports fell from 3.2% in the first quarter of 2022 to 1.2% in the second quarter of 2025. Over the same period, its share of extra-EU imports dropped from 9.3% to just 1.1%. This an 88% decline.",5824ef61b2081ca20a6536fdf9388d83,trafilatura

On July 9, Verona Pharma plc (NASDAQ:VRNA) announced that it will be acquired by Merck (NYSE:MRK) in a transaction valued at around $10 billion.
Recently, on August 14, H.C. Wainwright analyst Raghuram Selvaraju downgraded Verona Pharma plc (NASDAQ:VRNA) from Buy to Neutral; however, he raised the price target from $90 to $107. The analyst noted the rating is due to Merck acquiring the company for $107 per American Depositary Share, which represents eight Verona Pharma ordinary shares.
The acquisition will give Merck access to Ohtuvayre, a new drug approved by the FDA in June 2024. The CEO of Verona Pharma plc (NASDAQ:VRNA) noted the rapid uptake of Ohtuvayre since its launch in August 2024 in the US and believes Merck’s scale will help reach more patients.
Verona Pharma plc (NASDAQ:VRNA) is a biopharmaceutical company that develops innovative treatments for chronic respiratory diseases. Their first commercial product is Ohtuvayre, which is an inhaled therapy for COPD.

Luxxfolio views Litecoin “as hard currency,” CEO and Director Tomek Antoniak said in a statement.
“In our sector, scale is critical—the larger our treasury, infrastructure, and ecosystem footprint, the greater our ability to capture market share and influence adoption,” Antoniak said, adding that the shelf would give Luxxfolio “flexibility” to scale and meet market demands.
Once approved, Luxxfolio’s shelf prospectus will enable it to raise funds over 25 months through the issuance of shares, debt, or other securities.
The latest filing follows Luxxfolio’s move in July to begin disclosing its Litecoin purchases, with a strategic advisor confirming earlier this month that the company is targeting a total of 1 million LTC by 2026.
Litecoin creator Charlie Lee, meanwhile, joined its advisory board in late June.
Luxxfolio, like others jumping on the crypto treasury trend, is positioning its strategy around reserves and infrastructure, despite its financials being in poor shape, marked by mounting losses and limited liquidity for its stock.
Key signs of strain include no revenue, a net loss of approximately $197,000 for the second quarter, compared with a net loss of $8,000 in the same period a year earlier, and nine-month losses that more than doubled year-over-year, according to its latest quarterly financials.
The company closed Q2 this year with just $112,000 in cash and relied on a $844,000 private placement to stay afloat, with nearly $19 million in total losses since its inception in 2017.
Its management had warned of “significant doubt” about its ability to continue operating without fresh capital. Decrypt has reached out to Luxxfolio for comment.

Don’t just sit on it
Observers argue that a Litecoin-focused digital asset treasury can draw institutional attention if it goes beyond passive accumulation.
Such a model could “absolutely attract institutional capital if it’s paired with usable infrastructure,” Mehow Pospieszalski, CEO of wallet infrastructure platform American Fortress, told Decrypt.
Citing how inflows on the Litecoin ecosystem top over $100 million, Pospieszalski said that institutions “don’t deploy that kind of capital into a ghost chain,” instead, “they’re looking for scalable rails, compliance pathways, and user adoption.”",4d86f97c563a7afed6ad04051f744cab,trafilatura

The analyst noted that the recent FDA approval of Dawnzera for hereditary angioedema is a positive step for the company. The key advantage of the drug is its long dosing interval, which is expected to help the company gain market share despite tough competition. However, regardless of this positive development, the analyst remains cautious on the stock due to the pricing of the drug. Fye noted that the price is much higher than initially expected, which raises doubts about how quickly the patients would switch to this treatment.
The analyst also highlighted that although the warning labels for the drug are in line with expectations, the market reaction is still uncertain. The FDA approved Dawnzera on August 21, and the stock has fallen around 3.28% since then.

(NYSE:PBI) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently shed light on. Cramer discussed how the company, and subsequently the stock, turned around after Kurt Wolf stepped in.
“Alright, what do we make of this incredible rebound in this stock of Pitney Bowes? It’s up nearly 71% year to date. Now, a lot of people still see this company as a play on mail, meaning old-fashioned snail mail, because their core business used to be mail meters and equipment that helped off send postage. As you might imagine, the stock spent decades in the doghouse; from its peak in 1999 to its lows in April 2020, Pitney Bowes lost, get this, 98% of its value. Even in late 2022, the stock was still trading at just around two bucks and change. Then an activist stepped in, a guy named Kurt Wolf of Hestia Capital. He took his activist campaign public in December of 2022, got himself on the board of directors after a proxy fight in the spring of 2023. Over the past couple years with the activist on the board, Pitney Bowes has divested money-losing lines of business, reduced its debt, repurchased shares, and this company has now repeatedly raised its dividend. This past spring, Wolf took the next step, taking over CEO of Pitney Bowes and vowing to conduct ‘a comprehensive strategic review’ for the remainder of the year, and look, it’s already paying off. Since Wolf got involved in this, stock’s up more than 400%.”

The move will consolidate assets and investor commitments, with Hut 8, an energy infrastructure firm with a strong crypto presence, holding an 80% stake in American Bitcoin. After the merger, the company will operate under the American Bitcoin name and trade under the ticker ABTC.
A Selected Group of Companies is Backing The Initiative
American Bitcoin is primarily supported by Donald Trump’s eldest sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., as well as significant participation from Hut 8 Mining Corp. The Trump sons and Hut 8 are expected to control a combined 98% of the newly formed company following the merger.
Notable anchor investors also include Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, co-founders of the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini.Rather than a traditional IPO, American Bitcoin chose to merge directly with Gryphon Digital Mining in an all-stock transaction. This approach provides streamlined access to financing and leverages Gryphon’s existing infrastructure and resources, such as its status as a public company.
The merger is expected to be finalized in the third quarter, with trading to begin as early as September, according to Reuters, pending regulatory approval. As a result, American Bitcoin will absorb Gryphon’s existing business and branding while maintaining its own management and board structure.
The merger between the companies looks very positive for Gryphon Digital Mining investors, with a 23% increase in their shares in 5 days, according to Yahoo! Finance.
The merger and subsequent public listing mark an expansion of American Bitcoin’s ambitions, including potential investments and acquisitions in Asia to boost its global footprint.
The timing aligns with renewed policy support for the cryptocurrency sector’s growth during President Trump’s administration, as the company seeks to attract institutional and private investors who are currently restricted from purchasing Nasdaq-listed shares in specific markets.

Since exiting our position in Salesforce in December, the stock price has declined by over 30% despite continuing to report fundamental results that are in line with our expectations.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the best long-term stocks to invest in according to Warren Buffett. On August 22, Apple began early discussions with Google to potentially integrate its Gemini AI into a revamped version of Siri. The move could mark a major upgrade for Apple’s voice assistant as it seeks to catch up in the generative AI race. The goal is to create a more capable foundation for a new Siri, with a potential debut as early as 2026.
Apple is conducting an internal “bake-off” to compare its own AI model, code-named Linwood, with external models, including Google’s Gemini, code-named Glenwood. No final decision has been made on whether to use an external partner or stick with Apple’s in-house model, with a decision expected in the coming weeks. Earlier in the year, the company held discussions with OpenAI and Anthropic to explore using their AI models for this task. However, negotiations stalled due to high fees, prompting the current talks with Google.
Apple’s software engineering chief, Craig Federighi, described the Siri project as a “second-generation” architecture, stating, “This has put us in a position to not just deliver what we announced, but to deliver a much bigger upgrade than that we envisioned,” emphasizing an “end-to-end revamp” for advanced personalization features.

The complaint alleges that Apple’s integration of ChatGPT into the iPhone operating system unfairly favors OpenAI, stifles competition, and limits consumer choice.

Musk’s team argued that Apple’s arrangement makes it impossible for rival chatbots to reach the top of the App Store rankings, thereby curbing innovation in generative AI. The filing also contends that Apple Inc.

KKR has also reportedly engaged with Lazard, Coca-Cola’s adviser in the sale process, but is unlikely to submit a bid. Coca-Cola is still in the initial phase of exploring divestment options for Costa, which it currently owns, as interest from private equity firms begins to surface.

(NYSE:KR) is one of the best long-term stocks to invest in according to Warren Buffett. On August 11, Kroger and C&S Wholesale Grocers reached a confidential settlement, resolving a lawsuit that C&S had filed against Kroger. The lawsuit stemmed from the collapse of Kroger’s proposed $24.6 billion merger with Albertsons. To gain regulatory approval for that merger, Kroger and Albertsons had agreed to sell hundreds of stores and other assets to C&S Wholesale Grocers.

C&S sued Kroger in March, alleging that it was owed a $125 million termination fee. The lawsuit argued that Kroger’s inability to finalize the merger prevented C&S from acquiring nearly 600 supermarkets, private-label brands, and other assets, which were part of the divestiture plan. However, Kroger responded that C&S was not entitled to the termination fee. In a separate legal battle, Kroger had also filed a lawsuit against Albertsons, claiming that Albertsons and C&S had “secretly coordinated” and undermined the merger deal.
A joint court filing in the Delaware Superior Court confirmed that all claims have been resolved. The case was dismissed with prejudice, which means C&S is barred from bringing the same claims against Kroger in the same court.
The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is one of the largest grocery retailers in the United States.

Investors cap off a volatile week dominated by Federal Reserve drama and Nvidia earnings with Friday's release of a key inflation measure that could influence the Fed's September policy meeting.
Expectations are for the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index - the Fed's preferred measure of inflation - to have stayed steady at 0.3% on a monthly basis, putting the annual rate at 2.9%.
However, there is the risk the data may reveal more evidence of U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs filtering into consumer prices, following a recent upside surprise in producer inflation.
Still, markets have pretty much priced in a 25-basis-point cut from the Fed in September, though what happens after that remains uncertain.
Fed Governor Christopher Waller said on Thursday he wants to start cutting rates next month and ""fully expects"" more rate cuts to follow to bring the Fed's policy rate closer to a neutral setting, stepping up his call to lower short-term borrowing costs.
Bets of imminent Fed cuts left the dollar set for a monthly fall on Friday, with worries about the central bank's independence also weighing on the currency as Trump steps up his campaign to exert more influence over monetary policy.
Fed Governor Lisa Cook filed a lawsuit on Thursday claiming Trump has no power to remove her from office, after he took the unprecedented step on August 25 of announcing he would fire her.
Ahead of the release of the PCE figures, preliminary French and German inflation data are also due later in the day.
European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers were divided on whether inflation was more likely to come in higher or lower than expected when they met in July, ECB accounts showed on Thursday, in a foretaste of a debate set to come to a head in the coming months.
The ECB in July kept rates steady and it will probably do so again next month before discussions about further cuts likely resume in the autumn, especially if European economies weaken under U.S. tariffs, sources have told Reuters.
Key developments that could influence markets on Friday:
- U.S. PCE price index (July)
- German preliminary CPI (August)
- France preliminary CPI (August)

A company spokesperson stated that Visa will now focus its open-banking strategy in high-potential markets like Europe and Latin America.

Visa cited persistent regulatory uncertainties concerning consumer data rights and the likelihood of elevated fees associated with customer information as the reasons for the decision. The unit enabled third parties, including fintech firms, to access banking data and streamline processes for sign-ups and fund transfers.
The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) had issued a final rule on “Personal Financial Data Rights” that gave Americans the right to share their financial data with third-party providers. However, under the new administration, the CFPB moved to have this rule rescinded and has begun a new process to revise the open-banking regulations. The new rulemaking process is seeking comments on issues such as fees, data security, and data privacy.
Visa will now prioritize high-potential markets like Europe and Latin America, where regulations already require banks to share data with authorized third parties. The decision marks a change from the company’s earlier strategy, which included a $5.3 billion bid for Plaid (ultimately blocked in 2021) and later acquisition of Tink in Sweden for $2 billion to bolster open-banking capabilities.

The proposed 21Shares SEI ETF would offer investors exposure to SEI while providing the potential for additional yield through staking rewards, according to a registration statement filed Thursday.
Following successful launches of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in 2024, fund managers are targeting smaller digital assets, including Solana, Dogecoin, XRP, and other altcoins under a crypto-friendly Trump administration.
The Trust's primary objective is ""to seek to track the performance of SEI,"" with a secondary focus on generating ""rewards from staking a portion of the Trust's SEI,"" the filing reads.

It’s ""highly likely that 21Shares’ SEI ETF would be accepted and would be available along with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs,"" Krishnendu Chatterjee, CEO and co-founder of A2ZCryptoInvestment, told Decrypt.
""21Shares SEI ETF is a step towards broader application towards regulated alt investment (including staking benefits),” he added.
Still, 21Shares confirmed it has not yet concluded that staking can be offered under a public trust structure, according to the prospectus.
Canary Capital Seeks SEC Approval for First Sei ETF With Staking
The Trust will use Coinbase Custody Trust Company as its primary custodian for SEI holdings, while Coinbase Inc. will serve as the prime broker for trading activities, according to the filing.
The move adds to Canary Capital’s filing of the first SEI ETF application in May, which also shares similar staking objectives.
Multiple crypto ETF applications are now in play and face SEC decision deadlines in October, with regulators extending review periods for spot XRP funds from several issuers and Solana ETF proposals, among others.
SEC Delays Decision on Solana ETF Filings
Industry experts widely expect a batch of approvals beginning in October based on established listing standards.
“Along with Digital Asset Treasury Companies, ETFs provide exposure to a new asset class for institutions, and it is not an exception but would become a new normal,"" Chatterjee said, noting “XRP, Solana, and AVAX ETFs have high chances of getting approved by year's end, even if not by October.”",b3559f0fb5af155ad020b372a90c9e21,trafilatura

Turnover for the onshore market climbed to a record this month as the benchmark CSI 300 Index (000300.SS) rose for nine of the past 10 weeks. That’s despite words of caution from Chinese state media and moves by some brokerages and fund managers to cool things down.
Most Read from Bloomberg
Bullish investors are expressing confidence that authorities will keep sentiment supported before the Sept. 3 military parade, which is set to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. China has a history of propping up its stock market ahead of major political events to project an image of stability. Bears, meanwhile, are pointing to overstretched technical indicators and high margin-financing levels.
“Animal spirits have burst out in China’s market, with traders piling into everything from chips to Labubu,” said Hebe Chen, an analyst at Vantage Markets in Melbourne. “The upcoming parade is fanning the frenzy, acting as a psychological safety net much like Chinese New Year or National Day, when authorities are expected to keep skies — and sentiment — clear.”
The relentless surge has also divided opinion among Wall Street strategists. Those at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised their CSI 300 target to flag a potential upside of about 10% over 12 months. They cited supportive valuations and favorable market positioning. A team at Morgan Stanley pointed to early signs of overheating, cautioning improving corporate fundamentals and stronger policy support are needed to sustain the rally.
“Normally, when we see divergent views we’re approaching a top. I think we may see a bit more market euphoria driven by a positive sentiment, but I don’t think it’s warranted in the longer term,” said Nick Twidale, chief analyst at ATFX Global Markets. “Investor appetite is still relatively strong but it could now turn swiftly and with it the market.”
Still mired in deflation and trade tensions, the stock boom this month that has added $1.3 trillion in onshore market’s value has caught many by surprise and spurred questions on the durability of the rally. Analysts have attributed the gains to rotation out of bonds in a low-yield environment onshore and enthusiasm around the chip sector inspired by DeepSeek’s new model.",4c72391fecb9ea611a0e7e797825b558,trafilatura

(Reuters) -Resurgent European bank shares, up over 40% this year, face testing times with sentiment already being challenged by renewed French uncertainty.
Still, investors may find it hard to ignore the pull of Europe's best performing sector of the year so far. An investor who bought into European banks five years ago is sitting on a net return of around 300%, versus 70% for the broader market, LSEG data shows.
Here's a look behind the rally and what's next.
1. EARNINGS' BOUNCE MAY NOT LAST
Strong earnings, bolstered by relatively higher interest rates in the past few years - before recent cuts - and brighter growth prospects have driven the rally, with a majority of banks outperforming earnings estimates.
Morningstar senior equity analyst Johann Scholtz argues that alongside falling rates, future earnings are likely to be flat-to-lower with tariffs potentially lifting companies' bad-loan provisions, which RBC says have been stable until now.
""We definitely expect corporate defaults to increase as a result of tariffs,"" said Scholtz.
Morgan Stanley analysts said Q2 earnings supported a view that net interest income (NII), the difference between earnings on loans and investments and what banks pay on deposits, has bottomed sooner than expected and notes growth should resume in 2026.
2. NO MORE RATE CUTS
Even if earnings momentum ebbs, banks should draw support as European Central Bank rate cuts near an end while the negative-rates era appears firmly in the past.
""People really underestimated the damage that zero and negative interest rates, that we had for a decade, did to European banks,"" said Morningstar's Scholtz.
A recent European Parliament study found that European banks are especially sensitive to rates compared to U.S. peers, with NII making up 60% of net operating income.
While rates have fallen from a peak of 4%, they are not expected to drop much below 2% as an EU-U.S. tariff deal eases economic uncertainty.
""We're almost in a sweet spot where banks are able to finally benefit from these deposit franchises that they have, but at the same time, you're not seeing that stress on the credit side,"" said MFS Investment portfolio manager Shanti Das Wermes.
3. WINNERS, LOSERS
A sign of confidence in banks' prospects of generating more shareholder value is a rise in the price-to-book ratio for the average lender in the STOXX Europe 600 Banks index, comparing a lender's market value with the value of its assets. It's risen to 1.12, after years of trading below one.",edb98e424ad9051a5df5021999dd4edb,trafilatura

As market dynamics indicate a continued low-volatility regime in the near term, 10x Research highlights the ""short strangle"" as an ideal play.
""Given the current dynamics in the bitcoin options market, a short strangle looks well-suited for the next month. With bitcoin trading around $113,000 and an expected range between $95,000 and $125,000, selling an out-of-the-money [September expiry] put near $95,000 alongside an out-of-the-money [September expiry] call near $125,000 provides an opportunity to capture premium,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a report to clients Thursday.
Short strangle involves a simultaneous writing (selling) of out-of-the-money higher strike calls and OTM lower strike puts with the same expiry, positioned equidistant from the underlying asset's spot price.
The strategy is similar to selling insurance against both bullish and bearish moves in exchange for a premium, which represents the maximum profit achievable if the spot price remains between the two strike prices - $95,000 and $125,000 in this case.
Selling options (or strangles) is a common strategy when implied volatility (IV) exceeds realized volatility, as this allows traders to capture richer premiums, and the market is expected to remain relatively stable.
""The strategy works because the implied volatility curve is trading above realized levels, signaling options are overpriced, and the market is unlikely to deliver large moves outside your defined range in the short run,"" Thielen noted. ""The options implied volatility term structure indicates near-term calm.""
The implied volatility (IV) term structure is a graphical representation showing how volatility is expected to evolve across different future time horizons. It is typically upward sloping, reflecting increasing uncertainty and risk as the time to expiration lengthens.
Risk-reward profile
BTC needs to continue trading between $95,000 and $125,000 for the suggested strategy to generate profits. The rangebound trading will reduce the demand for OTM calls and puts, thereby draining premium from these options and generating a profit for strangle sellers.
Thielen’s previous recommendation from early August was also a short strangle, involving a $105,000 put and a $130,000 call. This strategy generated a yield of 3.5%.
Note, however, that short strangles carry significant risks, particularly in the event of a sudden spike in volatility, which can lead to substantial losses. Therefore, traders must continuously monitor the position and relevant market variables to manage risk effectively.

At least, that's the conclusion you'd probably reach if you compared their investment portfolios. The variety in the stocks preferred by highly wealthy investors is striking.
However, that doesn't mean there aren't any common denominators in their portfolios. Several of the world's richest investors are fans of some of the same stocks. Here are three stocks billionaires are buying right now.
1. Amazon
Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) ranks as one of the most popular stocks with billionaires. Chase Coleman bought 4.1 million more shares of the e-commerce and cloud services giant in the second quarter of 2025, boosting his Tiger Global Management hedge fund's stake by 62%. David Tepper increased his Appaloosa hedge fund's position in Amazon by nearly 8%.
The biggest move with this stock in the billionaire community, though, came from Pershing Square's Bill Ackman. He initiated a new position in Amazon that was valued at roughly $1.28 billion at the end of Q2.
Importantly, Amazon's shares were down significantly during part of the second quarter. It's a pretty safe bet that these wealthy investors wanted to take advantage of an opportunity to buy the stock of a great company at a discount.
That's definitely the case with Ackman. Pershing Square's chief investment officer, Ryan Israel, confirmed in a May conference call that Amazon had been on the hedge fund's radar for a long time but that the team was waiting for the price to become attractive enough to buy. Israel highlighted Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and noted that the Trump administration's tariffs shouldn't significantly impact Amazon's e-commerce business.
2. Alphabet
Ackman also increased Pershing Square's stake in Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) in Q2. His hedge fund already owned both of Google's share classes. While Pershing Square didn't buy any additional class C shares, it scooped up another 925,000 class A shares -- enough to boost its holding by roughly 21%.
Coleman was less enthusiastic but still upped Tiger Global's position in Alphabet class A shares by more than 3% in Q2. Billionaire Israel ""Izzy"" Englander was more interested in Alphabet class C shares last quarter, increasing his Millennium Management hedge fund's stake by almost 32%.
Like Amazon, Alphabet's stock fell sharply early in Q2. Ackman, Coleman, and Englander almost certainly liked the opportunity this sell-off presented to buy one of the top AI leaders. However, Tepper went in the opposite direction, slashing Appaloosa's stake in Google's parent company by around 25% in Q2.
3. UnitedHealth Group
Although Tepper seemed less bullish about Alphabet, the story was quite different with UnitedHealth Group(NYSE: UNH). He increased Appaloosa's position in the health insurance stock by a whopping 1,300% in Q2. UnitedHealth Group is now his second-largest holding.
The bigger news, though, was that Warren Buffett initiated a big stake in UnitedHealth Group last quarter for Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio. Buffett has been a net seller of stocks for 11 consecutive quarters. However, he saw enough to like about UnitedHealth to buy more than 5 million shares.
It's reasonable to conclude that Buffett and Tepper viewed UnitedHealth Group's steep plunge this year as overdone. The company has faced several challenges that weighed on its share price, including higher-than-expected Medicare Advantage plan costs and a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation.
Are these stocks good picks for other investors?
Several billionaires like Amazon, Alphabet, and UnitedHealth Group, but are these stocks good picks for investors who aren't quite so wealthy? Yes, yes, and yes.
Amazon should have tremendous growth opportunities with AWS, especially, thanks to a strong AI tailwind. AI demand will also help Alphabet's Google Cloud unit. Both Amazon and Alphabet also have plenty of other growth drivers.
UnitedHealth Group seems likely to return to growth next year as higher health insurance premiums take effect. Granted, it's too early to know how the DOJ investigation will unfold. However, the company has successfully navigated government probes in the past and could do so again.

Key Takeaways:
-
Luxxfolio filed to raise up to $73 million as it deepens its Litecoin treasury strategy.
-
The company aims to acquire 1 million LTC by 2026, with Charlie Lee now on its advisory board.
-
Despite ambitions, Luxxfolio faces mounting losses and warned of survival risks without new funding.
The filing, submitted Thursday with Canadian regulators (excluding Québec), will allow Luxxfolio to issue a mix of securities, including shares, debt, and warrants, over a 25-month window.
Luxxfolio CEO Says Capital Raise Will Boost Flexibility and Litecoin Expansion
CEO Tomek Antoniak said the move gives the company “financial flexibility” to scale operations and accelerate Litecoin adoption.
“In our sector, scale is critical — the larger our treasury, infrastructure, and ecosystem footprint, the greater our ability to capture market share,” Antoniak said in the company’s announcement.
The fundraising plan comes just months after Luxxfolio became the first publicly traded company to formally anchor its corporate treasury in Litecoin.
The firm began disclosing its Litecoin purchases in July and has outlined an ambitious goal of acquiring 1 million LTC by 2026.
Litecoin creator Charlie Lee joined the company’s advisory board in June, further cementing its alignment with the 12-year-old blockchain network.
Despite its strategic pivot, Luxxfolio’s financials show signs of strain. In its most recent quarterly report, the company posted a Q2 net loss of $197,000, up from just $8,000 a year earlier.
Over the nine-month period ending that quarter, losses more than doubled year-over-year.
With only $112,000 in cash on hand as of the quarter’s end, the company relied on an $844,000 private placement to remain operational.
Since its founding in 2017, Luxxfolio has accumulated nearly $19 million in total losses. Its management has already flagged “significant doubt” about the company’s ability to continue without securing new capital.
The shelf prospectus, once finalized, is intended to give the company room to raise capital quickly as market conditions shift, and as it attempts to grow its Litecoin infrastructure footprint despite mounting financial pressure.

Three decades later, Carville’s remarks still ring true.
Rising bond yields have a unique ability to exert power over politicians. Just think of Liz Truss’s mini-Budget crisis and the sackings, about-turns and resignations that followed a surge in borrowing costs.
Yet one world leader so far seems immune to the bond market’s menace: Donald Trump.
US 10-year Treasury yields have risen from 3.8pc to 4.2pc over the past 12 months, yet the president so far shows no sign of curbing his ambitions.
It is part of a broader assault on the central bank’s independence as Trump seeks to bend the Fed to his will.
The issue is “definitely gaining investor traction”, according to James Bilson, a fixed-income strategist at FTSE 100 fund manager Schroders.
“We are seeing markets begin to price in moves in the direction of institutional weakening – the politicisation of the Fed.”
Bond yields fell at the end of last week after Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, hinted rate cuts were on the way.
But yields have gyrated this week as Trump has escalated his feud with Cook, who has refused to go and has launched a legal challenge to the president’s dismissal letter.
Investors fear that political capture of the Fed, once Powell’s term of office expires next May, will allow Trump to push down interest rates at the expense of tackling inflationary forces.
Ultimately, that will force higher interest rates further down the line to address the problem.
“If Trump succeeds, we will get higher expected inflation, which may sound abstract, but it translates into higher interest rates on car loans, mortgages, student loans, business loans, and certainly Uncle Sam will pay more,” former IMF chief economist Ken Rogoff told the BBC this week.
He warned the world faced an “incredibly destabilising” period if Trump succeeded in watering down Fed independence.
David Roberts, head of fixed income at Nedgroup Investments, says investors are “extremely worried [about the] politicisation of the Fed”.
“Too cheap money will stoke future inflation,” he adds.
In her lawsuit challenging Trump, Cook’s lawyers argued that the president’s power grab at the Fed could do “irreparable harm” to the central bank in the pursuit of “short-term political interests”.
The gap between two-year and 30-year US bond yields – the difference in borrowing costs for shorter and longer-term debt – has now reached its widest since January 2022.
The rate on 30-year bonds is closing in on 5pc, even as the two-year slides to 3.6pc, close to its lowest level since 2022.
It is a sign of just how concerned investors are about the longer-term inflation threat and the eroding of the Fed’s independence.
Rising long-term borrowing costs carry a political risk for Trump. American mortgage rates are usually tied to longer-dated bonds as householders tend to borrow over longer terms than in the UK or elsewhere.
Higher 10-year and 30-year Treasury yields – the return the government promises to pay a buyer of its debt – would therefore hit “Main Street” America rather quickly, harming many Maga voters in the process.
“We think the bond market holds the real leverage,” says Lale Akoner, global market analyst at eToro.
“If investors lose confidence that the Fed will defend price stability, or if fiscal deficits balloon despite tariffs, the bond market can punish Washington with higher yields.”
For now, US 10-year and 30-year Treasury yields both remain well below the highs hit in April, in the wake of Trump’s liberation day tariffs.
While longer-dated bond yields are moving higher, they are doing so in an “orderly” way, according to Bilson.
Robert Dishner, a portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman, says traders have been comforted by a recent report by the Congressional Budget Office that said the president’s tariffs had already brought in $136bn and would reduce the US primary deficit, excluding interest payment, by $3.3 trillion over the next decade.
“The market currently appears to be a bit less fearful of the fiscal [situation] in the US as tariffs have added to government revenues and haven’t necessarily seen big impacts on growth or inflation,” he says.
“They are more focused on places like the UK with the autumn Budget coming up as well as the potential for electoral change in France.”
Jason Borbora-Sheen, a portfolio manager at FTSE 250-listed fund manager Ninety One, says: “There’s decent revenue generation coming through from tariffs, there appears to be an acknowledgement of the importance of medium-to-longer dated bond yields.
“I think the Federal Reserve attacks are not good, but there are elements of truth.”
Another reason that bond markets may be relatively calm for now may also be because Trump has shown he is vulnerable to their pressure in the past. When markets went into meltdown in the wake of “liberation day”, the president announced a 90-day pause.
“During that tariff episode he did pivot back from the most severe version of tariffs when that 10-year yield moved,” Borbora-Sheen says.
“The market has figured out that it matters to him.”
While there is relative calm for now, sentiment can turn on a sixpence and attention will now be focused on Cook’s legal case.
“If Cook wins, she stays in place and we achieve some semblance of stability,” Peter Conti-Brown, a professor of financial regulation at the University of Pennsylvania said in a Substack post.
“If she loses ... that’s the end of Fed independence as it has been constructed and reconstructed over 112 years.”
In that case, all hell may break lose – and Trump’s resolve to face down the bond market may be truly put to the test.",1db72655dd65235a04a260ff436b0255,trafilatura

The S&P 500 fell 0.6% a day after climbing to a record high. The benchmark index ended August with a 1.9% gain, its fourth straight month of gains. It’s now up 9.8% so far this year.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average also came off its own record high, slipping 0.2%, while the Nasdaq composite closed 1.2% lower.
“The reason the market is down today is primarily because we are heading into a long weekend, and a lot of traders don’t like to have a hefty exposure over a long weekend because of the news that could come out and take them by surprise,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
Mixed economic data may also have given traders an excuse to sell and pocket some profits following the market’s milestone-setting week. A closely watched measure of inflation showed prices mostly held steady last month, and a survey of consumer sentiment came suggested Americans' worries about the economy and prices intensified since July.
Losses in technology weighed on the market, offsetting gains in health care and other sectors.
Dell Technologies slid 8.9% for the biggest decline among S&P 500 stocks a day after the company reported second-quarter revenue that exceeded analysts' expectations, but noted that margin pressures and weakness in PC revenue.
Among other tech companies that ended the day in the red: Tech giant Nvidia fell 3.3%, Broadcom dropped 3.6% and Oracle slid 5.9%.
The Commerce Department said prices rose 2.6% in July compared with a year ago, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures index. That’s the same annual increase as in June and in line with what economists expected.
Still, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose 2.9% last month from a year earlier, up from 2.8% in June and the highest since February.
While inflation is much lower than the roughly 7% peak it reached three years ago, it is still running noticeably above the Fed’s 2% target.
Still, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled last week that the central bank may cut its key interest rate at its meeting next month, amid signs of sluggishness in the job market.
The most recent government data suggests hiring has slowed sharply since this spring.
“Today’s in-line PCE Price Index will keep the focus on the jobs market,” said Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. “For now, the odds still favor a September cut.”",6b4534336bb3cea36458e6542246e673,trafilatura

The 35-year non-call five structure was offered at a spread of 340 basis points over Japanese government bonds, according to lead underwriter Daiwa Securities Co. The yield is about three times that on 10-year JGBs, according to Bloomberg calculations.
Most Read from Bloomberg
The latest issuance comes as SoftBank and its founder Masayoshi Son push ahead with the $500 billion Stargate artificial intelligence initiative. The program is fueling record funding needs, with SoftBank’s domestic bond sales already at ¥820 billion this fiscal year, the most among Japanese firms. That jumbo supply has pushed up borrowing costs, reflected in the record coupon of its five-year debt.
So-called hybrid bonds are debt securities that have some features similar to equity. SoftBank’s hybrid bonds have an optional interest payment deferral provision and are subordinated to senior debt. The company expects credit rating firms to classify about half of the principal as equity.
The ¥200 billion issuance was SoftBank’s largest for domestic institutional investors. Final demand reached ¥270 billion, Daiwa said. The company initially planned to raise about ¥100 billion, but increased the size to ¥150 billion and ultimately to ¥200 billion.
Supply of subordinated bonds in Japan is “limited” and their “high yields were appealing,” said Rina Suzuki, vice president in debt syndication at Daiwa. SoftBank’s solid earnings and high share price also acted as a “plus” in attracting investors, she added.
“Interest rates are still on an upward trend and amid expectations of further increases, they likely moved to secure funds without delay despite wider spreads,” said Taketoshi Tsuchiya, chief executive officer at Tsuchiya Asset Management Co. He added that taking potential implications for credit ratings into account, “it makes sense to maintain a solid buffer of equity-like funding.”

(Reuters) -French spirits maker Remy Cointreau raised its annual profit forecast on Friday, joining larger rival Pernod Ricard in flagging a lower than feared blow from U.S. tariffs after a 15% rate was agreed on EU imports last month.
Sales have slumped in Remy Cointreau's key U.S. and Chinese markets in recent years, forcing the company into multiple guidance downgrades and to scrap medium-term sales targets. It said in June, though, that the worst was over.
Remy said on Friday it now expects a net 20-million-euro ($23.4 million) hit from U.S. tariffs on its current operating profit for the 2025-2026 fiscal year, down from 35 million euros estimated previously.
An estimated hit from Chinese tariffs of 10 million euros was unchanged and Remy now expects an overall blow from global tariffs of 30 million euros, down from 45 million estimated previously.
As a result, the maker of Remy Martin cognac now expects a mid-single-digit percentage organic decline in 2025-2026 current operating profit, an improvement from the mid-to high-single-digit percentage drop previously anticipated.
In 2024-25, Remy reported a current operating profit of 217 million euros, down 30.5% on an organic basis amid weak U.S. and Chinese sales.
The new forecast ""represents a second upgrade from the company as tariff uncertainty has eased"", brokerage Jefferies said in a note, expecting more optimism once the EU-U.S. trade deal is finalised.
Jefferies said the lower tariff hit would allow Remy to invest in growth initiatives to regain market in the U.S. and China.
At 0820 GMT, Remy shares were down 1.6% at 53.8 euros, after rising strongly on Thursday.
The company makes around 70% of its sales from cognac, mostly in the U.S. and China, leaving it more exposed to tariffs and economic downturns than more diversified rivals.
On Thursday, Pernod Ricard revised its forecast for the annualised impact of U.S. and Chinese tariffs to 80 million euros from 200 million previously.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's factory activity likely contracted for a fifth straight month in August, with manufacturers awaiting more clarity on a trade deal with the U.S. while a wobbly job market and a property crisis curb domestic demand, a Reuters poll showed.
The survey of 21 economists forecast the official purchasing managers' index (PMI) would edge up to 49.5, up from July's 49.3, remaining below the 50-point threshold that separates growth from contraction in activity. The data is due on Sunday.
This trifecta of problems - pressure on China's exports, a property slump squeezing household spending and rising job uncertainty - is just China's headline concerns, economists say. Extreme weather and cash-strapped local authorities are also putting Beijing's ambitious 2025 growth target of ""around 5%"" in jeopardy.
The highest poll reading was 49.5, cited by more than half the respondents, while the Economist Intelligence Unit gave the lowest forecast of 49.0.
""The summer months tend to be the low point in the year, and this year there's additional pressure from extreme weather and production limitation,"" said Xu Tianchen, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit.
""Activity should improve in September and October.""
While July exports beat forecasts, the gain was supported by a low base and driven by a surge in shipments to Southeast Asia, as Chinese exporters scramble to grow market share there amid fears of losing access to the U.S., the world's top consumer market - a push some producers have called a ""mad rat race.""
Earlier this month, the U.S. and China extended their tariff truce for another 90 days, locking in place levies of 30% on Chinese imports and 10% Chinese duties on U.S. goods, but the uncertainty is eroding confidence on both sides of the Pacific.
Profits at China's industrial firms fell for a third straight month in July, official data showed on Wednesday, highlighting how businesses are also struggling with subdued demand and persistent factory-gate deflation at home, keeping the pressure on Beijing to roll out more stimulus.
Policymakers have ramped up consumer subsidies, but a prolonged property slump is still crimping spending, with real estate a key store of household wealth.
Households' reluctance to take out mortgages was reflected in July bank lending data, which unexpectedly contracted for the first time in 20 years.
And consumer spending could take a further hit if a recent ruling by China's top court banning firms and employees from skirting social insurance payments leads to job losses, with many companies and workers already struggling to make ends meet.

That’s up approximately 2 basis points from the prior day’s report, and down approximately 8 basis points from a week ago. Read on to compare average rates for a variety of conventional and government-backed mortgage types and see whether rates have increased or decreased.
Note that Fortune reviewed Optimal Blue’s latest available data on Aug. 28, with the numbers reflecting home loans locked in as of Aug. 27.
What’s happening with mortgage rates in the market?
If it feels as though 30-year mortgage rates have been stuck on the verge of 7% for an extended period, that’s not too far off. Many observers anticipated that rates would soften when the Federal Reserve started reducing the federal funds rate last September, but there was no sustained decrease in mortgage rates. There was a short-lived dip preceding the September Fed meeting, but rates rapidly climbed afterward.
By January 2025 the average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage surpassed 7% for the first time since last May, as indicated by Freddie Mac data. That’s a big jump from the historic average low of 2.65% recorded in January 2021, when the government was still working to stimulate the economy and ward off a pandemic-induced economic downturn.
Absent another major crisis, experts agree we won’t have mortgage rates in the 2% to 3% range in our lifetimes. Nevertheless, rates around the 6% mark are entirely possible if the U.S. manages to tame inflation and lenders feel optimistic about the economic prospects.
In fact, rates had a modest decline at the end of February, dropping nearer to the 6.5% mark than had been seen for some time. There was even a brief point in early April where rates dipped below 6.5%, but they rose immediately afterward.
At present, with uncertainty as to the extent to which President Donald Trump will pursue policies such as tariffs and deportations, some observers worry the labor market could constrict and inflation could resurface. Against this backdrop, U.S. homebuyers face high mortgage rates—although some can still find options for making their purchase more manageable, like negotiating rate buydowns with a builder when purchasing newly constructed property.
How to get the best mortgage rate you can
While economic conditions are beyond your control, your financial profile as an applicant also has a substantial impact on the mortgage rate you’re offered. With that in mind, aim to do the following:
Make sure you have excellent credit. The minimum credit score for a conventional mortgage is generally 620 (for FHA loans, you may qualify with a score of 580 or a score as low as 500 with a 10% down payment). However, if you’re hoping to get a low rate that could potentially save you five or even six figures in interest over the life of your loan, you’ll want a score considerably higher. For instance, lender Blue Water Mortgage notes that a score of 740 or higher is considered top tier in the context of home loan applications.
Maintain a low debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. You can calculate your DTI by dividing your monthly debt payments by your gross monthly income, then multiplying by 100. For example, someone with a $3,000 monthly income and $750 in monthly debt payments has a 25% DTI. When applying for a mortgage, it’s typically best to have a DTI of 36% or below, though you may be approved with a DTI as high as 43%.
Get prequalified with multiple lenders. Consider trying a mix of large banks, local credit unions, and online lenders and compare offers. Additionally, connecting with loan officers at several different institutions can help you evaluate what you’re looking for in a lender and which one will best meet your needs. Just ensure that when you’re comparing rates, you’re doing so in a consistent way—if one estimate involves purchasing mortgage discount points and another doesn’t, it’s important to recognize there’s an upfront cost for buying down your rate with points.
Mortgage interest rates historical chart
An important bit of context for the discussion about high mortgage rates is that rates around 7% feel high because of the recent memory of rates between 2% and 3%. Those rates were possible due to unprecedented government action aimed at preventing recession as the country grappled with a global pandemic.
However, under more typical economic conditions, experts agree we’re unlikely to see such exceptionally low interest rates again. Historically, rates in the vicinity of 7% are not unusually high.
Consider this St. Louis Fed (FRED) chart tracking Freddie Mac data on the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage average. From the 1970s through the 1990s, such rates were more or less the norm, with a significant spike in the early 1980s. In fact, September, October, and November of 1981 all saw mortgage interest rates exceeding 18%.
Nevertheless, this historical perspective offers little consolation to homeowners who may want to move but are locked in with a once-in-a-lifetime low interest rate. Such situations are common enough in the current market that low pandemic-era rates keeping homeowners from moving when they otherwise would have become known as the “golden handcuffs.”
Factors that impact mortgage interest rates
The U.S. economy may well be the single largest driver of mortgage rates. When lenders fear inflation, they can raise rates to protect their long-term profits.
Plus, the national debt is another significant factor. When the government has to borrow large sums to cover what it spends, that can drive interest rates higher.
Demand for home loans is key too. If few people are borrowing, lenders might lower rates to attract business. But if loans are in high demand, they might raise rates to cover their costs.
In addition, the Federal Reserve’s actions play a role. The Fed can sway rates for mortgages and other financial products by changing the federal funds rate and by managing its balance sheet.
The federal funds rate gets a lot of media attention. When it changes, mortgage rates often follow suit. But remember, the Fed doesn’t set mortgage rates directly, and they don’t always move in perfect sync with the fed funds rate.
Perhaps even more importantly, the Fed influences rates through its balance sheet. In tough times, it can buy assets like mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to boost the economy.
But recently, the Fed has been shrinking its balance sheet, choosing not to replace assets as they mature. This tends to push interest rates up. So while everyone focuses on cuts or hikes to the fed funds rate, what the central bank does with its balance sheet might be even more important for your mortgage rate.
Why it’s important to compare mortgage rates
Comparing rates on different types of loans and shopping around with various lenders are both essential steps in obtaining the best mortgage for your situation.
If your credit is excellent, opting for a conventional mortgage might be the ideal choice for you. However, if your score is below 600, an FHA loan may give you an opportunity that a conventional loan would not.
When it comes to exploring options with different banks, credit unions, and online lenders, it can make a significant difference in your overall costs. Freddie Mac research indicates that in a market with high interest rates, homebuyers may be able to save $600 to $1,200 annually if they apply with multiple mortgage lenders.",9cb71514b77e4f0d69213ada2cd2d16a,trafilatura

(Reuters) -Shares of Marvell Technology slumped nearly 18% on Friday, as the chipmaker's data center demand outlook fell short of lofty expectations owing to irregular sales of its custom AI chips to cloud giants.
Investor expectations for chipmakers are elevated after their valuations have sky-rocketed due to Wall Street's picks-and-shovels AI trade, but market bellwether Nvidia's latest earnings cast doubt over demand from cloud providers.
Marvell CEO Matt Murphy said on a post-earnings call on Thursday that data center revenue in the third quarter would be sequentially flat, worrying investors and analysts about growth in its key segment that reflects demand for hardware used in AI data centers.
The networking chipmaker's revenue is increasingly driven by its custom chip business which services cloud providers such as Amazon.com and Microsoft who are developing in-house capabilities to reduce their dependence on Nvidia.
A recent media report said Microsoft had delayed its in-house AI chip rollout to 2028 or later.
Some analysts said the concerns were overblown.
Morningstar analyst William Kerwin said the delay could benefit Marvell by increasing Microsoft's reliance on it.
""Overall, the most important debate on Marvell stock today is uncertainty in its ability to retain its custom chip business, across both AWS and Microsoft. We are more bullish on this front.""
Murphy said ""lumpiness"" was normal when large cloud providers build infrastructure, referring to Marvell's exposure to uneven product development schedules and spending.
Summit Insights analyst Kinngai Chan, who has a ""hold"" rating on the stock, said, ""Marvell lacks scale relative to larger peers and expects hyperscale customers to pursue a multi-vendor sourcing strategy, which could weigh on margins.""
Marvell competes against larger rival Broadcom for a piece of cloud providers' custom chip and networking businesses. Broadcom is yet to report July quarter results.
Marvell is set to lose close to $12 billion in market value if losses hold. It has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 24.24, compared with Broadcom's 39.03, according to data compiled by LSEG.
But Marvell expects its custom business to be stronger in the fourth quarter, Murphy said, implying an uptick later in the year as custom chip orders increase again.

The Institute of Public Policy Research, a Blairite think tank, said Ms Reeves could rake in £8bn a year by introducing a new tax on reserves held at the Bank of England (BoE) by the likes of Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and Natwest.
Such a tax would inspired by Thatcher’s 1981 deposit tax on banks, which took a cut of windfall profits made by lenders, the IPPR said.
In addition, Chancellor could recoup a further £12bn by pushing the BoE to stop selling bonds at a loss under its controversial quantitative tightening (QT) scheme.
In total, the Left-leaning think tank said the £20bn annual haul would be a vital boost to the public purse. By some estimates, the Chancellor needs to raise as much as £50bn to get the finances back on track.
Carsten Jung, from the IPPR, said the BoE money printing scheme used to buy £895bn of bonds – known as quantitative easing (QE) – was “bungled” at the taxpayers’ expense.
That is because the BoE pays the base rate of interest to high street banks on the reserves they hold at the central bank. Those reserves ballooned in the past 15 years because of QE.
Cashflows from the Bank of England to commercial banks were of little consequence when the base rate was as low as 0.1pc in the pandemic. But when the base rate shot up to 5.25pc, it became a major financial burden on the public sector.
On top of that, the Bank is selling bonds under QT for less than it paid to buy them under QE, making a loss.
It means a scheme which initially made a profit for the Bank - which was passed on to the Treasury - is now forecast to make a loss of more than £130bn, to be covered by the Government.
Mr Jung said: “What started as a programme to boost the economy is now a massive drain on taxpayer money. Public money is flowing straight into commercial banks’ coffers because of a flawed policy design.
“While families struggle with rising costs, the government is effectively writing multi-billion-pound cheques to bank shareholders.
“This is not how QE was meant to work – and no other major economy does it this way.”
The IPPR is highly influential in Labour circles. Carys Roberts, formerly the think tank’s executive director, is now a special adviser to Sir Keir Starmer.
A raid on bank reserves held at the BoE has united Left and Right. Last year Reform UK called for the Bank to cease paying interest on reserves, arguing it could save as much as £35bn.
Andrew Bailey has disputed this estimate, arguing the move would not be that lucrative.",42e7b53762f318d34a521cafe3dab6ed,trafilatura

PRAGUE (Reuters) -Czech-based firearms maker Colt CZ Group SE has agreed to buy a majority stake and potentially all of the shares in Synthesia Nitrocellulose, in a deal valuing the Czech gunpowder ingredient maker at 22 billion crowns ($1.05 billion).
Colt, which also has operations in the United States, Canada, Sweden, Switzerland and Hungary, said on Friday the deal with privately-owned chemicals group Synthesia would help to secure its supply chain and expansion into larger calibres, which are in high demand amid Europe's rearmament drive.
Energetic nitrocellulose is a raw material needed for ammunition production, especially for gunpowder. Colt does not produce it itself at this point but may aim to step into the business in future, the company said.
""The acquisition ... fits into our strategy of expanding the group's activities into medium and large-calibre ammunition while strengthening our position in a critical element of our supply chain,"" Colt Chairman Jan Drahota said in a statement.
""We intend to continue the vertical integration of ammunition manufacturing, thereby contributing to the strategic independence and self-sufficiency of the Czech Republic and NATO countries in defence supplies.""
Synthesia Nitrocellulose is among the top three energetic nitrocellulose producers in Europe and North America, with a 6,000 metric ton capacity and an expansion to 7,000 tons underway, Colt said.
The transaction gives Synthesia Nitrocellulose an enterprise value of 22 billion crowns, or about 8.2 times expected 2025 core profit, Colt said.
In the first stage, Colt will take a 51% stake in a cash-and-shares deal, pending regulatory approvals expected by the end of the first quarter of 2026, it said.
The initial cash payment will be 5.5 billion crowns, with stock accounting for about 40% of the first stage of the deal. This will make Synthesia owner Kaprain the third largest shareholder in Colt with between 5% and 10%, Colt said.
Colt and Kaprain have options to buy and sell the remaining 49% stake, respectively.
Colt said it may issue bonds in the fourth quarter to help finance the deal, which also includes Synthesia's power production business.
Colt shares were up 0.14% at 1000 GMT, against a 0.4% drop in the Prague PX index.

Futu Holdings is expanding its footprint in Hong Kong with the opening of its first flagship store and inaugural Institutional and Private Wealth Services centre in Causeway Bay, underscoring the online brokerage's ambition to capture the city's growing base of high-net-worth clients.
The new centre, occupying two floors with a combined area of more than 7,000 sq ft (650 square metres) on Russell Street opposite Times Square, officially opens on Friday . It marks Futu's eighth permanent service point in the city and the first to combine online trading services with offline, personalised advisory service for affluent clients.
""Hong Kong will remain a core market for us, and we see strong demand from clients for more personalised support alongside our online services,"" said Daniel Tse, managing director of Futu Securities, during a media preview on Wednesday. ""This flagship store allows us to bring that experience offline and create a dedicated space for wealth management.""
Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.
To qualify to use the advisory centre's service, clients need to hold at least HK$5 million (US$640,000) in investable assets, according to Futu's website. That is less than the US$3 million typically required by traditional private banks, according to the company.

Russell Street is in one of Hong Kong's main shopping districts. Shops along the 250-metre thoroughfare had to pay US$2,671 per square foot on average in annual rent as recently as 2018. That made it the world's costliest retail strip at that time, surpassing the Champs-Elysees boulevard in Paris, Omotesando in Tokyo and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, according to Cushman & Wakefield.
Futu could be paying HK$1.2 million per month for its bricks-and-mortar branch, according to agents' estimates. Futu declined to comment.

The online broker's lavish physical branch serves what Futu called the need of so-called ""new wealth"" clients who seek professional, face-to-face advice on complex asset allocation needs.
Executives noted that high-net-worth investors are showing greater interest in fixed-income products such as bonds and structured funds, particularly against the backdrop of elevated US dollar interest rates. At the same time, equities in Hong Kong and the US remain their most actively traded products, while some are also looking at alternatives including hedge funds, quantitative strategies and gold-linked products.
Leveraging its technology platform, Futu said it aimed to provide a differentiated service that integrates digital trading, AI-powered research and global asset allocation. Its private wealth clients can access products ranging from high-end mutual funds, private equity and structured products to virtual assets and family trusts.
The company has also adopted a ""1+N"" service model, with a dedicated client manager backed by a team of specialists in various fields.

The strategy has paid off. In the first quarter of 2025, net asset inflows surged 170 per cent from last year, while assets under management jumped 74 per cent and client numbers nearly doubled in the second quarter, Futu said.
""High-net-worth clients increasingly want both flexibility and depth in services,"" said Kevin Fu, executive director of Futu Institutional and Private Wealth Services. ""By combining dedicated managers with a team of specialists, we can better address those needs and strengthen long-term relationships.""
Hong Kong's stock market has rebounded, as the Hang Seng Index jumped 25 per cent this year, the best among major global benchmarks. Brokers expect the rally to extend into next year as China's economic outlook stabilises, while more than 200 companies line up for initial public offerings in the city.
Futu's Russell Street store will not replace its branch on Lee Garden Road, spitting distance away in Causeway Bay, which will continue to serve retail clients. Tse said the company could add more outlets in Hong Kong or other markets if demand warranted, but stressed that new locations would be guided by client needs rather than sheer scale.",bcf48e4f6dab3077d16f780634c3c017,trafilatura

As the current U.S. president ran for office, he made it very clear to U.S. voters and the world that they should expect higher tariffs. And that's exactly what his administration has offered up in dramatic fashion. Some on Wall Street worry that the tariffs could turn the bull market into a bear. Here's how a long-term investor should be thinking about this issue.
The tariffs are coming! The tariffs are coming!
To simplify what is a fairly complex issue, a tariff is a tax imposed on imported goods. The Trump administration has been using tariffs in an aggressive attempt to reshape global trade. This will have an impact on the economy and the stock market, but what that might be is hard to define today. Simply put, so many things are up in the air right now that nobody knows where the chips are going to fall.
That said, one concern is that higher tariffs will eventually be passed through to consumers. That would increase inflation, crimp consumption, and lead to lower earnings for corporate America. The flip side of that argument is that companies have increased prices so much in recent years that they can't easily push higher costs onto consumers, and, thus, companies are likely to absorb the tariff hit. That would mean lower profit margins. Even here, however, Wall Street could still end up in the dumps as companies earn less and investors react to that negative news.
It seems like nothing good can come of this whole tariff thing. Except that, so far, the market hasn't really paid much attention. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) is up more than 10% so far in 2025. Yes, there was a brief market correction early in the year, but the S&P 500 index, which is what the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF tracks, seems to have shrugged that off, as it is again trading near all-time highs.
Don't get too caught up in the short term
Here's the big takeaway from the tariff kerfuffle: It is shockingly hard to predict performance on Wall Street. Some people get market turns right once, but very few have been able to time the ups and downs with any consistency. For most investors, trying to jump in and out of the market -- a practice known as market timing -- is a mistake.
It is far better to buy and hold for the long term, perhaps including an exchange-traded fund (ETF) like Vanguard S&P 500 ETF in the mix. Indeed, focusing on a well-diversified portfolio is key, as it will help to soften the impact of the market's gyrations over time. Which brings the story back to the potential for a bear market. Simply put, there will be one.
That's not a prediction; it is just a statement of fact. Eventually, for some reason, investors will go from being bullish to being bearish. That's just what market history tells us is the norm on Wall Street. Why it happens will be the topic of debate, and eventually, some common cause will be determined. Maybe it will be tariffs. It could also be geopolitical tensions, which are very high today. Or maybe artificial intelligence (AI) won't turn out to be as profitable as investors expect, and that will lead the market lower, given that AI enthusiasm has helped lead the market higher.
Something will eventually give way, and there will be a bear market. Then, after some period of time, a bull market will arrive. It's just how the market works. You should spend more of your time thinking about ways to save money and how to invest wisely. Investing wisely means taking into consideration the ever-present risk of a bear market.
Keep it simple and think long term
Far too often, investors get caught up in short-term market movements. The big picture is more important, including the sometimes erratic upward march of stocks over the long term. Sticking to an investment plan is hard, but it is likely to result in better long-term performance than trying to jump in and out of the market. Which is why a simple portfolio consisting of an S&P 500 index fund and a broadly diversified bond fund or ETF -- say, in a 60% stock/40% bond breakdown -- could be all you need.
Bonds help provide safety during market turmoil, and stocks provide growth over the long term. That combination will allow you to ride out bear markets without letting your emotions lead you into making investment mistakes (like selling everything you own and never investing again). Another option is just to buy a balanced mutual fund that does all the investing work for you. That leaves you to focus on saving money, which is where you will likely have the biggest impact on your long-term wealth, anyway.
If you do choose to buy individual stocks, which can be a lot of fun, don't focus on the short term. Or to put it another way, think in decades, not days. When you do that, a bear market will probably end up looking like just a small hiccup. And it won't really matter to you what precipitated the bear, anyway, because you will be too busy. You see, long-term investors often find their best investments during deep market declines.

Silver Bonds, sold to people aged 60 and above, were designed to support Hong Kong's ageing population by offering them a stable source of inflation-adjusted income to cope with rising living costs and uncertain financial market returns. They are more appealing than 12-month bank deposits because they pay higher interest, said Christopher Hui, the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, during a press conference on Friday.

Most Read from Bloomberg
The calendar turns next week to what has historically been the weakest month for US stocks, as institutional investors rebalance, retail traders slow their buying, volatility picks up and corporate buying goes dark.
While macro events are generally more determinant for the market’s direction, seasonal factors can exacerbate moves triggered by the likes of economic data or monetary policy. Next month, investors will have to grapple with the latest government hiring report and two readings on inflation before the Federal Reserve makes its highly anticipated policy decision. In the background is President Donald Trump’s continued criticism of the central bank’s independence as he clamors for sharp rate cuts.
Bulls roll into September in a particularly precarious position, given the S&P 500’s 17% surge since early May. Valuations have hit 22 times projected earnings, levels associated with the end days of the dot-com bubble. Computer-driven traders, whose strategies ignore fundamentals to focus on trends, are near maximum allocation to US stocks. And hedge fund equity exposure hit the 80th percentile in recent days, leaving positioning extended, according to Barclays (BCS) strategists including Emmanuel Cau.
“We’re in a very dangerous spot,” said Brandon Yarckin, chief operating officer of Universa Investments. “It’s a difficult thing to navigate this market by owning diversifiers like bonds or hedge funds instead of being fully invested in stocks.”
The S&P 500 (^GSPC) has fallen 56% of the time in September, by an average 1.17%, according to Bank of America Corp.’s Paul Ciana, who cited data going back to 1927. In the first year of a president’s term, the S&P 500 is down 58% of Septembers by an average of 1.62%.
Selling pressure is likely to arise from pension funds and mutual funds, as they rebalance portfolios at the end of the quarter. The largest exchanged-traded fund that tracks the S&P 500 has gained almost 5% since the end of June, while a broad bond ETF has lost nearly 2%. That equity outperformance could force selling as the month wears on.
Mutual funds, likewise, could begin rebalancing ahead of their fiscal year-end, selling laggards, or simply locking in gains, said David Cohne, mutual fund analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Larger funds tend unwind positions slowly so as to not roil the market, moves that could start next month, he said.",8716c852ec2a29710e37bee6991ca7af,trafilatura

Cuban Says Mavericks Sale Was Mishandled Despite No Regrets About Letting Go
Speaking on the DLSS Mavs podcast on Tuesday, Cuban reflected on both his long relationship with franchise legend Dirk Nowitzki and the fallout from last November's sale of the team to the Adelson family. Cuban, who still owns 27% of the Mavericks, said his biggest mistake was not opening the sale to competitive bidding.
""I don't regret selling the team. I regret how I did it,"" Cuban said. ""Would I still sell the team? Yes. Would I do it the same way? Absolutely not.""

Mark Cuban Claims NBA Removed His Control Clause In Mavericks Contract
Cuban added that he expected to stay deeply involved in basketball operations but said the league intervened.
""There was a clause in there that gave me the right to be in every meeting, every trade discussion, everything. And the NBA took that out,"" he claimed.
""I've got the letter from my lawyer saying the NBA made us remove it,"" Cuban said when the host noted that the league disputes his assertion.
NBA did not immediately respond to Benzinga’s request for comments.

Mark Cuban Revealed Mavericks Sale Regrets And Massive Ownership Losses
In late 2023, Cuban sold his majority stake in the Dallas Mavericks for $3.5 billion, ending a 23-year run as majority owner. Despite the massive sale, Cuban later revealed that he lost hundreds of millions of dollars during his ownership, making money only twice over two decades.
In March 2024, Cuban reflected on his fiery, hands-on approach, recalling moments when he confronted players for lack of effort.
He also admitted frustration over the sale terms, which left him without control of basketball operations after expecting otherwise. The Adelson family, who purchased the team, appointed Nico Harrison to take over.
Cuban defended his tenure by highlighting his efforts to keep ticket prices among the lowest in professional and college basketball, emphasizing that he always prioritized fans even while facing financial losses.
NBA Says Cuban Role Was Always Up To Patrick Dumont, Not The League
When Cuban decided to sell the Dallas Mavericks nearly two years ago, it stunned much of the NBA world. Known as one of the league's most outspoken and passionate owners, Cuban's exit caught even commissioner Adam Silver off guard, according to CBS Sports.
Silver later revealed that Cuban had first notified him in October 2022, about a year before the deal was finalized.
Since the sale in November 2023, the Mavericks have seen both dramatic highs and crushing lows — from an appearance in the 2024 NBA Finals to the stunning February trade that sent Luka Doncic away, a move Cuban insists would never have happened under his leadership.
Silver has publicly stated that Cuban's future role in basketball operations was always tied to his private arrangement with Patrick Dumont, who now oversees team decisions. According to Silver, the agreement brought before the board of governors made it clear that Dumont, not Cuban, would be in charge.
Cuban, however, maintains he has documentation proving he was supposed to retain control of basketball operations and claims the NBA forced the removal of that specific clause.

From April to June, Huawei regained top spot in the domestic smartphone market for the first time in four years, shipping 12.5 million units to capture 18 per cent market share in the period. However, its shipments were down 3.4 per cent compared with the same period in the previous year, according to market research firm IDC.
China's smartphone market saw overall shipments drop 4 per cent to 69 million units during that period, the first contraction after six consecutive quarters of growth, IDC data showed.
The weak market momentum was partly due to the impact of ""roll-out disruptions in the government subsidy programme"" for electronic devices, as well as a challenging economic environment and subdued consumer confidence, said IDC senior analyst Arthur Guo.
""This suggests that a significant uplift in smartphone demand is unlikely in the immediate term, and the market will navigate a more complex landscape in the second half of the year,"" he said.
In addition to smartphones, Huawei has invested heavily in artificial intelligence development amid US sanctions, including its self-made operating system HarmonyOS, the Pangu AI models, and computing resources powered by its own Ascend AI chips.
On Wednesday, Tao Jingwen, president of Huawei's quality, business process and information technology management department, said the firm had already ""built an ecosystem entirely independent of the United States"".",a3107ba227dacf98700d62ae4fd11073,trafilatura

DPP, developed by AWS and VW Group, is integral to the automaker's efforts to refine manufacturing processes across its global production network.
By integrating AI into its operations, VW Group aims to improve production, cost efficiency, and the speed at which new vehicle models are brought to market.
DPP is currently operational in 43 VW Group locations throughout North and South America, as well as Europe.
The platform functions as a digital link that ensures a smooth data exchange across the entire process chain, including order intake, logistics, and manufacturing. It also allows for the standardised rollout of new IT systems across VW Groups factories.
AWS's cloud services play a vital role in hosting VW Group’s critical production systems, reducing the risk of halting production lines.
The group has over 1,200 AI applications for software development and enhancing quality control.
VW said, with AWS's Amazon SageMaker, it can train AI models and create industrial computer vision applications that have led to quality control and cost savings.
The DPP also sets the stage for the introduction of software-defined vehicles (SDVs), where software largely manages and updates vehicle functionalities.
This platform is expected to be key in enabling the deployment of software directly during the manufacturing process.
VW’s joint venture with Rivian Automotive is influencing the development of new electronics architecture and vehicle software.
The AI solutions, such as KI4UPS and their corresponding data models, will be adaptable to this future electronics architecture, allowing VW to leverage rapid development cycles in its production environment.
AWS Industries vice president Kathrin Renz said: ""Our five-year extended collaboration combines AWS's cloud infrastructure and purpose-built IoT and machine learning services with Volkswagen's manufacturing expertise.
“Together, we're fast-tracking AI solutions that will help unlock new levels of innovation throughout Volkswagen Group’s manufacturing operations.""

That sharpened focus by Tencent stems from how its overseas cloud operations have been expanding ""the fastest among all [its business] segments"", with ""high double-digit growth over the past few years"", said senior executive vice-president Dowson Tong Tao-sang, who serves as CEO of the Shenzhen-based firm's Cloud and Smart Industries Group (CSIG), in an interview with the Post on Thursday.
AI was a major driver for that growth, according to Tong. ""There's a lot of opportunity"" to bring Chinese open-source AI models to overseas clients, he added.
Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.
""Many of these AI-powered apps are growing very fast, so we definitely have very aggressive growth targets and we have been on track.""
Targeting AI opportunities beyond China reflected Tencent's efforts to keep pace with rapid developments in the field, where competition has intensified among innovative start-ups like DeepSeek and internet peers Alibaba Group Holding, Baidu and ByteDance. Alibaba owns the Post.
""[In] some of the markets we're looking at, they want to host large language models within their own region,"" Tong said. ""We have a lot of tools to help them leverage open-source models, based on our expertise and experience in implementing products around AI.""

Tencent, which runs the world's largest video gaming business by revenue and operates the Chinese super appWeChat, was the mainland's third-biggest AI public cloud services provider in 2024 when the market reached 19.6 billion yuan (US$2.7 billion), according to research firm IDC. Alibaba Cloud and Baidu led the market last year.
Outside China, the Asia-Pacific region was Tencent Cloud's ""fastest-growing market"" where the company intends to increase its investments, according to Tong. He said the company was seeing ""very good progress"" in the European market.
The Chinese tech giant's cloud business was initially launched to serve internet services providers, including video gaming companies and video platform operators. Tong said Tencent Cloud has expanded its reach to cover more industries including finance, retail and Web3.
Earlier this year, Tencent made sweeping changes to its AI product portfolio. It incorporated several apps - including QQ Browser, keyboard tool Sogou Pinyin and learning assistant Ima - into the CSIG from their previous home at the firm's Platform & Content Group.
The restructuring came about because ""we see pretty much all applications can be redone with AI, or enhanced by AI or create new versions with AI being an integral part of it"", Tong said.
""Because CSIG has now taken the responsibility of running some tool-based products, some of the products that moved to my group are geared towards productivity - tools that many consumers have been using for a while,"" he said. ""So we will continue to find user pain points and use AI to make many of these products easier to use.""

Outside China, Tencent Cloud will compete with global leaders - including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google - which collectively hold more than half of the world's cloud infrastructure services market.
""I don't think some of these offer consumer-facing AI products, except Google,"" Tong said. ""I do not believe we're looking at any competitive situation on the consumer side.""
Tencent is among Chinese tech giants that have significantly increased its AI spending, including snapping up advanced chips for AI training. Tong said Tencent ""works with global vendors as well as domestic vendors very closely"", and that the company has ""sufficient resources"" to meet the ""large appetite for computing power"".
Tencent's second-quarter earnings beat analysts' forecasts, as AI delivered a boost to its financial results. The company's revenue jumped 15 per cent year on year to 184.5 billion yuan, while net profit rose 16 per cent to 56 billion yuan.
The company was able to grow its sales and profitability because ""we invested in and also benefited from utilising AI"", the company said in its earnings release on Wednesday.
Revenue from Tencent's fintech and business services operations, which include its cloud business, rose 10 per cent year on year, according to the company.
Tencent's Hong Kong-listed shares closed 0.83 per cent lower to HK$594 on Thursday. Its stock has risen more than 40 per cent this year.",002281f5681cedf5259ccca529f7e672,trafilatura

On August 21, 2025, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) faced both geopolitical headwinds and new growth possibilities.
In Beijing, regulators, including the CAC, NDRC, and MIIT, tried to prevent Chinese tech companies from purchasing Nvidia’s H20 chips, prompted by recent remarks by US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The restrictions hampered demand, despite early interest, which forced NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to restart H20 production lines.

Shares of the chip designer shot up 89% during this period, and that solid rally seems justified in light of the company's improving growth profile owing to its dominant position in the market for custom AI chips.
The company is set to release its fiscal 2025 third-quarter results on Sept. 4, and it won't be surprising to see the stock get a nice shot in the arm once it releases its report. Let's look at the reasons why it may be a good idea to buy Broadcom stock before its upcoming results.
Broadcom can beat Wall Street's expectations once again
Broadcom's earnings per share exceeded consensus estimates in each of the past four quarters. Investors can expect the company to deliver a market-beating performance once again, thanks to a couple of reasons.
First, tech giants are expected to spend more money on AI infrastructure than previously estimated. As pointed out by Yahoo! Finance, AI spending by big tech companies -- Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms -- is expected to hit $364 billion in 2025, up by $39 billion from the original estimate.
The new estimate points toward an increase of 63% in AI spending this year by the big tech giants, up from the 59% increase witnessed last year. This stronger spending bodes well for Broadcom, especially considering that big tech companies are focusing on developing more in-house chips for their data centers.
This brings us to the second reason why Broadcom could deliver another quarter of better-than-expected results. Big tech companies are increasingly investing in custom AI processors for their data centers to reduce operational costs. This was the reason why investment bank UBS recently suggested that Broadcom is on track to exceed expectations when it releases its results and also raised its price target to $345 from $290.
According to UBS, Broadcom could get a boost from the stronger-than-expected production ramp of Google's custom AI processors. The investment bank is expecting the demand for Google's latest TPU (tensor processing unit) to jump by over 50% in 2025, and that could fuel a 60% increase in Broadcom's AI revenue this year.
Broadcom is already designing custom AI processors for Google, Meta, and ByteDance. Even better, the company is engaged with another four hyperscale customers for designing their custom AI processors. Reports indicate that these four customers could be xAI, OpenAI, Arm Holdings, and Apple.
So, the chances of Broadcom delivering better-than-expected results once again are quite solid thanks to stronger demand from current customers, as well as the potential ramp from new customers.
Another big reason to buy the stock
Analysts expect Broadcom to end the current fiscal year with almost $63 billion in revenue, which would be a 22% increase from the year-ago period. The company is on track to record AI-specific revenue of $13.6 billion in the first three quarters of the fiscal year, which translates into an annual run rate of just over $18 billion.
Looking ahead, Broadcom estimates its potential revenue opportunity from its first three custom AI chip customers to land between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027. That opportunity could be much bigger when we take into account the new customers that the company is expected to bring on board.
As such, Broadcom seems to be on track to continue outperforming the market's expectations over the next three years since its AI business alone could be enough for it to crush Wall Street's revenue estimates in fiscal 2027.
Importantly, Broadcom's 70% share of the custom chip market means that it is in a terrific position to capitalize on the huge end-market opportunity. All this makes Broadcom a top AI stock to buy and hold for the long run and doing that before its upcoming earnings report could be a smart move, since it could soar higher after Sept. 4.

The agreement includes two primary components. The first revises the articles of association and shareholder agreement for the joint venture (JV) company, ORLEN Synthos Green Energy (OSGE).
This component grants both parties a 50% equity stake each in the JV and ensures ORLEN's control over strategic decisions.
The second component is a licensing agreement that provides OSGE with full access to the BWRX-300 reactor technology, enabling the project to progress towards construction.
The revised agreements also confirm Włocławek as the chosen site for Poland's inaugural BWRX-300 reactor.
The BWRX-300 reactor technology, developed by GE Vernova in the US, is recognised as the most sophisticated SMR design globally.
ORLEN management board president Ireneusz Fąfara said: “Poland will host the first BWRX-300 small modular reactor in Europe. We are building the energy system of tomorrow.
“This reflects the essence of decision by the ORLEN Group Supervisory Board, which approved the agreement. We spent over a year negotiating terms that safeguard ORLEN’s interests, securing for our joint venture with Synthos direct access to US SMR technology that will enable the project’s delivery.”
Leadership roles within ORLEN Synthos Green Energy will be alternated, with ORLEN appointing the initial chair of the supervisory board and Synthos Green Energy nominating the first president of the management board. Subsequent appointments will rotate every three years.
A steering committee has also been introduced to oversee the agreement's execution and manage operational aspects concerning OSGE and the special-purpose vehicles for future reactor projects.
In line with ORLEN's strategy, 'The Energy of Tomorrow Starts Today', the company aims to launch at least two SMR units with a combined capacity of 0.6GW by 2035.
In June, the ORLEN Group secured 1.7bn zoltys ($460m) in grants from the National Recovery Plan (NRP) for its Green H2 and Hydrogen Eagle hydrogen projects.
These initiatives will enhance renewable hydrogen production and low-emission hydrogen from municipal waste, with the support of Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego and funding through the NRP.

Following a series of impressive upgrades, Reddit, Inc. (NYSE:RDDT) is garnering new momentum on Wall Street.

July also showed ongoing net additions in the United States and international markets.
Despite challenges from Google, analysts attributed steady user growth to new publisher agreements and marketing techniques. On August 18, momentum increased even more when Argus Research began covering Reddit, Inc.

The company's Shanghai-listed stock nearly doubled in the last month on a wider rally fuelled by China's favourable policy support of local artificial intelligence chips and a new AI model from DeepSeek tailored for upcoming domestic chips.
""[Our] stock price risks deviating from current fundamentals, and investors participating in trading might face substantial risks,"" the company said in a filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Thursday.

Cambricon also reminded investors that it was subject to US export restrictions that made it vulnerable to supply chain risks.

""The company and some of its subsidiaries have been placed on the Entity List (of the US Commerce Department), and this will pose risks to the stability of the company's supply chain and may adversely affect its operating performance,"" it said.
The warning came after its shares overtook liquor distiller Kweichow Maotai as the costliest stock in China, prompting the country's retail investors to hail it as ""the new king"" in the onshore stock market.
The stock closed at 1,587.91 yuan (US$221.96) on Thursday, overtaking Kweichow Moutai's closing price of 1446.1.
The company said its full-year revenue in 2025 was expected to fall into the range between 5 billion and 7 billion yuan. On Tuesday, Cambricon reported that revenue in the first six months surged 4,348 per cent year on year to 2.88 billion yuan.
Separately, Cambricon said it had no plans to release any new products.
The company noted that its shares were trading at a 12-month trailing price-to-earnings ratio of over 5,000 compared to the industry average of about 90.
The company's shares fell 5.3 per cent in the Friday morning session after the warning.
Beijing this week unveiled the latest in a series of strategies to bolster AI development and encourage its application across traditional industries, with a focus on progress in domestically made chips. The policy support follows DeepSeek's release of a new AI model that it said employed a new scale factor designed for the ""next generation of domestic chips to be released soon"".",5a5cb18db54cc3dfecdc2391de87377f,trafilatura

Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders advanced 78 per cent to 43.1 billion yuan (US$6 billion) in the period, up from 24.3 billion yuan a year earlier, primarily due to ""mark-to-market changes from our equity investments and gains from the disposal of the local consumer service business of Trendyol"", the Hangzhou-based company said. That was better than the 30.2 billion yuan expected by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Total revenue rose 2 per cent to 247.7 billion yuan in the three months ended June 30, compared with the Bloomberg consensus estimate of 253.17 billion yuan. That marked the 12th consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth for the company.

Alibaba's New York-listed shares gained more than 8 per cent in pre-market trading after the release of its latest financial results. The company's Hong Kong-listed shares slipped 0.1 per cent to HK$115.70 on Friday, ahead of the earnings release.
""This quarter, our strategic focus on consumption and AI + Cloud delivered strong growth,"" said Eddie Wu Yongming, CEO of Alibaba, which also owns the South China Morning Post.
Wu said synergies from consumer platform resources led to new highs in order volumes and numbers of monthly active users, while he attributed the growth in the cloud computing business to ""robust AI demand"".
At Friday's earnings call, Wu said Alibaba's priority is growing the number of users of its cloud business and expanding into new use cases. ""Our goal is to maintain a growth rate above the average market growth rate, while also increasing our market share,"" he added.

Alibaba's cloud computing unit posted a 26 per cent year-on-year increase in revenue to 33.4 billion yuan, higher than the 18 per cent growth in the March quarter.
The unit, which drives the company's artificial intelligence efforts with US$52 billion in capital spending pledged earlier this year, outpaced the international e-commerce unit Alibaba International Digital Commerce (AIDC) Group to become the fastest-growing business for the tech giant.
""This momentum was primarily driven by public cloud revenue growth, including the increasing adoption of AI-related products,"" the company said, adding that revenue from AI-related products maintained triple-digit year-on-year growth for the eighth consecutive quarter.
Alibaba has emerged as one of China's major AI developers - along with start-ups DeepSeek and Moonshot AI, among others - as it doubles down on the open-source approach by making its AI models available for third-party developers to use, modify and distribute.
Alibaba was also unfazed by uncertainties around the supply of AI chips, according to Wu.
""Based on changes in policies around AI chips and supply, we have backup plans in place to work with different partners and respond to different situations with regards to the supply chain,"" he said.
Its Qwen series was now ""the world's largest open-source model family"", Alibaba chairman Joe Tsai and CEO Wu noted in June. As of April, the company had open-sourced more than 200 Qwen models, generating more than 300 million global downloads and over 100,000 derivative models.

On the e-commerce side, the company's online marketplace Taobao has been engaged in a months-long price war with on-demand delivery giant Meituan and long-standing online shopping rival JD.com to grab market share. China's market regulator has called their price war ""irrational competition"".
Alibaba's adjusted Ebita (earnings before interest, taxes and amortisation) - an alternative measure of a company's financial health - fell 14 per cent to 38.8 billion yuan in the quarter, missing analysts' estimate of 43.25 billion yuan. That was partly due to Alibaba's investment in Taobao Instant Commerce, which competes in the on-demand delivery segment.
Still, that outlay appeared to boost the user base of its main domestic marketplace. The instant commerce operation contributed to a 25 per cent increase in monthly active consumers on the Taobao app in the first three weeks of August.
""Since the launch of instant commerce four months ago, growth - in order volume, user scale, merchant supplies and delivery capacity - has exceeded expectations, particularly since July,"" said Jiang Fan, head of Alibaba's E-commerce Business Group, on the earnings call.
Quarterly revenue from Alibaba's ""quick commerce"" business rose 12 per cent year on year to 14.8 billion yuan, boosted by the instant delivery service launched at the end of April. Operations of Taobao Shangou, Alibaba's instant commerce unit, reached a peak of 120 million daily orders, with average daily orders of 80 million in August. Monthly active users climbed to 300 million, more than triple the level in April, while daily active couriers rose to 2 million.
Given the high-frequency usage pattern of quick commerce, Jiang said it had become a key driver of user scale and engagement on the Taobao app. Overall, Alibaba expects the instant commerce and quick commerce operations to add about 1 trillion yuan in annualised incremental gross merchandise volume within the next three years.
Alibaba China E-commerce group, the company's domestic online retail business, saw revenue rise 10 per cent from a year ago to 140 billion yuan.
The company had been consolidating its sprawling e-commerce empire since late last year, as it sought greater synergies across different business units amid slowing online retail growth.
AIDC, meanwhile, continued its growth momentum from the past few quarters, as it posted 19 per cent revenue growth to 34.7 billion yuan in the quarter.",a3e51d3da84bb4432b4fafb349d00676,trafilatura

The company’s revenue declined to A$528m, compared to A$841m in the previous fiscal year.
Underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) loss for FY25 was A$43m, while underlying free cash flow was A$49m, a stark contrast to the A$713m reported in FY24.
The FY25 results indicate the challenges in the market, particularly due to tough pricing conditions in both the nickel and lithium sectors, the company stated.
IGO's investment in Tianqi Lithium Energy Australia was notably affected, with a reported share of net loss amounting to A$642m due to various factors including the full impairment of Kwinana refinery assets and lower spodumene prices at Greenbushes.
Despite these setbacks, the Greenbushes operation itself maintained strong margins, achieving a full year EBITDA margin of 66%.
The Kwinana refinery, partially owned by IGO, faced a challenging year with an EBITDA loss of A$210m, although lithium hydroxide production increased compared to the prior year.
IGO's nickel business also saw a decline, with revenue falling to A$512m, compared to A$823m in FY24, and underlying EBITDA dropping to A$59m.
IGO also recognised A$115m in non-cash impairments against its exploration assets following a strategic review and new business model implementation to enhance target prioritisation and value delivery.
As of 30 June 2025, IGO's cash and cash equivalents stood at A$280m, a decrease from the previous year's A$468m, influenced by an A$197m dividend payout to shareholders.
IGO managing director and CEO Ivan Vella said: “IGO’s FY25 financial results are disappointing. Both challenging market conditions and asset impairments, as a result of a disciplined portfolio review, impacted our headline results.
“Some of these were difficult decisions; however, our underlying business remains solid and we have a clear strategy for value and growth we are delivering on. The improvement in safety throughout the year has also been a key achievement and sets a positive foundation for FY26.”
Additionally, IGO has revised its revolving credit facilities along with a refreshed capital guideline, reducing the size of the revolving credit facilities to A$300m and extending the maturity date to 31 July 2028.
The company has also set a new liquidity threshold of A$500m for shareholder return targets, maintaining a return range of 20–40% of underlying free cash flow, with potential for higher returns when liquidity exceeds the threshold.",d41bba930cb2cb21dc81ce43409feed6,trafilatura

Specifically, the writer recalls a demonstration hosted by Mastercard and a Norwegian bank in London as long ago as 2014, to highlight what was dubbed the world’s first biometric contactless payment card. Since then, it has become a regular feature of our annual new year forecasts feature for payments experts to aver that biometric cards would be the next big thing in payments technology. So, the concept is not novel. In the UK, NatWest claimed a country first with the launch of its first biometric fingerprint card in 2019.
RBI discusses with Tolgahan Yildiz, VP of Trusted Mobile Connectivity and Transactions, Infineon, why previous pilots have not led to full rollouts.
Yildiz:
Several issuers launched pilot projects to a handful of customers since 2019, but the projects were hindered by three major challenges.
First, enrolment was complicated for users and expensive for banks. Users either had to enrol at a bank branch, or use an expensive ‘sleeve’ device at home. This resulted in an unattractive, inconvenient user experience.
Second, banks were deterred from launching pilot projects because of prohibitively expensive card production, complex implementation, limited support, and time to market was unacceptably long. As such, it was hard to truly gauge cardholder enthusiasm for using the cards.
Third, customers were still uneasy using biometrics. Many cardholders misunderstood how their biometric data would be used, not realising the data is only stored and processed on the card; it is not even accessible to their bank.
These challenges combined to deter both banks and their customers from pursuing biometric cards – at least until the manufacturing process and user experience could be improved.
RBI: So, what’s changed, in your opinion, to make the biometric offer more appealing today?
Yildiz:
What’s changed is the investment that’s been made in innovation and support, as well as numerous emerging use cases – beyond contactless payments – that are looking very exciting.
To begin with, the challenges I outlined earlier have been overcome, resulting in a more affordable premium cardholder offer.
Issuers today can offer customers easy, inexpensive enrolment, which now takes place either on the user’s smartphone or in their favourite stores. There’s no expensive hardware and no need to visit a bank branch.
This expands the biometric card market to branchless neobanks and fintechs – who are always looking for innovative ways to market their brand – enabling them to offer an enrolment experience befitting their digital-first status.
Card manufacturing itself is also a critical innovation, as it has enabled turnkey solutions and scalabilities. What this means is that production is now compatible with existing manufacturing equipment, with only minor adaptations. This keeps costs down, enabling a high production yield, as well as cost-efficient and frictionless onboarding.
Card solutions today comply with dedicated Mastercard and VISA specifications and comprehensive guidance and support is available. This enables a go-to-market process that is quick and simple.
And finally, we can start getting excited by emerging, value-add use cases that biometric cards could unlock. These will take potential applications far beyond just payment, helping banks play a central role in the new world of digital identities.
RBI: How are biometric cards unlocking the next wave of use cases?
Yildiz:
Biometric cards enable banks to manage their own customer experience, rather than losing control of the user journey to mobile platforms owned by OEMs. By putting fingerprint cards into customers’ hands, banks can showcase their own branded payment solution, enabling trusted experiences both digitally and in-store.
For example, biometric cardholders can ‘Tap to Verify’; tapping their card on a POS device, using their fingerprint to confirm their identity and signify that they are the legitimate cardholder. They can also ‘Tap to Authorise’, using their biometric card to approve a transaction quickly, conveniently and with an added layer of security.
We’re also in a world of increasingly smart devices, many of which are equipped with NFC (near-field communication) capabilities. Biometric cards could enable cardholders to ‘Tap to Authenticate’, tapping their card to an NFC-enabled device to log in to a secured session, confirming they are the account owner for a bank account or merchant website, for example.
These scenarios will become increasingly widespread as consumers grow more accustomed to using biometrics to authenticate themselves and authorise purchases of goods and services.
At the same time, the rise of increasingly capable AI tools presents new and evolving cybersecurity risks, which is driving more banks to establish secured, convenient and trusted digital interactions with their customers.
Combining biometrics with Secure Elements provides new ways to help mitigate the evolving risks that banks, merchants and cardholders face.
As users struggle with password apathy, delivering fast, convenient and trusted biometric authentication for services and purchases could be a massive game changer in tackling phishing attacks and reducing fraud.
But obviously, that is not all. Banks could also enable biometric cardholders to store and manage digital assets, providing a secured and convenient way to access digital currency accounts. This is an opportunity that is, as yet, largely untapped.
RBI: Will issuers want to invest in biometric cards?
Yildiz:
More than anything, banks trade in trust. It has always been so: we as customers trust that our money will be robustly secured, while remaining easily accessible to us – and only us – as and when we need it.
As artificial intelligence helps cybercrime to grow and scale, consumers will be concerned about security and who to trust with their money. Biometrics aren’t just a cool gimmick, they offer real value by helping worried consumers trust their bank more. Market insights firm Global Data wrote in a 2023 report that “biometrics adoption has the potential to enhance efficiency while shaping the future of privacy and regulation”. In short, they offer an additional layer of convenience and security in today’s digital, global society.
And because the card is something physical the customer holds and uses, it can be a visible symbol of that trust – much like the firm handshake previous generations once shared with their local bank manager.
Today, it’s up to the banks to decide how to stand out in a fiercely competitive financial services market. But it’s important to recognise that physical cards are not disappearing anytime soon. Over 13 billion+ EMV® chip cards are deployed worldwide, offering unprecedented payment reliability, trust, consumer familiarity, and robust, universal security.
Whether you’re an established bank or a newer entrant, this means that the payment card remains – and will for the foreseeable future – the most visible and sustainable way to connect the customer and the brand, with the potential to support secured journeys for new use cases far into the digital age.
We’ve seen many banks launch colourful cards, or metal cards, but at the end of the day this is a marketing tactic rather than a value-add to the customer. What biometric cards do is enable marketers, acquisition/retention managers and CTOs to unite around an innovation that delivers on each of their ambitions: building brand visibility alongside convenient, secured cardholder experiences.
Quite simply, if banks don’t offer a trusted gateway to these experiences, someone else will.

10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›
Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) CEO, Jensen Huang, has transformed his company into the world's largest by identifying trends earlier than anyone else. This is how Nvidia captured a significant portion of the AI computing market, delivering substantial gains to its shareholders.
So, when Jensen Huang calls a company's stock a ""very smart buy,"" investors should listen up.
What company was Huang talking about when he mentioned this? It's none other than a key Nvidia supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM).
Taiwan Semiconductor is a key Nvidia supplier
During a visit to TSMC, Jensen Huang stated:
Well, first of all, I think TSMC is one of the greatest companies in the history of humanity, and anybody who wants to buy TSMC stock is a very smart person.
That's huge praise from the man who leads and founded the world's largest company. But is he right?
Taiwan Semiconductor, widely known as TSMC, is in a strong and unique position in the chip world. It's a semiconductor foundry that produces chips for companies like Nvidia that lack the in-house capabilities to do it themselves. This fosters a strong working relationship, as they each depend on one another. Nvidia isn't the only company that uses TSMC; others, such as AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), do also.
This raises a key point about TSMC: It often produces chips for companies that are competing against each other. AMD and Nvidia are vying for supremacy in AI computing power, and Apple's iPhones are competing against Google's Pixel phones, which have just started using TSMC-made chips. With TSMC remaining neutral and acting only as a supplier to companies battling it out, it's in a position to capitalize on several key trends without needing to develop the winning product.
As long as TSMC can stay on top with the technology it offers, it will maintain its market leadership position.
By the end of the year, TSMC's next chip node, the 2nm (nanometer) chip, will be in production. This chip offers substantially better power consumption (25% to 30% improvement) compared to the 3nm variety when configured at the same speed. While concern grows about the power consumption of AI data centers, this innovation is expected to be a massive hit among tech companies. Additionally, TSMC has 1.6nm and 1.4nm designs in the pipeline, which are expected to offer similar power consumption improvements.",b99e4385d9efa7f563288e6e1754bfe0,trafilatura

This investment will bring CFS closer to achieving its goal of being the first company globally to commercialise fusion energy.
It will help complete its SPARC fusion demonstration machine and advance the development of its first ARC power plant in Virginia.
The latest funding round, which was oversubscribed, is the largest capital raise among deep tech and energy companies since CFS' $1.8bn Series B round in 2021.
CFS now has close to $3bn in funding, approximately one-third of the total capital invested in private fusion companies globally.
Commonwealth Fusion Systems CEO and co-founder Bob Mumgaard said: “Investors recognise that CFS is making fusion power a reality. They see that we are executing and delivering on our objectives.
“This funding recognises CFS' leadership role in developing a new technology that promises to be a reliable source of clean, almost limitless energy – and will enable investors to have the opportunity to capitalise on the birth of a new global industry.”
CFS' investor base has expanded internationally, attracting a diverse group, from fundamental investors to industrial companies.
The round saw participation from a variety of financial entities including banks, hedge funds, pension funds, private equity firms, sovereign wealth funds and venture capitalists.
Notable new investors include Brevan Howard Macro Venture Fund, Counterpoint Global (Morgan Stanley) and Stanley Druckenmiller.
Additionally, a consortium of 12 Japanese companies, led by Mitsui & Co. and Mitsubishi, joined the investment round.
The consortium includes prominent companies such as the Development Bank of Japan, Fujikura, JERA and Kansai Electric Power.
These new stakeholders are joined by existing investors such as Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Google, which have increased their stakes in CFS.
CFS senior vice-president of corporate development Ally Yost said: “CFS offers investors the clearest path to bringing commercial fusion to the world – and an unprecedented opportunity to make a real impact as global demand for power accelerates with electrification and increased use of AI and data centres.
“Along with the promise of energy independence and security, fusion power will help to expand energy access, and with it, improve quality of life.”
CFS’ ARC power plant project, due to be built in Chesterfield County, Virginia, US, is set to be the world's first grid-scale fusion power plant.",6e601f5c7944140fe6b3d3e81939c5a1,trafilatura

Mulino announced that an agreement was reached after meeting Chiquita chairman Carlos Lopez Flores during an official visit to Brazil's capital. He said the deal would help restore jobs, trade, and stability in the sector.
Under the memorandum signed in Brasília, the company will rehire about 3,000 workers initially, with another 2,000 to follow later, the government said. Chiquita aims to resume operations in Panama by February 2026.
""I will always stand on the side of investment, production and decent work for our people,"" Mulino said in a video message on social media. ""What happened, happened. Now is the time to look forward and reorganize the country for the benefit of Panamanian families.""
The US fruit giant halted production in Panama's Bocas del Toro province in April after nearly two months of strikes by banana workers and other unions protesting a pension reform. Chiquita dismissed its entire workforce and shifted its local headquarters to neighbouring Costa Rica.

The trade provision, which allowed small shipments worth $800 or less to be shipped into the country from foreign lands duty free, became a central pillar of the global e-commerce boom. It prompted direct-to-consumer business models to flourish and drop-shipping to become a dominant channel for retail sales.
During the whole of 2024, 1.4 billion packages—nearly 4 million per day—were brought into the United States using the trade rule, first sketched out in Section 321 of the Trade Act of 1930. The country’s forbears and trade officials could never have predicted that the provision, originally intended to ease the duty burden on travelers bringing home souvenirs and gifts, and makers to ship samples tax free, would become what it has: a superhighway for global commerce.
But in the eyes of President Donald Trump, de minimis represented “a big scam”—a means for foreign actors to skirt import duties and ferry huge volumes of cheap and illicit wares into the U.S. market while facing minimal customs scrutiny.
Trump—and the Republicans—weren’t alone in that view. In recent years, as pandemic-driven online spending ratcheted up and marketplaces like Shein and Temu rose to global prominence, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle called for the trade “loophole” to be closed. The Biden administration last fall set in motion executive actions designed to restrict the use of de minimis and rein in its rapidly growing influence.
Some members of American industry, too, called for an end to de minimis. The National Council of Textile Organizations (NCTO), a Washington-based trade group representing the interests of the country’s textile and apparel producers, lobbied against the trade provision for years, appealing to members of the Trump and Biden administrations alike. The group argued that the law undermined the competitiveness of American-made products, which couldn’t compete with the appeal of $12 dresses from Shein—especially when they weren’t subject to the same environmental or consumer safety standards that U.S. makers face.
“For years, companies have used this loophole to avoid tariffs and customs reporting requirements on shipments valued at $800 or less, devastating U.S. manufacturers, undercutting American jobs, and opening the floodgates to unsafe and counterfeit products and goods made with forced labor,” NCTO president and CEO Kim Glas said Thursday. “The administration’s executive action closes this channel and delivers long overdue relief to the U.S. textile industry and its workers, while strengthening America’s economic and national security.”
But John Lash, group vice president of product strategy at supply chain platform e2open, told Sourcing Journal that there will be downsides to the new policy for both shoppers and the supply chain.
“Aside from the postal services temporarily halting small package delivery to America, the two parties most likely to feel the pinch from this latest action are domestic consumers and small foreign businesses,” he said.
“For consumers, higher import costs on favorite goods are one more blow to an already fragile consumer confidence. While ending de minimis is unlikely to be the tipping point, it’s a step closer to a larger and far more significant indirect economic effect from curtailed spending,” he added. “The last time I checked, consumer spending made up just shy of 70 percent of the economy, so any downturn is concerning.”
Brookings Institute economic expert Elena Patel wrote in a memo Thursday that the issue became deeply convoluted as de minimis came into vogue. Consumers have certainly benefited from the unfettered access to a wide assortment of globally sourced products, and some U.S. enterprises have made hay by leveraging the provision—but others have indeed seen their market share erode as they’ve been held to stricter standards and forced to pay higher taxes.
“For low-value packages, exempting duties and documentation can reduce costs for both governments and businesses. But the rule now raises deeper questions about fairness and tax neutrality,” she said. “Two sellers, one domestic and one foreign, can offer the same product but face vastly different tax and regulatory obligations. Domestic retailers must collect and remit sales taxes and comply with consumer protection laws, while foreign sellers often bypass these requirements under de minimis.”
Despite its disproportionate burdens on U.S. business, Patel noted that the “abruptness of this change”—the wholesale axing of de minimis—is “far from ideal, sowing uncertainty for parcel carriers, postal systems, businesses, and consumers while raising questions about how the new rules will be put into practice.”
“The magnitude of this is not only on consumers and e-commerce marketplaces. The entire supply chain will need to recalibrate itself, and that can have significant impact on costs, on delays, as well as priorities, because I would imagine some carriers will opt out of this segment entirely,” echoed Ram Ben Tzion, founder and CEO of Ultra Information Solutions.
Over the course of the past week, a number of international mail carriers have announced their intentions to halt service to the U.S. market due to the moratorium on de minimis. And companies like DHL, FedEx and UPS, too, will face seismic shakeups.
“They have been optimizing capacity for years. They have been hiring space on air cargo and airplanes, which is now far less relevant and necessary to the market demands,” Ben Tzion told Sourcing Journal. “If you cannot stack up a bunch of Temu packages on an airplane, and you need to consolidate them into a container, then there’s going to be a lot of capacity that will need to be redirected or recalculated.”
In the supply chain technology executive’s estimation, carriers are trying to apply pressure on the government by ceasing operations. “They are hoping for an outcry from both business and private consumers that will turn this [decision] way down, reverse it or reduce it,” he believes.
It’s unclear to everyone involved—businesses, logistics providers, even the architects of the policy and those who will carry it out—what exactly the new rules are and how they’ll be implemented. But Ben Tzion believes that’s not just par for the course for this administration, but part of its strategy.
“This is part of the shock therapy that we’ve been seeing on all trade policies—the back and forth with the radical measures that are not necessarily completely thought through. But the momentum and the vector is still there, meaning at the end of this tunnel there’ll be a new reality.”",292eaeaa854ffa4d49f42b9945cdbaf7,trafilatura

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's economy unexpectedly gathered steam in the April-June quarter, defying expectations of slower growth even as a sharp rise in U.S. tariffs on Indian imports threatens to weigh on business activity in coming quarters.
The United States doubled tariffs on Indian goods to as high as 50% on Wednesday over India's continuing imports of Russian oil. That ushered in the most punishing rate among U.S. trading partners alongside Brazil and economists say the move could hurt exports including textiles, leather goods and chemicals.
Gross domestic product expanded 7.8% in the latest quarter in Asia's third-largest economy, the fastest in five quarters, from 7.4% in the previous three-month period, government data showed on Friday.
This was well above the 6.7% expansion economists had forecast in a Reuters poll.
Gross value added (GVA), seen as a more accurate measure of underlying economic activity, grew 7.6% in the three months to June, from 6.8% in the previous quarter. GVA excludes indirect taxes and government subsidy payouts, which tend to be volatile.
At this pace, India remains one of the fastest-growing major economies, despite an increasingly cloudy export outlook after U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff hike.
The ""surprise acceleration"" in GDP growth in the April-June quarter means that ""the economy is still on course to expand by a world-beating 7% this year, despite the upcoming hit from punitive US tariffs"", Capital Economics said in a note.
""Despite the reciprocal penal tariff, we are maintaining our growth range (of 6.3%-6.8%) for full year,"" India's Chief Economic Adviser V. Anantha Nageswaran said at a press conference after the data release.
CONSUMER SPENDING RISES
Private consumer spending, which makes up about 57% of GDP, rose 7.0% year-on-year in April-June, compared with 6% in the previous quarter, as rural spending increased, and demand for durables and farm equipment such as tractors remained firm.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has pledged support for sectors hit by U.S. tariffs and has said it would propose tax cuts to spur domestic demand. It had earlier cut income taxes starting April this year.
""Private consumption is supported by tax relief, rate cuts, crops sowing, though households may defer discretionary purchases until proposed consumption tax cuts take effect in the festive season,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA ratings agency.

One area where many Americans have monitored tariff impact is with automobiles. It’s understandable, as cars are a major purchase for most. One unfortunate side effect of Trump’s auto tariffs is they are driving up the costs of auto insurance.

Check Out: 10 Used Cars That Will Last Longer Than the Average New Vehicle
Inflationary pressures have made auto insurance increasingly expensive for Americans, according to Yahoo Finance. Worse yet, a recent report from Insurify revealed Trump’s tariffs could raise auto insurance rates 280% faster.
Below, we’ll explain just how that might happen, and why tariffs are at the center of expected rising insurance costs.
Tariffs Increase Vehicle Costs
Purchasing a car is often the second most expensive purchase Americans make. Tariffs can increase that already high cost. Trump imposed a 25% on imported cars, but some modifications allow for no stacking of levies, and cars finished in America will qualify for some reimbursements, according to CNBC.
Combined with aluminum and steel tariffs, this will cause auto insurance premiums to increase to $2,759 annually, on average, according to Insurify. This represents a 19% increase from 2024 — or increasing 280% faster. This assumes full coverage on the car in question. If it weren’t for the tariffs, Insurify reported that coverage would increase a mere $122 annually to $2,435, for an increase of 5%.
With new vehicles expected to rise in price by at least $6,000 for cars under $40,000, this makes buying a new car more painful.

Higher Repair Costs
Trump’s tariffs don’t just impact the price you pay for the car; they also impact many of the car parts. Roughly 75% of what goes into making a car comes from international suppliers, according to The White House. Much of what goes into a car is made from steel or aluminum, so neither new nor used cars are immune.
Most of these parts will incur some sort of levy. Americans will see higher repair costs and, in turn, increased auto insurance rates. “As a result of higher part costs, insurers will pay more for repair claims and eventually pass those costs on to consumers through higher insurance premiums,” according to Insurify.
More Expensive Claims

It has indeed a strong pitch, namely the ability to solve the fundamental issues of the complex and outdated payments back-end. And via a comprehensive and flexible suite of services across accounts, payments and FX, its service is tailored to meet the needs of companies with ambitious payment goals.
Mishal Ruparel, Chief Commercial Officer at Banking Circle, discusses the firm’s recent highlights and future plans with GlobalData banking and payments group editor, Douglas Blakey
EPI: Can you summarise the Banking Circle USP? What is the Banking Circle value proposition?
Although many aspects of financial services have seen rapid innovation in recent years, the global payments ecosystem has evolved much more slowly, with back-end infrastructure still largely working with timescales and costs set in the twentieth century. Without fundamental redesign, many businesses will remain stuck in a ‘slow lane’, processing transactions at a pace that no longer matches the speed of other parts of their business or the expectations of their digitally enabled customers. To address this challenge, Banking Circle has built a single global payments platform with interoperability at its core, combining pioneering technology and the established central bank clearing system to offer businesses ultra high-speed access to global, multi-currency instant payment schemes. Together with our customers and partners, we are aiming to overhaul the world’s legacy payments infrastructure – delivering truly instant payments to meet the challenge of today’s ‘real time’ age.
EPI: Historically, Asia Pacific has led the way in payments but there is momentum in Europe thanks to regulatory action. What is Banking Circle’s take on prospects in Europe and why is the company targeting expansion in Europe?
Ruparel:
Europe represents a core market for Banking Circle as we continue to scale our business globally. Like many markets, Europe has been experiencing a sustained increase in cross-border payment activity, with cross-border transaction volumes in the region projected to grow by 58% between 2023 and 2028. This trend is underpinned by robust economic activity between EU member states and strong trading relationships with global markets.
The EU has also built a regulatory environment supportive of Banking Circle’s expansion in Europe. Initiatives like PSD2 have helped to enhance innovation, competition, and security in the payments space, while SEPA has simplified euro-denominated cross-border euro transactions. Upcoming changes to the regulatory landscape, particularly the introduction of PSR and PSD3, are also set to bring about a range of benefits, including further innovation in the space and enhancements to fraud and customer protection measures. Europe’s investment in payment infrastructure – including TIPS, SEPA Instant, and domestic instant schemes like Sweden’s Swish and the UK’s Faster Payments – is also accelerating the region toward full real-time cross-border capabilities.
Despite this progress, many cross-border, multi-currency transactions in Europe remain costly, slow, and opaque. This creates a clear opportunity for companies like Banking Circle to step in with modern, advanced infrastructure that bypasses legacy limitations. Through our next generation platform, we’re helping our clients meet rising demand while improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of international payments.
EPI: What is the significance of Banking Circle securing access to Swiss Interbank Clearing?
Ruparel:
Securing access to the Swiss Interbank Clearing (SIC) system allows Banking Circle to offer clients a fully integrated, real-time connection to domestic payment schemes in Liechtenstein and Switzerland. This latest integration means Banking Circle now provides direct access to local payment schemes and account infrastructure for five of the 12 major currencies across Europe and the UK. This milestone reflects our ongoing ambition to become a super-correspondent bank for global business-to-business payments, removing legacy barriers that have restricted demand for instant payment flows among European businesses while enhancing financial inclusion across the continent.
EPI: And why is the Visa Direct initiative noteworthy?
Ruparel:
Our work with Visa will see Visa Direct gain access to Banking Circle’s extensive local clearing rails around the world, bolstering its global payments reach and joining the over 530 licensed financial institutions that benefit from our offering. Through this collaboration, Visa Direct will leverage Banking Circle’s single API technology to connect to multiple direct clearing systems worldwide — all through one secure, reliable, and scalable provider. This marks a significant milestone in our mission to enhance the speed, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of cross-border payments. Collaborating with a global leader in the payments space like Visa Direct not only strengthens Banking Circle’s capabilities but also underscores the trust placed in our infrastructure and the value of our single API approach. It is a clear demonstration of how Banking Circle is helping international businesses simplify access to global payment networks — delivering reach, reliability, and real-time performance through a single integration.
EPI: It is often said that the adoption of real-time payments demands more than just updating payment rails – it requires full-scale transformation of banking infrastructure. Banks must re-engineer outdated systems and rethink legacy processes in the front-end and back-end. How realistic is that? Do banks get it?
Ruparel:
Legacy systems built around limited operating hours are poorly suited to supporting instant settlements, requiring banks to modernise both front-end and back-end systems, rethink operational workflows, and embrace more flexible, cloud-based architectures. The necessary technology for facilitating this transformation is certainly there, like cloud-native platforms, which can provide the scalability, flexibility, and resilience needed to meet rising transaction volumes and support innovation. Yet, the degree of the transformation varies across institutions, with some pursuing incremental upgrades, while others are undertaking more comprehensive overhauls. Although 76% of European possessed a moderate degree of business and technological readiness to facilitate instant payments, just 7% are positioned as leaders in instant payment adoption. Current market conditions highlight the need for more decisive action if banks are to remain competitive in a real-time, always-on payments landscape.

The US giant is spending $54m at its James Ford Bell Technical Center in Minnesota to add a new pilot plant ""wing"" that will increase space by more than 20%.
The centre in Golden Valley is a “key hub for innovation, technology, and quality capabilities” for the company, which is headquartered in nearby Minneapolis.
Lanette Shaffer Werner, chief innovation, technology and quality officer at General Mills, said: “This expansion is a critical step in ensuring General Mills remains at the forefront of innovation.
“The new wing at our James Ford Bell Technical Center will add much needed flexibility in our pilot plant operations and empower our teams to collaborate more effectively to deliver the next generation of consumer-centric products.”
Originally built in 1960, the facility houses about 1,000 General Mills employees.
The newly expanded area is expected to be operational by the autumn of 2027.
The news comes as the Blue Buffalo pet food brand owner projects nearly flat net sales in fiscal year 2026 amid a “volatile” operating environment.
Speaking to analysts in June, General Mills chairman and CEO Jeff Harmening said: “As we head into fiscal ’26, we expect the operating environment will remain volatile, with consumers pressured by widespread uncertainty from tariffs, global conflicts and changing regulations.”
General Mills projects that its organic net sales will remain within the range of a 1% decline and a 1% increase for the fiscal year 2026.
In its fiscal year 2025, the group reported a 2% decrease in full-year net sales, mirroring the same percentage drop organically to $19.5bn.
The company also anticipates a 10-15% decline in both adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share on a constant-currency basis in fiscal year 2026, compared to the previous year.
General Mills’ investment in its innovation centre also follows the Pillsbury cookie maker’s potential workforce reduction as part of a “global transformation” initiative aimed at enhancing productivity.

(Reuters) -PepsiCo has raised its stake in Celsius Holdings through a $585 million deal, as the global soda and snacks maker strengthens its energy drink business amid shifting consumer preferences.
The popularity of energy drinks has surged among young U.S. consumers seeking low-calorie, vitamin-infused alternatives to traditional sugar-heavy beverages, fueling deals in the sector.
PepsiCo has acquired 5% of Celsius' preferred stock, taking its total stake to about 11% after conversion. It had infused $550 million for an 8.5% stake in 2022.
The company will also nominate a director to serve on Celsius' board.
The deal puts Celsius in charge of the companies' energy-drink portfolio in the U.S., consisting of its Celsius and Alani Nu brands, as well as PepsiCo's Rockstar Energy.
""As PepsiCo's energy captain, Celsius has control over portfolio allocation, planogram design, SKU prioritization, and promotional strategy — giving them greater influence at retail and making them a more formidable competitor in the energy category,"" Jefferies analysts said in a note.
PepsiCo, which owns Mountain Dew, expanded its energy drink business in 2020 with a $3.85 billion acquisition of Rockstar Energy. It will continue to own the Rockstar brand internationally.
The companies will hold a 20% share in the energy drink category through this partnership, according to Celsius' presentation.
The U.S. energy drinks market was valued at $25.01 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow 7.2% annually through 2030, according to data firm Grand View Research.
The deal also helps the companies compete better in the energy drink category, long dominated by players such as Red Bull and Monster Beverage. Rival Coca-Cola owns a 19% stake in Monster Beverage.
Shares of Celsius were up nearly 4% in midday trading on Friday. They have more than doubled in value this year.
ENERGY DEALS
Beverages makers have been pursuing energy and non-soda brand deals, driven by growing interest in fitness and lifestyle products.
""With regard to wellness-focused beverages. Yes, consumers are gravitating there, and the large beverage companies are following them,"" said Joseph Gabelli, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.
PepsiCo said in March it would buy prebiotic soda brand Poppi for nearly $2 billion to boost its ""better for you"" product portfolio.
Last year, Keurig Dr Pepper bought a 60% stake in energy-drink maker Ghost for $990 million to spruce up its refreshment beverages portfolio.",036de4f8cd714659e1af10751782dff3,trafilatura

The financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
In a statement, City Brewing said the transaction “meaningfully strengthens” its financial position by “significantly reducing” its debt, “enhancing liquidity” and supporting the Wisconsin group “for sustainable growth and long-term operational stability”.
In 2021, City Brewing secured an undisclosed investment from Charlesbank Capital Partners. Oaktree Capital Management and Blue Ribbon Partners were also listed as the beverage co-manufacturer’s shareholders at the time.
Ross Sannes, the CEO of City Brewing, said: “With a stronger financial position and clear strategic vision, we are well-positioned to continue serving as the go-to producer in the beverage manufacturing space while pursuing sustainable growth in the years ahead.”
City Brewing offers co-packing for hard seltzers, flavoured malt beverages, beer, spirit-based RTDs and non-alcoholic drinks.
It operates facilities in La Crosse in Wisconsin, as well as in Memphis, Tennessee; Latrobe, Pennsylvania and Irwindale, California.
Alongside the transfer of ownership, a new board of directors with ""significant expertise"" in the beverage and co-manufacturing industries has been appointed.
As part of the leadership change, David Taylor has stepped down as executive chairman but will assist in the transition.
Sannes will continue to lead the company alongside the newly appointed board, which has members that have worked at companies including The Coca-Cola Company, Anheuser-Busch InBev and Diageo.
The directors City Brewing has lined up include David Colo, who was the CEO of US contract distiller MGP Ingredients for almost four years up to January 2024.

(Reuters) -DuPont will sell its heat-resistant fiber business Aramids, home to brands such as body armor maker Kevlar, to peer Arclin for $1.8 billion as the chemicals company undergoes a broader reorganization.
The sale will not affect the planned separation of its electronics business in November, DuPont said on Friday, as the company attempts to streamline its portfolio.
Lower exposure to the ""legacy"" Aramids business would aid DuPont's growth and margin profile in the near-term, helping the company achieve a better valuation post the spinoff, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Arun Viswanathan.
The chemicals industry has been struggling with higher energy costs, as well as weak demand and prices, especially in European markets where strict regulations have raised the cost of manufacturing.
The company expects pre-tax cash proceeds of about $1.2 billion upon the sale's close, along with a note receivable of $300 million and a non-controlling stake valued at $325 million in Arclin.
RBC's Viswanathan expects proceeds from the Aramids sale and the electronics unit spinoff to likely be used for acquisitions, share buybacks and deleveraging.
DuPont's sale of the Aramids portfolio, which includes protective clothing maker Nomex, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026.
Shares of the company were up marginally at $77.56 in morning trade.

Companies worth $200 billion or more are generally described as “mega-cap stocks,” and BRK.B definitely fits that description, with its market cap exceeding this threshold, reflecting its substantial size, influence, and dominance in the insurance-diversified industry.

Berkshire slipped 7.8% from its 52-week high of $542.07, achieved on May 2. Over the past three months, BRK.B stock declined marginally, underperforming the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average’s ($DOWI) 8.4% rise during the same time frame.
Moreover, in the longer term, shares of Berkshire rose 10.3% on a YTD basis and climbed 7.6% over the past 52 weeks, compared to $DOWI’s YTD return of 7.3% and 11.1% gains over the last year.
Berkshire has been trading above its 200-day and 50-day moving averages since mid-August, indicating an uptrend.
On Aug. 2, Berkshire Hathaway released its fiscal 2025 second-quarter earnings and its shares dipped 2.9% in the next trading session. Its net income dropped to $12.4 billion from $30.4 billion a year ago due to a $3.8 billion Kraft Heinz write-down, while operating earnings held steady at $11.2 billion.

Wall Street analysts are moderately bullish on BRK.B’s prospects. The stock has a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating from the seven analysts covering it, and the mean price target of $537.75 suggests a potential upside of 7.6% from current price levels.

The capital raise is aimed at strengthening the company's balance sheet and providing financial flexibility to pursue its Towards 2030 strategy.
The new shares will be offered at a 10% discount to the last traded price of A$14.73 on 27 August 2025 and an 8.6% discount to the volume-weighted average price of A$14.5 over the preceding ten trading days.

New shares issued under this placement are expected to settle on 2 September 2025, with trading on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) to commence the next business day.
Lynas Rare Earths CEO and managing director Amanda Lacaze said: “Towards 2030 sets out our plan to optimise performance from the Lynas 2025 capital investments and to pursue new growth opportunities. The equity raising provides Lynas with the balance sheet strength to pursue a strong growth agenda.”
“The rare earths market is rapidly evolving, and we need to move at pace to maximise value from existing assets and create further value from market opportunities. This includes continuing to grow our operations to serve the customers, downstream players and governments who seek to partner with Lynas to quickly establish larger and more resilient outside China supply chains for rare earths materials.”
In conjunction with the placement, Lynas is also offering a non-underwritten share purchase plan (SPP) to its eligible shareholders, aiming to raise up to an additional A$75m.
Eligible shareholders will have the opportunity to purchase up to A$30,000 worth of new shares per shareholder, free of transaction and brokerage costs, at the same issue price of A$13.25 per share.

Dell Technologies (DELL) shares sank in early trading Friday, a day after it projected soft current-quarter profit.
The Round Rock, Texas-based maker of personal computers and servers sees third-quarter adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.45 at the midpoint, below the $2.49 expected by analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha.
Dell shares are falling around 10% in early trading Friday, leading declines on the S&P 500. They are up around 5% so far this year.
Dell's forecasts for Q3 revenue and full-year profit and revenue came in above Visible Alpha consensus. Its second-quarter adjusted EPS of $2.32 on revenue that surged 19% year-over-year to a record $29.78 billion also topped estimates, which the company attributed to strong AI demand.

Caterpillar now expects a tariff hit of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion this year, up from its prior forecast of up to $1.5 billion.
BofA Securities analyst Michael Feniger said the headwinds were not limited to the company.
""A theme through earnings is that tariff headwinds are higher than expected, and this continues to rise into (the) third quarter,"" Feniger said.
Global companies that have reported between July 16 and August 20 have forecast a combined annual financial hit of $14.3 billion to $15.9 billion and nearly $15 billion for 2026, Reuters tariff tracker shows.
Baird Equity analyst Mircea Dobre estimated that tariffs could cost Caterpillar an additional $1.1 billion in 2026. He also said he does not assume meaningful mitigation next year.
Meanwhile, Brian Langenberg, analyst at Langenberg LLC, was relatively optimistic about demand. ""Annoying, but not a killer. Demand is demand, and if someone needs a bulldozer they will buy it and absorb the tariffs,"" he said.
""While we believe cycle transition will overpower tariff-sentiment, volume growth is the clear next catalyst."" said Oppenheimer analyst Kristen Owen.
Caterpillar's shares trade at about 21.34 times their forward profit estimates, above the industry median of 18.46. They have risen 20.9% so far this year.

Grant Cardone, a real estate mogul and entrepreneur known for his high-energy approach to wealth building, has consistently positioned himself at the intersection of established markets and emerging opportunities. His recent statement that “$60 trillion in retirement funds want access to Bitcoin” underscores both the scale of traditional investment capital and his belief that digital assets can no longer be ignored in long-term financial planning. By framing the launch of Cardone Capital’s “real estate bitcoin hybrid funds” as a bridge between stability and innovation, Cardone highlights a central theme in his career: creating vehicles for investors to participate in opportunities that were previously difficult to access.
Cardone’s Quote and Its Implications
Cardone’s message stresses two key ideas: the massive pool of untapped retirement savings and the growing demand for exposure to digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTCUSD). He argues that retirement vehicles like IRAs and 401(k)s could benefit from diversification beyond traditional equities and bonds, combining the predictable cash flow of real estate with the volatility-driven potential of cryptocurrency. The assertion that retirees can enjoy “dependable growth” through real estate while gaining exposure to the “explosive potential of Bitcoin” reflects his view that both asset classes offer complementary strengths.
More News from Barchart
Context Behind the Statement
Cardone’s reputation was built on real estate, where his company, Cardone Capital, manages billions of dollars in multifamily properties across the United States. His rise from modest beginnings to a leading voice in real estate investment has given him credibility in markets traditionally associated with stability and long-term value. By pairing that experience with an embrace of Bitcoin, he is signaling confidence in cryptocurrency as a legitimate component of modern wealth strategies rather than a speculative trend.
This approach reflects a broader shift in financial markets. Institutional interest in Bitcoin has grown significantly in recent years, with pension funds, hedge funds, and large asset managers exploring ways to integrate digital currencies into their portfolios. Cardone’s framing of a hybrid fund recognizes both the risk aversion of retirement investors and the inevitability of change as digital assets move further into the mainstream.",b91b7184184294906cb2aa1b207e141d,trafilatura

I was a college student studying accounting in the mid-1990s, and one of my projects was to decide if the Internet could become a viable platform for commerce. My group and I researched, ran the numbers, made the presentations and gave the answer that felt obvious: No, the Internet would not work.
At the time, we couldn’t imagine using a credit card online. Or buying shoes on a computer. Like many people then, we underestimated what would become the most important technological advancement of our lives. How wrong we were.
In the long run, though, my college experience would give me a deeper understanding of the forces of innovation. When I first encountered crypto in 2017, I saw parallels to the internet, including what I missed the first time. I saw a similar structure, incentives and also a sense of inevitability. That insight led me to found Pure Crypto, a digital asset investment firm which was the best-performing hedge fund-of-funds globally between 2018 and 2025.
Since launching Pure Crypto, I’ve watched digital assets transform from a fringe experiment into a Wall Street-approved asset class. Despite this, I believe crypto is still in its early days. It sounds counterintuitive to call something “early” when it’s created trillions in value, but consider how few people own crypto — only about 6.8% of people globally at the end of 2024. For comparison, at the time of the dot-com crash, less than 7% of the world was online, and some of the Internet’s most transformative platforms hadn’t even arrived yet. Facebook didn’t exist until 2004.
What that tells me is simple: When a transformative technology arrives, the window of opportunity is longer and bigger than it looks.
How I learned to take the long view of technology
One of the biggest shifts in my approach — and maybe the reason I didn’t misjudge crypto like I did the Internet — was learning to dig deeper. When I initially dismissed the Internet as a viable commercial platform, I didn’t understand the infrastructure. I looked at the surface — what seemed possible then — instead of understanding what might come next. With crypto, I’ve made an effort to be more tenaciously curious. I ask different questions now:
What’s the architecture? What does this protocol actually enable? Is it solving a real-world problem or is it just noise? I’m not a computer scientist or developer, and I don’t pretend to be. But I’ve learned that understanding the fundamentals changes the way you see the space.",58cad9cb49ebddfcf79707fb39461419,trafilatura

(NYSE:CHPT) is one of the best meme stocks. On July 29, ChargePoint launched Safeguard Care, a new service that monitors the reliability of its electric vehicle charging stations. The company made $408 million in revenue over the past year and is looking for new ways to earn money while keeping cash burn under control.
The program, now active in six markets, sends trained service staff to regularly check charging stations and fix common problems during their visits.
During each Safeguard Care visit, the team inspects the charging station and surrounding area, cleans it, makes minor repairs or adjustments, and runs a test charge to make sure everything works. Problems that cannot be fixed on-site are sent to ChargePoint support for follow-up.
JD Singh, ChargePoint’s Chief Customer Experience Officer, mentioned that Safeguard Care shows the company’s focus on providing reliable charging. The service is aimed at busy and widely spread charging stations, like those in cities, parking garages, and workplaces, especially for owners who don’t have staff to maintain them. It works alongside ChargePoint’s Assure service by adding on-site inspections.
ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CHPT) offers EV charging networks and solutions in North America and Europe.

Nu Holdings is a dominant fintech stock focused on the Latin American market.
-
Its growing crypto offerings should get investors very excited about its prospects.
Most investors still haven't heard about Nu Holdings (NYSE: NU). That's because the company operates in just three countries: Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. Despite limited awareness of it in the U.S., however, Nu dominates its local markets. More than half of all Brazilian adults are Nu customers, using its debit cards and banking services regularly.
But there's actually another factor that should make Nu a must-know name for investors everywhere: Its exposure to cryptocurrencies.
Nu is a crypto powerhouse
Nu is already a banking giant in Latin America. But over time, it could become a crypto giant. That's because the company is a digital-first bank. It operates no physical branches, allowing customers to access its services purely through a smartphone. That may not seem innovative today, but in 2013, when Nu first launched, it was a groundbreaking concept in Latin American markets.
A digital-first approach allowed Nu to shed costs, lower prices, and iterate new products rapidly. At the push of a button, the company could activate a new service for tens of millions of customers at once. Nu's crypto service, for example, was launched in 2022, and generated 1 million users in its first month!
Since the launch of Nu's crypto service, we haven't received many updates with concrete subscriber numbers. But what we do know is that Nu has gradually added more and more options to its platform. Earlier this year, for instance, Nu added support for 11 new cryptocurrencies. Today, its customers can seamlessly exchange fiat currencies for cryptocurrencies at any time. This allows customers to easily pay with crypto at a restaurant or store -- an ability that crypto optimists have long dreamed of achieving.
Despite falling sales growth rates, Nu remains a bona fide growth stock. This year, sales are expected to grow by 35%. Next year, sales should grow by another 27%. If crypto usage takes off, we could see Nu maintain these high growth rates for years to come.

TLDR: 95 of the top 100 coins have turned red today; All top 10 coins have dropped today, with ETH leading the list; BTC and ETH fell 2.7% and 5.2%, trading at $110,125 and $4,376, respectively; This is ‘a natural market correction following significant gains’; ’History cautions toward late‑Summer/September pullbacks even after sharp rallies’; ’Momentum may carry ETH higher in the near term’; ’Strong accumulation by long-term holders and on‑chain demand retention can help sustain BTC’s recovery’; ’Retail and institutional investors are seeing the unique utility that altcoins provide over Bitcoin’; Both US BTC and ETH ETFs saw inflows on Wednesday, with $81.25 million and $307 million, respectively; Caution continues rising among investors.
At the time of writing, all top 10 coins per market capitalization have decreased over the past 24 hours.
Bitcoin (BTC) fell by 2.7% and below $110,500, now trading at $110,125.
At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) is down by 5.2%, now changing hands at $4,376. This is the biggest drop in the category.
It’s followed by Dogecoin (DOGE), with a drop of 4.7% to $0.2143, as well as XRP (XRP), having decreased by 4.6% to $2.87.
As for the top 100 coins, only five coins are up. Yesterday’s biggest fall, Provenance Blockchain (HASH), increased the most today: 10.3% to $0.02763.
Others are down below 4% each.
Cronos (CRO), which had stood at the top for three days in a row, saw the largest drop today. It fell 13.7% to the price of $0.2978. Also, this is the only double-digit drop.
Kinetiq Staked HYPE (KHYPE) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) follow with falls of 8.9% and 8.8%, now trading at $44.78 and $44.47, respectively.
Analysts have found that bearish divergences have been building over several months across weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly timeframes. Also, September has historically been bearish.
James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet, argued that “Ethereum has stolen the spotlight.” The coin’s rally is driven by strong institutional demand, including hedge funds and corporate treasuries accumulating ETH, as well as regulatory advancements, spot ETF inflows, and staking yields.
“Momentum may carry ETH higher in the near term,” Toledano said. “However, history cautions toward late‑Summer/September pullbacks even after sharp rallies. Breaking below ~$4,400 or ~$4,500 could undermine the trend —especially if Jerome Powell decides not to cut rates in September due to core inflation fears, then momentum could be stopped in its tracks.”
He also commented on Bitcoin’s drop, stating that “it’s hardly in need of a recovery,” given that it hasn’t moved that far from its ATH.
“Analysts will say that Bitcoin needs to stabilise above critical technical levels—particularly around $107K and $100K—to rebuild support,” he writes. “The slump in ETF inflows in favour of Ethereum ETFs isn’t helping either. The cooling macro volatility in response to more rate-cut signals from the Fed has the potential to reignite investor confidence. Avoiding further liquidations after recent “flash crash” events—triggered by large whale selling ($2.7B) —is also vital. Strong accumulation by long-term holders and on‑chain demand retention can help sustain recovery.”
Moreover, FLock.io’s CEO Jiahao Sun, commented that Bitcoin’s price has plunged to a seven-week low below $110,000 in “what is a natural market correction following significant gains.”
Per the CEO, “although it has kickstarted a cooling-off period and consolidation, it is still reflective of a maturing and dynamic asset class. Incumbent investors are growing in numbers, alongside the broader maturation of the altcoin market. This growth aligns with increasing interest from both retail and institutional investors, who are seeing the unique utility that altcoins provide over Bitcoin.”
Sun continued: “Ethereum overcame resistance with a breakout and retest confirmed, speculating calls for a run to double in value. While the market performance is a textbook bullish signal, it also speaks to ETH’s growing utility and adoption within the digital asset ecosystem. More and more projects are being built on the blockchain, which has become the gold standard for utility tokens.”
At the time of writing on Wednesday morning, BTC trades at $110,125. The chart shows a gradual decrease over the past 24 hours, unlike the sharp plunges and jumps over the past couple of days.
The day’s highest point was $113,291. The coin was unable to move above $114,000 and keep the level, falling to the intraday low of $110,003. The coin may fall further to $109,000 and towards $105,000.
Since last Friday, BTC has fallen 7.6%. Also, it’s 11.3% away from its all-time high.

Ethereum is currently trading at $4,376. Its highest point today was $4,611, falling to the intraday low of $4,365.
Should the pullback continue, ETH could fall below the $4,300 level.
The coin is still green over the past week, though by only 0.3% at the time of writing. It’s also 12% away from its ATH of $4,946.
Furthermore, the crypto market sentiment has been moving within a narrow range in neutral territory for several days now. The crypto fear and greed index is back to 47 today from 45 yesterday.
The sentiment barely moving for the past few days highlights that investors are awaiting additional signals to see in which direction the market will move in the mid-term. Therefore, they are highly cautious.

Meanwhile, as of 28 August, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw the fourth day of positive flows, taking in $178.9 million.
Ark&21Shares is at the top today, with $79.81 million, followed by BlackRock’s $63.72 million.
Three other funds saw inflows, and there were no outflows recorded on Thursday.

Moreover, the US ETH ETFs also saw inflows for the sixth day in a row, with $39.16 million on Thursday, reaching the total net inflow of $13.68 billion.
Two of the nine funds saw inflows, and two saw outflows. BlackRock and Grayscale took in $67.62 million and $6.27 million.
On the other hand, Fidelity and Bitwise lost $33.45 million and $1.28 million.

Meanwhile, US Bitcoin ETFs dominated spot volume with $10 billion daily trading, capturing 13.1% market share, while Ethereum ETFs surged with $4 billion inflows in August.
Also, 21Shares has filed for a spot SEI ETF with the US SEC, which would track the CF SEI-Dollar Reference Rate in USD. Also, the company could engage in staking if tax status permits. This follows Canary Capital’s similar filing in April.
Matt McPhee, Chief Financial Officer at Xapo Bank, commented that institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs hit $33.6 billion in Q2 this year, “with investment advisors, hedge funds, and brokers leading the charge.”
“That’s not just capital moving, it’s a signal that Bitcoin is firmly on the institutional and treasury radar. What was once a fringe asset is now being actively allocated to by some of the most influential firms and players in finance,” McPhee says.
He continued: “This growing wave of adoption shows the huge shift in mindset, even since the same period last year. Bitcoin isn’t just a speculative play; it has become a strategic allocation that is changing how modern-day finance operates. For institutions focused on long-term allocation strategies, this is merely the opening act.”

Why did crypto move against stocks today?
The crypto market dropped over the past day, while the stock market continued rising on its previous day of trading. By the closing time on Thursday, the S&P 500 was up by 0.32%, the Nasdaq-100 increased by 0.58%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.16%. Stock investors are reacting to Nvidia’s quarterly earnings results, as well as other economic data in the US specifically.
-
Is this dip sustainable?
For now, yes. The continuation of the current pullback is possible. While many analysts and traders expect the prices to continue rallying, at least by the end of this year, we’ve entered a phase of (typical) corrections.

By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)
Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped nearly 3% to $109,800 in the past 24 hours, pulling the broader market, including ether (ETH), down with it. But those losses are nothing out of the ordinary, meaning major tokens are trading near recent valuations.
What's new today is that BTC's volatility is bouncing from recent multiyear lows (See Chart of the Day). The 30-day implied volatility, as represented by Volmex's BVIV and Deribit's DVOL indices, has surged above the 100-day simple moving average for the first time since mid-June. Perhaps the price turbulence that some traders predicted for August may unfold in September.
The increase could be noteworthy for stock traders as an early indicator of a potential uptick in Wall Street’s VIX. The VIX is inversely correlated with stocks, suggesting there's of a rough day ahead on Wall Street, a possibility underlined by fiat liquidity dynamics.
""Market liquidity pressures are mounting as reserve balances decline and large Treasury settlements approach, leaving equities vulnerable despite lower volatility,"" Michael Kramer, the founder of Mott Capital Management, wrote in the latest edition of the firm's markets update.
One piece of data to keep an eye on is the U.S. core PCE release, due later today.
""This PCE release will shape the Fed’s future easing path rather than the September decision itself,"" analysts from crypto exchange Bitunix wrote in an email. ""If data comes in at or below expectations, risk sentiment can hold; but if significantly hotter, the Fed’s forward guidance may shift toward a 'one-and-wait' stance. Investors should focus on core services and wage trends, alongside U.S. Treasury yields and the DXY as key drivers of risk appetite.""
In the event of a soft CPI, ether may outperform because traders have been increasingly focusing on Ethereum's native token. That's evident from the ETF flows. This week, the U.S.-listed ETH ETFs have registered a net inflow of over $1 billion, SoSoValue data show. That's close to double the $567 million entering the bitcoin ETFs.
In traditional markets, the spread between the U.S. 10- and two-year Treasury yields has risen to the highest since September 2022. The so-called curve steepening supports the bullish case in gold and bitcoin. Stay alert!

Solana (SOL) posted a 44% drop in second-quarter application revenue, sliding to to $576.4 million from $1 billion in the first quarter even as its DeFi sector expanded, according to Messari.
The downturn reflects weaker profitability across key decentralized apps. Pump.fun (PUMP) still led with $156.9 million, but was still down 44% as memecoin frenzy cooled.
Axiom was the outlier, surging 641% to $126.6 million, showing how fast protocol-specific growth can offset broader ecosystem weakness. Jupiter (JUP) earned $66.4 million (–16%), while Phantom and Photon were hit hardest with declines of 65% and 72%, respectively.
Despite revenue losses, DeFi TVL on Solana climbed 30% to $8.6 billion in the quarter and has since crossed $11 billion, cementing the chain as the largest DeFi network behind Ethereum.
Kamino Finance drove TVL growth, up 34% to $2.1 billion after introducing Kamino Lend V2, which attracted $200 million in deposits and $80 million in loans within three weeks. Kamino now controls 25% of Solana’s market share.
Raydium staged a strong comeback, rising 54% to $1.8 billion in TVL, reclaiming second place from Jupiter. It now commands 21% share versus Jupiter’s 19%.
Trading activity, however, told a different story: Average daily spot DEX volume fell 45% to $2.5 billion, reflecting a fading of the memecoin momentum that had fueled the previous quarter's records.
Derivatives Positioning
Open interest (OI) in futures tied to the top 20 coins, excluding SOL, has decreased in the past 24 hours, indicating broad-based capital outflows.
SOL's open interest, however, hit a record high 63.84 million, alongside a rally in the token's price to $217, a level last seen in February.
The eight-hour funding rates for ether, tron and BNB flipped slightly negative, indicating a bias for bearish bets on a drop in prices. Funding rates for other major tokens were steady at around zero, indicating neutral sentiment.
OI in the CME bitcoin futures slipped to 135.72K BTC, the lowest since April, while ether OI remained elevated at record highs near 2.10 million ETH. The divergence suggests a continued preference among investors for ETH over BTC.

The order was placed by Nebraska Public Power District (NPPD), a public corporation and political sub-division of the state.
The power plant, to be located near Hallam, will feature 12 Wärtsilä 50DF dual-fuel engines that primarily run on natural gas but can switch to diesel during natural gas supply interruptions such as extreme weather conditions.
Set for delivery in August 2027, the engines are a critical component of the plant, which is scheduled to begin commercial operations in 2028.
Wärtsilä's technology is designed to support the integration of renewable energy into the power system.
Wärtsilä Energy North America Engine Power Plants Energy Business director Jon Rodriguez said: “This project emphasises the importance of flexible engine power plant solutions in the energy system, providing reliable power supply and operations when needed.
“By meeting fuel resilient asset needs, and by enabling flexible generation, we are serving the local communities.”
Prior to this, the company secured a contract to supply engineering and equipment for a 217MW power plant in Liberty, Kentucky. Commissioned by the East Kentucky Power Cooperative, the facility will help bolster the grid's capacity to meet the increasing power requirement.
Last month, Wärtsilä was chosen to deliver a 204MW power plant solution for the Reko Diq copper-gold mining project in Pakistan. This plant, featuring 12 Wärtsilä 50 engines and auxiliaries, will ensure economical power supply for mining operations.

The fines by the Accounting and Financial Reporting Council (AFRC) relate to the audits of two former listed companies over the period from 2011 to 2013.
The AFRC, with assistance from the mainland’s Ministry of Finance (MOF), has concluded its first batch of disciplinary cases.
Additionally, two partners at the firm, Samuel Wong Tin-chak and Mak Chi-lung, have been ordered to pay HK$416,000 and HK$336,000, respectively.
Both partners, as well as the firm, have been reprimanded by the regulator.
The AFRC identified multiple audit deficiencies, particularly in revenue recognition, which led to the failure to identify related misstatements.
The individuals and firm involved accepted their breaches and proactively engaged in settlement negotiations, ultimately reaching an early settlement with the AFRC.
The Tianhe Group's core business involved the manufacturing and sale of fine chemical products.
Deloitte and Wong were responsible for auditing the financial information of the Tianhe Group for the financial years 2011, 2012, and 2013, as part of the company's 2014 IPO on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
The AFRC highlighted that revenue was a significant risk area and that there was a potential risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
The AFRC's findings indicated that the reporting accountants failed to properly evaluate internal controls over the revenue cycle and did not obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding their operating effectiveness.
As for the Sound Global Group, which specialised in turnkey water and wastewater treatment, Deloitte and Mak audited the financial information for the years 2012 and 2013.
The auditors had identified risks of material misstatement in relation to revenue and bank balances for both years.
The AFRC found multiple deficiencies in their work, particularly concerning revenue from turnkey services and sales of equipment, as well as external confirmations relating to bank balances and trade receivables.
AFRC CEO Janey Lai said: “The successful completion of these disciplinary cases attests to the effectiveness of the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the MoF and AFRC in 2019 in strengthening public trust in financial reporting and investor confidence.

Economist Peter Schiff, renowned for predicting the financial crisis of 2008, supported Donald Trump during the election season. However, right before Trump moved back into the White House, Schiff sounded the alarm about his approach to a critical issue for America: trade.
At a press conference in Mar-a-Lago, Trump addressed trade deficits with Canada and Europe, announcing plans to impose substantial tariffs to address the imbalance. These tariffs have subsequently caused ripples through the international economy.
Schiff, the chief economist and global strategist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, strongly disagrees with the president.
“Trump’s take on trade deficits is all wrong,” he wrote on Instagram, sharing a clip from The Peter Schiff Show podcast where he elaborated on his critique.
“[Trump] said we have a huge trade deficit with Canada as if somehow that’s harming the United States — it’s actually helping the United States. It’s unfortunate that we’re not productive enough to get by without all those Canadian products,” Schiff explained.
“Donald Trump specifically said we don’t need any Canadian cars, we don’t need any Canadian timber — of course we do! I mean, we build houses, we drive cars. I mean, if we didn’t have access to Canadian lumber or Canadian cars or any of the other things that we import from Canada — America imports a lot of stuff from Canada — what does Donald Trump think would happen to the price of all that stuff? It would go way up,” he argued.
America imports a significant volume of goods from Canada — and it’s not limited to timber and cars. The list also includes crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, and electricity, among others.
Schiff also criticized Trump’s perspective on trade deficits with Europe, pointing out that America depends on European goods as well.
Double-digit inflation in 2025?
Schiff didn’t mince words, asserting that by imposing tariffs, Trump “wants to add to the inflationary problem.”
He’s not alone in this critique, as economists often view tariffs as a double-edged sword. On one hand, they can protect domestic industries by making imported goods more expensive, giving local manufacturers a competitive edge. On the other hand, higher tariffs may result in increased costs for consumers, as companies pass on the extra expenses. This can lead to inflation, eroding household purchasing power and raising the cost of living.
While some economists — including Nobel laureate Paul Krugman — have claimed that the U.S. has won the war against inflation, Schiff strongly disagrees. “Inflation won the war,” he declared. “Inflation is going to keep getting worse.”
How much worse? Last year, he warned, “By 2025 inflation will likely be in double digits, and the first digit may not be a one!”
Given Schiff’s dire forecast of rising price levels, where should investors seek refuge?
His go-to answer is simple: gold.
The allure of investing in gold lies in its unique properties: the yellow metal can’t be printed in unlimited quantities by central banks like fiat money. And because its value isn’t tied to any one currency or economy, gold could provide protection during periods of economic uncertainty.
As inflation erodes the purchasing power of paper currencies, gold’s appeal as a stable store of value often grows, driving up demand. In 2024, gold prices surged by 26%, surpassing $2,600 per ounce.
Schiff believes this is just the beginning. “If gold can go from $20 an ounce to $2,600 an ounce, it can go from $2,600 to $26,000, or even to $100,000. There’s no limit because, again, gold isn’t changing — it’s the value of the dollar that’s decreasing,” he recently stated.
At today’s prices, a climb to $100,000 would represent an astounding upside of over 3,600%.
One way to invest in gold that also provides significant tax advantages is to open a gold IRA with the help of Thor Metals.
Gold IRAs allow investors to hold physical gold or gold-related assets within a retirement account, which combines the tax advantages of an IRA with the protective benefits of investing in gold, making it an attractive option for those looking to potentially hedge their retirement funds against economic uncertainties.

A tangible hedge with passive income
In addition to gold, real estate serves as another time-tested hedge against inflation — with the added benefit of generating passive income.
When inflation rises, property values often increase as well, reflecting the higher costs of materials, labor and land. This makes real estate a compelling store of value for investors looking to protect their wealth.
Moreover, real estate doesn’t just rely on appreciation for returns. Rental properties, for instance, can provide a steady stream of passive income. As inflation pushes up the cost of living, rental income typically rises alongside it, helping landlords offset the erosion of purchasing power.
Over the last five years, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index has surged by more than 50%.
One way to invest in real estate is by purchasing rental properties and becoming a landlord. But for the average American who wants to avoid the need for a hefty down payment or the burden of property management, crowdfunding platforms like Arrived makes it easier to slice yourself up a piece of that pie.
With Arrived, you can invest in shares of rental homes with as little as $100 without worrying about mowing lawns, fixing leaky faucets, or handling difficult tenants. The process is simple: browse a curated selection of homes that have been vetted for their appreciation and income potential. Once you find a property you like, select the number of shares you’d like to purchase, and then sit back as you start receiving rental income deposits from your investment.
Another option is First National Realty Partners (FNRP), which requires a larger minimum investment and targets necessity-based commercial real estate.
The platform lets accredited investors own a share of commercial properties leased by national brands like Whole Foods, CVS, Kroger and Walmart. The FNRP offers white-glove service to investors so you can engage with experts, explore available deals, and easily make an allocation, all in one personalized secure portal. Investors can enjoy the potential to collect stable, grocery store-anchored income every quarter.",225b1c043ab1dbb13927a7af39d1a8ea,trafilatura

What do I do ? ,2025-08-30 13:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Emergency funds are an indispensable part of financial health, offering a cushion when life takes an unexpected turn. But when that safety net is suddenly gone, the loss can feel devastating, both financially and emotionally.
Consider Joe. After decades of disciplined saving, he managed to build a $50,000 emergency fund. It wasn’t easy, but it gave him confidence that he could weather whatever came his way. Then two major medical bills arrived in quick succession. Almost overnight, the account he worked so hard to build was nearly emptied, leaving him anxious about how to start again.
Joe’s story may feel dramatic, but it’s far from unusual. In fact, according to Bankrate's 2025 Annual Emergency Savings Report, only 46% of all Americans have enough saved to cover three months of expenses. Another 30% have some money saved for emergencies but not enough to pay for three months of bills, and nearly a quarter have nothing saved at all.
But an emergency fund is essential, and Bankrate found that 37% of adults relied on their emergency fund sometime in the past three months.
Losing an entire emergency fund in one fell swoop can feel discouraging. But as hard as it is to see that balance disappear, it’s important to remember that the fund did exactly what it was designed to do: protect you during a crisis. Building an emergency fund once and keeping it untouched forever might be ideal, but the reality is that it exists for moments like these.
To start rebuilding an emergency fund, the first thing you'll want to do is to set a specific and realistic goal for rebuilding your emergency fund. What's reasonable for you will depend on what your income is. It’s generally recommended that an emergency fund will have enough money to cover 3 to 6 months of essential expenses (housing payment, utility bills, etc.).
For example, if your monthly essential expenses are $2,000, then six months of emergency funds would be about $12,000.
Once you’ve identified how much you need to save, the next step is figuring out what you need to set aside each month to get there. The timeline should fit your income and circumstances. If you aim too high, you risk leaving yourself cash-strapped and stressed, which makes the process unsustainable. A more realistic plan, even if it takes longer, will keep you motivated.
If your goal is to save $12,000, you could aim to save about $300 per month for three years.
Of course, you also don't want to abandon other goals, like saving for retirement and earning your employer a match on your 401(k) funds, so look at the big picture and find a balance for how fast you can rebuild.
The next step is to track your spending and make a detailed budget that is both realistic and that prioritizes saving for emergencies. Living under a strict budget can feel restrictive, but while you’re rebuilding an emergency fund, it’s a necessary — and temporary — state. Once your savings are back on solid ground, you’ll be able to loosen the reins a bit and enjoy more flexibility.
If you look back at credit card statements and monitor what you're spending money on now, you'll get a good baseline for where your cash is going. Using this information, you can create a detailed budget that accounts for every dollar, and that includes the money you're trying to save for emergencies.
For example, you can specify in your budget how much you'll save, as well as how much to spend on groceries, entertainment, clothing, dining out, housing, transportation and all of your other costs.
Treat those contributions as non-negotiable, the same way you would a rent payment or utility bill. By putting emergency savings first and building the rest of your budget around it, you make sure progress happens consistently, even if other spending categories have to tighten for a while.

Next, look for areas in your budget that you can cut to make sure you can meet or exceed your goals in saving for emergencies. Some of these cuts might feel small, like canceling a $10 subscription, while others, such as refinancing debt or shopping for cheaper insurance, can make a bigger impact. Here’s what you can look for:
-
Streaming services
-
Unused gym memberships
-
Your clothing budget (consider shopping at thrift stores or not buying new things)
-
Your grocery budget (you can use coupons)
-
Your cell phone bill (shop for a cheaper plan)
-
Your transportation costs (consider carpooling or public transportation)
-
Your utility bills (turn down the head or the AC and unplug unused appliances)
-
Your entertainment costs (look into free activities)
-
Your insurance costs (increase your deductibles or drop unnecessary coverages)
-
Your bank fees (switch to a bank that doesn't charge)
-
Your debt expenses (refinance to a loan with a lower monthly payment)*
The key is to examine your spending line by line and ask yourself if each expense is essential right now. Remember, this rebuilding process is temporary so you don't have to sacrifice forever.
Once you’ve found room in your budget, the best way to make sure you actually save it is to take the decision out of your hands. Automating contributions means the money moves into your emergency fund before you have the chance to spend it elsewhere.
So if you said you'd save $100 a month toward your emergency fund, set that up to happen on payday.
You can even use the budget cuts you found to save more money. For example, if you cancelled a streaming service and saved $10 per month, for example, set up a transfer of $110 per month to savings, instead of $100.
Automating the process means you won't miss a contribution, and it makes it more likely you'll build up your emergency fund faster.
Rebuilding an emergency fund after it’s been drained can feel overwhelming, but remember: the fact that you had savings to fall back on already put you ahead of the curve. Most people never get that far.
By setting realistic goals, sticking to a temporary budget, cutting where you can, and automating contributions, you can gradually restore the safety net that once gave you peace of mind. It won’t happen overnight, but every step forward puts you in a stronger position for the next unexpected expense.
Your emergency fund did its job — it was there when you needed it. Now the task is to rebuild, one contribution at a time.

This results in a synergized acquisition multiple for the remaining business that is below 7 times synergized Adjusted EBITDA, in line with Post’s synergized acquisition multiple presented in conjunction with its 8th Avenue acquisition announcement on June 3, 2025.

Whether you built up that cash from grinding away at your job or reining in your spending, you’re well ahead of the average American, who doesn’t even have $1,000 set aside for an emergency.
You don’t want to blow it. You want to grow it. Stashing $5,000 in a bank account may feel like the safest option, but over time, its value will shrink with inflation. There are other ways to make that money work for you.
As a finance writer, I’ve picked up many of those strategies from financial experts and applied them as a DIY investor. I’ve had to. Managing money responsibly is a necessity, not an option, for freelancers like me. It means I can also relate to people who are new to investing.
Now I want to use my personal experience to help you along the way to your best financial future — and hey, $5,000 is a great start.
The best strategy for you will be highly dependent on your personal situation. Let’s look at a few hypothetical scenarios to help you start thinking about how best to balance growth and risk with a pile of cash this big.
Imagine someone beginning her career, like Rachel, 25, who’s single and who just started an entry-level marketing job. The idea of investing excites her — but it also stresses her out because $5,000 is all she has saved.
Read more: Rich, young Americans are ditching stocks — here are the alternative assets they're banking on instead
Common wisdom is to keep at least three months’ worth of money stashed away in an emergency fund — and that’s good advice.
If I were in Rachel’s situation, I might consider putting $4,000 in a high-yield savings account so I have a solid start and access to fast funds, especially for an emergency.
I might put the other $1,000 into a broad-based ETF with a beginner-friendly brokerage with low fees — a safer alternative for beginner investors than daytrading or picking their own stocks.
Or I could start investing in my retirement really early, investing that $1,000 in a Roth IRA account, and take advantage of the tax-free benefits.
While this kind of allocation may not come with huge gains, it’s good to start a wealth-building journey on solid ground and have an emergency fund available for life’s uncertainties.
Picture an IT tech like Raj, 30, who’s married, no kids. His company pays him a good salary and he’s managed to pay down his debt and even put some cash aside in an emergency fund. He’s ready and keen to start investing.
If I were Raj, I’d consider investing $3,500 of my $5,000 in a total stock market ETF with a taxable brokerage account.
I might invest another $1,000 in a broad-based market ETF in a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA (depending on current income and future expectations) to save for retirement.
The remaining $500 would be “play money” to invest in a few solo stocks I feel good about. But as a beginner, I’d avoid investing in the latest trending stocks or day trading until I’m much more experienced.
In the meantime, I might buy more ETF shares and read up on news from reputable publications that follow the stock market. Then I could try a no-risk paper trading simulator to test day trading before diving deeper into these riskier strategies.
Putting all $5,000 in the market as a beginner would expose me to market volatility but it would also teach the value of staying the course. At 30, Raj has time to ride out the ups and downs of the market for the long term, and historical data shows the market has always recovered from dips in the past.
Danielle, 28, is a single mom and teacher who, when not working and raising her son, is also juggling $25,000 in federal student loans. For Danielle, every dollar has a job and she wants to be more cautious with her money.
In Danielle’s situation, paying off debt would be my top priority. Interest on $25,000 could mount up quickly. I might use my savings to tackle the student debt with a $2,500 lump-sum payment.
I’d put another $1,000 of my $5,000 in savings into a high-yield savings account so I’d have instant access to the cash in an emergency — something any single parent would understandably worry about.
It’s clear Danielle doesn’t have the time or financial cushion to take on a ton of risks. In her position, I’d consider investing the remaining $1,500 in a low-risk, income-focused option like a bond portfolio with a robo-advisor.
In Danelle’s position, I’d avoid investing in ETFs until I had a solid emergency fund, was debt-free and secure with a reliable income. While this strategy wouldn’t generate growth, it’s predictable with a safety net if life gets real.
Terry, 35, is married with one child. He’s a civil engineer and has a 401(k) through his firm. He wants to accelerate retirement and go beyond investing basics. He’s disciplined but not highly experienced when it comes to investing.
If I were Terry, I’d consider putting the entire $5,000 in a tax-advantaged IRA — either traditional or Roth — after crunching the numbers in an online IRA calculator to compare the tax rates for traditional and Roth IRA accounts.
Terry doesn’t have the time to micromanage investments or the experience to “beat the market.” This novice investor has a family to support.
In his shoes, I’d set up my IRA account with a brokerage known for low-fee mutual funds and ETFs.
I’d put most of my $5,000 in market ETFs and the remainder in blue-chip stocks or income-generating assets like REITs or bond ETFs. That kind of diversification is key to balancing growth and risk.
As for accelerating retirement, I could set up automatic monthly deposits into my Roth IRA, increasing my prospects for capital growth and income-generating investments. Like Raj, Terry has time to let his tax-sheltered investments sit for years.
There’s an investment strategy for everyone, whether you have $50, $5,000 or $500,000. And the strategies I’d consider might not work for somebody else.
That’s why it never hurts to consult a professional to talk through your own unique situation.
If you’ve saved up $5,000, you’ve already made great financial moves. A qualified financial advisor can help ensure you’re making all the right moves going forward, too.

-
Despite its monster growth so far, Nu still has huge expansion potential in Latin America.
-
Stellar unit economics have supported the company’s rapidly rising profits.
-
Shares have surged in the past three years, but they trade at a reasonable valuation.
Nu Holdings (NYSE: NU) might be a company that's unfamiliar here in the U.S., but American investors might want to become familiar with the Brazil-based digital banking powerhouse. Nu sports a market capitalization of $71 billion, and in the past 24 months, its shares have jumped by nearly 200%.
There still might be more to get excited about the bank. After the market close on Aug. 27, this fintech stock trades at $14.64. Should you buy shares while they're below $15?
Still a big opportunity ahead
Since its founding in 2013, Nu has quickly become one of the largest digital banks on the planet. By leaning on technology to provide a great user experience and serving up various financial services, it has found rapid adoption. Revenue climbed 40% year over year in the second quarter (ended June 30). Nu added 4.1 million net new customers in the last three months, bringing its total to 122.7 million.
The growth thus far has been nothing short of excellent. However, investors would have a flawed view if they believed the gains were over. That couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, Nu appears to have a long runway for expansion ahead. Nu is established in its home country of Brazil, and it's making tremendous progress in Mexico and Colombia. In the future, the leadership team could enter new markets.
Wall Street consensus analyst estimates call for revenue to rise at a compound annual rate of 30.7% between 2024 and 2027. This is a stellar outlook that should add some bullishness to the story.
Nu operates in a developing region of the world. To be clear, this comes with risks, like geopolitical turmoil or macroeconomic volatility. But as internet and smartphone penetration increase, it creates a more favorable backdrop for the business to keep thriving.
Add in the fact that Latin America has a huge unbanked and underbanked population. As the economy grows here, incomes rise, and the need for more people to have financial services emerges, Nu is poised to be a much larger company five or 10 years down the road.
At a bigger scale, Nu's competitive position will be extremely difficult to disrupt. Established banks, such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, have developed wide economic moats that stem from cost advantages and switching costs. Nu could be well on its way to building these compelling traits.",003dfe172b0d917ea19b39271ed185b5,trafilatura

Here how to ace it . ,2025-08-30 13:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Employers are increasingly embracing artificial intelligence over human recruiters to screen potential job candidates.
More than 8 in 10 companies use AI to review resumes, 40% employ AI chatbots to communicate with candidates, and roughly a quarter use AI to conduct interviews, according to a Resume Builder survey. Another 19% plan to add AI for conducting interviews this year.
“The technology has caught on so quickly that many people aren’t ready for it,” Jim Chaffee, an AI expert at the University of Iowa, told Yahoo Finance.
“Using AI early in the process to screen out candidates is a useful and time-saving tool for employers,” he said, “but chatbots are not properly equipped to get more in-depth with a candidate, at which point human participation is vital.”
Companies hiring right now are inundated with job seekers, which has escalated the use of AI interview assistants in recent months, Chaffee said.
The number of Americans filing new applications for jobless benefits rose by the most in roughly three months last week, and unemployment claims have reached the highest level in nearly four years, according to data from the US Department of Labor.
Read more: What are jobless claims, and why do they matter?
Moreover, last month, there were 62,075 job cuts, up 29% from June, according to a recent report by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. That amps up the 2025 total to 806,383 layoffs, the highest January-to-July figure since the pandemic shutdowns of 2020.
Dig deeper: Jobs, inflation, and the fed: How they're all related
“The applicant count that we're receiving every day is astronomical,” said Devin Jones, a senior associate at ROCS Grad Staffing in Washington, D.C. “We have hundreds and hundreds of resumes and applications to go through, and for every single interview that we complete, we’re using an AI tool.
AI-led interviews are especially common with roles that require hard skills or technical requirements — accounting, data entry, and administrative positions, Jones said.
In reality, AI has been part of the job hunting process for years now. Nonetheless, job seekers are not happy about it. Only a quarter of job candidates trust AI will fairly evaluate them, according to recent research by Gartner, Inc. More than 6 in 10 candidates said they are more likely to apply to a position if the organization requires in-person interviews.
In AI-assisted interviews, applicants log on to a hiring platform like Ribbon AI, where they provide videotaped responses to questions that either pop up on the screen or are verbally asked by an avatar. The sessions are typically under 30 minutes, but can stretch to an hour, Jones said.
The AI algorithms scan the video responses, looking for facial expressions, keyword usage and tone of voice. A transcript of the interview is then sent to a hiring manager or recruiter along with the bot's take on the candidate’s performance.
I talked to several career strategists about the advice they’re giving their clients and have included my own expert tips. Here’s what you need to know:
Your AI interviewer is looking for the same kinds of things that a human would look for, Chaffee said.
“Job seekers should approach every interview the same way, whether having a human or an AI conversation,” said Christine Cruzvergara, chief education strategy officer at career platform Handshake. “This is critical because if you are qualified to move to the next round of interviews, chances are highly likely that a person will be reviewing your responses.”
“Introduce yourself and smile,” Jones said. “This is your audition tape.”
Candidates get nervous and clam up when there isn’t a person to talk to, she said. Turn the lights on so your face is brightly shown in soft light and your expressions and nonverbal cues are clear. Speak clearly and let your personality come through.
“It's 10 times harder to let that shine through when you feel like you're talking to yourself,” Jones added.
It really is more like acting than interviewing, so practice. If possible, practice with a friend or family member on the platform you’ll be using or something similar. With Zoom, for example, you can record it to review. This also helps with figuring out how loud to talk and how to position the screen and camera lens.
Watch and critique your recorded responses to improve your delivery. Keep your shoulders back and your hands quiet.
Workplace etiquette applies to all interview experiences, whether online or in-person, Cruzvergara said. “If you’re interviewing via video, keep your attire professional and your interview environment clear of distractions — no pets on the video.""
You’ll need a reliable internet connection, a webcam, and a microphone. Most computers and laptops have these built in.
Position your computer screen so you’re in the middle (horizontally) and the top of your head is near the top of the computer screen. You should be looking up slightly at the camera, a position that helps define your chin and subtly conveys a message of strength and confidence.
Chatbots are always on and always looking at you, so focus on speech clarity, facial expressions, body language, and eye contact because it will note these things in its report, Chaffee said. Try your best to look into the camera when talking. This can take discipline when you aren’t talking directly to another person.
These explore how you’ve handled work situations in the past. “Having examples ready will keep you from pausing too long, which sometimes triggers an AI to think you’re done answering the question,” Cruzvergara said.
Some bots are programmed to answer basic questions about the job or the employer, so go ahead and ask if it’s so equipped.
“Think of an AI interview not as a traditional conversation, but as a chance to do in-depth fact finding,” said Maggie Mistal, a career consultant and executive coach. “Unlike an interview with a person, you won't be building rapport or camaraderie, but you can get solid information about the role, the company, and the skill sets they are searching to hire.”
Some of Mistal’s suggestions to ask the bot:
-
For people hired at my level, what's their general career path for promotion?
-
How many years do employees typically stay at the firm?
-
Is this department a growing part of the company?
-
Which skill sets or experiences are particularly important for success in this job?
“Be factual in your responses to questions,” Mistal said. “Share specific details and add numbers where you can. For instance, don't say, ‘I worked in sales and had success.’ Rather, say, ‘I closed a million dollars in sales, landed a large new customer, and was recognized for top performance by leadership with a bonus.’""
Sticky notes on your computer screen can prompt you with talking points to emphasize about your experience, why you’re a good fit for the job, and what questions to ask about the firm.
Have a question about retirement? Personal finances? Anything career-related? Click here to drop Kerry Hannon a note.
End your interview by saying a version of, “Thank you for considering me for the job. I look forward to hearing from you.” Smile, and continue eyeing the camera until the interview disconnects.
Then send a thoughtfully worded thank-you note to the hiring manager or recruiter who set it up.
“We receive the exact notes from thousands of candidates,” Jones said. “They're all identical, carbon copies. Make your note unique, make it stand out. Refer to specific things you talked about. It’s an extension of the interview itself. If you send an AI written note that they've received before, you risk being immediately declined from that pipeline.”

(NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the AI Stocks Hit with New Analyst Ratings. On August 26, Truist Securities analyst William Stein upgraded the stock from Hold to Buy with a price target of $213.00 (from $173.00).
The rating upgrade reflects the booming demand from data centers and the accelerated momentum in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. According to Stein, hyperscalers are increasingly considering AMD as a genuine partner instead of considering it as merely a “price check” against rival Nvidia.
The company is no longer a secondary player in the AI hardware race, noted Stein, anticipating that it will secure close to 10% of GPU market share overtime.
Stein has also increased his earnings per share (EPS) estimates, now anticipating a calendar year 2027 EPS of $7.89. Moreover, the company’s newly launched MI355 chip is likely to be a key driver of growth in the coming quarters.
“Constructive view from the field. For the last several years, our industry contacts (component buyers/sellers) have told us that hyperscale customers deploying AI were experimenting with AMD’s technology as a “price check” to NVDA (Buy), nothing more. Over the last month or so, contacts have increasingly noted that hyperscalers are working with AMD in a partnership manner, expressing true interest in deploying AMD at scale. We fine tune our model, establish CY27 EPS at $7.89, set our PT to $213 (up fr. $173), and upgrade to Buy.”
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) develops and sells semiconductors, processors, and GPUs for data centers, gaming, AI, and embedded applications.
While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Government Stake Deal,2025-08-30 15:00:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of the AI Stocks Hit with New Analyst Ratings. On August 25, TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter reiterated a Hold rating on the stock with a $20.00 price target following the announcement that the US government is taking a stake in the chipmaker.
According to the firm, the finalized agreement with the Trump administration on previously signed CHIPS Act and Secure Enclave funding is seen to be positive. This is because the company seems to be in a favorable political position now.
However, the firm pointed out that Intel isn’t receiving any meaningful net new capital, and that the company’s issues are technical and competitive. These issues aren’t such that funding alone can resolve them.
It also believes it is difficult to be confident about Intel’s future both in the short and long-term. The challenges weighing in on the company are going to take their due time to resolve, and solid proof such as earnings or cash flow will take time to show up.
“Net, it remains difficult for us to gain confidence in the immediate and long-term path forward. Roadmaps and customer confidence are not (re)built overnight, and the strategy seems very much in flux. That said, Intel’s market breadth and extensive intellectual property assets across compute, combined with now more closely aligned incentives with the White House, cannot be fully counted out yet, and there are likely ways to monetize its collection of assets for shareholders. We think the near-term and long-term overhangs on the narrative will likely be an overhang until more tangible metrics (e.g., earnings, FCF) begin to inflect to support valuation…which we think remains a long ways away.”
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) designs and sells computing hardware, semiconductor products, and AI-driven solutions for various industries.

Here's Which Dividend King Is Still Flying Under the Radar.
Key Points
-
Consumer staples companies make things that people need and buy regularly.
-
Many consumer staples makers have been so reliable as businesses that they have achieved Dividend King status.
-
Diversified consumer staples giant PepsiCo has a historically high yield today as investors pass it by for better-performing stocks.
The Motley Fool just updated its report on the 10 largest consumer staple companies. You probably know every name on the list, which includes retail giants like Walmart (NYSE: WMT), product makers like Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), and tobacco companies like Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM). Also on that list is a Dividend King food and beverage company that has a historically high yield. Here's why it could be the best opportunity for investors today.
What does PepsiCo do?
To get right to the crux of the topic, PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) is the company in question. It sits at No. 7 on the list of the largest consumer staple companies, with a market cap of around $200 billion. It is one of three beverage makers on the list, the other two being Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) at No. 4 and Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE: BUD) at No. 10.
Unlike those other two, however, PepsiCo's business extends well beyond beverages. It also has leading positions in the salty snack (Frito-Lay) and packaged food (Quaker Oats) segments of the sector. It is one of the most diversified companies on the top-10 list. Only Unilever (NYSE: UL), which makes household products and food, has a similar degree of diversification.
PepsiCo, meanwhile, stands toe to toe with every company on the list with regard to name recognition. For more direct peers, those that manage brands and are not retailers, it can compete equally on distribution, marketing, and product development. And, like all the other names on the list, PepsiCo is large enough to act as an industry consolidator, buying smaller companies to round out its brand portfolio and keep up with consumers' buying habits.
The proof of the business's strength and resilience is best highlighted by the fact that PepsiCo is a Dividend King. It has increased its dividend annually for 53 consecutive years, which is not something a company can achieve if it doesn't have a strong business model that gets executed well in both good times and bad. For reference, other Dividend Kings on the list include Walmart, Coca-Cola, and Procter & Gamble.
This is not a good time for PepsiCo
Among the sub-grouping of large consumer staples companies that are also Dividend Kings, PepsiCo has been the laggard in recent years. To put a number on that, PepsiCo's 2.1% organic sales growth in the second quarter was less than half the 5% growth of Coca-Cola, its closest peer. No wonder PepsiCo's stock is down more than 20% from its 2023 highs, the worst result from the Dividend Kings grouping. That also puts PepsiCo into its own personal bear market.",942b2da04d169ca7f38a209b6d2661f4,trafilatura

The company develops and supports software, services, devices and solutions. With a market cap of $3.8 trillion, Microsoft offers applications, extra cloud storage, and advanced security solutions serving customers worldwide.
Companies worth $200 billion or more are generally described as “mega-cap stocks,” and MSFT definitely fits that description, with its market cap exceeding this threshold, reflecting its substantial size, influence, and dominance within the software - infrastructure industry. The tech giant has made significant progress in the rapidly expanding generative AI industry, seamlessly incorporating it into its search engine and various productivity tools.
More News from Barchart
Despite its notable strength, MSFT slipped 8.2% from its 52-week high of $555.45, achieved on Jul. 31. Over the past three months, MSFT stock has gained 11.4%, outperforming the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) 10.4% gains during the same time frame.
In the longer term, MSFT shares rose 20.9% on a YTD basis and 24.1% over the past 52 weeks, outperforming the SPX’s 10.6% surge in 2025 and 16.3% returns over the past year.
To confirm the bullish trend, Microsoft has been trading above its 50-day moving average since late April, with slight fluctuations. The stock is trading above its 200-day moving average since early May.
Microsoft's partnership with Shopify and impressive performance in the AI space have driven its outperformance in the market. The integration of Shopify's Checkout Kit into Microsoft's Copilot platform has enhanced user shopping experiences. MSFT’s strong focus on AI, cloud infrastructure expansion, and Office 365 Commercial demand has fueled growth in revenue and ARPU. The company's success in Azure, AI, and Copilot platforms showcases its dominance in the fast-growing cloud and AI markets. With Azure surpassing $75 billion in annual revenue and reaching 100 million monthly active users for its AI assistants, Microsoft's position as a leader in the AI transformation is evident. The company's accelerating growth, expanding margins, and leadership in the AI revolution point to a compelling investment opportunity for the future.",d6c1d5ae37fcbe8a9196a6d493cce1b2,trafilatura

That's not unreasonable to believe, but in true lemming fashion, investors are flocking into stocks that they believe will be AI winners. But it is still early days for the technology, so it is hard to predict which companies are best positioned to benefit.
Except, there is one group of companies that will definitely see demand increase. And one company in that group is better positioned than any other to take advantage: Dominion Energy(NYSE: D). Here's what you need to know.
The problem with artificial intelligence
Aside from AI's ability to replace human employees, the big problem with AI right now is that the technology is still evolving. It is developing quickly, for sure, but there's no way to really know how best to use it. Or which companies will have the best AI technology to offer the world.
If you want to understand the risk, look no further than Yahoo! It was the leading internet search company until Alphabet's Google search service came around. Nvidia is an AI icon today, but it may not always be the industry's big winner. In other words, the early winners in AI could still end up being long-term losers. And bad investments, if you buy them.
But there's something that is very clear about this new technology. It runs on computers, often housed in massive data centers, and computers need electricity to operate. AI, along with other electricity-dependent technology, is expected to lead to a step change in electricity demand.
To put some numbers on that, U.S. electricity demand from AI alone is projected to increase 300% over roughly a decade. And the overall growth in electricity demand is expected to increase from 9% between 2000 and 2020 to 55% between 2020 and 2040. That's not a step change in demand in the utility sector, it is a leap change!
Dominion Energy is better positioned than any other utility
As the AI tsunami washes over the world, there's one region that is going to benefit disproportionately. That region is Virginia. You might not have guessed that, but Virginia is one of the largest data center markets in the world. AI ""lives"" in data centers. Dominion Energy operates a regulated electric utility in Virginia, giving it a monopoly on serving the power needs of these data centers.
How big an opportunity is this for Dominion Energy? Well, in the second half of 2024 demand from data centers grew 88%. There's a problem with that number, though. Dominion can't just send out 88% more power, especially given that most of the data centers are going to be new buildings. It has to build generating capacity and construct the power lines needed to get that power from where it is generated to where it is going to be consumed.
That process takes time. And it requires Dominion to work with its regulators on the rates it charges and more importantly, on its capital investment plans. Slow and steady growth is the likely outcome, but AI demand suggests that growth is going to be less slow in the future than it has been in the past. Dominion isn't going to turn from an income stock into a growth stock, but it could become an attractive growth and income stock.
The most exciting part of Dominion's story, however, is that it is out of favor on Wall Street right now. The average utility has a dividend yield of around 2.7%. Dominion Energy's yield is 4.4%. Okay, a dividend cut and zero near-term dividend growth is part of the story, here, too. But management has slimmed down the business to where it is basically just a plain vanilla, regulated electric utility. There's a reason why the stock is unloved, but there's also a reason to expect the future to be better than the past since there's now a strong business foundation in place.
Dominion's super charged opportunity
Essentially, Dominion Energy is a low-risk turnaround story in the utility sector. But its turnaround story has a hidden booster rocket in the form of AI, given the company's well-located Virginia operations. If you prefer to think long term while other investors are focused on the short-term profits they expect from AI stocks, you might be better off buying Dominion.
Yes, Nvidia's shares are up 50% in just six months, compared to Dominion's 6%. But how long can Nvidia keep up its stellar performance and at what point is too much good news priced into the stock? The hype is real and it could be distorting the way Wall Street sees AI companies like Nvidia.
Dominion, in comparison, is an anti-hype stock. But if you buy Dominion, you can collect a fat dividend while the business benefits from the AI revolution, helping the utility get its business back on a steady growth path.
Should you invest $1,000 in Dominion Energy right now?

See which banks are currently paying the highest CD rates. If you’re looking for a secure place to store your savings, a certificate of deposit (CD) may be a great choice. These accounts often provide higher interest rates than traditional checking and savings accounts. However, CD rates can vary widely. Learn more about CD rates today and where to find high-yield CDs with the best rates available.
Banks with the best CD rates right now
Today’s CD rates vary quite a bit. In general, however, CD rates are beginning to decline due to the Fed’s decision to cut its benchmark rate three times in the later part of 2024. Even so, some banks are still offering competitive CD rates.
For those that are, top rates reach about 4% APY. This is especially true for shorter terms of one year or less.
Today, the highest CD rate is 4.45% APY. This rate is offered by LendingClub on its 8-month CD.
Here is a look at some of the best CD rates available today from our verified partners:
This embedded content is not available in your region.
Compare these rates to the national average as of August 2025 (the most recent data available from the FDIC):
Compared with today’s top CD rates, national averages are much lower. This highlights the importance of shopping around for the best CD rates before opening an account.
Why do online banks have the best CD rates?
Online banks and neobanks are financial institutions that operate solely via the web. That means they have lower overhead costs than traditional brick and mortar banks. As a result, they’re able to pass those savings on to their customers in the form of higher interest rates on deposit accounts (including CDs) and lower fees. If you’re looking for the best CD rates available today, an online bank is a great place to start.
However, online banks aren’t the only financial institutions offering competitive CD rates. It’s also worth checking with credit unions. As not-for-profit financial cooperatives, credit unions return their profits to customers, who are also member-owners. Although many credit unions have strict membership requirements that are limited to those who belong to certain associations or work or live in certain areas, there are also several credit unions that just about anyone can join.
Should you open a CD?
Whether or not you should put your money in a CD depends on your savings goals. CDs are considered a safe and stable savings vehicle — they don’t lose money (in most cases), are backed by federal insurance, and allow you to lock in today’s best rates.
However, there are some drawbacks to consider. First, you must keep your money on deposit for the full term, otherwise you’ll be subject to an early withdrawal penalty. If you want flexible access to your funds, a high-yield savings account or money market account might be a better choice.
Additionally, although today’s CD rates are high by historical standards, they don’t match the returns you could achieve by investing your money in the market. If you’re saving for a long-term goal such as retirement, a CD won’t provide the growth you need to reach your savings goal within a reasonable time frame.

Both trusts were incorporated as Delaware Statutory Trusts on August 12, 2025, following Grayscale’s established pattern of Delaware registrations preceding SEC submissions.
Altcoin ETF Race Heats Up as Approval Odds Surge
The Cardano ETF would trade on NYSE Arca under ticker GADA, while specific exchange details for the Polkadot fund remain pending final approval.
The filings arrive as prediction markets surge with optimism for the approval of altcoin ETFs.
Solana maintains a 99% approval odds on Polymarket for 2025, up from 72% in May, while XRP holds an 87% probability, up from 64% in August.

Even speculative memecoin Dogecoin commands 82% approval odds, nearly doubling from 44% in June.
Grayscale’s aggressive expansion strategy includes converting five existing trusts into ETF structures, covering Litecoin, Solana, Dogecoin, XRP, and Avalanche.
The firm simultaneously filed for Dogecoin ETF approval with ticker GDOG, entering competition with Rex-Osprey and Bitwise for similar products.
Current crypto ETF applications encompass eight Solana proposals and seven XRP submissions, driven by renewed filing activity following the SEC’s feedback.
Grayscale Fund Structured to Anticipate Regulatory Uncertainties
Both Grayscale ETF proposals acknowledge significant regulatory risks, particularly the SEC’s previous determination that ADA constitutes a security.
The Cardano filing warns that a final SEC security classification could trigger material adverse impacts on token value and potentially force the termination of the trust.
The trusts operate through cash-only creation and redemption mechanisms, processing shares in 10,000-unit baskets through authorized participants and liquidity providers.
In-kind transactions involving direct token deposits remain unavailable pending “In-Kind Regulatory Approval” that may never materialize.
Notably, valuation relies on CoinDesk price indices, which are calculated daily at 4:00 PM New York time.
Both funds maintain staking capabilities contingent on undefined “Staking Conditions” that currently remain unmet.
The Polkadot trust anticipates staking up to 85% of holdings through provider-facilitated arrangements, while maintaining 28-day unbonding periods that introduce liquidity constraints.",f8f5c3ac36aef385257637dc37e73f76,trafilatura

(Reuters) -The United States is making it more difficult for chipmakers Samsung and SK Hynix to produce chips in China by revoking authorizations that allowed the companies to receive American semiconductor manufacturing equipment there, according to the Federal Register.
The U.S. Commerce Department had given the companies exemptions to sweeping restrictions created in 2022 on the sale of U.S. semiconductor equipment to China.
The companies will now need to obtain licenses to buy the equipment for China. The federal filing also included Intel among the companies that lost their authorization for China, although Intel sold its Dalian, China, unit in a deal that was finalized this year.
The revocations will take effect in 120 days, according to the posting.
The Commerce Department said in a statement that the United States plans to grant license applications to allow the companies to operate their existing facilities in China, but does not intend to grant licenses to expand capacity or upgrade technology.
SK Hynix said in a statement that it ""will maintain close communication with both Korean and the U.S. governments and take necessary measures to minimize the impact on our business.""
Samsung did not respond to a request for comment.
South Korea's government has explained to the Commerce Department ""the importance of a stable operation of our semiconductor companies in China for the stability of the global semiconductor supply chain,"" the industry ministry said.
Seoul will continue discussions with Washington to minimize the impact on South Korean companies, the ministry said.
A spokesperson for China's commerce ministry said Beijing ""opposes the U.S. move"" and ""will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises.""
The licensing change will likely reduce sales to China by U.S. equipment makers KLA Corp, Lam Research and Applied Materials. The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Shares of Lam fell 4.4%, Applied Materials dropped 2.9% and KLA shares were down 2.8%.
CHINESE MAKERS, MICRON MAY BENEFIT
In June, when the U.S. Commerce Department raised the possibility of revoking the authorizations, a White House official said the United States was ""just laying the groundwork"" in case the truce in trade talks between the two countries fell apart.
In July, the two allies and major trading partners announced a deal on tariffs, but South Korean President Lee Jae Myung came away from a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump this week without finalizing the agreement in writing.",1fc6fc5183140cbb5a5b464a33a49343,trafilatura

McGeough, who joined HSBC in 2021, is leaving to ""pursue new opportunities"", the lender disclosed in a regulatory filing on Friday. Her appointment in January was part of a raft of leadership changes by CEO Georges Elhedery.
The transition comes at a pivotal time for HSBC, which has reshaped its U.S. footprint in recent years. The U.S. ""remains a critical market within HSBC's international network and central to its growth strategy"", it said in a statement.
HSBC exited most of its consumer operations in the country in 2021, selling parts of the retail banking business to Citizens Financial and Cathay General Bancorp.
The lender also shuttered its business banking portfolio in the U.S. in May to simplify operations. London-based HSBC is Europe's biggest bank by assets.
Henderson most recently served as deputy U.S. head of banking and will continue those duties while taking on the interim role. He will report to Michael Roberts, CEO of corporate and institutional banking, effective immediately.
Henderson has spent nearly two decades at HSBC, according to his LinkedIn profile, holding executive roles in the U.S. and Canada. Before that, he was at RBC Capital Markets for about 13 years.

(TSLA) is the leading electric vehicle manufacturer in the United States, holding about 70% of the EV market with its flagship Model 3 as the top-selling model. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, Tesla operates globally, combining direct sales, servicing, and charging to differentiate itself from traditional automakers.
Companies worth more than $200 billion are generally labeled as “mega-cap” stocks and Tesla fits this criterion perfectly. Beyond automobiles, the company has expanded into energy generation and storage, positioning itself as a clean energy innovator.
More News from Barchart
Despite this, shares of Tesla have declined 29.2% from its 52-week high of $488.54. The stock has dipped 3.6% over the past three months, underperforming the Nasdaq Composite’s ($NASX) 13.6% increase over the same time frame.
In the longer term, TSLA stock is down 14.4% on a YTD basis, lagging behind NASX’s 12.4% gain. Moreover, shares of the company have surged over 68% over the past 52 weeks, compared to NASX’s 23.6% return over the same time frame.
TSLA stock has been trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving average since early August.
Tesla shares tumbled 8.2% following its Q2 2025 results on Jul. 23 as investors focused on narrowing margins and weak forward signals despite revenue of $22.5 billion slightly beating forecasts and EPS of $0.40 meeting expectations. Automotive gross margin excluding regulatory credits dropped to 14.6%, below expectations, reflecting steep price cuts, restructuring charges, and rising AI-driven expenses.
In contrast, rival General Motors Company (GM) has outpaced TSLA stock on a YTD basis, rising 9.6%. However, GM stock has gained 19.1% over the past 52 weeks, lagging behind TSLA.
Due to the stock’s underperformance, analysts remain cautious on Tesla. The stock has a consensus rating of “Hold” from 42 analysts in coverage, and as of writing, TSLA stock is trading above the mean price target of $299.28.

""Ryanair Holdings plc (NASDAQ:RYAAY), the European budget airline, was up 29.0%. It released full year results. The same theme continues - with its low cost position strengthening, but its expansion being hindered by Boeing delivery delays. Interestingly, management has revealed plans to open two engine maintenance facilities at a likely cost of USD 600m. We expect its reasoning is to control this critical business function. By doing so, it will no longer be privy to the third party service agents (perhaps its recent experience with Boeing was a catalyst). Ryanair is also buying back shares, management proposed a 20% dividend increase, and its foreign ownership restrictions were lifted. This led to MSCI inclusion in the end of May, which was likely a contributing factor to the strong share price performance. Ryanair has grown to be the Fund’s largest position (7.9%). We’re comfortable with this. As we updated our analysis, our estimate of maintainable owners earnings increased as did our valuation, and it trades at a slightly lower price than that conservative valuation.""

Find Out: Warren Buffett: 10 Things Poor People Waste Money On
GOBankingRates asked ChatGPT what the effect of rising interest rates has on the money you put into your savings, and here’s what it said.
Also see how to calculate interest in a savings account.
Your Savings Account Will Benefit
According to ChatGPT, if your money is in high-yield savings accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs) or money market accounts, your savings will increase.
As the federal interest rate rises, banks raise their interest rates they pay customers to deposit cash. You will earn more money on top of your money in savings without having to do anything. Right now, a high-yield savings account can earn you over 4% interest, which is a good return and could even increase as federal rates rise. At 4%, if you save $10,000 in a year, you’ll earn an extra $400.
Check Out: 3 Best Ways to Prioritize Your Savings Goals
Pay Attention to Credit Card Rates
If you carry credit card debt, you might see interest rates or required minimum payments go up. That’s why it’s important to prioritize paying off this debt as fast as you can, so you’re not stuck paying an ever increasing amount.
It may be good to pay off the credit card with the highest interest rate first and then go in descending order from there.
Keep an Eye on Your Investments
The good thing about having money in savings is that it’s a sure thing. If you don’t spend what’s in the account, it will still be there in a few months. With interest, you’ll probably even have a little more than you started with. On the flip side, there is more risk investing money in stocks.
While investing is still a good bet over the long term, when interest rates are higher, things like high-yield savings accounts can be another attractive option.

The company's shares are up over 1,500% in the past 12 months through Aug. 27.
Rigetti and other businesses in the sector are developing technology with the potential to transform industries, including medicine and artificial intelligence. Because quantum computers are powered by atomic particles, they boast computational capabilities beyond the reach of current classical computers.
However, they also have shortcomings that hinder their widespread adoption. One key drawback is that errors creep into quantum computations due to the extreme difficulty of isolating and controlling quantum states. While quantum computing is inherently probabilistic (which is actually useful for many algorithms that rely on randomness), the real challenge is that environmental noise and imperfect controls corrupt these probabilities. Finding and correcting these errors -- distinguishing between intended quantum randomness and unwanted noise -- is one of the field's key issues.
Can Rigetti's tech overcome such challenges? Discovering the answer requires diving into the company in more detail.

Rigetti's technology employs superconducting qubits, a widely used approach to quantum computing due to its advantages. This method performs faster than other quantum techniques and leverages existing semiconductor chip fabrication processes, which helps to scale up the technology.
In recent weeks, Rigetti unveiled its latest invention, the Cepheus-1-36Q. This multi-chip quantum machine is the largest in the industry, according to the company. Moreover, the device's calculation error rate is half that of its predecessor.
The Cepheus-1-36Q shows Rigetti is making progress toward overcoming the issues inherent in quantum computers. Despite that, the company isn't growing sales this year. In the second quarter, Rigetti generated $1.8 million in revenue, which was down from $3.1 million in 2024.
A look into Rigetti's financials
While the company has struggled to produce revenue, its costs are climbing. Rigetti's Q2 cost of revenue and operating expenses both ticked up from 2024, resulting in an operating loss of $19.9 million versus a loss of $16.1 million in the previous year.
The costly combination of rising expenses and declining sales is cause for concern. Rigetti's saving grace is that it amassed an impressive $571.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale investments with no debt on its balance sheet. The funds can sustain operations in the short term as the company builds up income.
The quest to increase sales relies on how quickly Rigetti's tech can achieve quantum advantage. This is the point at which a quantum device can solve useful, real-world problems more effectively than classical computers.
According to CEO Dr. Subodh Kulkarni, Rigetti is about four years away from achieving quantum advantage. In the meantime, it's cobbling revenue together from organizations interested in quantum computing for research and experimentation, such as its collaboration with Montana State University announced on Aug. 20.
Factors to consider before deciding on Rigetti stock
At this early stage in quantum computing's development, Rigetti's future depends on reaching quantum advantage as fast as possible. Once there, it can unlock more sales as its technology becomes a superior alternative to classical supercomputers.
Can Rigetti achieve this goal in four years? Its shares are trading as if that's likely.
Here's a look at the stock's valuation using the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, and contrasting it to other pure-play quantum computing competitors IonQ and D-Wave Quantum. This metric measures how much investors are willing to pay for every dollar of revenue generated over the trailing 12 months.
Rigetti's P/S multiple is sky-high compared to its rivals, indicating that shares are expensive. Perhaps investors are betting the company can achieve quantum advantage.
But a lot can happen in four years, and if Rigetti continues to burn through cash with little revenue trickling in, the business may not survive to achieve its goal.
In addition, many well-heeled competitors, including Alphabet-owned Google, are actively pursuing quantum advantage. Google has already developed a quantum chip capable of completing a complex computation in five minutes that would take centuries with today's fastest supercomputers. Granted, this algorithm is a benchmark designed to be easy for quantum computers and hard for digital system, but it's still an impressive achievement.
Although it's too early to tell which business will deliver the dominant technology, one or more of these rivals could build a scalable quantum computer that overcomes the obstacles to broad adoption. This competition impacts Rigetti's ability to attract customers, as evidenced by its difficulties with revenue growth.
Consequently, only investors with a high risk tolerance should consider buying Rigetti shares. Even then, given its stock's inflated valuation, the ideal approach is to wait for the share price to drop before deciding to invest.

The company's shares are up over 1,500% in the past 12 months through Aug. 27.
Rigetti and other businesses in the sector are developing technology with the potential to transform industries, including medicine and artificial intelligence. Because quantum computers are powered by atomic particles, they boast computational capabilities beyond the reach of current classical computers.
However, they also have shortcomings that hinder their widespread adoption. One key drawback is that errors creep into quantum computations due to the extreme difficulty of isolating and controlling quantum states. While quantum computing is inherently probabilistic (which is actually useful for many algorithms that rely on randomness), the real challenge is that environmental noise and imperfect controls corrupt these probabilities. Finding and correcting these errors -- distinguishing between intended quantum randomness and unwanted noise -- is one of the field's key issues.

The 7-4 ruling, issued by 11 judges for the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., allows the tariffs to remain in place while the administration decides on an appeal to the US Supreme Court.
The decision upholds a ruling handed down in May by the US Court of International Trade (CIT), saying that the president lacked legal authority to order, by way of executive orders, a series of global tariffs imposed on US trading partners.
""We affirm the CIT’s holding that the trafficking and reciprocal tariffs imposed by the challenged executive orders exceed the authority delegated to the President,"" the majority held in the ruling. ""We also affirm the CIT’s grant of declaratory relief that the orders are 'invalid as contrary to law.'""
At the center of the dispute is the scope of a national security-based law enacted in 1977 known as “IEEPA” — the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The law authorizes the president to “regulate” international commerce after declaring a national emergency.
""In response to these declared emergencies, the President has departed from the established tariff schedules and imposed varying tariffs of unlimited duration on imports of nearly all goods from nearly every country with which the United States conducts trade,"" the court said in its ruling.
In a post to his social media website Truth Social, the president said, ""a Highly Partisan Appeals Court incorrectly said that our Tariffs should be removed, but they know the United States of America will win in the end. If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country.""
The court emphasized that under the US Constitution, Congress is empowered to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises and to regulate commerce with foreign nations.
""Tariffs are a tax, and the framers of the Constitution expressly contemplated the exclusive grant of taxing power to the legislative branch,"" the ruling said.
The court was tasked with deciding if IEEPA is among a handful of rare exceptions that extend limited taxing power to the president, a power otherwise exclusive to Congress.
Trump cited IEEPA when he declared two national emergencies — illegal immigration and flows of illegal drugs from overseas — as bases for the tariff orders.
Trump’s Justice Department Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate argued in July before the appeals court that IEEPA could not limit president's method of regulation, once the president declared an emergency. Congress would have understood that when it wrote the law, Shumate said, and Congress can step in to overrule the president's tariffs.
Brian Simmonds Marshall, a lawyer for one of 12 states that joined the importers in their challenge opposing the tariffs, argued that the term ""regulate"" was meant to permit the president to order quotas that limit the number of imported goods — and potentially order import licensing requirements and fees.
“IEEPA doesn't even say ‘tariffs.’ It doesn't even mention it,” one judge said during the hearing in May.
“What does ‘regulation of importation’ mean?” another judge asked. And “If ‘regulate’ doesn’t cover tariffs, what does it cover?”
The appeals panel that issued Friday's decision was composed of seven judges appointed by former Democratic presidents and four appointed by Republican presidents.
Trump tariffs versus Nixon tariffs
The judges looked to a Nixon-era lawsuit that addressed IEEPA’s predecessor law, known as the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA), which Trump's team cited as proof that the president’s global tariffs should be allowed to stand in court.
Roughly five decades ago, President Nixon unilaterally imposed 10% duties on imports as part of a set of economic measures dubbed the ""Nixon shock."" Those tariffs were challenged in court in much the same way as Trump's 2025 tariffs have been.
A Japanese zipper-making business called Yoshida International sued, saying Nixon lacked the power to set the tariff under three different laws that the government cited as justification: the Tariff Act, the Trade Expansion Act, and the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA).
The most controversial justification was the TWEA.
A US Customs Court initially sided with the zipper importer, holding that none of the three laws offered adequate authority for the duty. Yet on appeal, Nixon's tariffs were upheld.
The court that upheld the Nixon tariffs reasoned that ""neither need nor national emergency"" justified the levies because Congress had not delegated such power and because the authority was ""not inherent"" in his office. However, the court said, TWEA carved out enough power to regulate importation during an economic emergency.
One of the appeals court judges hearing the Trump case referenced the 1970s case and said, “It seems pretty clear to me that Yoshida is telling us that ‘No, the president doesn't have the authority to rewrite the Tariff Schedule.’ In this case, that's what the president is trying to do.”
A lawyer for the challengers to Trump’s duties argued that by adopting IEEPA in 1977, Congress ratified the high court’s holding in Yoshida, which he said allowed the president to impose “modest, bounded, temporary tariffs,” but did not sanction unbounded, permanent duties.
During the arguments before the appeals panel, the lawyers also sparred over whether the president’s declared national emergency met IEEPA’s requirements of ""unusual"" and ""extraordinary.""
One judge agreed the president did meet these requirements by identifying underlying causes contributing to the threat, including trade deficits, tariff barriers, domestic production shortfalls, and a lack of reciprocity in US trading relationships.
“How does that not constitute what the president is expressly saying is an extraordinary threat?” the judge asked the challengers.
Another judge countered, “How can a trade deficit be an extraordinary and unusual threat when we've had trade deficits for decades?”
Lawyers for the administration argued that the deficit becomes extraordinary and unusual once it reaches a point where it threatens the resources that are foundational to US national security.
Other cases involving challenges to the IEEPA-based tariffs have been filed in multiple jurisdictions.
In a case set for arguments in the US Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in September, two private, family-owned American toy companies, Learning Resources, Inc., and hand2mind, Inc., allege that IEEPA neither authorizes the president to impose tariffs nor authorizes the particular challenged tariffs. The companies also allege that the tariffs violate the Administrative Procedure Act.
A district court ruled in favor of the toy companies, which import goods from China, Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, and India.
In a rare legal filing, the toy companies asked the high court to grant certiorari before an anticipated judgment from the US Appeals Court for the DC Circuit.
“Whether the President has authority to impose tariffs … is of such imperative importance that it warrants review now,” the toy companies said. However, the high court declined to take up the case.

Powered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above.
Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. this week said it’s buying coffeemaker JDE Peet’s NV and funding the deal with a €16.2 billion ($19.0 billion) bridge loan. AT&T Inc. said on Tuesday it’s buying spectrum licenses from EchoStar Corp. for about $23 billion, a move that will probably be at least partly funded with bonds.
Companies have broadly been lifting their debt loads relative to earnings, with that leverage ratio in the second quarter close to its highest level since 2021. Corporations’ willingness to lever up represents a shift in their thinking.
As the Federal Reserve started raising rates in 2022 and debt became more expensive, many companies sought to cut their borrowings. AT&T’s debt load steadily declined through the first quarter of 2025, for example.
But the Fed is moving closer to a renewed round of rate cutting, potentially lowering the cost of borrowing. The Trump administration is seen as more likely to grant regulatory approval for corporate tie-ups. Executives are gaining more confidence that the stock market volatility has ebbed, while questions about corporate tax rates have been clarified. All of that has improved the conditions to make acquisitions.
“We had a tremendous amount of uncertainty in the first part of the year,” said Hans Mikkelsen, a credit strategist at TD Securities. With some of it resolved, he said, “that’s really what’s unleashing all this M&A.”
For much of this year, credit markets have been starved of acquisition financings, debt sales that not only provide fresh supply but also often include long-dated bonds. Money managers are eager to buy longer-term securities in a world of historically elevated yields that may soon decline. This year, M&A-related financings account for around 10% of high-grade debt sales, compared with 15% in 2019, according to JPMorgan.
Syndicate professionals expect many of the recently announced deals to make their way to the debt markets later this year or in 2026, since companies typically wait until their acquisitions close to refinance bridge loans with permanent financing. Keurig Dr Pepper’s tie-up is expected to close in the first half of next year, while AT&T said it expects to finalize its transaction in mid-2026.
It’s possible, however, that some firms choose to sell debt before completing their deals, especially if credit spreads stay tight and borrowing costs fall further. The companies could include a condition known as special mandatory redemption language, which would let them buy the bonds back at a small premium if their acquisition doesn’t go through.
“Particularly if we see a gap lower in rates, there’ll be more incentive for those companies to de-risk the debt component of those acquisition financings,” said Ryan Morrell, co-head of investment grade debt capital markets at PNC Financial Services Group Inc.
Either way, more debt-fueled acquisitions are probably coming at high-grade companies, teeing up a busy 2026.
“Now a few months after that fear episode in April, we are getting a restart of animal spirits,” said Piers Ronan, co-head of debt capital markets and syndicate at Truist Securities. “That, I’m sure, will continue into 2026 and hopefully beyond.”

A majority of young Americans are counting on family wealth to shape their future, according to a new survey by insurance agency Choice Mutual that digs into expectations around inheritance.
Roughly two-thirds of Americans between the ages of 18 and 43 either expect to receive or have already received an inheritance from their parents. On average, they believe they'll inherit about $334,850.
Most Say They'll Save Or Invest The Money
“The Great Wealth Transfer is surely on its way,” said Choice Mutual CEO Anthony Martin. But what stood out most was how younger generations are planning for the money long before it arrives.

Among those expecting an inheritance, 73% said they plan to put the money into savings, while 57% said they would invest it. Others plan to use it for housing costs, debt repayment, or saving for their own children.
More than seven in 10 expect to inherit cash, and 69% believe real estate will be part of the package. Investment accounts, property, and business ownership stakes were also mentioned.
“This is not just wishful thinking,” the study notes. “Sixty-one percent of those surveyed have had a direct conversation with their parents about an expected inheritance or have seen a will or trust.”
Still, the optimism has limits. More than half – 53% – said they expect to be financially burdened by supporting their aging parents. About one in two said they already have or plan to support their parents financially.

This financial stress is already shaping their lives. 60% said they feel anxious about future support responsibilities, and 52% said it's already impacting their financial plans.
About one-third of those surveyed even admitted they resent their parents for not being in a stronger financial position.
In some cases, the anticipation of inheritance is influencing how people live now. One in 10 said they carry more debt than they otherwise would, assuming they'll use the inheritance to pay it off. Around 9% feel less pressure to save or earn money, and about one in six said just knowing the money is coming makes life less stressful.

The transaction, aimed to split the company into two separate units focusing on grocery and sauces, respectively, could be finalized and announced as early as next week, the report said.
In July, the company was studying a potential spinoff of a large chunk of its grocery business, including many Kraft products, into a new entity that could be valued at as much as $20 billion on its own. Later that month, it said that it was ""working with urgency"" to evaluate strategic options for some of its brands.
Kraft Heinz is betting that two separate units would worth, in total, more than the company's roughly $33 billion market value, the report added, noting that plans and timing could still change at the last minute.
The split would leave the company with products such as its namesake Heinz ketchup and Dijon mustard brand Grey Poupon, according to the Journal.
Kraft Heinz did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The company was formed in 2015 after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital combined the former Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz, which they bought in 2013. Berkshire Hathaway left Kraft's board in May.
The Heinz ketchup maker, in late July, reported a quarterly results beat, helped by resilient demand for its pantry staples and condiments in the United States.
Shares of the company were up 2% in afternoon trading.

Known for disciplined capital allocation and industry-leading returns, the company maintains a strong dividend record and credit profile.
Companies valued at $200 billion or more are generally considered “mega-cap” stocks, and Exxon Mobil fits this criterion perfectly. Its operations span traditional energy, petrochemicals, and emerging lower-emission opportunities, positioning it as a bellwether in the sector.

However, shares of Exxon Mobil have dipped 9.5% from its 52-week high of $126.34. Over the past three months, shares of XOM have risen 11.4%, which outpaced the First Trust Nasdaq Oil & Gas ETF's (FTXN) return of 10.3% during the same period.
In the longer term, XOM stock has gained 6.3% on a YTD basis, outperforming FTXN’s 1.2% increase. Moreover, shares of the company have dipped 1.8% over the past 52 weeks, a less pronounced decline than FTXN’s 3.7% decrease over the same time frame.
ExxonMobil’s stock has recently moved above both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.
Despite reporting better-than-expected Q2 2025 EPS of $1.64, shares of XOM fell 1.8% the next day as revenue of $81.5 billion came in below expectations, reflecting weaker oil prices. Earnings from oil and gas production fell to $5.4 billion, highlighting margin pressure despite record quarterly production of 4.6 million boepd.
In comparison with its rival, Chevron Corporation (CVX) stock has outperformed XOM stock. CVX stock has increased 10.7% on a YTD basis and 9.8% over the past 52 weeks.
Despite the stock’s underperformance relative to its industry peers, analysts are moderately optimistic about its prospects. XOM stock has a consensus rating of “Moderate Buy” from the 26 analysts covering the stock, and the mean price target of $168.88 is a premium of 47.6% to current levels.

The decline reflects deteriorating policy conditions following the 2024 elections, with developers rushing to lock in tax credits before year-end.
Plug Power operates in the hydrogen ecosystem, which depends heavily on government subsidies and renewable energy adoption for economic viability. The company has struggled with profitability and cash flow generation, making it vulnerable to policy shifts that could reduce demand for hydrogen infrastructure and fuel cell systems.

However, worldwide renewable investment hit a record $386 billion in the first half, up 10% year-over-year (YoY). Europe saw a 63% surge in investment as capital reallocated away from the U.S. market, while China maintained its dominant 44% global share.
Is Plug Power Stock a Good Buy Right Now?
Plug Power reported mixed results in the second quarter. It reported revenue of $174 million, a 21% increase YoY, as electrolyzer sales more than tripled to $45 million. However, the company remains unprofitable with negative gross margins of 31%, down from -92% in the year-ago period.
The hydrogen fuel cell company's fortunes received a boost from recent federal legislation extending key tax credits. The 48E investment tax credit offers a clean 30% credit for fuel cell property through 2032, with no complex requirements. Moreover, the 45V production tax credit for clean hydrogen extends through 2027.
CEO Andy Marsh emphasized that these policy changes provide crucial long-term certainty that was previously lacking. Operationally, Plug Power continues to execute its ""Project Quantum Leap"" restructuring initiative, consolidating facilities and streamlining operations to drive efficiency.
The company's hydrogen production facilities in Georgia and Louisiana are performing well, with management targeting gross margin neutrality by the end of Q4 2025. Service performance improvements and pricing discipline are contributing to margin recovery.",de4f0c1f1a4d311260a9e0c2191b2b52,trafilatura

It’s not a matter of if something will happen to an organization, it’s a matter of when will it happen. Once incident can derail even the best-run supply chains. As a result technology providers are doubling down on tools that give brokers and shippers clearer visibility into carrier performance.
A new partnership between MyCarrier Portal and Carrier Assure aims to do just that, embedding Carrier Assure’s scoring directly into the MyCarrier Portal workflow to streamline onboarding, strengthen monitoring, and help prevent costly missteps before they occur.
The collaboration was born out of demand from mutual customers who were already pairing MyCarrier Portal’s carrier onboarding platform with Carrier Assure’s safety and fraud rating system.
Brokers and shippers often found themselves jumping between platforms, first running MyCarrier Portal assessments, then cross-checking Carrier Assure scores. Danielle Spinelli, Account Executive at MyCarrier Portal, said, “Everyone was already doing both steps.The partnership just brings the Carrier Assure score into the MyCarrier Portal dashboard, so users have everything in one place.”
Now, when a user searches for a carrier in MyCarrier Portal, they see Carrier Assure’s risk score alongside their own vetting results. If needed, they can click through directly into the Carrier Assurance portal for a deeper dive into why a carrier earned its rating.
The experience is configurable, allowing users to set parameters that match their own risk tolerance. For example, a “B” score could be flagged as a medium alert for one broker but considered acceptable for another. “It’s about helping customers navigate the gray area of vetting with guardrails that fit their business,” Spinelli added.
Carrier Assure’s scoring is built on a wide range of data points that go beyond surface-level safety metrics. The model incorporates factors such as business stability, DOT safety performance, inspection and violation trends, insurance and authority status, tracking reliability, and even the relationships between connected entities. This allows the system to identify unusual safety patterns, compliance gaps, or signs of business instability that may not show up in traditional checks.
Equally important is data quality. Carrier Assure requires documentation to back up user-submitted information, which is reviewed for accuracy and authenticity. Other inputs come from trusted third-party sources, giving customers confidence that fraudulent credentials, double-brokering, or outright identity theft will be flagged before a load is put at risk. The score is not designed to make absolute judgments but rather to surface risk patterns and help customers make better-informed decisions.",324c33aaac8d4ef488ab745d4702526e,trafilatura

While there’s another top 25 team in action tonight -- number 12 Illinois -- the majority of top 25 teams play on Saturday. The following Thursday, NFL football begins with the Cowboys playing the Eagles in Philadelphia. Can’t wait.
Enough about football; I'm here to discuss unusual options activity. In Thursday's trading, there were 796 calls and 533 puts, resulting in a put/call ratio of 0.67, a slightly bullish indicator. Among the 533 puts were two Wendy’s (WEN)puts expiring in 50 days on Oct. 17.
As you can see above, both of the puts are OTM (out-of-the-money), with the $9 strike possessing the highest Vol/OI (volume-to-open-interest) of any unusually active option yesterday at 150.09, almost double the put in second place.
Not a lot has gone right for the fast food chain in recent years. Its stock is down 36% year-to-date and 52% over the past five years. Its shares are well down from the 20-year high of $29.31 set on June 1, 2021.
Wendy’s wouldn’t be the first stock I would think to invest in at the moment. That said, the two unusually active puts suggest someone could be looking to protect their downside.
With that in mind, here are three potential trading strategies to implement based on Wendy’s two puts.
Have an excellent weekend.
The Straight Up Play
Starting with the most obvious, you have three possibilities: buying a long put for downside protection, profiting from further correction in the share price, or selling a short put for premium income.
In terms of downside protection, the $10 strike is the better play with a profit probability of 25.80%. The share price must fall below $9.60 (8.57%) to make a profit from the trade. The $9 strike has to fall 15.71% over the next 50 days. The likelihood of that happening is 13.01%, so it's not likely.
Whether you own the stock and are looking to protect on the downside or to profit from a further correction, the $10 strike is the way to go.
Now, if you believe that the stock has fallen as far as it can go and want to generate some income by selling the put, it’s tempting to sell the $10 strike. However, the $9 strike is the better bet to avoid having to buy 100 shares at $10 at expiration, above where they might be trading.
While your annualized return is considerably less than 22.6% at 8.2%, that’s still a reasonable return to augment your portfolio.
The Bullish Play
In this scenario, you expect Wendy’s share price to appreciate over the next 50 days. Utilizing a bull put spread, you sell a short put option and buy a long put option at a lower strike price, with both expiring on the same day. In this example, you sell the $10 put and buy the $9 put.
Your maximum profit is the net credit, which is the difference between the premium income of $30 from selling the $10 short put and the cost of buying the $9 long put for $15. In this instance, it’s $15.
On the other hand, the maximum loss is the difference between the two strike prices, less the net credit. This occurs if Wendy’s share price is below $9 on Oct. 17. The maximum loss in this instance is $85 [$10 put strike - $9 put strike - $15 net credit].
So, if the share price is $9.85 at expiration, you break even. If the share price is $9.95 at expiration, for example, you make $10 [$15 net credit - ($10 strike price - $9.95 share price)]. If the share price at expiration is above $10, you make the maximum profit of $15.
The likelihood of this happening is 69.4%, with a risk-to-reward ratio of 5.67 to 1. I probably wouldn’t make this bet given the high risk/reward ratio.
The Bearish Play
In this scenario, you expect Wendy’s share price to fall over the next 50 days. Utilizing a bear put spread, you buy a long put option and sell a short put option at a lower strike price, with both expiring on the same day. In this example, you buy the $10 put and sell the $9 put.
Your maximum profit is the difference in strike values minus the net debit. The net debit is the $40 cost of buying the $10 long put, less the $10 premium received for selling the $9 short put. In this instance, it’s $30. The maximum profit is $70 [$10 strike price - $9 strike price - $30 net debit]. The maximum profit is achieved if Wendy’s share price is below $9 strike price at expiration.
The maximum loss is the net debit of $30. This occurs if Wendy’s share price is above $10 on Oct. 17.
So, if the share price is $9.70 at expiration, you break even. If the share price is $9.40 at expiration, for example, you make $30 [($10 strike price - $9.40 share price) - $30 net credit]. If the share price at expiration is below $9, you make the maximum profit of $70.
The likelihood of this happening is 26.4%. However, with a risk-to-reward ratio of just 0.43 to 1, the bear put spread is a better bet than the bull put spread.
The Bottom Line on Wendy’s Unusually Active Options
When you consider that the strategy of selling the $10 short put generated $30 premium income, three times the $9 put, it’s tempting to choose the higher-priced option. As I said in the section about straight-up plays, I wouldn’t do it.
I especially wouldn’t do it when you can generate $70 of premium income, 2.3 times more than selling the put, by utilizing the bear put spread, whose risk/reward ratio is more than reasonable. It's the best strategy for Wendy's stock.

After cooling off over the last month with shares down about 18%, can Coinbase sustain this momentum and keep posting gains?
About Coinbase Stock
Founded in 2012 by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, Coinbase is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform. The company offers a secure and user-friendly platform to trade digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTCUSD) and Ethereum (ETHUSD). Coinbase was one of the first crypto trading platforms to go public. The company has played a role in making digital currencies mainstream. It serves millions of users worldwide. With a market cap of $80 billion, the company aims to build a more accessible financial system.
This year, cryptocurrencies have been experiencing a rise, with Bitcoin gaining 15.4% year-to-date (YTD). This was driven by progress on cryptocurrency legislation and the adoption of digital currencies by financial institutions. For instance, President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law on July 18, creating a new framework for stablecoin regulation.
As a part of a partnership with Circle Internet Group (CRCL), a non-bank operator of the stablecoin USDC, Coinbase generates a considerable amount of revenue from the stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. This new legislation ensures that stablecoin revenue continues to flow in for Coinbase.
Coinbase was also lauded for establishing a European crypto hub in Luxembourg under the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework. This milestone enables the company to offer its cryptocurrency products and services to 450 million people across all 27 member states of the European Union (EU).
A Look Inside Coinbase’s Q2 Results

(Hint: Not Broadcom)
Big tech companies are set to spend $375 billion on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure this year, according to estimates from analysts at UBS. That number will climb to $500 billion next year.
The biggest expense item in building out AI data centers is semiconductors. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been by far the biggest beneficiary of that spend so far. Its GPUs offer best-in-class capabilities for general AI training and inference. Other AI accelerator chipmakers have also seen strong sales growth, including Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), which makes custom AI chips as well as networking chips, which ensure data moves efficiently from one server to another, keeping downtime to a minimum.
Broadcom's stock price has increased more than fivefold since the start of 2023, and the company now sports a market cap of $1.4 trillion. Another year of spectacular growth could easily place it in the $2 trillion club. But another semiconductor stock looks like a more likely candidate to reach that vaunted level, joining Nvidia and the four other members of the club by 2028.
Is Broadcom a $2 trillion company?
Broadcom is a massive company with operations spanning hardware and software, but its AI chips business is currently steering the ship.
To that end, AI revenue climbed 46% year over year last quarter to reach $4.4 billion. Management expects the current quarter to produce $5.1 billion in AI semiconductor revenue, accelerating growth to roughly 60%. AI-related revenue now accounts for roughly 30% of Broadcom's sales, and that's set to keep climbing over the next few years.
Broadcom's acquisition of VMware last year is another growth driver. The software company is now fully integrated into Broadcom's larger operations, and it's seen strong success in upselling customers to the VMware Cloud Foundation, enabling enterprises to run their own private clouds. Over 87% of its customers have transitioned to the new subscription, resulting in double-digit growth in annual recurring revenue.
But Broadcom shares are extremely expensive. The stock garners a forward P/E ratio of 45. While its AI chip sales are growing quickly and it's seeing strong margin improvement from VMware, it's important not to lose sight of how broad a company Broadcom is. Despite the stellar growth in those two businesses, the company is still only growing its top line at about 20% year over year. Investors should expect only incremental margin improvements going forward as it scales the AI accelerator business. That means the business is set up for strong earnings growth, but not enough to justify its 45 times earnings multiple.
Another semiconductor stock trades at a much more reasonable multiple, and is growing just as fast.
The semiconductor giant poised to join the $2 trillion club by 2028
Both Broadcom and Nvidia rely on another company to ensure they can create the most advanced semiconductors in the world for AI training and inference. That company is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), which actually prints and packages both companies' designs. Almost every company designing leading-edge chips relies on TSMC for its technological capabilities. As a result, its market share of semiconductor manufacturing has climbed to more than two-thirds.
TSMC benefits from a virtuous cycle, ensuring it maintains and grows its massive market share. Its technology lead helps it win big contracts from companies like Nvidia and Broadcom. That gives it the capital to invest in expanding capacity and research and development for its next-generation process. As a result, it maintains its technology lead while offering enough capacity to meet the growing demand for manufacturing.
TSMC's leading-edge process node, dubbed N2, will reportedly charge a 66% premium per silicon wafer over the previous generation (N3). That's a much bigger step-up in price than it's historically managed, but the demand for the process is strong as companies are willing to spend whatever it takes to access the next bump in power and energy efficiency. While TSMC typically experiences a significant drop off in gross margin as it ramps up a new expensive node with lower initial yields, its current pricing should help it maintain its margins for years to come as it eventually transitions to an even more advanced process next year.
Management expects AI-related revenue to average mid-40% growth per year from 2024 through 2029. While AI chips are still a relatively small part of TSMC's business, that should produce overall revenue growth of about 20% for the business. Its ability to maintain a strong gross margin as it ramps up the next two manufacturing processes should allow it to produce operating earnings growth exceeding that 20% mark.
TSMC's stock trades at a much more reasonable earnings multiple of 24 times expectations. Considering the business could generate earnings growth in the low 20% range, that's a great price for the stock. If it can maintain that earnings multiple through 2028 while growing earnings at about 20% per year, the stock will be worth well over $2 trillion at that point.

Oracle was close to dead money in the five years between 2015 and the end of 2019 -- gaining just 17.8% compared to 56.9% for the S&P 500. But since the start of 2020, Oracle is up 345% compared to a 100.6% gain in the S&P 500. A big driver of the outperformance is the build-out and adoption of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).
Oracle transformed from a database-first company to a fully fledged ecosystem. Not long ago, companies were using Oracle's database software on third-party clouds. Oracle decided to capture that revenue by building out its own cloud services.
Oracle Integration Cloud hosts software-as-a-service offerings for financial reporting, automated workflows, human resources operations, marketing, personalization, and more. Oracle also offers artificial intelligence (AI)-powered database services. And OCI has been shown to be much more cost-effective for data-intensive operations than Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud. It's an especially ideal offering for industries like financial services and healthcare that have complex regulatory frameworks and sensitive information. On its earnings calls, Oracle often discusses how industries are choosing OCI for its security and compliance capabilities.
Oracle was already a leader in enterprise software solutions. And now, it is a major player in the cloud business. The main downside of Oracle is that its valuation is expensive, and it is spending extremely aggressively. Oracle is arguably among the higher-risk, higher-potential-reward Titans. If its investments translate to bottom-line earnings growth, it could continue to be one of the best performers in the group. If not, it wouldn't be surprising if the stock underwent a sizable sell-off.
Netflix is an entertainment giant that is raking in the cash flow
Netflix's outsized returns in recent years are partly due to how beaten down the stock was going into 2023. Netflix fell over 50% in 2022, outpacing the broader sell-off in the Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) that year. At the time, other streaming platforms were gaining traction, and Netflix was still inconsistently profitable.
The business model has remained largely unchanged over the past decade. So it's not a transformational story like Oracle. Rather, Netflix has perfected its craft.
The biggest change has been its content slate -- what it spends on, how it markets that content (like the global success of ""KPop Demon Hunters,"") and basically just boosting its overall content success rate. The second major change was cracking down on password sharing. This was a resounding success because a lot of new accounts opened up -- showing that customers were willing to pay for Netflix because they value the service (again, despite a lot of competition). And finally, Netflix's ad-supported tier is driving new signups, which accelerates revenue growth.
Netflix is an industry-leading cash cow with high margins. It has become a near-perfect business. The only issue is that the valuation reflects that, as Netflix trades at 52 times trailing 12-month earnings. Netflix could still be a winning long-term stock, but it may need a year or two to grow into its valuation. Therefore, it may not be a standout performer in 2026.
Nvidia just delivered another blowout quarter
Nvidia reported exceptional second-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Aug. 27 despite the company's China business being hindered by export restrictions to China.
Even with difficult comps from the second-quarter fiscal 2025, Nvidia grew revenue by 56% and adjusted earnings per share by 54%. Arguably, the most impressive aspect of Nvidia's results is that it continues to sustain ultra-high gross margins over 70%. Nvidia's high margins allow it to convert a substantial amount of sales into profit, which is a testament to its edge over the competition and technological leadership on the global stage.
Nvidia gets a lot of attention for its data center business -- and rightfully so, as it made up 88% of revenue in the recent quarter. But it's worth noting that the rest of the business is doing well too. Nvidia's non-data center revenue, which includes gaming and AI PC professional visualization, automotive, and robotics, was collectively $5.49 billion -- up 48% compared to $3.7 billion a year ago.
Nvidia is in its third year of what has been an uninterrupted masterclass of exponential growth on a scale unlike any business the world has ever seen. And somehow, the company still has its foot on the gas with no signs of slowing down.
Nvidia's outlook for the third-quarter fiscal 2026 calls for $54 billion in revenue even if it ships zero H20 chips to China -- all while maintaining a 73% gross margin. That would mark a 54% increase in revenue and just slightly lower gross margins than third-quarter fiscal 2025 and a near three-fold increase in revenue in just two years.
Despite the impeccable results, Nvidia's valuation isn't cheap, as investors are pricing in a sustained breakneck growth rate. But Nvidia just keeps delivering, so its 58.4 price-to-earnings ratio is reasonable.
If Nvidia's stock price remained unchanged for a year but the company grew earnings by 50%, the P/E would drop to 38.9. So even now, with the stock on track to crush the S&P 500 for the third consecutive year, Nvidia remains a top AI stock to buy now.
I expect Nvidia to continue leading the Ten Titans higher in 2026, especially if trade policy with China eases. However, if for whatever reason there's a slowdown in AI spending from key Nvidia customers, Nvidia could drag down the Ten Titans and the broader market with it.

Sugar prices gave up an early advance on Friday and settled lower due to higher Brazilian sugar output. On Friday, Unica reported that Brazil's Center-South sugar output in the first half of August rose by +16% y/y to 3,615 MT. Also, the percentage of sugarcane crushed for sugar by Brazil's sugar mills in the first half of August increased to 55.00% from 49.15% the same time last year.

Sugar prices initially moved higher on Friday, with London sugar posting a 3.5-month high after the International Sugar Organization (ISO) forecast a global sugar deficit for the 2025/26 season, the sixth consecutive year of sugar deficits. The ISO projects a global 2025/26 sugar deficit of -231,000 MT, improving from a -4.88 MMT shortfall in 2024/25. The ISO also projects 2025/26 global sugar production will rise by +3.3% y/y to 180.6 MMT, and 2025/26 global sugar consumption will increase +0.3% y/y to 180.8 MMT.
Sugar also has a positive carryover from Tuesday, when Conab, Brazil's government crop forecasting agency, cut its Brazil 2025/26 production estimate by 3.1% to 44.5 MMT from a previous estimate of 45.9 MMT.
Sugar prices have been under pressure over the past two weeks, posting 2-week lows last Monday due to the outlook for lower sugar production in Brazil. Last Monday, Covrig Analytics reported that Brazil's sugar mills are prioritizing sugar production over ethanol, crushing more cane for sugar. This trend is expected to continue as harvesting peaks, driven by drier cane crops that prompt mills to produce more sugar.
On August 12, NY sugar rallied to a 2.5-month high on concerns over weaker cane yields in Brazil. Conab reported last month that 2024/25 Brazil sugar production fell by -3.4% y/y to 44.118 MMT, citing lower sugarcane yields due to drought and excessive heat.
The outlook for higher sugar exports from India is negative for sugar prices after Bloomberg reported that India may permit local sugar mills to export sugar in the next season, which starts in October, as abundant monsoon rains may produce a bumper sugar crop. India's Meteorological Department reported last Friday that cumulative monsoon rain in India was 650.3 mm as of August 22, or 2% above normal. Also, the Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association recently said that it will seek permission to export 2 MMT of sugar in 2025/26.",f167680fc56715fcf5176bc40f179e70,trafilatura

(Reuters) -Walmart (WMT) defeated an appeal by shareholders who said the world's largest retailer defrauded them by failing to disclose that federal prosecutors were investigating its opioid-dispensing practices.
The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia said Walmart did not commit securities fraud by waiting until June 2018 to reveal it was being investigated, 1-1/2 years after the probe began and 10 weeks after a Texas prosecutor warned she intended to indict the company.
Walmart learned of the opioid probe after federal agents raided one of its stores, seeking records concerning two Texas doctors who were prescribing vast amounts of the painkillers.
The company was not indicted, but was hit with a U.S. Department of Justice civil lawsuit in December 2020. A trial is scheduled for November 2027. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer has more than 5,000 Walmart and Sam's Club pharmacies.
Shareholders sued Walmart after ProPublica reported on the near-indictment on March 25, 2020.
Walmart shares fell 5.1% that day, wiping out about $16 billion of market value, and fell after the Justice Department announced its civil lawsuit.
In Friday's 3-0 decision, Circuit Judge Anthony Scirica said ""not everything is securities fraud,"" and that while Walmart did not reveal the indictment threat it ""did what it had to do"" to avoid misleading disclosures.
""The complaint does not plausibly allege the investigations into Walmart constituted a liability or a reasonably possible liability, or that Walmart's disclosures implied it was not under investigation,"" Scirica wrote.
""Once the contours of the investigation were clearer,"" he added, ""Walmart disclosed it was under investigation, what it was under investigation for, and that it faced possible losses.""
Friday's decision upheld an April 2024 dismissal by Chief Judge Colm Connolly of the Delaware federal court.
Lawyers for the shareholders did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A Walmart spokeswoman said the company was pleased with the outcome.
In November 2022, Walmart reached a $3.1 billion nationwide settlement of opioid claims by state, local and tribal governments.
The case is In re Walmart Inc Securities Litigation, 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 24-1818.

Buying a home with an affordable mortgage payment at a time of relatively higher interest rates may seem like a difficult or even impossible goal. But what if there were a way to buy a home and keep the seller's existing mortgage with its lower rate and payment? That's exactly what an assumable mortgage helps you do.
This embedded content is not available in your region.
Read more: A guide for first-time home buyers
What is an assumable mortgage?
An assumable mortgage is any mortgage that can be transferred from one borrower to another.
Assumable mortgages tend to be attractive when interest rates for new loans are higher than rates were for most earlier loans. Assumptions can also prove useful when a loan is transferred due to a divorce or inheritance.
Conventional mortgages typically aren't assumable, but most government-backed mortgages are. The government-backed category of assumable loans includes:
-
FHA loans, insured by the Federal Housing Administration
-
VA loans, guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
-
USDA loans, guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
How to find a home with an assumable mortgage
There's no fast and easy way to locate all the homes with assumable mortgages in a particular area, but a few strategies could help you identify these homes one by one.
Search online listings
One strategy is to search for-sale home websites for related keywords, like ""assumable"" or ""assume,"" or types of assumable mortgages, such as ""FHA,"" ""VA,"" or ""USDA."" Some for-sale homes are advertised online with offers like: ""2.5% Fully Assumable mortgage!"" ""ASSUMABLE MORTGAGE at 4.625%!!"" or simply ""ASSUMABLE MORTGAGE.""
Ask your Realtor for help
Another strategy is to ask your real estate agent to help you. Your Realtor can search additional listings, research national mortgage data, ask other Realtors about their sellers' mortgages, send letters to homeowners in areas where you want to live, or even knock on doors in those neighborhoods to try to locate current or prospective sellers who may not even know they have an assumable mortgage. Sellers who aren't sure can contact their lender or loan servicer for this information.
Lenders may not be a big help
A strategy that's not likely to work is to ask a loan representative or mortgage broker to find homes with assumable mortgages for you. Loan professionals are compensated for selling new mortgages, not finding old ones to transfer to new borrowers.
How to assume a mortgage
Assuming a seller's mortgage isn't easy, but it could save you thousands of dollars in mortgage interest expense compared with the payment for a new mortgage.
3 steps to assume a mortgage
1. Complete a loan application. To assume an existing mortgage, you'll need to apply and be approved, as you would for any other home loan.
While it is possible to pay someone else's mortgage without the lender's approval, the seller is unlikely to agree to this approach, because without the lender's approval, the seller will remain financially responsible for the mortgage payment, and the lender may demand repayment of the full loan amount.
2. Make a larger cash down payment or arrange for a second mortgage to finance the difference between the home's sale price and the amount the seller still owes on the assumable mortgage.
FHA, VA, and USDA loans generally allow very small or even 0% down payments, which may make closing the gap with cash or secondary financing easier.
A second mortgage will likely have a higher rate than the assumable mortgage, but the combined payments for both mortgages should still be lower than the payment for a new mortgage for the combined loan amount.
3. Pay any loan fees and closing costs. A home purchase with an assumable mortgage may have lower closing costs than one with a new mortgage; however, the costs typically won't be zeroed out, especially if you need a second loan to finance the full sale price. The seller will also want a release from liability for any future responsibility for repaying the loan.
One more thing to consider: If the assumable mortgage has an escrow (or impound) account for property tax and insurance, those funds will likely remain with the mortgage rather than be refunded to the seller. The buyer and seller will need to negotiate whether either of them will provide the other a credit for all or part of those funds at closing.
Assumable mortgage FAQs
Do you put a down payment on an assumable mortgage?
While every buyer's situation is different, assumable mortgages often require large down payments. When you assume a homeowner's mortgage, your down payment must cover the difference between the home value and the owner's outstanding loan balance. For example, if the sales price is $500,000 and the owner still owes $375,000, you'll need a $125,000 down payment to make up the difference.
What are the downsides of assuming a mortgage?
For one, that large down payment. Assumable mortgages also aren't very common, so finding a loan officer with substantial experience in this area can be difficult.
Do banks still allow assumable mortgages?
Yes, banks and other mortgage lenders allow borrowers to assume a mortgage, though it isn't as common as it once was. But you generally cannot assume a conventional loan — you're limited to government-backed loans.",ad073ab581c640d528b5fcdae4df4ecb,trafilatura
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swift-effect-strikes-again-heres-171300765.html,8ddcaacf0589a666f93efc76f4a2af90,  The Swift Effect  Strikes Again : Here How the Singer Engagement Announcement Impacted Jewelry Stocks This Week,  The Swift Effect  Strikes Again : Here How the Singer Engagement Announcement Impacted Jewelry Stocks This Week,2025-08-30 18:15:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"It didn't turn out to be a ""Cruel Summer"" for singer Taylor Swift: she and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, in a continuation of their ongoing ""Love Story,"" have officially told each other, ""You Belong With Me.""
The pop icon, self-made billionaire, and self-described ""Anti-Hero"" announced her engagement to Kelce in an Instagram post on Tuesday. Sure enough, where there used to be a ""Blank Space"" on Swift's ring finger, she was now ""Bejeweled"" with a large engagement ring (and we hope she doesn't accidentally ""Shake It Off"").
Swift surely knew ""All Too Well"" that the announcement would make ""Sparks Fly"" among her legion of fans (to them I say, ""You Need to Calm Down""), but even in her ""Wildest Dreams,"" she probably never expected the news to affect the stock market.
But it did. Here's how.
Look what you made me do...to the market
In the immediate wake of the announcement, as fans were still trying to identify the exact cut of the diamond in Swift's ring (it was a ""cushion cut,"" for those who are interested), there was a brief, otherwise-unexplained 1% pop in the stock price of Signet Jewelers Limited(NYSE: SIG), one of the few publicly traded jewelry companies.
As the afternoon wore on, Signet's shares climbed higher in a rally continued through Wednesday and into Thursday's premarket trading, when Signet's stock briefly hit $95/share, up nearly 10% over the pre-""pop star pop"" price. The Swift Effect was even more pronounced for Brilliant Earth Group (NASDAQ: BRLT), which soared from $2.17/share at 12:50 PM on Tuesday to close at $2.82/share, a 30% gain.
Even luxury brands only partially exposed to the jewelry market rose in the wake of the announcement: Movado Group (NYSE: MOV), which is primarily a watchmaker but does sell other jewelry items, and LVMH (OTC: LVMHF), which owns Tiffany & Co., were both up more than 4% over their pre-engagement price at Thursday's close.
Today was a fairytale
It's not the first time that Taylor Swift's legions of fans -- known as ""Swifties"" -- have collectively influenced the financial world. In July 2023, the Federal Reserve's Beige Book credited Swift's ""Eras"" tour as being responsible for the strongest month of hotel revenue in Philadelphia since the pandemic. This mirrored reports from Cincinnati and Chicago, among many other cities, that credited the ""Eras"" tour for record hotel revenues.
So how did this happen? There was likely a noticeable spike in internet searches for various types of wedding rings in the wake of Swift's announcement as eager fans tried to identify the exact ring in question (and possibly score one for themselves). That activity may have triggered certain traders' algorithms to buy jewelry stocks...or perhaps there are just plenty of Swifties among the ranks of hedge fund managers.
The money question is, could this one-time pop in interest translate into a meaningful increase in jewelry sales, or lasting gains for these jewelry stocks?
Is it over now?
Unfortunately, it looks like the rally may already be fizzling. Although Signet Jewelers closed on Thursday at $89.86/share, which is 3.6% above its pre-engagement price, it had fallen significantly from its post-engagement high of $95. Brilliant Earth Group also closed lower on Thursday at $2.69/share, though that was also well above its pre-engagement price.
Getting engaged is a much bigger commitment than buying an album or attending a concert (although the cost of some resold ""Eras"" tour tickets could have funded an entire wedding and then some). Sure, it might be fun to dream about getting a ring like Taylor Swift, or to shop for one online, but even if you idolize Swift, will her engagement really prompt legions of uncommitted Swifties to propose? (Don't get me wrong: I know the intensity of Swift's fandom is strong...but that strong?)
Meanwhile, all of the aforementioned jewelry and jewelry-adjacent companies have significantly lagged the S&P 500 over the past five years: some by a little (Signet is trailing on a total return basis by about 35 percentage points) to a lot (Brilliant Earth is ""Down Bad,"" by a jaw-dropping 130 percentage points).
I'd classify those returns as not just in the ""Red,"" but redder than ""Bad Blood,"" and it'll take more than a one-time surge of interest from Swifties to make me say anything besides ""I Knew You Were Trouble"" and ""We Are Never Ever Getting Together.""
That said, whichever jeweler can be the first to mass-produce a Taylor Swift-inspired cushion-cut engagement ring will almost certainly have a hit on their hands.

Buying a home is one of the biggest financial decisions you’ll ever make. So, you may be wondering: What is the best age to buy a house? Are you too young to think about homeownership? Or do you feel like you’ve waited too long to buy? Here’s a look at the average age of first-time home buyers and how to decide the right age to make a move.

Average age to buy a house
Young adults are now waiting longer to buy their first homes. In 2024, the average age for Americans to buy their first house reached a record high of 38, according to a report from the National Association of REALTORS®. The shift is largely due to soaring home prices and student loan debt levels. Many young adults are also delaying marriage and prioritizing personal growth and career development over homeownership.
That said, the right age to buy a home may vary depending on your financial situation, desired location, lifestyle, and long-term goals.
Pros and cons of buying a home when you’re younger
Pros
-
Building equity. Buying early and owning your own home for an extended period gives you time to build up equity. Your home equity is the difference between what your home is worth and the amount you still owe on your mortgage. You can leverage home equity to invest or meet other financial goals in the future, and even use it to afford a down payment on your next house if you move. However, you don’t accumulate equity when you rent.
-
Predictable housing costs. Annual rent increases are relatively common. But when you purchase a home with a fixed-rate mortgage, you get set monthly mortgage payments. (Note: Property taxes, homeowners insurance, and homeowners' association fees, if applicable, may fluctuate over time.)
-
Tax perks. You can save at tax time by deducting mortgage interest, property taxes, and other home costs on your return. Homeowners who itemize deductions can take advantage of this perk. Reach out to a tax professional to learn more.
-
Freedom of expression. Most landlords impose restrictions on the customizations you can make to rental properties. Owning a home, though, means you can renovate or upgrade your space to make it more functional.
-
Lower price point. Home prices generally rise over time. So, buying young means you can take advantage of the lower price point. Plus, if you stay in the house for a long time, you could pay off your home loan before you retire.
Cons
-
Limited mobility. Leasing means you only have to stay put for a year (or less in some cases) before you can relocate. But buying a home is more of a long-term investment, and selling too prematurely could be costly.
-
Lending terms. There are loan programs for people with low or no credit scores or those with limited income, minimal cash reserves, or high debt levels. The problem is, you may not qualify for the best lending terms offered to prospective buyers. Specifically, you could get stuck paying a higher mortgage rate.

Pros and cons of buying when you’re older
Pros
-
Financial stability. Buying in your middle or older years gives you more time to build a solid financial foundation. Remember, good credit, ample reserves, and a low debt-to-income ratio make you more attractive to lenders.
-
More clarity. It’s also highly likely that you’ll have more clarity on where you want to live long term when you’re older. Whether you're retiring in your dream area or relocating to be closer to adult children, buying a home later in life can bring peace of mind. You’ll have confidence knowing you’re living exactly where you want to be.
Cons
-
Forfeited equity growth. Again, buying young can work in your favor as home values climb. But buying older gives you less time to build up equity that you can convert to cash to use however you see fit.
-
Mortgage payments during retirement. Some homeowners experience a significant dip in income during their golden years. Unfortunately, costly mortgage payments could stretch your budget thin.
-
Uncertainty. There’s no way to know what the future holds. You could face medical challenges or other unexpected obstacles as you age that make it difficult for you to afford or maintain your dream home.
Is there a 'right time' (or age) to buy?
The right time to buy a home isn’t always about age. It’s more about your financial situation, future plans, and ability to manage homeownership costs. Here are some questions to ponder:
-
Do you meet the lending criteria for a mortgage?
-
Do you have a minimal debt load?
-
Can you afford to make a down payment on a new home?
-
Do you have at least three to six months of expenses saved for emergencies?
-
Can you comfortably afford the monthly mortgage payments?
-
Do you plan to live in the home for an extended period of time?
-
Do you have the means to cover maintenance and repairs?
-
Do you have a designated point of contact to assist with questions or address your needs?
Answering yes to most of these questions is a sign that you’re ready to buy a home, regardless of your age. Before moving forward, analyze your situation, needs, and goals to make an informed decision.

The best age to buy a house FAQs
At what age do most people buy a house?
A 2024 National Association of REALTORS® report revealed that the average age of first-time home buyers is 38. However, depending on your financial situation and goals, the right age for you could be much younger or older.
Are you too young to buy a house?
Again, there’s no right or wrong age to purchase a home, as it depends on your unique situation. However, most states require you to be at least 18 unless an adult signs real estate contracts on your behalf.
Is buying a house in your 20s a good idea?
If you’re financially stable with a solid credit profile, adequate savings, and a clear vision for your future, homeownership in your 20s could be a smart financial move. You’ll have several years to build equity, benefit from predictable housing costs, and even enjoy a paid-off home before retirement should you purchase your “forever home.”

As you go through the home-buying process for the first time, you're bound to encounter different interest rates when looking for loans online or working with mortgage lenders. However, there is a difference between the interest rate and the APR when shopping for a mortgage — and understanding the difference is crucial.
This embedded content is not available in your region.
What does APR mean?
APR is an acronym for ""annual percentage rate,"" which reflects the total borrowing costs of your mortgage. Essentially, it’s what you pay on top of the principal balance you borrow.
Your mortgage interest rate is one component that gets factored into your mortgage APR, but since your APR is the full borrowing cost of your home loan on an annualized basis, it includes other expenses. Therefore, your APR will likely be higher than your interest rate.
Learn more: What is mortgage interest, and how does it work?
How does APR work?
Points and fees
The other expenses that could get factored into your mortgage APR, besides your interest rate, include mortgage points, underwriting or origination fees, or select closing costs.
The mortgage points (if applicable), fees, and closing cost elements of your APR impact the amount of money you’ll need when closing on a house. You’ll pay for those expenses in cash to finalize your home loan.
The interest rate
The interest rate aspect of your mortgage APR influences your ongoing monthly payment amount. The higher your interest rate, the higher your housing bill (and overall home loan cost).
You may choose to pay mortgage points to lower your interest rate.
Yahoo Finance tip: The APR calculation processes can vary from lender to lender, so it’s wise to ask your financial institution what costs are reflected in the figures they provide. If you’re looking to do a little research on your own, a good APR calculator can provide you with some estimates.
How to use APR when mortgage shopping
""I think mortgage APR is generally the best way to compare rates because APR includes the origination fees and closing costs,"" said Ted Erhart, certified financial planner and founder of Norris Lake Retirement Planning, via email interview.
""In other words,"" said Erhart, ""it’s an all-in 'price' for the loan. If you shop for mortgages online, you’ll often see advertisements for what appear to be low rates. But if you look closely, the rate being offered comes with two, three, or even more origination points. Hence, the face rate is misleading because it doesn’t include thousands of dollars of origination and closing costs.""
You can find the mortgage APR on page three of the lender-provided Loan Estimate form. Your mortgage lender must give you a copy of this document within three days of receiving your mortgage application.
Yahoo Finance tip: Make sure you compare apples to apples when reviewing your mortgage options. Request that lenders provide Loan Estimates with no mortgage points included.

How can I get a lower APR?
Since the interest rate is one of the main factors that influences your mortgage APR, here are some strategies that may reduce your cost to borrow:
-
Improving your credit score and reducing debt.
-
Always compare mortgage offers from several lenders. You may find a lender that charges fewer (or less expensive) fees than another.
-
The length and type of your mortgage can impact the APR you pay, too.

When a higher mortgage APR is worth it
While it may seem counterintuitive, there are times when a higher mortgage APR may work in your favor.
""For instance, if the borrower plans to stay in the home for a short period, they might opt for a loan with higher fees (and thus a higher APR) in exchange for a lower interest rate. This strategy can be cost-effective if the lower interest payments outweigh the upfront fees over the time the borrower holds the loan,"" said Bryan Jordan, certified financial planner and managing partner of Censifi, via email.
Erhart said, ""A higher APR could make sense for someone who is more concerned about monthly cash flow as opposed to the interest expense. For example, 15-year terms generally have lower rates and APRs than 30-year mortgages. But many home buyers are willing to pay a higher rate for a lower monthly payment.""

The dollar gave up an early advance on Friday and turned lower following the weaker-than-expected August MNI Chicago PMI report and after the University of Michigan’s US August consumer sentiment index was revised lower. The dollar was also pressured by dovish comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who stated that he supports a 25-bp rate cut at the September FOMC meeting and anticipates additional rate cuts over the next three to six months.
The dollar on Friday initially moved higher on signs of strength in US consumer spending after July personal spending rose by the most in four months. Also, sticky inflation pressures are hawkish for Fed policy and are supportive for the dollar after the US July core PCE price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, rose to a 5-month high.
Concern over the Fed’s independence and fears about capital flight are negative for the dollar with President Trump’s move to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook. If Mr. Trump succeeds in firing Fed Governor Cook, foreign investors may lose faith in the Fed and the dollar and swap their dollar assets into non-dollar investments.
US July personal spending rose +0.5% m/m, the most in four months, and right on expectations. Also, July personal income rose +0.4% m/m, right on expectations.
The US July core PCE price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, rose to a 5-month high of +2.9% y/y from +2.8% y/y in June, right on expectations.
The US Aug MNI Chicago PMI fell -5.6 to 41.5, weaker than expectations of 46.0.
The University of Michigan US Aug consumer sentiment index was revised lower by -0.4 to 58.2, weaker than expectations of no change at 58.6.
Late Thursday, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said he supports a 25 bp rate cut at the September FOMC meeting and anticipates additional rate cuts over the next three to six months. He said, “With underlying inflation close to 2%, market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, and the chances of an undesirable weakening in the labor market increased, proper risk management means the FOMC should be cutting the policy rate now.”
Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 88% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and at 55% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.
EUR/USD (^EURUSD) on Friday rose by +0.11%. The euro recovered from early losses on Friday and turned higher after the ECB’s July CPI expectations came in higher than expected, a hawkish factor for ECB policy. Also, the stronger-than-expected German Aug CPI report is hawkish for ECB policy and supportive for the euro.
The euro initially moved lower on Friday due to a stronger dollar. Also, concerns over a slowdown in consumer spending in the Eurozone are negative for the euro after German July retail sales fell by the most in nearly two years.
The ECB Jul 1-year CPI expectations were unchanged from Jun at +2.6%, stronger than expectations of +2.5%. The ECB Jul 3-year CPI expectations unexpectedly climbed to +2.5%, stronger than expectations of no change at +2.4%.
German Aug unemployment unexpectedly fell by -9,000, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of +10,000.
German Jul retail sales fell -1.5% m/m, weaker than expectations of no change and the biggest decline in almost two years.
German Aug CPI (EU harmonized) rose +2.1% y/y, stronger than expectations of +2.0% y/y.
On the geopolitical front, diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine remain elusive, as the US tries to broker a peace deal between the two countries. On Friday, German Chancellor Merz and French President Macron called for secondary sanctions on Russia for its war in Ukraine and said they will push for measures targeting “companies from third countries that support Russia’s war.” On Thursday, German Chancellor Merz stated that a meeting between Russian President Putin and Ukrainian President Zelensky is unlikely to take place. The outcome of the Russian-Ukrainian war could have macroeconomic implications regarding tariffs and oil prices, and could, of course, have significant consequences for European security.
Swaps are pricing in a 3% chance of a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.
USD/JPY (^USDJPY) on Friday rose by +0.07%. The yen posted modest losses on Friday due to the weaker-than-expected Japanese economic reports on July industrial production and July retail sales, which are bearish for the yen. In addition, price pressures softened in Japan after the Aug Tokyo CPI eased as expected, a dovish factor for BOJ policy. Also, Higher T-note yields on Friday were bearish for the yen.
Losses in the yen were limited Friday after the Japanese Jul consumer confidence index rose more than expected to a 7-month high. Also, strength in Japan’s labor market is bullish for the yen after the Jul jobless rate unexpectedly fell to a 5.5-year low of 2.3%.
The Japan Jul consumer confidence index rose +1.2 to a 7-month high of 34.9, stronger than expectations of 34.2.
Japan’s July industrial production fell -1.6% m/m, weaker than expectations of -1.1% m/m and the largest decline in 8 months.
Japan July retail sales fell -1.6% m/m, weaker than expectations of -0.2% m/m and the biggest decline in 4.25 years.
The Japan July jobless rate unexpectedly fell -0.2 to a 5.5-year low of 2.3%, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of no change at 2.5%.
Japan Aug Tokyo CPI eased to +2.6% y/y from +2.9% y/y in July, right on expectations. Aug Tokyo CPI ex-fresh food and energy eased to +3.0% y/y from +3.1% in July, right on expectations.
December gold (GCZ25) on Friday closed up +41.80 (+1.20%), and September silver (SIU25) closed up +1.010 (+2.58%). Precious metal prices rallied sharply on Friday, with gold climbing to a 3-week high and silver posting a 14-year nearest-futures high. Signs of sticky global inflation pressures are boosting demand for gold as an inflation hedge, following Friday’s news that the US July core PCE price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, rose to a five-month high, and after the German August CPI rose more than expected.
Also, President Trump’s move to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook has sparked concerns about the Fed’s independence and increased demand for safe-haven assets, including precious metals. In addition, political uncertainty in France is driving demand for gold as a safe-haven, following French Prime Minister Bayrou’s call for a confidence vote that could bring down his government as soon as next month. Finally, dovish comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller were bullish for precious metals when he stated that he supports a 25-bp rate cut at the September FOMC meeting and anticipates additional rate cuts over the next three to six months.
Gold has continued safe-haven support related to US tariffs and geopolitical risks, including the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. The fund buying of precious metals continues to support prices, following the rise in gold holdings in ETFs to a 2-year high on Thursday and the rise in silver holdings in ETFs to a 3-year high the same day.

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.
The cryptocurrency market has just flashed a short-term bear signal, according to VanEck Head of Digital Assets Research Matthew Sigel.
Sigel said Tuesday on X that Bitcoin and Ethereum had formed a ""rare divergence"" as ETH did not mirror BTC’s over 10% drawdown on the day. He said it was the first time the divergence had occurred since 2021, adding that since 2020, the setup had occurred on just 52 out of 1,927 days.

Sigel said that, on average, Bitcoin has experienced a 2.8% decline the week after the divergence and a 15.6% decline the month after. On the other hand, Ethereum has, on average, experienced a 6.4% increase one week after and an 8.4% decline one month after, he said.
""A bearish flag for crypto overall: ETH cushions short-term, but both tend to roll over,"" he said.
When one user suggested that the recent divergence could be an outlier and that Bitcoin and Ethereum could both rise, Sigel said it was ""possible,"" but maintained that ""history tilts bearish.""

A Volatile Market
The divergence between Bitcoin and Ethereum comes as the cryptocurrency market has faced significant volatility over the past week, with BTC oscillating between $117,000 and $110,000. MEXC Ventures Investment Director Leo Zhao attributed the recent price swings to thinning liquidity, exchange-traded fund rebalancing and heavy profit-taking from OG Bitcoin holders in a Tuesday note shared with Benzinga.
""In the absence of a fresh macro catalyst, such as a dovish FED policy pivot, rate cuts, or renewed ETF inflows, BTC is likely to drift into a period of market consolidation as the market digests the recent distribution,"" he said. ""The long-term picture, however, remains underpinned by institutional accumulation, which continues to outpace new supply, suggesting that once the risk-averse approach wears off and macro uncertainty headwinds subside, Bitcoin retains the structural foundation for another attempt at record highs of $130,000 before the EOY.""

But while Zhao remains optimistic in the long term, veteran commodities trader Peter Brandt warned Wednesday on X that Bitcoin could be forming a cycle top.

Alibaba snapped a three-day losing streak on Friday, jumping 12.95 percent to end at $135.05 apiece after posting a stellar earnings performance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026.
In its updated report, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) said net income attributable to shareholders surged by 67 percent to 40.65 billion yuan from 24.39 billion yuan registered in the same period last year, primarily driven by mark-to-market changes from equity investments and gain from the disposal of local consumer service business of Trendyol, partly offset by the decrease in income from operations.

Revenues grew by 1.89 percent to 247.6 billion yuan from 243 billion yuan year-on-year. Excluding revenue from the disposed businesses of Sun Art and Intime, revenue on a like-for-like basis would have grown by 10 percent year-on-year.

The company stands out as one of the few pure-play quantum stocks available to investors, and it’s making waves with its innovative trapped-ion technology, an approach praised for its potential to scale qubits while minimizing error rates, two of the biggest hurdles in building commercially viable quantum computers.
With quantum breakthroughs seen as the next leap in computing power, IonQ’s unique position in the ecosystem has drawn plenty of attention from growth-focused investors. Analysts are also starting to take bold positions. Rosenblatt’s Kevin Garrigan maintains a Street-high price target of $70 for IonQ, highlighting the stock as a promising way to ride the quantum wave.

His bullish call reflects growing confidence in the company’s long-term roadmap, but with IonQ still far from that target, can the company’s technology and execution catch up with the market’s high hopes by 2025?
About IonQ Stock
IonQ is leading the charge in quantum innovation, drawing on over 20 years of academic research to bring trapped-ion quantum computing into practical use. Unlike other approaches, IonQ’s method leverages ionized atoms, enabling longer and more accurate computations with significantly fewer errors.
The company has quickly become a key player in the quantum race, with its Forte and Forte Enterprise systems already driving major performance gains for partners like Amazon (AMZN), AstraZeneca (AZN), and Nvidia (NVDA). With bold plans to scale up to 2 million qubits by 2030, IonQ aims to tackle complex challenges across various industries, from drug discovery to defense.
Valued at roughly $12.9 billion by market capitalization, IonQ has seen its stock surge an astonishing 509% over the past year, blowing past the broader S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX)15.5% gain in the same timeframe.
What Do Analysts Think About IonQ Stock?
Wall Street’s confidence in IonQ is gaining momentum, with analysts growing increasingly bullish on its quantum potential. On July 29, Rosenblatt initiated coverage with a “Buy” rating and a Street-high $70 price target, calling IonQ a prime way to tap into what analysts describe as the “next era of computing.” Led by Kevin Garrigan, the analyst team believes the quantum market won’t be dominated by a single winner, and IonQ is firmly in the race to be one of the frontrunners.",758d0c3f40e97dd69717c6f5baf93bce,trafilatura

The stock mirrored the rally in both silver and gold prices, following July inflation data that solidified expectations for an interest rate cut.

Typically, prices of precious metals such as silver and gold rise when the central bank lowers interest rates, as it makes yields from bonds and savings less attractive, thus shifting funds to non-yielding and safer assets.

This unexpected rally, fueled by cost discipline, margin improvements, rising proprietary-brand and Sephora sales, and even meme-stock momentum, has reignited investor interest.
However, Kohl’s still faces structural headwinds from ongoing same-store sales declines, lingering management turnover, and a fragile retail landscape. So, let’s analyze whether the surge reflects durable strength or a fleeting market reaction.

About Kohl’s Stock
Kohl’s is a prominent American department store chain headquartered in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. The company operates over 1,100 stores nationwide alongside a growing e-commerce platform and has a market cap of $1.8 billion. Its product offerings span several key segments: apparel; footwear; accessories and jewelry; beauty and personal care; and home goods, including furniture, décor, and household items.
Kohl’s share price stands at $15.20 as of Friday afternoon, following a remarkable 24% intraday surge on Aug. 27 after the retailer topped Wall Street’s fiscal second-quarter earnings expectations and revised its guidance. This powerful rally helped erase much of the weakness seen earlier in the year, and the stock now reflects an 8.16% year-to-date (YTD) return, signaling a sharp turnaround from its prior stumbles.
Despite this recovery, Kohl’s remains well below its 52-week peak of $21.39 reached on July 22, following a 37.6% single-day surge amid meme-stock–style activity and heavy short interest. The stock is down by 22% over the past year.
While the stock is trading at a premium compared to industry peers at 37.70 times forward earnings, it is trading below the sector median in terms of price/sales (P/S) ratio at 0.09.
Kohl’s Q2 Results Surpassed Projections
Kohl’s released its second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings on Aug. 27, covering the period that ended on Aug. 2. Despite a challenging environment, the company delivered adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56, significantly above analysts’ expectations but below the prior-year quarter value of $0.59.",c211cd5a3430805132ffdd953fcbf4ca,trafilatura

As it turns out, they’re exceptionally good at saving. In fact, many of their financial decisions are genius strategies for creating lasting wealth.
Find Out: 3 Best Ways To Prioritize Your Savings Goals
Read Next: How Much Money Is Needed To Be Considered Middle Class in Your State?
Below experts outline some of the ways they’re able to save tons of money.
Prioritizing Strategic Investments
“From what I’ve observed working with affluent clients, one of the most effective ways wealthy people save money is by focusing on strategic investments,” said Shirley Mueller, finance expert and founder of VA Loans Texas.
“They understand the power of compounding and often prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs, 401(k) plans and health savings accounts (HSAs) to maximize their returns while minimizing tax liabilities.”
She also noted that many also leverage tools like trusts and charitable giving strategies to reduce tax exposure, creating long-term savings while supporting causes they care about.
“This level of planning reflects their focus on building sustainable wealth rather than chasing short-term gains,” Mueller added.
Try This: 9 Downsizing Tips for the Middle Class To Save on Monthly Expenses
Mastering the Art of Negotiation and Rewards
According to Mueller, wealthy individuals rarely pay full price for anything, even when they can afford to.
“They are skilled negotiators, whether they’re buying property, financing a home or making high-ticket purchases,” she said.
The expert noted many also take full advantage of rewards programs tied to credit cards or memberships.
“I’ve seen clients use travel rewards or cashback bonuses in ways that significantly offset their expenses,” Mueller explained. “For them, it’s about maximizing value on every dollar spent, an approach that helps them save thousands without cutting corners on their lifestyle.”
Valuing Maintenance Over Replacement
“Another subtle habit I’ve noticed among wealthy clients is their commitment to maintenance,” Mueller said. “They understand that taking care of what they already own — whether it’s a home, car or investment property — saves money over time by avoiding costly repairs or replacements.”
For example, routine home maintenance can prevent expensive structural issues down the road.
Similarly, she said they approach personal finances with this mindset, regularly reviewing their budgets, portfolios, and insurance coverage to ensure everything is optimized and aligned with their goals.",b08bb4888c9f11cf2f3789e25dc5aeaf,trafilatura

Simply stated, they provide traders tools that regular equity ownership can’t provide.
In most cases, the strategy for market participation is purely binary: either you’re long the security in question or you’re not long (as in, you’re not participating in the opportunity at all). Of course, you can choose to short a position but that comes with incredible financial risks. As such, most retail folks wisely avoid this route.
On the other hand, options deliver directional flexibility. Sure, many point to the leveraged long and short strategies available. However, what I appreciate is the ability to be bullish or bearish from either a debit (cash outlay) or credit (cash influx) position.
Further, options provide strategic flexibility. Not all ideas may offer a clear directional trajectory over an indefinite period. Or in other cases, the anticipated move may only be minimal. With the geometry of particular transactions — such as bull call spreads — traders can potentially extract huge payouts from relatively small swings.
Of course, options tend to intimidate newcomers because of the jargon-rich environment. Here’s the deal with the Greeks and other complex concepts in the derivatives space: they provide information but they won’t automatically help you be a successful trader.
To actually make money trading, you have to think like a quarterback. You’re going to identify the coverage, exploit any vulnerabilities and hit your target. Here’s your game plan for the next several weeks.
Super Micro Computer (SMCI)
First up on our hit list is Super Micro Computer (SMCI). As with most technical analysts, we’re going to operate with the reasonable presupposition that the market has already priced in all publicly available information for SMCI stock. But rather than relying on interpretive signals, we’re going to look for empirical, falsifiable patterns.
But before we dive into the good stuff, we’ve got to establish a baseline expectation for SMCI stock. Using path-dependent analytics — which takes into account SMCI’s aggregate pricing data — we can map out the security’s expected drift. Over the next 10 weeks and assuming no special mispricing, Super Micro may fluctuate somewhere between about $42.50 and $44.20.
However, in the past 10 weeks, the market has voted to buy SMCI stock six times and sell four times. Moreover, the stock incurred a downward trajectory, despite the balance of accumulative sessions outweighing distributive. Historically, this sequence — which can be classified as 6-4-D — has represented a near-term reversal.
What’s more, the conditional drift associated with this sequence features a much wider range with a positive skew, landing between $44 and over $49.
In football terms, the market makers are positioned in an aggressive Cover 1 defense, with only one dedicated defender covering the deep ball. As such, using data provided by Barchart Premier, I’d take a look at the 42/44 bull call spread expiring Oct. 17.
If SMCI stock rises 5.92% from now to the expiration date, you can collect a maximum payout of over 117%.
Cardinal Health (CAH)
Next on our list is Cardinal Health (CAH). One of the standout names in the healthcare services industry, Cardinal has witnessed its shares rise nearly 26% since the start of this year. However, since the second half of 2025, CAH stock is down more than 11%, potentially offering contrarians a discount.
Using pathway-dependent analytics, the natural drift associated with CAH stock may see it range between a median low of $150.59 to a median high of $155.25 over the next 10 weeks. However, CAH has also printed a 3-7-D sequence: three up weeks, seven down weeks, with an overall downward trajectory. Historically, this sequence tends to be a sentiment reversal rather than a bearish continuation pattern.
Even more enticing, the projected drift of the 3-7-D may see CAH stock ranging between $165 and over $175. Again, I would classify market makers as being positioned in an aggressive Cover 1 defense, with the focus being on putting more defenders in the box to stop the run.
Such a scheme leaves market makers vulnerable to the long ball and that’s what we’re going to aim for with the 155/160 bull spread expiring Oct. 17. If CAH stock rises 7.54% from now to expiration, the max payout for the aforementioned trade clocks in at over 122%.
Groupon (GRPN)
Without hesitation, Groupon (GRPN) is easily the riskiest idea on this list. It’s not just about the volatility and overall wildness of GRPN stock, although it’s liable to take people on quite a journey. Sure, on a year-to-date basis, GRPN is up nearly 115%. However, in the trailing month, it also slipped almost 18%. Still, there could be a case for a discount here.
Again, using pathway-dependent analytics, the natural drift associated with GRPN stock may see it range between a median low of roughly $24.27 and a median high of $26.42. However, GRPN has also printed a 3-7-D sequence: three up weeks, seven down weeks, negative trajectory. When this sequence flashes, there’s a 55.9% chance that the following week’s price action results in upside.
Moreover, the conditional drift associated with the 3-7-D may see the price range from around $23 to $32. This range engulfs GRPN’s baseline or aggregate drift, which means that there’s potential opportunity on the upside but also sizable risk to the downside.
As mentioned earlier, in football terms, market makers are positioned in an aggressive Cover 1 defensive scheme. However, in GRPN’s case, some of the defenders are also showing blitz. That’s going to leave the middle of the field open — assuming you don’t get sacked.
If you’re feeling gutsy, I’d take a look at the 28/30 bull spread expiring Oct. 17. You’ll need a 15% move but this would translate to a nearly 208% payout if successful.

Ren, an IT contractor for financial institutions, recently discovered a problem that has little to do with his work performance and everything to do with his FICO score.
He told The Ramsey Show he's involved in security work for banks, and his FICO score is one of the things directly tied to his job.

Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP
After paying off his car loan — a financial milestone most people would celebrate — Ren watched his score drop below 700. Now, under the terms of his contract, he fears that it could put his future at risk. But Dave Ramsey insists that's not true.
“You have to look at who’s using this, saying, ‘Listen, if you guys are so corporate and stupid, that the only measure of financial wellness that you have is a FICO score … and you’re calling me financially irresponsible — you’re stupid,” Dave Ramsey said. “When you get up in their grill, they’re going to cave like a Walmart tent.”
The Missouri caller’s concerns raise a bigger question that matters for many workers: Could a credit score actually cost you your job?
Can you get fired over a credit score?
Here’s the nuance: employers or clients cannot access your actual FICO score, though they may request a version of your credit report. And that requires your written permission.
That said, some industries, especially finance, defense and government contracting, do tie employment eligibility to creditworthiness. Companies may use credit reports to evaluate “character” or “financial responsibility,” particularly for roles involving access to sensitive data or money, as in Ren's case.
While rare, these reviews can influence hiring, contracting or retention in regulated fields. So technically, Ren’s client isn’t checking his score but rather his credit report shows closed accounts and a less active credit history, which they could still interpret negatively.
Why did his score drop after paying off debt?
Ren’s frustration comes from an ironic reality: Paying off loans can hurt your score in the short term.
According to myFICO, closing a long-standing account, like an auto loan, reduces both your credit mix and your length of credit history, which make up 10% and 15% of your score.",c8b8f2771f654b957766fe0bc1d1d0c3,trafilatura

Altman's logic for not getting equity in his own company is that it was his ""childhood dream job,"" he said during the DealBook Summit. He also said that he enjoyed ""getting to sit in the room with the smartest researchers in the world and go on this crazy adventure.""
Not accumulating equity in OpenAI could have helped Altman work with more talented workers and investors who wanted a slice of the pie. OpenAI was also originally a nonprofit, and he had to preserve a majority disinterested board to maintain nonprofit status. He admitted this detail during an ""All-In"" podcast interview in May 2024.
It is shocking to see a tech founder not own any equity in their company, especially one as large as OpenAI. However, there is speculation that Altman can receive equity in the future. Reuters reported that Altman would receive equity in the company last year after its corporate restructuring from a nonprofit to a for-profit company. CNBC reported less than a week later that Altman told OpenAI staff that he would not receive a ""giant equity stake' in the company.

Sam Altman Was Already Rich
OpenAI was Sam Altman's biggest hit, but it wasn't his first rodeo. In fact, he's worth approximately $2 billion due to a string of good investments and startups. Forbes chronicled Altman's path to wealth, which includes early stakes in companies like Stripe, Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) and Helion, a nuclear fusion firm.
Before making those big investments in early-stage tech giants, he dropped out of Stanford to start Loopt, a social mapping company that he sold in 2012 for $43 million. Those funds went into his own venture fund that made those early investments. He also became a partner at startup accelerator Y Combinator, and served as its president from 2014 to 2019.",0db3bc8eccee1085e21662f9807f0013,trafilatura
