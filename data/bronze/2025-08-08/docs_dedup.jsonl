(NYSE: EGY, LSE: EGY) (“Vaalco” or the “Company”) today reported operational and financial results for the second quarter of 2025.\nSecond Quarter 2025 Highlights and Recent Key Items:\n-\nReported net income of $8.4 million ($0.08 per diluted share), Adjusted Net Income(1) of $2.3 million ($0.02 per diluted share) and Adjusted EBITDAX(1) of $49.9 million;\n-\nProduced 16,956 net revenue interest (“NRI”)(2) barrels of oil equivalent per day (“BOEPD”), above the high end of guidance, or 21,654 working interest (“WI”)(3) BOEPD, toward the high end of guidance;\n-\nSold 19,393 NRI BOEPD, above the high end of guidance;\n-\nReported a net cash(4) position of $7.9 million that did not include approximately $24.0 million of cash receivables that was collected in July 2025;\n-\nReiterated full year guidance which previously included a reduction to capital expenditures in Q1 2025 by approximately 10%, without impacting full year production or sales guidance; and\n-\nDeclared quarterly cash dividend of $0.0625 per share of common stock to be paid on September 19, 2025.\n(1) Adjusted EBITDAX, Adjusted Net Income Capital and Free Cash Flow are Non-GAAP financial measures and are described and reconciled to the closest GAAP measure in the attached table under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n(2) All NRI sales and production rates are Vaalco's working interest volumes less royalty volumes, where applicable.\n(3) All WI production rates and volumes are Vaalco's working interest volumes, where applicable.\n(4) Net cash is defined as cash and cash equivalents less long-term debt.\nGeorge Maxwell, Vaalco’s Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We continue to consistently deliver successful quarterly results that either meet or exceed our guidance. Both our sales and NRI production for the second quarter of 2025 were above the high end of guidance, leading to solid net income of $0.08 per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAX of $49.9 million. We continue to execute our strategic vision as we prepare for multiple production enhancing drilling campaigns across our diversified asset base. In Côte d’Ivoire, the FPSO refurbishment project is well underway, with the vessel at the shipyard in Dubai and we are preparing for a drilling campaign in 2026 to augment the production and economic life of the Baobab field. In Gabon, we are preparing for the 2025\/2026 drilling program which is expected to begin near the end of Q3 2025 as we wait for the drilling rig to complete its current commitments. In Egypt, we continue to efficiently drill wells and the success of the program in the first half of the year is expected to lead to incremental projects in the second half of 2025. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we entered into a new reserves-based credit facility that will supplement our internally-generated cash flow and cash balance to assist in funding our robust organic growth projects. In the second quarter we drew on this facility, as planned, and will continue to utilize it to assist in our growth plans.”\n“We believe that we are well positioned to fund the significant growth and opportunities that we have planned over the next few years which should lead to even greater growth and value for the remainder of the decade. In May, we provided additional details at our Capital Markets Day regarding the meaningful upside that we believe is available to drive future organic growth and support our commitment to consistent shareholder returns. Our track record of success in delivering results at or above expectations should provide our investors with assurance that we will execute on the portfolio of opportunities we discussed in the Capital Markets Day presentation.”\nOperational Update\nGabon\nThe Company secured a drilling rig in December 2024 for its 2025\/2026 drilling program, which is expected to begin near the end of Q3 2025 as we wait for the drilling rig to complete its current commitments. The program includes drilling multiple development wells, and appraisal or exploration wells, and perform workovers, with options to drill additional wells. Vaalco plans to drill the wells at both the Etame platform and at its Seent platform, as well as a re-drill and several workovers in the Ebouri field to access production and reserves that were previously removed from proved reserves due to the presence of hydrogen sulfide.\nIn July 2025, the Company performed planned, staged shutdowns of the Gabon platforms to perform safety inspections and necessary maintenance to increase the integrity and reliability of the assets.\nEgypt\nThe drilling campaign in Egypt, which commenced in December 2024, continued through Q2 2025. During the quarter, Vaalco completed six wells and three of the wells drilled during Q2 2025 will be hydraulically fractured in Q3 2025. Based on detailed analysis completed in Q1 2025 to evaluate the well inventory potential, a series of workover re-completions, re-activations and well optimizations have also been carried out resulting in an incremental production gain.\nCanada\nIn 2024, Vaalco drilled and completed five horizontal wells in Canada, with all laterals being greater than two miles long. These wells continue to meet production expectations and the Company is monitoring their longer-term performance for future drilling opportunities. In 2025, the Company has decided to defer the drilling of additional wells in Canada to reduce the Company's overall capital expenditures.\nCôte d'Ivoire\nAs part of the planned dry dock refurbishment, the Baobab Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (“FPSO”) vessel ceased hydrocarbon production on January 31, 2025 and the final lifting of crude oil from the FPSO took place in February 2025. The vessel departed from the field in late March 2025 and arrived at the shipyard in Dubai ahead of schedule in mid-May 2025. The FPSO refurbishment is now underway in the shipyard. A rig has been secured for significant development drilling which is expected to begin in 2026 after the FPSO returns to service bringing meaningful additions to production from the main Baobab field in CI-40. The Company is also evaluating the anticipated impact of the potential future development of the Kossipo field, which is also on the CI-40 license.\nEquatorial Guinea\nVaalco owns a 60% working interest in an undeveloped portion of Block P offshore Equatorial Guinea where it is the designated operator. The Company has an existing plan of development of the Venus field discovery on Block P, which focuses on key areas of drilling evaluations, facilities design, market inquiries and metocean review. The Company completed a Front End Engineering and Design study and is currently targeting a Final Investment Decision by the end of 2025.\nFinancial Update – Second Quarter of 2025\nVaalco reported net income of $8.4 million ($0.08 per diluted share) for Q2 2025 which was up compared with net income of $7.7 million ($0.07 per diluted share) in Q1 2025 and down 70% compared with net income of $28.2 million ($0.27 per diluted share) in Q2 2024. The increase in earnings compared with Q1 2025 was driven by higher sales volume in Q2 2025 of 1,765 MBOE compared to a sales volume of 1,717 MBOE in Q1 2025 and lower production expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) and lower income tax expense partially offset by lower realized pricing driven by a decrease in oil market index prices.\nAdjusted EBITDAX totaled $49.9 million in Q2 2025, a 12% decrease from $57.0 million in Q1 2025. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized pricing offset by higher sales volumes and lower production expense. Adjusted EBITDAX was down 31% from $72.5 million generated in Q2 2024 primarily due to lower realized pricing.\nIn Q2 2025, Vaalco had a net revenue decrease of $13.4 million or 12% compared to Q1 2025 primarily due to lower average realized price received of $54.87 per barrel in Q2 2025 compared to $64.27 per barrel in Q1 2025, offset by an increase in the total NRI sales volumes of 1,765 MBOE which was 3% higher than the Q1 2025 volumes of 1,717 MBOE but was flat compared to 1,764 MBOE for Q2 2024. Q2 2025 NRI sales were above the high end of Vaalco’s guidance.\nTotal production expense (excluding offshore workovers and stock compensation) of $40.3 million in Q2 2025 decreased by 10% compared to Q1 2025 and 23% compared to Q2 2024. The decrease in Q2 2025 compared to Q1 2025 and Q2 2024 was driven by a reduction in production expenses in the Côte d’Ivoire segment.\nDD&A expense for Q2 2025 was $28.3 million, which was 7% lower than $30.3 million in Q1 2025 and 15% lower than $33.1 million in Q2 2024. The decrease in Q2 2025 DD&A expense compared to Q1 2025 and Q2 2024 is due primarily to a reduction in DD&A expenses in the Côte d’Ivoire segment.\nGeneral and administrative (“G&A”) expense, excluding stock-based compensation, decreased to $7.1 million in Q2 2025 from $7.8 million in Q1 2025 due to lower salaries and wages, IT expense and other expenses and increased from $6.6 million in Q2 2024. The increase in G&A expenses compared to Q2 2024 was primarily due to higher professional service fees, salaries and wages, and accounting and legal fees. Q2 2025 cash G&A was within the Company’s guidance.\nNon-cash stock-based compensation expense was $1.4 million for Q2 2025 flat compared to Q1 2025 and higher compared to $0.9 million for Q2 2024.\nExploration expense was $2.5 million for Q2 2025 which was attributable to the purchase of seismic data to be used in Block 705 in Cote d’Ivoire. There were no exploration costs incurred in Q1 2025 or Q2 2024.\nOther income (expense), net, was an expense of $1.8 million for Q2 2025, compared to an expense of $2.4 million for Q1 2025 and income of $17.1 million during Q2 2024. Other income (expense), net, normally consists of foreign currency losses and interest expense, net. In Q2 2024, there was a $19.9 million bargain purchase gain associated with the Svenska acquisition offset by $3.1 million in transaction costs related to the Svenska acquisition.\nIncome tax expense (benefit) was an expense for Q2 2025 of $7.0 million which includes a $3.1 million favorable oil price adjustment as a result of the change in value of the government of Gabon's allocation of Profit Oil between the time it was produced and the time it was taken in-kind. After excluding this impact, income taxes were $10.1 million for the period. Income tax expense for Q2 2024 was an expense of $9.3 million. This expense is comprised of current tax expense of $10.4 million including a $1.1 million favorable oil price adjustment as a result of the change in value of the government of Gabon's allocation of Profit Oil between the time it was produced and the time it was taken in-kind. After excluding this impact, current income taxes were $10.4 million for the period.\nTaxes paid by jurisdiction are as follows:\nFinancial Update - First Six Months of 2025\nWI Sales for the first six months of 2025 increased to 4,358 MBOE compared to 4,134 MBOE in the first six months of 2024. The increase was driven primarily by timing, number and size of crude oil liftings in each quarter and do not always coincide with volumes produced in any given period.\nThe average realized crude oil price for the first six months of 2025 was $65.62 per barrel, representing a decrease of 12% from $74.75 realized in the first six months of 2024. This decrease in crude oil price reflects the softening of commodity prices over the past year.\nThe Company reported net income for the first six months of 2025 of $16.1 million, which compares to $35.8 million for the first six months of 2024. The decrease in net income for the six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 was primarily due to the bargain purchase gain related to the Svenska acquisition completed in April 2024, along with lower realized pricing in 2025.\nCapital Investments\/Balance Sheet\nFor the second quarter of 2025, net capital expenditures totaled $45.9 million on a cash basis and $40.9 million on an accrual basis. These expenditures were primarily related to project costs and long-lead items for Gabon, Egypt and Côte d'Ivoire and the development drilling program in Egypt.\nOn June 30, 2025, Vaalco had an unrestricted cash balance of $67.9 million. During July 2025, the Company received cash payments of current receivables totaling approximately $24.0 million, primarily related to collection of approximately $19.0 million receivable for the lifting that occurred in Gabon in late June and approximately $5.0 million received from EGPC. Working capital at June 30, 2025 was $62.8 million compared with $56.2 million at December 31, 2024, while Adjusted Working Capital at June 30, 2025 totaled $79.9 million.\nIn March 2025, Vaalco entered into a new reserves based revolving credit facility (the “new facility”) with an initial commitment of $190 million and the ability to grow to $300 million, led by The Standard Bank of South Africa Limited, Isle of Man Branch with other participating banks and financial partners. The new facility, which is subject to customary administrative conditional precedents, replaces the Company’s previously undrawn revolving credit facility. The Company arranged the new facility primarily to provide short-term funding that may be needed from time-to-time to supplement its internally generated cash flow and cash balance as it executes its planned investment programs across its diversified asset base over the next few years. As of June 30, 2025, the Company had $60.0 million outstanding borrowings.\nQuarterly Cash Dividend\nVaalco paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.0625 per share of common stock for the second quarter of 2025 on June 27, 2025. The Company also recently announced its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.0625 per share of common stock for the third quarter of 2025 ($0.25 annualized), to be paid on September 19, 2025 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 22, 2025. Future declarations of quarterly dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to approval by the Vaalco Board of Directors.\nHedging\nThe Company continued to hedge a portion of its expected future production to lock in strong cash flow generation to assist in funding its capital and shareholder return programs.\nThe following includes hedges remaining in place as of the end of the second quarter of 2025:\n(a) One gigajoule (GJ) equals one billion joules (J). A gigajoule of natural gas is approximately 25.5 cubic meters standard conditions.\nThe table below presents commodity swaps entered into subsequent to June 30, 2025.\n2025 Guidance:\nThe Company has provided third quarter 2025 guidance and full year 2025 guidance. All of the quarterly and annual guidance is detailed in the tables below.\nConference Call\nAs previously announced, the Company will hold a conference call to discuss its second quarter 2025 financial and operating results, Friday, August 8, 2025, at 9:00 a.m. Central Time (10:00 a.m. Eastern Time and 3:00 p.m. London Time).

Where a forward-looking statement expresses or implies an expectation or belief as to future events or results, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis. All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “aim,” “target,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “may,” “likely,” “plan” and “probably” or similar words may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements in this press release include, but are not limited to, statements relating to (i) estimates of future drilling, production, sales and costs of acquiring crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; (ii) expectations regarding Vaalco's ability to effectively integrate assets and properties it has acquired as a result of the Svenska acquisition into its operations; (iii) expectations regarding future exploration and the development, growth and potential of Vaalco’s operations, project pipeline and investments, and schedule and anticipated benefits to be derived therefrom; (iv) expectations regarding future acquisitions, investments or divestitures; (v) expectations of future dividends; (vi) expectations of future balance sheet strength; and (vii) expectations of future equity and enterprise value.\nSuch forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from ...future results expressed, projected or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: risks relating to any unforeseen liabilities of Vaalco; the ability to generate cash flows that, along with cash on hand, will be sufficient to support operations and cash requirements; risks relating to the timing and costs of completion for scheduled maintenance of the FPSO servicing the Baobab field; and the risks described under the caption “Risk Factors” in Vaalco’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDividends beyond the third quarter of 2025 have not yet been approved or declared by the Board of Directors for Vaalco. The declaration and payment of future dividends remains at the discretion of the Board and will be determined based on Vaalco’s financial results, balance sheet strength, cash and liquidity requirements, future prospects, crude oil and natural gas prices, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. The Board reserves all powers related to the declaration and payment of dividends. Consequently, in determining the dividend to be declared and paid on Vaalco common stock, the Board may revise or terminate the payment level at any time without prior notice.\nAny forward-looking statement made by Vaalco in this press release is based only on information currently available to Vaalco and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Except as may be required by applicable securities laws, Vaalco undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\nOther Oil and Gas Advisories\nInvestors are cautioned when viewing BOEs in isolation. BOE conversion ratio is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalencies described above, utilizing such equivalencies may be incomplete as an indication of value.\nInside Information\nThis announcement contains inside information as defined in Regulation (EU) No. 596\/2014 on market abuse which is part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“MAR”) and is made in accordance with the Company’s obligations under article 17 of MAR. The person responsible for arranging the release of this announcement on behalf of Vaalco is Matthew Powers, Corporate Secretary of Vaalco.\nVAALCO ENERGY, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(Unaudited)\nVAALCO ENERGY, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n(Unaudited)\nVAALCO ENERGY, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n(Unaudited)\nVAALCO ENERGY, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nSelected Financial and Operating Statistics\n(Unaudited)\n*Offshore workover costs excluded for Q2 2025, Q2 2024, and Q1 2025 are $0.0 million, $0.1 million and $0.0 million, respectively.\n*Stock compensation associated with production expense excluded for Q2 2025, Q2 2024, and Q1 2025 are immaterial.\n**General and administrative expenses include $0.78, $0.51 and $0.76 per barrel of oil related to stock-based compensation expense for Q2 2025, Q2 2024, and Q1 2025, respectively.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nManagement uses Adjusted Net Income to evaluate operating and financial performance and believes the measure is useful to investors because it eliminates the impact of certain non-cash and\/or other items that management does not consider to be indicative of the Company’s performance from period to period. Management also believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors to evaluate and compare the Company’s operating and financial performance across periods, as well as to facilitate comparisons to others in the Company’s industry. Adjusted Net Income is a non-GAAP financial measure and as used herein represents net income, plus deferred income tax expense (benefit), unrealized derivative instrument loss (gain), bargain purchase gain on the Svenska Acquisition, FPSO demobilization, transaction costs related to the Svenska acquisition and non-cash and other items.\nAdjusted EBITDAX is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by Vaalco’s management and by external users of the Company’s financial statements, such as industry analysts, lenders, rating agencies, investors and others who follow the industry. Management believes the measure is useful to investors because it is as an indicator of the Company’s ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. Adjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP financial measure and as used herein represents net income, plus interest expense (income) net, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation, depletion and amortization, exploration expense, FPSO demobilization, non-cash and other items including stock compensation expense, bargain purchase gain on the Svenska Acquisition, other operating (income) expense, net, non-cash purchase price adjustment, transaction costs related to acquisition, credit losses and other and unrealized derivative instrument loss (gain).\nManagement uses Adjusted Working Capital as a transition tool to assess the working capital position of the Company’s continuing operations excluding leasing obligations because it eliminates the impact of discontinued operations as well as the impact of lease liabilities. Under the applicable lease accounting standards, lease liabilities related to assets used in joint operations include both the Company’s share of expenditures as well as the share of lease expenditures which its non-operator joint venture owners’ will be obligated to pay under joint operating agreements. Adjusted Working Capital is a non-GAAP financial measure and as used herein represents working capital excluding working capital attributable to discontinued operations and current liabilities associated with lease obligations.\nManagement uses Free Cash Flow to evaluate financial performance and to determine the total amount of cash over a specified period available to be used in connection with returning cash to shareholders, and believes the measure is useful to investors because it provides the total amount of net cash available for returning cash to shareholders by adding cash generated from operating activities, subtracting amounts used in financing and investing activities, effects of exchange rate changes on cash and adding back amounts used for dividend payments and stock repurchases. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and as used herein represents net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and adds the amounts paid under dividend distributions and share repurchases over a specified period.\nFree Cash Flow has significant limitations, including that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary purposes and should not be used as a substitute for cash flow measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Free Cash Flow should not be considered as a substitute for cashflows from operating activities before discontinued operations or any other liquidity measure presented in accordance with GAAP. Free Cash Flow may vary among other companies. Therefore, the Company’s Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Net Income have significant limitations, including that they do not reflect the Company’s cash requirements for capital expenditures, contractual commitments, working capital or debt service. Adjusted EBITDAX, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Working Capital and Free Cash Flow should not be considered as substitutes for net income (loss), operating income (loss), cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Net Income exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) and operating income (loss), and the calculation of these measures may vary among other companies. Therefore, the Company’s Adjusted EBITDAX, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Working Capital and Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nThe tables below reconcile the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDAX, Adjusted Working Capital and Free Cash Flow.\nVAALCO ENERGY, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands)\n(1) No adjustments to weighted average shares outstanding\nVAALCO ENERGY, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands)","content_hash":"819fdea41562e05a4865d0982b9e0954","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":27041,"method_rank":0}

How do you compare it to the average 401K participant? You're listening to the weekend Personal Finance edition of Motley Fool Money. I'm Robert Brokamp. We're doing a trial run of something a bit different for our Saturday episodes in which per usual, we feature a guest interview, and this week, I speak with Martha Kortiak Mert of savingforcollege.com about the newly expanded uses of 529's and how to choose the right plan for you. But then I'll also offer some other personal finance tidbits and tricks. Let's kick things off with three items from the news in a segment we're calling last week in Money. First up, they say that comparison is the thief of joy. But that doesn't stop us from doing it, especially when it comes to our bunny. If you're curious how your 401K behavior stacks up to the average workers, Vanguard has some answers, and it's recently released, How America Saves Report, based on analysis of all the retirement plans with the firm in 2024. Here are some highlights. The amount you have in your 401K is highly dependent on how long you've been contributing.\nHere are the median account balances based on job tenure. For people who have been on the job for 2-3 years, the median account balance is a bit more than $20,000, 4-6 years, a bit more than $44,000, 7-9, almost $73,000, and more than 10 years, almost $166,000. How much are workers contributing to their accounts? Well, the median savings rate is 6.8% just from the worker, and it's 11.5% when you include the employer match. Now, that's below the 15% savings rate that really most experts recommend nowadays, which means many folks might be behind in saving for retirement. Those workers might consider maxing out their accounts, and the limit this year is 23,500. Then when they turn 50, contributing even more with catchup contributions up to $7,500 or starting this year, 11,250 if you're 60-63 years old. What percentage of workers with Vanguard 401Ks took full advantage of their accounts last year? Well, 14% max out their accounts, and 16% of the 15 and older crowd made catch up contributions.\nOf course, it really doesn't matter how you compare to the average person. What really matters is whether you're on track to retire, when and how you want. To figure that out, you can start by using a good online calculator. One to consider is the CalcXML comprehensive retirement planning module. Just do an online search for it. You'll know you've found it if it has 606 as the last three numbers in its URL. Next item on our agenda, article from the Wall Street Journal, Jason Zweig, who highlighted the woes of small cap stocks. Over the past century, small caps have outperformed large caps by two percentage points annually on average, but not so much recently. In his article, Zweig cited the following staff from Steven DeSantis and Equity Strategist at Jeffrey's. Small caps have trailed large caps by more than seven percentage points over the last decade, which is the widest gap since 1935. Accordingly, money is just flowing out of ETFs that invested small US stocks while money is just pouring into the ETFs attract US large companies. This also means that small caps are a good bit cheaper.\nThe Russell 2000 Index of small companies trades at a price to earnings multiple that is almost nine points lower than the S&P 500 PE. Iger argues, it might be time to go against the grade and grab some bargains by buying some small caps, which you can do pretty easily with a low cost ETF, such as the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF, Ticker VTWO or the iShares CR S&P Small Cap ETF, Ticker IJR. Finally, we come to the number of the week, and that number is $435,300. That is the median price of an existing home that was sold in June an all time high, according to a report published last week by the International Association of Realtors, but while prices are up, sales volume is actually down 2.7%, and year over year inventory is up more than 15%. There's a bit of a slowdown in the real estate market. Growth of prices has boderated somewhat this year, and it took a bit of a dip in 2022. But anyone who owns a home that they bought more than a few years ago is likely sitting on some pretty nice gains. According to the Case Shiller National Home Price Index, home prices are up 49% over the past five years, 91% over the past decade, and 146% since the bottom of the housing crash in February of 2012.\nPutting a kid through college can easily cost well over $100,000. One way to prepare for that cost is by contributing to a 529 college savings plan. But how do you choose the right one? Here to provide some pointers is Martha Kortiak Mert, author and COO at savingforcollege.com. Martha, welcome to Motley Fool Money.\nMartha Kortiak Mert: Hello. Thanks for having me.\nRobert Brokamp: The benefit of 529 savings plans is that the growth and withdrawals are tax free, as long as the money is used for qualified expenses, and that used to mean pretty much just college costs. But the list of qualified expenses just keeps growing, including this month, thanks to the big beautiful bill that was passed on July 4. Let's start by telling us a little bit about what a 529 can actually be used for.\nMartha Kortiak Mert: Sure thing, and you're right. That list is actually pretty long right now. Let's start with when your child is young. A few years ago, added to the list of qualified expenses was K-12 tuition. But with the passage of the one big beautiful bill, you now pay for a lot more than just tuition at the K-12 level. You can pay for curricular materials, online materials, private tutoring. You can also once your kid is in high school, you can pay for things like standardized tests, SAT exams, ACT. Those were things that people would often ask about, can I use my 529 plan to pay for this. Finally, the answer now is yes. At the K through 12 level, withdrawals have been limited to $10,000 per year per beneficiary. That is going up to $20,000 per year starting in January. That's just at the K-12 level. Then once you get post post secondary education, you can pay for college tuition, room and board, books, supplies, computers, software, things that you need for your course of study. But in addition, you can also pay for trade schools. You can pay for vocational education. Now you can pay for a range of credentialing and accreditations and continuing education as well. This can include things like welding certification programs, HVAC. There are a number of different programs that are now going to be considered eligible expenses for 529 plans, as well as, again, if you're in law school, if you study to become an accountant, any studies that you're doing for your certification or your accreditation, like a CPA exam or bar exam, you can also now use a 529 plan to pay for those exam fees as well as educational courses that you're doing for those exams.\nRobert Brokamp: A much broader range of uses. That might appealing to anyone who's listening to this, so they think, OK, I maybe should open a 529. The interesting thing is, though, they're unique. If you want to open an IRA, you'd have to decide, well, yeah, I can go to Schwab or Vanguard or Fidelity or whatever. But with 529, they're operated by states. You're like, well, do I go with Virginia or Utah or Alaska? How should someone go about choosing the right 529 for their student? Because you don't have to stick with your own states plan.\nMartha Kortiak Mert: No, absolutely. This creates a lot of confusion for people and it gives them a lot of choices, which can be a good thing, but sometimes too many choices makes things hard. For one thing, we suggest look at your states plan. Now almost 40 states offer some type of state tax benefit. Most of the time, you have to use your state's 529 plan to get the tax benefit, but not in all cases. Check if you are in a state where you have state income tax, check to see if your state offers a deduction or a credit for contributions that you make to a 529 plan and whether or not you have to use your own states plan to get that. If you are not in a state that offers a tax benefit, and even if you are in one that offers, check out and see, we actually have an article one our site that breaks us down how much is available and you can say, what's the actual benefit? You can see how much is that worth to you and look around and look at how different plans are rated. If you're in a state that maybe doesn't have the highest performing 529 plan. If your 529 plan doesn't offer some of the options that you'd be looking for to invest in, shop around, see what else is out there. There are close to 100, 529 plans of different kinds out there. About half of them or maybe a little over half are direct sold, meaning you can just go to the website and open those yourself. The remaining ones have to be opened for you by a financial advisor or broker.\nRobert Brokamp: You can transfer money from one 529 to another. Can you try to game the system? Can you like, I'm going to contribute to my state's mediocre plan to get that tax break, but then I'm going to transfer it to another 529, or is there a catch there somewhere?\nMartha Kortiak Mert: No catch. You can totally do that. The other thing that happens is people move states sometimes, so maybe you open your states plan for that tax benefit, then you move to another state. Depending where you're moving, you could transfer that money, or you can just keep it where it is and open a new 529 plan in that new state if that offers a tax benefit, as well. They're actually really flexible in that way. There's no reason that you only have to open one 529 plan if you have more than one child. It's probably a good idea to open a different one for each child. But for sure, you can max out your tax savings in your state tax benefit, and then open an additional one.\nRobert Brokamp: You mentioned ratings of 529 plans. A few people do it Morningstar does it, but you all do it at saving for college.com as well. What are some of the criteria you use when it comes to how you've ranked and rated 529 plans?\nMartha Kortiak Mert: Yeah, let's start with the rankings, because that sort of feeds into our overall ratings, as well. Our rankings are an analysis we do of how all the 529 plans perform, so what their investment returns have been. Now, of course, within a 529 plan, you have multiple choices of how to invest your money. You can choose from portfolio options that are, give you age based or target year options. You choose the one that corresponds to your child's age or the expected age of enrollment in college, and those funds will shift over time from more aggressive type of investments to more conservative investments as your child nears college age. But they also offer different single fund and static blends and things like that. You do have quite a range of investment options. How do we compare the performance of one 529 plan to another 529 plan? We have to find a way to normalize those things. What we do is, in this case, we look just at the age based and year of enrollment portfolios, and we basically calculate an average across the age range. What would your average return be at any given point in time from 0-18 plus years of age? Then we compare that average performance for all the different plants. That's how we rank which are the best performing 529 plans. That performance component is definitely a big component for people.\nWhen we think about the rating and how we rate 529 plans, we want to be able to rate them based on which are the plans that are going to most help you as a parent, as a grandparent, ensure that you're reaching your goals for your child or your grandchild. Their performance is a big element of that, but we also think about things like saving success. That means, does the plan offer different types of features that will enable you to save more? This can include things like, does it have a gifting feature? How easy is it for you to if your parent have grandparents, family and friends on birthdays and holidays, make gift contributions into the 529 plan in lieu of a toy, for example. Ease of use. How easy is it to enroll in the plan? This is a place a lot of people drop off during the enrollment process because they really just get stuck. It's hard for them to figure out what these different options are that are being offered, and ultimately program delivery. How likely do we think it is that a 529 program manager is going to continue to deliver excellence to their investors? Those are some of the things we look at. We use both publicly available information, and we also survey all the 529 plan program administrators with a series of questions that they provide answers to us.\nRobert Brokamp: You mentioned various relatives there. Some people may wonder, well, how does a 529 affect my financial aid eligibility? It comes down really to ownership. Tell us a little bit about the different financial aid treatment when the parent owns it versus the kid or maybe another relative like the grandparent.\nMartha Kortiak Mert: A 529 plan is considered on the financial aid form, the FAFSA form that you fill out for federal financial aid. Whether it's owned by the parent or the student, it is considered a parent asset. A maximum of 5.64% of that asset value is included in the FAFSA form, ultimately. You put the full amount, but what's actually considered in the calculation is just up to 5.64%. Basically, if you're saving in any way, whether that money is in mutual funds or in a bank account, that's going to be considered at the same rate. If you can save, that's not a reason to not open a 529 plan. If a grandparent is considering whether to contribute to the parents 529 plan or to open their own, the good news for grandparents now is that a grandparent 529 is not considered for financial aid purposes. Now, in the past, it used to be withdrawals that you made from a grandparent 529 plan and then used to help the student were considered as untaxed student income.\nThat was considered at a much higher rate, I think that was 20%. That has gone away. That untaxed income is no longer considered. Any cash support that's provided to the student from a grandparent or a family friend or other family member, that is not considered on the FAFSA. It does give an additional bump for grandparents that are trying to decide whether or not to open a 529 plan. The other thing to consider, too, or just to be aware of, really, if the parents are divorced, only one parent is filing the FAFSA form. That is the parent who provides most of the financial support to the student. If both parents have a 529 plan, the other parent, the 529 plan that they have for that same student would also not be reported on the FAFSA.\nRobert Brokamp: The whole grandparent thing, to me, feels like a huge loophole. It's basically completely ignored for financial aid purposes. Do you know why they made that change?\nMartha Kortiak Mert: I know that over time. I don't know exactly why that change was made. I know it was something, though, that had caused a lot of confusion over time. There was a whole strategy and loophole around how to use grandparent funds to pay for college without affecting financial aid, and so it used to be you would wait until the sophomore year to start withdrawing from a grandparent 529. There was a loophole there already, and a lot of people were aware of it, and that's gone away now, essentially, so I think made it a lot easier overall.\nRobert Brokamp: I say grandparent, but it's really anyone other than the parent doesn't have to be a grandparent. Let's move on to the final question. Are there any underappreciated or lesser known aspects of 529 accounts or just saving for college in general that you think more people should know about?\nMartha Kortiak Mert: Yeah. People are so concerned about what happens if I don't use it. I think especially in this day and age, where there is so much focus and emphasis on the value of a college degree, is it still worthwhile, especially given the student debt picture? A lot of people, they have a lot of uncertainty and trepidation around opening a 529 plan. For one thing, I do think that this expansion of benefits does help a lot because now you can say, look, your child is probably going to need something post high school, right, to make it in today's world. If that's not college, it's going to be something else. Really, there's not a great reason to not open a 529 plan. The other thing, we didn't really talk about, which I think people are aware of, but if you think about that tax benefit that you get of a 529 plan, we just focused on the state tax benefits.\nBut of course, the really big benefit of a 529 plan is that those withdrawals that you're making come out federal tax free and state tax free. As long as it's being spent on qualified education expenses, we went through that list earlier. It's a pretty expansive list. That can add up to thousands of dollars. You could put the money in a mutual fund. You're going to be taxed along the way. In the case of a 529 plan, all that tax is deferred, and you are going to have to pay thousands of dollars every time you're taking withdrawals are. You're going to pay the capital gains tax rate, I should say. Depending on how much you have in there and how much you've earned over time, you're basically, you can't count on every dollar that you see in your account going to pay for college. With 529 plans, I think that's really the beauty of it that every dollar, when you go and look at your account statement online, every dollar that you see there can go toward education, and that's pretty huge. I think there are other flexibilities, you can transfer to another beneficiary if you end up. If you're in the enviable position of having more in your 529 plan than you need. The other actually pretty recent development that we didn't talk about that is huge is if you do end up with leftover money in your 529 plan. You can now transfer up to $35,000 to a Roth IRA for your beneficiary. You have to do it within the Roth IRA rules. You can only transfer so much up to the transfer limit each year. But that's a great way to jump start your kids retirement savings, as well. If you end up not spending or not spending all the money. I really encourage people to not delay, start early, put money away regularly. It's just I've heard from so many parents, friends of mine that say, I didn't get it. I didn't start saving until middle school, and I didn't understand the value of the compounding I would get if I'd started 10 years earlier, eight years earlier or something. You start early, you're going to use those funds one way or another.\nRobert Brokamp: Martha, this has been great. Thank you for joining us.\nMartha Kortiak Mert: Thank you so much.\nRobert Brokamp: It's time for our final segment. Get it done. In which we provide an actionable tip to make the boast of your bunny. A few weeks ago President Trump signed into law the one big beautiful bill, and there's a lot in that bill's 870 pages, including a higher standard deduction, a higher state and local taxes deduction, a bonus deduction for seniors, a higher child tax credit, and a deduction for tips received by some workers. But it's not all about the breaks. The bill also eventually eliminates energy efficiency tax credits, limits student loan repayment options, and make some cuts to social welfare programs. But hey, whalers get a higher deduction for whaling related expenses, so that's nice. In the end, how much the new tax law will reduce your tax bill will depend on all factors, including your income, job, your age, your address, things like that. But most middle to upper income households could see their after tax incomes rise 2-4% annually over the next few years. Think of it like a raise. With any raise, it's a good idea to be proactive about what you do with that extra money.\nMy recommendation is to use most or even all of it to boost your savings rate, especially if you're behind in saving for retirement or any other goals. Right after you're done, listening to this podcast, log into your 401K, IRA, brokerage account, or your high yield savings account, and boost the amount that you have automatically contributed by a few percentage points. Because down the road, you may need that money. Estimates vary, but the big beautiful bill could increase the federal budget deficit by three trillion to $6 trillion over the next decade. Meanwhile, it could move up the depletion of the Social Security Trust Fund a year earlier to 2032, and around that same time, one of the trust funds that supports Medicare will run dry. In other words, over the next several years, the federal government will be borrowing even more money while two of its biggest and most important programs will become increasingly underfunded. Make the most of your tax cuts. Use that extra money to plump up your portfolio, because at some point, Uncle Sam is going to have to shore up Social Security, Medicare, and the rest of his finances, possibly resulting in higher future taxes and\/or reduced retirement benefits.

Companies like Amazon, Moderna, and McKinsey are eliminating layers of middle management, merging departments, and deploying AI agents to automate routine work. As AI automates various tasks, even the C-suite is changing, with new AI leadership roles emerging and long-held power dynamics shifting.\nThe traditional corporate org chart, a neat triangle of power with executives at the top and junior workers at the base, is undergoing a quiet revolution, thanks to AI.\nAt Moderna, HR and tech now live under the same roof overseen by one Chief People and Digital Officer. At another one AI-first healthcare company, a team of 10 software engineers have been replaced with three person unit overseeing AI agents. At Amazon, layers of middle management are being stripped out as part of a broader push toward a leaner, AI-ready structure.\nAI isn’t just a new tool for the modern workplace; it’s quietly reshaping how companies are organized.\nCall it “the Great Flattening.”\nAs business leaders race to integrate AI across their operations, entry-level roles are disappearing, management layers are thinning, and traditional team roles are starting to blur. Across the Fortune 500, middle management is taking hits, as are entry-level workers, but even at the C-suite, new power dynamics are at play as the old pyramid structure of corporate life starts to flatten out.\nTech bosses have been keen to promote a vision where AI automates the drudgery of work, cutting out admin while allowing soft skills and creativity to flourish. Or, as Microsoft’s Satya Nadella put it earlier this year: “I think with AI and work with my colleagues.”\nWhile the utopian idea of a world without tasks like editing Excel spreadsheets or sorting through files sounds great in theory, what does an AI-first organization actually look like in practice?\nOne key theme of organizations that are pivoting to “AI-first” structures is a kind of “flattening” of company structure, which essentially means fewer layers of management oversight, the removal of junior or support roles, and a growing reliance on AI systems to handle tasks that were once handled by human employees.\nIt can also mean the collapse or conflation of traditional team structures.\nFor example, pharmaceutical company Moderna recently merged its technology and human resources departments into a single function, appointing a Chief People and Digital Technology Officer to oversee both teams. The move, according to the Wall Street Journal, was driven in part by the company’s partnership with OpenAI and the company leaning into AI to help handle things like HR support and some junior roles.\nAt consulting giant McKinsey, the company is deploying thousands of AI agents to support consultants with tasks such as building decks, summarizing research, and verifying the logic of arguments. On top of this, around 40% of the company’s revenue now comes from advising on AI and related technologies.\n“If you’re an AI-first organization, you can use these AI agents to essentially do a lot of the execution work of organizations,” Nick South, the managing director and senior partner of Boston Consulting Group, told Fortune. “And when we organize our processes and our delivery processes around this AI native workforce, the role of the humans, then, is different.”\nThis is partly because the nature of individual job roles will change as tasks get automated by AI tools or agents.\n“Our job roles get kind of deconstructed, because some tasks might be taken over by AI and others might be new, so the meaning, or the function of the job changes,” Eva Selenko, a professor of work psychology at Loughborough Business School, said. “You might need less of the one role, but that person will take over another function from another thing.”\nThis doesn’t mean that entire jobs will be replaced, but it could mean employees’ roles become more diverse and take on tasks outside their normal scope of duties, or even their usual team. Job roles get deconstructed as tasks get automated, and their importance in the organization changes, Selenko said. As a result, strict divisions between teams may start to blur.\nMix all this in with a few AI agents carrying out autonomous work, and the traditional org chart starts to look dramatically different.\n“Now we’re moving to this more flat network of human teams supervising AI agents,” Rob Levin, McKinsey senior partner and a leader of QuantumBlack, McKinsey’s AI arm, said.\n“In early examples, we’re seeing that a client company that’s building an agent factory supporting multiple business workflows, about 50 to 100 AI agents can be managed by just two or three people,” he said.\nIn one example, Levin said a healthcare company had replaced a traditional 10-person software development team with much smaller, three-person units. These consist of a product owner, a software engineer who can effectively prompt AI coding tools, and a systems architect who ensures integration with the company’s broader tech ecosystem.\nHowever, these kinds of major structural changes are easier to implement in smaller organizations or startups rather than in larger companies that have more complicated structures.\nOne of the ways companies, especially in the tech sector, have tried to simplify and flatten their structures for the AI age is to slash employees at the managerial level. Palantir CEO Alex Karp, for instance, announced on Monday’s earnings call that he intended to cull 500 roles from his 4,100-person staff. he called it a “crazy, efficient revolution.”\nMiddle managers have especially taken a lot of flak, especially from the likes of Big Tech CEOs such as Andy Jassy, who has said that middle managers can hinder speed, ownership, and innovation at Amazon, particularly in the context of AI-driven organizational change.\nJassy is currently pursuing a flatter company structure at Amazon by increasing the ratio of individual contributors to managers, aiming to remove layers and streamline decision-making.\nHowever, experts told Fortune organizations shouldn’t be counting out middle managers just yet.\n“One obvious possibility [of flatter organizations] is that it’s going to cause some sort of managerial thinning,” said Tristan L. Botelho, an associate professor of organizational behavior at Yale School of Management. “If AI is reducing the coordination burden, it could shrink the role of middle management, whose job it was previously to make these connections.”\nHowever, while AI might change how middle managers work, Botelho does not expect them to disappear completely.\n“I don’t think middle management is going to be erased. I think it’s going to just redefine how managers think about their role within the organization,” he said. “One thing I often talk about a lot with executives…is this kind of idea that AI integrated with the organization, should…level up your skill set as a manager.”\nIn the AI age, soft skills also become increasingly important, with middle managers serving vital HR functions. Employees still need to be managed, and a workforce still needs to function with empathy or organizations risk losing their best performers.\n“There is a human side of things,” Stella Pachidi, a Senior Lecturer in Technology and Work at King’s Business School, said. “It’s not sustainable to just have a boss as an algorithm, it’s not going to work in the longer term.”\nIn contrast to the Big Tech narrative, some experts say the managerial class will expand within traditional organizational structures as automation replaces low-level work.\nBCG’s Nick South told Fortune that execution-level jobs, which are typically at the bottom of the org chart, will be the first on the chopping block due to AI agents, while the managerial or “orchestration” level will grow in complexity and importance.\n“At the orchestration layer, that will need to be bigger than it is today…there’ll be a critical human part of that, which is about making sure that all this stuff is doing things,” he said.\n“If you think about a classic middle manager profile, it’s sort of a general manager skill set. But what these people are going to need in the future is a combination of sufficient AI proficiency to manage a human-agentic workforce, plus the core skills of logic, understanding of ethics, rhetoric, and communication skills, so that they can communicate with others in much less siloed organizations,” he said. “So those orchestration roles are going to be quite complex.”\nWhile middle managers and entry-level employees may be feeling the brunt of the AI burden, these changes go right to the top.\nAI is already shifting the power dynamics in the C-suite and creating new, powerful, executive-level jobs. According to a 2023 Foundry study on AI Priorities, 11% of mid- to large-sized companies have already appointed someone to serve as “Chief AI Officer” (CAIO), while an additional 21% are currently in the process of recruiting for the role.\nAccording to LinkedIn’s 2023 report on AI at work, companies with a “Head of AI” position around the world had more than tripled in the five years, growing by 13% from 2022.\nAlex Connock, a senior fellow at the University of Oxford’s Said Business School, has observed the growth of these roles firsthand.\n“Whilst it was perhaps relatively rare when we first launched our AI for business programmes a few years ago, we now have many people … on our executive courses with the title of Chief AI Officer,” he told Fortune. “It’s the new mainstream. The level of interest transcends all levels, from the 20-year-old undergrads … up to seasoned executives.”\nWhile there’s some debate about whether these roles will stand the test of time, for example, experts have said that these roles can lack a clear purpose or authority, the executive level is not immune to the AI boom.\nSouth said that while the rise of some of these roles could also be a symptom of our immaturity with AI rather than a direct need for this work, the C-suite will still have to take on new responsibilities in the AI age.\n“People feel quite nervous about missing the boat,” he said. “I think it will be interesting to see how this evolves over time … as things settle down, how different will that be to the classic chief data officer?”\nBut here is a new “responsibility in the C-suite … to think about our competitive landscape, where are the potential sources of disruption, how we protect our sources of advantage. These are C-suite questions, and it would be a mistake to think, if we hire a chief AI officer, somehow we leave that with them. This is a really top-level thing to be thinking strategically about.”\nWhile AI is set to disrupt all levels of organizations, Selenko noted that management structures are likely to protect those at the top from too much turmoil.\n“In an influential management structure, if those at the top’s job might be partly doable by an AI, they will not give up that power. So I think you will see this shift in power balance is probably more among less powerful positions in an organization,” she said.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com","content_hash":"464fceb53d8ed425e0d32d0e3a8bffa3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":11224,"method_rank":0}

But Retell and his brother enjoyed the familiar trappings of what he calls a silver-spoon upbringing: regular vacations, a big house, luxury cars and enrollment at an elite private high school.\nBy 2017, having graduated from the University of Pennsylvania debt-free with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics, he'd figured he'd been given enough of a head start. He told his parents he no longer wanted their financial support.\n\"It was kind of incumbent upon me, for my own self-esteem,\" he says. \"[I was] trying to show myself that I could build my life from that point as much as possible.\"\nThings didn't go according to plan at first. Retell took out student loans to attend law school at Emory University straight out of undergrad, but soon withdrew due to health issues. He quickly found himself with $23,000 in debt and no savings to pay it back with.\n\"I needed to transition from leaving law school to making money basically as soon as possible if I didn't want to move back home and live with my parents,\" Retell says.\nHe managed to scrape things together for six months or so, spending 60 to 70 hours a week driving for Lyft around Atlanta, then took a short-term internship before joining the Peace Corps in Ukraine. The move was formative, if not particularly lucrative.\nNow 29, Retell shares a Washington, D.C. apartment with his boyfriend, a Ukrainian he met during his time overseas. In addition to his job at a small economic nonprofit, which pays him $75,000 per year, Retell serves in the civil affairs branch of the Army Reserve, and hopes to deploy back to Eastern Europe in the next few years.\nThe second gig, which includes base and bonus pay, brings Retell's annual income to about $82,000, and he saves as much of it as he can — he managed to stash away 21% of his pre-tax income in June.\nBut the way he sees it, he has some catching up to do. \"I'm not in a hole, but behind for sure,\" he says.\nPlaying a 'shell game' with credit card debt\nRetell says money wasn't top-of-mind when he made the decision to join the Peace Corps in 2018. In fact, he'd internalized his Jesuit high school's emphasis on service and even considered signing up right after college.\nThe move came with one big financial upside: volunteering allowed him to defer repaying his student loans. Still, the excitement of living abroad in his early 20s resulted in some poor money decisions, Retell says.\n\"It's very easy to want to travel throughout Europe when you're so close and flights are seemingly so cheap. But on a $300, $350 a month stipend, there's just really no room to afford that,\" he says. He got into around $6,000 in credit card debt, he says, which was \"at the time was astronomical for me.\"\nRetell says he played a \"shell game\" with the debt, moving it between 0% balance-transfer credit cards. \"I was just kicking the can down the road, and eventually had to pay the piper when I came back,\" he says.\nRetell returned from Ukraine in March 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic hit. After a two-week quarantine at his parents' house, he moved to Seattle, where he paid down his credit card debt by driving and shopping for Instacart.\nLife in the Army Reserve\nRetell had considered joining the military when law school fell through, but decided the Peace Corps was the better path at the time. But when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, he reached back out to his recruiters.\n\"With my connections and sympathy for Ukraine, feeling heavily invested there, the war just felt like a kick in the butt,\" he says. \"But it takes a long time to join the military.\"\nIn the meantime, he'd landed the nonprofit role in D.C., relocating to the capital in fall of 2022. He opted to keep that job and sign up for the Army Reserve in 2023.\nRetell's army contract came with a $20,000 enlistment bonus, half paid out upon completion of his initial training, and the rest divided over the remainder of his contract, which runs through 2029.\nRetell earns a $5,321 annual base salary as a reservist. His student loans have been in forbearance during his service and are slated to be paid off in annual installments throughout his contract as part of his bonus package — though his loan servicer has yet to receive repayment.\nRetell's end of the bargain: He attends training one weekend out of every month and does more in-depth work two weeks out of every year. Although there are fitness tests, Retell's training in the Civil Affairs division is more academic and less running through tires. He estimates he spends roughly 20 to 25 hours a month on Army-related activities.\nHe also has to be willing to be called for active duty, a likely outcome, Retell says, over the course of a reservist's contract.\n\"Some locations and some timings are more enthusiastic than others, as [is the case for] anyone with a civilian life and job and other responsibilities,\" Retell says. Though things can change, his unit is currently scheduled to deploy to Eastern Europe in 2028.\nHow he spends his money\nRetell makes more money than his boyfriend, who fled Ukraine for Poland before the Russian invasion, and who currently works as a shift supervisor at Starbucks. Nevertheless, the two approach finances as a team, covering each other on day-to-day expenses and each looking to save north of 20% of their respective incomes.\nSaving that aggressively means occasionally feeling strapped, especially in a city where things can get expensive.\nLiving in D.C., \"I have been able to save more than I have ever saved in my entire life,\" Retell says. \"Having said that, it makes my month-to-month feel uncomfortable because I'm trying to save as much as possible. So there is breathing room, but I try to make it seem like there's no breathing room.\"\nHere's how he spent his money in June 2025.\n- Housing and utilities: $1,526\n- Savings and investments: $1,462 stashed in his 401(k) and taxable brokerage account\n- Groceries: $487\n- Dining: $398\n- Discretionary: $274 on health, household and travel expenses\n- Transportation: $145 on Metro fare and ridesharing services\n- Gifts and donations: $179\n- Subscriptions and memberships: $71 on Whoop, DuckDuckGo, Geoguessr, Robinhood and various Apple subscriptions\n- Mobile: $64 in costs associated with iPad and Apple Watch fees, in lieu of a cellular plan\nAs with many urban-dwelling professionals his age, the biggest chunk of Retell's budget goes toward living expenses. He pays $1,518 of the $2,018 he and his boyfriend pay in rent on a studio apartment.\nThe $398 Retell spent on dining amounts mostly to workday lunches, and the $487 he spent on groceries comprises his share of the couple's near nightly shopping trips before preparing dinner at home — a European custom he picked up from his boyfriend. It hasn't made him any handier in the kitchen, however.\n\"My boyfriend is definitely the better cook,\" Retell says. \"I cannot cook anything but Kraft mac and cheese, and that's about it.\"\nA few common line items are missing from the budget altogether. Retell's workplace covers his insurance premiums, so no payout for medical, dental or vision. Instead of paying a phone bill, Retell connects his devices to Wi-Fi when he can and otherwise pays a fee to receive texts on his Apple Watch.\nThe budget is also missing, well, fun — but that doesn't mean the couple doesn't have any. Retell and his boyfriend are homebodies, but still hang with friends, stroll the city's many parks and occasionally tour the landmarks and museums, which are all free to visit.\nTheir biggest splurge, Retell says, is travel. When his boyfriend wanted to see Billie Eilish in Los Angeles this summer, the pair sprung for cheap flights and a budget hotel stay.\nHowever, they usually tighten their belts as much as they can. Last summer, on a 19-day road trip, they paid for four nights' accommodation. They slept in the SUV they rented for the remainder. \"That's an adventure for me. For other people, maybe not so much,\" Retell says.\nSacrifice with a purpose\nFor the most part, Retell and his boyfriend aim to save as much as they can, even if it means making what he calls \"manageable sacrifices.\"\nIn June, everything went according to plan. Retell contributed 6% of his pre-tax nonprofit salary, $375, to a Roth 401(k), receiving a full matching contribution from his employer. Another $1,087 went into his brokerage account, in which he holds a portfolio of index funds.\nNot every month is quite as strong. Retell says that Army pay — especially when it comes to bonuses — can be inconsistent. He is theoretically due $4,800 a year as a foreign language bonus, for instance, but hasn't seen any of the money thus far.\nRetell says it's tough to rely on his military pay when managing his finances from month to month. \"[It's] more of a bonus when I'm able to access it on time,\" he says.\nStill, Retell is slowly but surely building toward his long-term goals, which include homeownership and, eventually, a quiet retirement.\nOver the short-term, he hopes to buy a car and plans to re-enroll in law school, hopefully completing his coursework just in time for his military deployment.\n\"Graduating in 2028 or 2029 would be ideal, so that I can finish both around the same time and decide if I do want to re-enlist or explore the possibility of becoming an officer, or end my time there and be free to start the next chapter,\" Retell says.\nNo matter what the future looks like, Retell says he'll navigate the financial side of it without help from his family.\n\"I can't say I've never taken money from my parents. I mean, they've paid for things for me before and stuff like that. But it's been about as close to a hard and fast rule as I've maintained since being 21.\"\nWhat's your budget breakdown?

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CFO.com newsletter.\nEarnings calls, loved by some CFOs and dreaded by others, allow finance leaders and their fellow executives to verbalize their organization’s progress. Each month, CFO.com compiles interesting insights shared by CFOs during these calls for The CFO Earnings Dispatch series. These insights include statements about their company, analysis of financial data and answers to analysts’ questions.\nFor July, we highlight CFO comments from Boeing, UnitedHealth Group, General Dynamics, Starbucks, The Cheesecake Factory, Tractor Supply, Coca-Cola and BlackRock.\nMarket Cap: $170.53 billion\nDate of Call: July 29\nBoeing’s recent financial performance shows how CFOs can stabilize operations and narrow losses during challenging times by leaning on delivery execution and steady working capital improvements. In his final earnings call in the position, CFO Brian West said free cash flow usage of $200 million in Q2 was significantly better than expected, driven by 150 commercial deliveries that included 13 777 jets, nearly double the usual volume.\nWest projected approximately $3 billion in free cash flow for the year, assuming no major disruptions. The company also held firm on its strategy to reintegrate Spirit AeroSystems and normalize inventory as production stabilizes.\n\"Margins at [Boeing Commercial Airplanes] were negative 6.6% in Q1, improved to negative 5.1% in Q2 and we expect to continue improving quarter by quarter, although still negative for the year,\" West said. \"Long term, there's nothing we see that would suggest we can't get back to historical margin levels.\"\nMarket Cap: $224.32 billion\nDate of Call: July 29\nUnitedHealth Group is adjusting expectations for 2025 as elevated medical costs, exchange-related headwinds and slower OptumHealth growth weigh on results. Outgoing CFO John Rex reported Q2 adjusted earnings per share of $4.08, down from the prior year, and revised full-year guidance to at least $16 per share. The updated outlook includes $1.6 billion in potential settlement items, with $600 million recognized in Q2 and another $1 billion anticipated.\nRex noted a full-year medical care ratio of 89.25%, up from the previously forecasted 86.5%, driven by higher patient morbidity in Affordable Care Act exchanges and changes tied to Medicare and the Inflation Reduction Act. \"As we look toward 2026 and beyond, we expect efforts underway to steadily improve our performance,\" Rex said, pointing to renewed focus on pricing, operational discipline and longer-term investment in AI and modernization.\nMarket Cap: $101.46 billion\nDate of Call: July 29\nStarbucks CFO Cathy Smith said the company is focused on building a more durable cost structure to support its long-term turnaround. Four months into the role, Smith said the company is investing in foundational changes, including a $500 million labor investment while working across the P&L to find efficiencies.\n“We are, as we shared even last quarter, working across the entire P&L,” Smith said. “From cost of goods sold to operating expenses to G&A, the team is taking on both short-term and long-term cost structure efficiency work.”\nShe emphasized the importance of building sustainability into the turnaround. “We’re working on 2026, 2027 and 2028,” she said. “We’re putting in the more durable sustainable activities to make sure we don’t just address it once, but we actually address it long term.”\nSmith said the company is focused on setting the foundation for future earnings growth. “What’s really exciting though is when we start to grow, we’ll actually like what comes through to the bottom line.”\nMarket Cap: $3.09 billion\nDate of Call: July 29\nMatthew Clark, CFO of Cheesecake Factory, said stable consumer trends and execution across concepts supported margin gains and stronger-than-expected results in the second quarter. Revenue reached $956 million with an adjusted net income margin of 5.8%, exceeding the company’s guidance range. Clark highlighted improved labor productivity, lower commodity costs and disciplined pricing as key drivers of margin performance.\n“We feel really good about where we’re sitting today,” Clark said. “The environment has been very, very steady for us… and I think it’s a testament to our execution as well as the brands that we have.”\nThe company plans to open up to 25 new restaurants this year across its Cheesecake Factory, North Italia, Flower Child and other Fox Restaurants concepts. Clark said Flower Child, the company’s health-forward fast-casual concept, is delivering mature unit margins of 20.4%, with average unit volume approaching $5 million and returns in the mid-30% range.\nNorth Italia locations are also performing well, with new units opening above expectations and mature margins reaching 18.2%. Clark noted menu pricing will decline in the second half, driven by new lower-priced offerings. “The real pricing is probably going to be more like 2% to 2.5% in terms of what the consumer feels,” he said, emphasizing the company’s focus on perceived value and traffic recovery.\nMarket Cap: $31.87 billion\nDate of Call: July 24\nKurt Barton, CFO of Tractor Supply, said the company delivered record sales and net income in Q2, with signs of momentum continuing into the back half of the year. Comps were positive across six of seven regions, and June saw gains in all regions, supported by a delayed but accelerated spring selling season.\n“We see demand solid. Our customers [are] in a strong position,” Barton said. “The expectation for the second half of the year would be balanced between both ticket and transactions.”\nGross margin expanded by 31 basis points to 36.9%, aided by product cost management and efficiencies across the supply chain. Barton said tariff impacts have begun to flow through direct imports and will create modest pressure in the second half, though average unit retail has not yet been materially affected. “We believe we can still maintain even at these elevated comps… the operating margin rate that we gave in our guide,” he said.\nThe company returned $196 million to shareholders in the quarter and reduced its full-year repurchase outlook, citing a “more measured pace” of capital deployment. Barton said Tractor Supply remains focused on expense control, with selling, general and administrative expenses expected to ease in the second half.\nMarket Cap: $84.92 billion\nDate of Call: July 23\nGeneral Dynamics reported strong order activity and cash performance in the second quarter, with record backlog and improved free cash flow conversion. CFO Kim Kuryea said the company booked $28 billion in orders, resulting in a company-wide book-to-bill ratio of 2.2, led by marine systems. Aerospace also reported a 1.3x book-to-bill despite increased aircraft deliveries.\nBacklog reached a record $103.7 billion, up 14% from a year ago, with total estimated contract value exceeding $160 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.6 billion, with free cash flow of $1.4 billion and a cash conversion rate of 138%. The company expects full-year conversion to be approximately 90%, with the majority of cash generation in the fourth quarter.\nKuryea noted full-year cash projections do not yet include potential benefits from recent tax legislation reversing the amortization of R&D expenses, which may provide additional cash flow depending on timing.\nCapital expenditures were $198 million, or 1.5% of sales, with full-year capex expected to be slightly above 2% of sales. The company paid $402 million in dividends, did not repurchase shares during the quarter, and reduced net debt by $1.2 billion to $7.2 billion. Interest expense is projected to be $330 million for the full year.\nMarket Cap: $299.88 billion\nDate of Call: July 22\nCoca-Cola CFO John Murphy said the company delivered strong margin expansion and free cash flow growth in the second quarter, even as unit case volume declined 1% due to soft June results. Organic revenue grew 5%, driven by price\/mix gains, while comparable gross margin expanded by 80 basis points and operating margin rose 190 basis points.\n“We expect to deliver operating leverage in the second half of the year, albeit at a slightly lower rate than we had previously flagged,” Murphy said. He added that about one-third of the company’s underlying margin expansion came from faster realization of productivity initiatives.\nWhile the company reaffirmed its full-year guidance of 5% to 6% organic revenue growth, it now expects comparable EPS to grow 3%, down slightly due to a five-point currency headwind. Murphy said Coca-Cola plans to use its strong first-half performance to “invest some of our efficiencies” into growth for the back half of the year.\nHe noted the updated outlook reflects a softening of earlier currency-related pressure and that Coca-Cola would provide more detail on 2026 in its October call. Though not addressed on the earnings call, the company has separately indicated plans to begin using cane sugar in U.S. beverages, a potential shift with implications for costs, marketing and consumer preferences.\nMarket Cap: $182.97 billion\nDate of Call: July 15\nBlackRock and its CFO Martin Small reported 6% organic base fee growth in Q2 2025, marking the company’s fourth consecutive quarter above 5%. Assets under management are also at a record $12.5 trillion. Net inflows totaled $116 billion, excluding a $52 billion institutional index redemption. Small said the firm is seeing sustained growth across ETFs, its investment technology platform Aladdin, cash management, private markets and digital assets.\nThe acquisition of HPS Investment Partners added $165 billion of AUM and is expected to contribute $450 million in revenue in Q3. Preqin added $60 million to Q2 technology services revenue. Subscription revenue rose 26% year-over-year. Small said the firm remains on track toward its goal of $400 billion in private market fundraising between 2025 and 2030.\nOperating margin declined 80 basis points to 43.3%, mainly due to lower performance fees and acquisition-related expenses. Small said controllable expenses are aligned with revenue growth and that recent acquisitions are expected to be self-funding. Dividend growth is expected to track operating and net income as part of BlackRock’s 2030 strategy.\nRecommended Reading","content_hash":"55943a8e3741936454f5e712511719ce","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":10416,"method_rank":0}

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) rose +0.72%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) rose +1.21%.\nStock indexes rallied Wednesday on some positive corporate news. Arista Networks closed up more than +17% after its Q3 revenue forecast exceeded expectations. Also, Match Group closed up more than +10% after projecting a stronger-than-expected Q3 sales forecast. In addition, Apple rose +5% to lead megacap technology stocks higher after President Trump said the company will announce that it will commit to spending another $100 billion on domestic manufacturing.\nSpeculation that weaker-than-expected US economic news will push the Fed to lower interest rates as soon as next month is also supporting stocks. Tuesday’s unexpected decline in US services activity added to last Friday’s weak payroll and manufacturing reports. The chances of a Fed rate cut at the September FOMC meeting rose to 95% Wednesday from 40% last Friday.\nAlso, dovish Fed comments on Wednesday bolstered speculation about a Fed rate cut. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said, “The economy is slowing and in the near term it may become appropriate to start adjusting the federal funds rate lower.” Additionally, Fed Governor Lisa Cook said last Friday’s US July jobs report is “concerning” and that “the revisions are somewhat typical of turning points” in the US economy.\nThe US MBA mortgage applications index rose +3.1% in the week ended August 1, with the purchase mortgage sub-index up +1.5% and the refinancing mortgage sub-index up +5.2%. The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell -6 bp to 6.77% from 6.83% in the prior week.\nIn recent tariff news, President Trump announced Wednesday that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India’s purchases of Russian oil. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports would be announced “within the next week or so.” Last Thursday, President Trump raised tariffs on some Canadian goods to 35% from 25% and announced a 10% global minimum, along with tariffs of 15% or higher for countries with trade surpluses with the US, effective after midnight on August 7. According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\nThe markets this week will focus on earnings reports and any fresh tariff or trade news. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to increase by +3,000 to 221,000. Also on Thursday, Q2 nonfarm productivity is expected to be +2.0% with unit labor costs rising +1.5%.\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 95% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and 68% at the following meeting on October 28-29.\nQ2 earnings reports released thus far suggest that S&P 500 earnings are on track to rise +9.1% for the second quarter, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y\/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 67% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, around 83% exceeded profit estimates.\nOverseas stock markets on Wednesday settled higher. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed up +0.26%. China’s Shanghai Composite closed up +0.45%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.60%.\nInterest Rates\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) on Wednesday closed down -2 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield rose +0.6 bp to 4.216%. Supply pressures weighed on T-notes as the Treasury auctioned $42 billion of 10-year T-notes Wednesday as part of this week’s $125 billion auctions of T-notes and T-bonds in the August quarterly refunding. Also, strength in stocks on Wednesday has reduced safe haven demand for T-notes. Weak demand for the Treasury’s $42 billion auction of 10-year T-notes was bearish for T-note prices as the auction had a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.35, well below the 10-auction average of 2.58.\nLosses in T-notes were limited due to dovish Fed comments from Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and Fed Governor Lisa Cook, who signaled their support for interest rate cuts. Also, Wednesday’s 1% fall in crude oil prices undercut inflation expectations and was supportive for T-notes.\nEuropean government bond yields on Wednesday moved higher. The 10-year German bund yield rose +2.6 bp to 2.650%. The 10-year UK gilt yield rose +1.0 bp to 4.526%.\nEurozone June retail sales rose +0.3% m\/m, right on expectations.\nGerman June factory orders unexpectedly fell by -1.0% m\/m, weaker than expectations of a +1.1% m\/m increase and the biggest decline in 5 months.\nECG Governing Council member Holzmann said, “In my view, there is no longer any reason for the ECB to lower interest rates further and we should wait and see what economic developments arise, particularly outside Europe, and how we respond to them.”\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 13% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\nUS Stock Movers\nAstera Labs (ALAB) closed up more than +27% after reporting Q2 gross margin of 76%, better than the consensus of 74%.\nRingCentral (RNG) closed up more than +25% after reporting Q2 adjusted EPS of $1.06, above the consensus of $1.02, and raising its full-year adjusted EPS forecast to $4.20-$4.32 from a previous forecast of $4.13-$4.27, stronger than the consensus of $4.21.\nShopify (SHOP) closed up more than +21% to lead gainers in the Nasdaq 100 after reporting Q2 revenue of $2.68 billion, stronger than the consensus of $2.55 billion.\nArista Networks (ANET) closed up more than +17% to lead gainers in the S&P 500 after reporting Q2 revenue of $2.20 billion, above the consensus of $2.11 billion, and forecasting Q3 revenue of $2.25 billion, stronger than the consensus of $2.13 billion.\nAssurant (AIZ) closed up more than +11% after reporting Q2 adjusted EPS of $5.10, well above the consensus of $4.46.\nMatch Group (MTCH) closed up more than +10% after reporting Q2 revenue of $863.7 million, better than the consensus of $853.9 million, and forecasting Q3 revenue of $910 million-$920 million, stronger than the consensus of $889.8 million.\nGlobal Payments (GPN) closed up more than +8% after reporting Q2 adjusted EPS including SBC of $3.10, better than the consensus of $3.08.\nApple (AAPL) closed up more than +5% to lead gainers in the Dow Jones industrials after President Trump said the company will announce that it will commit to spending another $100 billion on domestic manufacturing.\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) closed down more than -18% to lead losers in the S&P 500 after reporting Q4 net sales of $5.76 billion, weaker than the consensus of $6.01 billion, and forecast Q1 set sales of $6.0 billion to $7.0 billion, the midpoint below the consensus of $6.59 billion.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) closed down more than -6% to lead chip makers lower after reporting Q2 adjusted EPS of 48 cents, below the consensus of 49 cents, and saying it was unable to give a clear outlook for resuming sales in China. Also, Marvell Technology (MRVL), Microchip Technology (MCHP), and ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) closed down more than -1%.\nCoca-Cola Europacific (CCEP) closed down more than -7% to lead losers in the Nasdaq 100 after cutting its full-year revenue growth forecast to +3% to +4%, from a previous forecast of +4%.\nKemper Corp (KMPR) closed down more than -21% after Piper Sandler double-downgraded the stock to underweight from overweight with a price target of $50.\nVertex (VERX) closed down more than -19% after reporting Q2 software subscription revenue of $157.8 million, below the consensus of $158.9 million, and cutting its full-year revenue forecast to $750 million-$754 million from a previous forecast of $760 million-$768 million, weaker than the consensus of $763.4 million.\nSnap (SNAP) closed down more than -17% after reporting Q2 revenue of $1.34 billion, below the consensus of $1.35 billion.\nDaVita (DVA) closed down more than -9% after the company noted in an earnings call that Q2 US treatments per day fell -1.1% y\/y, weaker than expectations of -0.50% y\/y.\nEmerson Electric (EMR) closed down more than -4% after reporting Q3 net sales of $4.55 billion, weaker than the consensus of $4.60 billion.\nEarnings Reports (8\/7\/2025)\nAkamai Technologies Inc (AKAM), Alliant Energy Corp (LNT), Becton Dickinson & Co (BDX), Block Inc (XYZ), ConocoPhillips (COP), Consolidated Edison Inc (ED), Constellation Energy Corp (CEG), Datadog Inc (DDOG), Eli Lilly & Co (LLY), EOG Resources Inc (EOG), EPAM Systems Inc (EPAM), Erie Indemnity Co (ERIE), Evergy Inc (EVRG), Expedia Group Inc (EXPE), Gen Digital Inc (GEN), Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD), GoDaddy Inc (GDDY), Insulet Corp (PODD), Kenvue Inc (KVUE), Live Nation Entertainment Inc (LYV), Martin Marietta Materials Inc (MLM), Microchip Technology Inc (MCHP), Monster Beverage Corp (MNST), Motorola Solutions Inc (MSI), Parker-Hannifin Corp (PH), Ralph Lauren Corp (RL), Sempra (SRE), Solventum Corp (SOLV), Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO), Targa Resources Corp (TRGP), Trade Desk Inc\/The (TTD), Viatris Inc (VTRS), Vistra Corp (VST), Warner Bros Discovery Inc (WBD), Wynn Resorts Ltd (WYNN), Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc (ZBH).\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

In my column today I look at how investors' apparent readiness to accept tariffs challenges the orthodoxies that have underpinned economic liberalism and world markets for the past 40 years.\nIf you have more time to read, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today.\n1.

Lula rejects 'humiliation' of calling Trump overU.S.-Brazil tariff 4. Biden-era appointees could stymie Trump's effort toreshape Fed 5. Bank of England's long unwinding road: Mike Dolan\nToday's Key Market Moves\n* FX: Dollar index falls 0.5%, its fourth straightdecline. Brazil's real rises 0.8% to a one-month high of 5.45\/$. * STOCKS: Nasdaq climbs 1.2%, the best performing majorindex on Wall St. * SHARES\/SECTORS: U.S. consumer discretionary index +2.5%,consumer staples index +1.8%. Apple +5%, Super Micro Computer-18%. * BONDS: A weak 10-year Treasury auction pusheslonger-dated yields up as much as 5 bps, steepening the curve. * COMMODITIES: Oil falls for a fifth day, hits newfive-week lows after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubiosuggests there may be an announcement on potential sanctionsagainst Russia.\nWall St momentum calms tariff shakes\nPositive investor sentiment and risk appetite were on full display on Wednesday, as optimism around corporate earnings and the U.S. tech boom again overshadowed more worrisome global developments on tariffs and growth.\nTraders cheered news that ChatGPT maker OpenAI is mulling a stock sale that could value the company at $500 billion and Apple's pledge to spend $100 billion on U.S. manufacturing. U.S. earnings continue to surprise to the upside too, and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary index rose 2.4%, its best day since May.\nWall Street stood in contrast to a more subdued global session. Benchmark Asian, emerging and European indices were all flat on Wednesday, with the Trump administration's tariffs weighing on sentiment across the board.\nThe major exception was China, where blue chip stocks closed at their highest in more than three and a half years on hopes that the United States and China will strike a trade deal in the coming days.\nTrade-related optimism elsewhere, however, is in much shorter supply. U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday slapped further import duties on India, bringing the total tariff rate to 50%, while Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva told Reuters that relations with the U.S. are at a 200-year low.\nSome Fed officials, meanwhile, are signaling growing unease about the U.S. labor market and economy. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly on Wednesday said interest rates should probably be lowered in the coming months.\nIn bonds, a weak $42 billion sale of 10-year U.S. government bonds drew the weakest demand in a year, and followed a somewhat disappointing auction of $58 billion three-year notes the day before. Thursday's $25 billion sale of 30-year bonds will come under even greater scrutiny.\nAlso on Thursday, the Bank of England is widely expected to cut its key interest rate to 4% from 4.25%. But the challenges facing the Bank are significant - the fiscal outlook appears to be deteriorating sharply, and inflation is close to double the central bank's 2% target.\nBefore that China announces July trade data, with economists expecting export growth to slow and the surplus to narrow. Earlier this week, official U.S. figures showed that the U.S. trade gap with China in June shrank to its lowest in more than 21 years.\nMarkets' tariff resilience challenges long-standing economic orthodoxy\nInvestors have been living in a real-time economic experiment ever since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January.\nWhether it's tariffs, \"America First\" isolationism, overt politicization of independent economic institutions, or upended global economic norms, markets are having to deal with challenges few investors have faced before.\nSo how are they reacting to the leader of the free world ripping up the economic playbook that has shaped the global financial system for 40 years?\nWall Street and world stocks are at record highs, U.S. high yield corporate bond spreads are the tightest since before the 2007-08 global financial crisis, and Treasuries are remarkably calm, with the 10-year yield below its average of the last two years.\nIt's not all serene, of course. The U.S. \"term premium\" - a measure of the extra compensation investors demand for holding long-dated Treasuries over short-term debt - is the highest in over a decade. Inflation expectations and long-dated yields have shot up too.\nAnd one needs to acknowledge that the full impact of Trump's tariffs has yet to be fully felt.\nBut, at this point there has been no U.S. recession, even if growth is slowing. And the market plunge on the back of Trump's April 2 \"Liberation Day\" tariff debacle lasted a few weeks.\nThe powerful stock market recovery since then suggests investors were less bothered by the actual tariffs than the shock of the initial announcement, the chaotic way it was delivered, and the amateurish way the levies were calculated.\nThis outcome is not what economic textbooks would have predicted.\nONE FOR YOU, 19 FOR ME\nTariffs are a tax.\nAnd the overall U.S. average effective tariff rate looks likely to be around 18%, according to the Budget Lab at Yale. That's down from an estimated 28% in May but still nearly eight times higher than the level in December.\nWho will ultimately pay this tax is up for debate, but if sustained at that level, the president of the United States will have effectively imposed a tax hike worth around 1.8% of GDP, one of the largest in U.S. history.\nBut wait. Aren't higher taxes bad for business, markets and growth? Don't higher taxes sap consumers' spending power, stunt investment and hiring, and crush the private sector's entrepreneurial spirit?\nMarkets' relatively speedy acceptance raises the question: What happened to the last 40 years of economic orthodoxy, symbolized by the so-called \"Washington Consensus\"?\nThis was the set of principles drawn up in the late 1980s that broadly mirrored the views of the Washington-based International Monetary Fund, World Bank and U.S. Treasury, ostensibly to help direct policy in Latin America but which ultimately served as the economic framework for Western liberal democracies and global markets.\nThey included support for privatization, deregulation, the free flow of capital, fiscal discipline, and lower taxes. They also entailed lower barriers to trade, a cornerstone of globalization.\nFor years these tenets were regarded by policymakers, business leaders and investors as sacrosanct. Some, like rigid adherence to tight fiscal policy, were put to the test - and shown to be flimsy, at best - during the GFC and pandemic.\nSo now that the tariff line has been crossed, what about other economic commandments? Could governments look to raise tax revenue from other sources, such as wealth taxes on the super rich, a \"Tobin tax\" on foreign exchange transactions, or other \"soft\" capital controls?\nThese are obviously anathema to the doctrine of free market capitalism. But then so were tariffs.\nTo be fair, we are just entering this new era. And as my colleague Mike Dolan observed earlier this week, even if tariffs don't send the economy or markets into a tailspin, they may still lead to a \"slow burn,\" with many years of lost economic potential, elevated volatility and lower investment returns.\nBut investors aren't looking that far ahead. What they see right now is a pretty resilient U.S. economy, solid earnings growth, and red-hot optimism around U.S. tech and AI. And some of the old orthodoxies may be in the rear-view mirror.\nWhat could move markets tomorrow?\n* Australia trade (June) * Japan earnings, including Softbank, Sony, Toyota * China trade (June) * China FX reserves (June) * Bank of England interest rate decision * Germany trade (June) * Germany industrial production (June) * U.S. weekly jobless claims * U.S. Treasury auctions $25 bln of 30-year bonds * U.S. earnings including Eli Lilly, ConocoPhillips, GileadSciences, Motorola * Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speaks\nWant to receive Trading Day in your inbox every weekday morning?

When you mishandle one of these, the entire cash cycle stutters. You risk not only delayed payments but also strained broker relationships and gaps in load documentation that can affect future opportunities. Brokers are moving faster than ever in 2025. If they see you dropping the ball on paperwork or missing consistent follow-ups, they’ll move to someone else. With margins already tight and freight volatility at an all-time high, you need every process working like clockwork.\nLet’s quantify the damage: A single late invoice can push payment from net 15 to net 45, which could mean you’re running three more loads before seeing a dime. A missing detention line in a rate con might not seem like much, but across 4–5 loads per week, even $50 per load is $1,000 a month gone. That’s a truck payment. When your admin is trained and proactive, they don’t just help—they lock down the financial foundation your fleet stands on.\nThe Mistake Many Small Carriers Make\nMost carriers treat admin support like an afterthought. They’ll hire someone, throw a few files their way, maybe give a login to QuickBooks or a TMS—and then expect clean billing, zero errors, and timely follow-ups. That’s not training, that’s delegation without direction.\nThe result? Missed charges, messy folders, and brokers chasing you for paperwork you thought was handled. Then it spirals. You’re behind on invoices, PODs are missing or misfiled, and you’re too deep in the load board to notice. Every one of these gaps is costing you money.\nLet’s be direct: If your admin doesn’t understand rate confirmation details, detention policies, POD compliance, or invoicing cadence, they’re flying blind. And if they’re flying blind, your business is bleeding slowly. Training them well isn’t optional. It’s your responsibility as an owner. Give them systems. Walk them through real examples. Don’t assume they’ll figure it out—assume they won’t unless you show them how.\nStep 1: Start With a System, Not a Person\nYour admin can only be as good as the process you hand them. Systems create consistency. They remove the guesswork and standardize how documents move through your business. Whether you’re on the road or off-grid, the process should work without you micromanaging every step.\nSet up this foundational structure:\nRate Cons Folder: Use Google Drive or Dropbox. Label it “Rate Cons 2025.” Every file follows the same format: Date_Shipper_Load# (e.g., 2025-07-01_FedEx_20234.pdf).\nPODs Folder: A separate folder labeled “PODs 2025.” Drivers scan PODs using apps like CamScanner or Adobe Scan and upload them before leaving the dock.\nInvoicing Tracker: Google Sheets works fine. Build columns for load number, shipper, amount, due date, status, accessorials, invoice number. Keep it simple but clean.\nControl Rule: Nothing gets marked complete until it’s cross-checked. Whether it’s verifying a POD against a rate con or confirming an invoice was sent, require signoff in your system.\nStep 2: Teach Rate Con Fundamentals\nA rate con is your agreement with the broker—it tells you what you’re owed and what you agreed to. Your admin must understand how to read it, file it, and question anything that looks off.\nHow to train them effectively:\nShow them a real rate con. Walk through the load number, agreed rate, pickup and delivery instructions, accessorial fees (like TONU, detention, layover), and deadlines.\nCreate a checklist: every rate con must be checked for matching amounts, signed and saved correctly.\nGive them practice: print 10 sample rate cons and let them file each one using your naming and folder system. Provide immediate feedback.\nWeekly Task: Every Monday, they cross-check rate cons with the ELD or dispatch notes. If drivers waited at a dock 3 hours and there’s a detention clause, your admin should flag it for billing.\nWhat this looks like in practice: Let’s say a broker allows $50\/hour for detention after 2 hours. If your admin isn’t catching that window, you’re losing out. Even catching 2 loads a week with detention equals $400\/month. Over a year, that’s nearly $5,000—money most small carriers desperately need.\nStep 3: Lock Down the POD Process\nA missing or poor-quality POD is the fastest way to get payment delayed—or denied. Yet, so many small fleets treat it casually. That stops now.\nTrain your admin to run a tight POD protocol:\nDriver Training First: Drivers must scan and submit the POD immediately after delivery. Apps like CamScanner or even iPhone Notes are free and effective.\nAdmin Daily Review: Set a daily task—your admin checks that all loads delivered have a matching POD uploaded by 6 p.m.\nQuality Check: Teach them to reject blurry scans, unsigned PODs, or files missing a load number. Those go back to the driver.\nMatch System: Every POD should be linked to its rate con. If they don’t line up (wrong date, wrong shipper), your admin escalates it.\nImpact: A tight POD system doesn’t just speed up invoicing—it builds broker trust. A fleet that consistently sends clean PODs fast becomes the one brokers keep calling back. It’s about reputation as much as revenue.\nStep 4: Make Invoicing Repeatable and Reliable\nInvoicing should be frictionless. You need clean, accurate invoices going out fast. No broker wants to chase you for billing, and no small fleet can afford to wait 30+ days because someone forgot to hit send.\nTrain your admin on a repeatable method:\nUse a clean invoice template that includes: company name, MC\/DOT number, load #, shipper, rate, accessorials, payment terms (Net 15, Net 30), and invoice number.\nWalk them through 5 real examples. Have them build and send invoices from actual rate cons and PODs.\nSet the rule: All invoices must be sent within 24 hours of POD upload. No exceptions.\nTrack everything: Use your invoice tracker to monitor “Date Sent,” “Due Date,” and “Paid Date.” Late payments get flagged every Friday.\nReal result: Most small carriers are sitting on 3–4 unpaid invoices at any time. Fixing this workflow can bring in $10,000+ in cash that’s just stuck. That’s not theory—that’s your money waiting.\nStep 5: Create a Weekly Admin Rhythm\nConsistency matters more than intensity. Set a weekly rhythm that keeps your back office tight.\nSuggested cadence:\nMonday: Rate cons are reviewed. Any detention or TONU charges are flagged.\nTuesday–Thursday: Match PODs to rate cons, check for scan quality, organize files.\nFriday: All invoices for the week are sent. The payment tracker is updated. Any unpaid invoices past terms are flagged.\nEnd of Month: Archive completed loads. Spot check for errors. Build a report of missed revenue (e.g., missed accessorials, late uploads).\nTrain your admin to own this process. It’s their weekly playbook. If they follow it, your business runs smoother—even if you’re 800 miles away chasing freight.\nStep 6: Coach Weekly, Don’t Criticize Loudly\nTraining is not a one-time dump. It’s an ongoing conversation. You’re not building a robot—you’re developing a professional who supports your business goals.\nHow to build confidence and skill:\nSchedule a 30-minute weekly check-in. Use it to review 2–3 loads. Praise accuracy, coach mistakes.\nExplain the “why.” If they caught a $200 charge, tell them how it affects the bottom line.\nAsk them what’s working and what’s not. If your folder system is confusing, fix it.\nCelebrate wins. Caught a $400 TONU you missed? That deserves credit.\nThis kind of leadership creates ownership. Your admin will start looking for ways to improve the process—not just follow instructions. That’s when you know they’re ready to operate without you watching.\nWhat to Watch Out For\nEven with training, things can slip. Stay on top of these red flags:\nMissing PODs: One missed POD can hold up $3,000. No excuses.\nUntracked Detention: If no one’s reviewing ELD time vs. appointment time, you’re leaving money on the table.\nEmail Issues: Don’t invoice from Gmail. Use your own domain. It signals professionalism and avoids spam filters.\nSystem Overload: If your admin is overwhelmed, your process might be too complex. Trim the fat.\nSet a monthly review to audit these. Catch errors before they become patterns.\nFinal Word\nIf your admin isn’t trained to manage rate cons, PODs, and invoicing with precision, your business is leaking money—plain and simple. In today’s market, where every dollar counts and brokers are quick to move on, you can’t afford to “hope” this gets done right.\nGive your admin a repeatable system. Train them in real-world tasks. Review their work consistently. Treat them like a core part of your operation, because they are. Remember: fleets that win in 2025 aren’t the biggest—they’re the most buttoned up. And it starts with training your admin to protect every load, every invoice, every dollar.","content_hash":"0ebbc7d59eda765de9842e9d14573cfc","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":8838,"method_rank":0}

Still, the company posted strong comparable sales and said the ongoing third quarter was off to a great start, offsetting some fears around higher input prices. Revenue in the quarter ended July 1 increased 12.8% year over year to $1.51 billion, exceeding the LSEG-complied Wall Street consensus estimate of $1.50 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) increased 4% on an annual basis to $1.86, missing expectations of $1.91, LSEG data showed. Shares were down a little more than 1% in extended trading Thursday. The stock has been drifting lower this summer, closing the regular session down 7.4% from its late May high of the year. Bottom line Texas Roadhouse is executing on what it can control – creating an enjoyable environment and offering full menus at affordable prices – and it's showing within the results. When the restaurant chain reported Q1 results in early May, management said same-store sales growth for the second quarter were tracking at 5%. This is key restaurant industry metric is also called comparable sales, or comps. We were pleased to see that the 5% growth rate not only sustained through the quarter, but improved a little further. What a difference the weather can make. By month, comparable sales, a key restaurant industry metric, increased 4.3% in April, 7.2% in May, and 5.8% in June. Companywide, same-store sales increased 5.8% in the quarter, mostly driven by an increase in customer traffic — a good sign. This result beat the consensus of 5.3%, according to FactSet. Even better, these positive trends continued early into the third quarter, with comparable sales up 5.3% through the first five weeks, beating the consensus estimate of about 5%. This strong rate includes a negative 60 basis point pressure from the calendar shift of the Fourth of July. Texas Roadhouse Why we own it: Texas Roadhouse is a fast-casual steak chain that offers quality food at an affordable price in a fun atmosphere, creating one of the more compelling value propositions for consumers in the full-service dining category. A substantial majority company's stores are company-owned stores, with only a small proportion as franchise locations. Competitors: Darden (Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse), Brinker (Chili's and Maggiano's), Bloomin' Brands (Outback, Carrabbas Italian Grill, BonefishGrill) Portfolio weighting: 2.3% Most recent buy: April 9, 2025 Initiated: Feb. 4, 2025 Usually, strong traffic and comparable sales performance translate to operating leverage, margin expansion, and earnings per share growth. But out of the company's control is beef inflation. This headwind weighed on the second-quarter results and is expected to be even worse in the third quarter. The company has some counterbalances in its disposal, including raising menu prices and labor inflation is coming in a little bit better than expected. On the call, CEO Jerry Morgan said the company plans to raise prices by 1.7% at the beginning of the fourth quarter. \"We feel confident this is the right level of pricing to maintain our everyday value while offsetting some of the inflationary pressures we are facing,\" he said. We are once again torn on Texas Roadhouse. The continued traffic-driven comps are proof that the brand is loved and the concept works wherever they open up a new location – and the company is doing plenty of it. The consumer may get more \"picky\" and \"choosy\" in the back half of the year, but Texas Roadhouse is a sensible place to flock to get great bang for one's buck. However, beef prices are everything for this steakhouse chain, and even with the strong comps, we probably won't see the big stock breakout we've been waiting for until prices fall. Tight cattle supplies in the U.S. have driven beef costs up in recent years. On Thursday, cattle futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange hit another record high. That's our current view. We remain optimistic about the future, supported by strong traffic trends, ongoing franchise acquisitions, and growth from new store openings. However, commodity pressures remain a headwind, which is why we're maintaining our hold-equivalent 2 rating and refraining from buying the stock until we see a more attractive entry point. Commentary The better than expected comparable sales growth of 5.8% was driven by a 4% increase in traffic and a 1.8% increase in the average check. Management spent some time on the earnings call walking through some of the mix dynamics— an industry term for the items sold — impacting check levels. The alcohol category continues to be a drag, a sign that people are drinking less when they are dining out. This is a society-wide trend. Introducing nonalcoholic cocktails, often called mocktails, to the menu has been one way the company has addressed the weakness in alcohol. On the entree side, management called out guests trading up to either bigger steaks or ordering steak more often as opposed to other dishes like chicken. During the quarter, Texas Roadhouse opened four-company owned restaurants, including two Bubba's 33 locations, and one franchise restaurant. Management said it's on track to open approximately 30 company-owned restaurants this year and could do a little more than that next year due to plans to step up growth for Bubba's 33, its sports-bar chain with 52 locations currently. Additionally, Texas Roadhouse completed the acquisition of three franchise restaurants, bringing its year-to-date total to 17. Texas Roadhouse said it has plans in place to acquire eight domestic franchise restaurants in the coming quarters, including its five remaining franchised locations in California. The company buys back these franchised locations from time to time, and we generally think these are a good use of cash. Bringing franchised locations under the corporate umbrella gives the company more control over everything in its restaurants and typically leads to stronger operating results. As for cash returns to shareholders, the company bought back $9.8 million worth of stock in the quarter. That's a step down from the $50.2 million worth of shares repurchased in the first quarter. Guidance As mentioned earlier, Texas Roadhouse comparable sales at company-owned restaurants increased 5.3% year over year through the first five weeks of the third quarter. For 2025, management reaffirmed most of its outlook. It continues to expect positive comp sales growth, including the benefit of menu price actions. It also continues to expect capital expenditures totaling $400 million and so-called store week growth of 5% Store week growth is a way to measure both new store openings and franchise acquisitions. However, the company now expects commodity cost inflation to be approximately 5%, which is up from last quarter's view of 4%. This is obviously disappointing to see but it's not a complete surprise since beef prices are on the rise. Partially offsetting the worsening commodity costs is a better view on wage and labor inflation. Management now sees that increasing 4%, which is the low end of its previous guidance range of 4% to 5%. Management also lowered its expected effective income tax rate to 15% from a range of 15% to 16%. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long TXRH. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

The country, which with 2024 gross domestic product of $632 billion ranks as the second largest economy in South America and third largest in the broader region of Latin America, is rapidly becoming one of the region’s leading hydrocarbon producers. The latest data from Argentina’s Ministry of Economy shows shale oil production hit an all-time high for June 2025, although overall petroleum output dipped lower. Meanwhile, all important natural gas output registered a new high for June 2025, with stronger-than-expected conventional field production bolstering overall output after a decline in shale gas volumes.\nArgentina’s hydrocarbon output continues to expand at a solid clip, despite the country’s numerous economic and social challenges. This is due to the tremendous hydrocarbon potential of the 8.6-million-acre Vaca Muerta shale formation, located in the Neuquén Basin. The geological body, despite being discovered in 1927, did not have its hydrocarbon potential fully evaluated until 2011 when it was determined the formation contains an estimated 16 billion barrels of recoverable shale oil along with 308 trillion cubic feet of shale gas.\nSource: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).\nThose gargantuan numbers make the Vaca Muerta one of the top five unconventional hydrocarbon formations globally, with it containing the world’s fourth-largest shale oil and second-largest shale gas resources. Indeed, the geological body is now being compared to the prolific world-class U.S. Permian Shale, underscoring its considerable potential. The successful exploitation of the Vaca Muerta will not only be a silver bullet for Argentina’s crisis-prone economy but will also make the country a leading South American oil and natural gas producer.\nOfficial government data shows Argentina lifted an average of 771,888 barrels of crude oil per day during June 2025, more than 62% weighted to shale oil the largest proportion reported yet.\nSource: Argentina Ministry of Economy.\nArgentina’s June 2025 oil output is 3.32% higher month over month and a whopping 16.79% greater than the same period a year earlier. As a result, the country’s petroleum production once again exceeded Colombia, making Argentina Latin America’s fourth-largest oil producer.\nSource: Argentina Ministry of Economy and Colombia National Hydrocarbons Agency.\nArgentina’s natural gas output is also growing at a solid clip it driven by the exploitation of the Vaca Muerta. For June 2025, natural gas production hit an all-time high of 5.6 billion cubic feet per day, which was a notable 7.5% increase compared to a month prior and 7.59% higher year over year.\nSource: Argentina Ministry of Economy.\nRemarkably, that record output was achieved despite a sharp decline in shale gas production, which fell by 13.31% month over month and 14.44% year over year to just under 2.5 billion cubic feet per day for June 2025. As a consequence, shale gas accounted for only 52% of all natural gas lifted, representing a significant reduction from previous months, when it exceeded 60% since the start of 2024.\nImpressively, Argentina reported strong production numbers despite the rig count falling. According to industry consultancy Baker Hughes, at the end of June 2025, there were 42 active rigs (30 oil and 12 gas) compared to 50 rigs (38 oil and 12 gas) a year earlier. This indicates the operational efficiency of shale oil and gas operations in the Vaca Muerta is improving, with overall hydrocarbon output rising despite a drop in the number of active rigs. It also underscores the improved performance of aging mature conventional oil and gas fields in the provinces of Río Negro, La Pampa, and Mendoza. Those trends bode well for further growth, even if industry investment flattens out, which is a risk because of Argentina’s fragile economy, despite Milei’s strong fiscal reforms, and ongoing geopolitical uncertainty impacting oil prices.\nFor these reasons, Argentina’s Neuquén Basin, where Vaca Muerta is located, is now the country’s largest hydrocarbon-producing sedimentary province and is responsible for nearly all the production growth experienced over the last decade. For June 2025, 72% of all oil and 73.5% of natural gas produced in Argentina were lifted in the Neuquén basin while for the first six months, the geological formation pumped 71% of all oil and natural gas pumped during that period. Consequently, Neuquén is now Argentina’s leading hydrocarbon-producing province. Output will keep expanding with $9 billion of petroleum investment expected in Neuquén during 2025 alone, most of which will be directed to the Vaca Muerta.\nNational oil company YPF, the largest hydrocarbon producer in the Vaca Muerta and Argentina, is responsible for most of that investment and subsequent production growth. The company will inject up to $5.2 billion into its portfolio in 2025, with approximately two-thirds, or $3.6 billion, of that capital allocated to upstream assets. This forms part of YPF’s nearly $36 billion investment plan for 2025 to 2030. Argentina’s national oil company anticipates that net shale oil production will reach 470,000 barrels per day by 2030. This is nearly four times greater than the 122,000 barrels per day lifted by YPF during 2024 and three times more than the 172,000 barrels per day extracted for the first six months of 2025.\nArgentina’s hydrocarbon output is expected to rise further over the coming months as additional key infrastructure, notably transport and storage facilities, comes online. Significant infrastructure upgrades in Argentina’s oil patch are responsible for the Vaca Muerta’s notable uptick in hydrocarbon production since the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. The August 2023 completion of the 900 million cubic feet per day Perito Moreno gas pipeline, along with its related pressurization facilities, boosted takeaway capacity, allowing drillers to increase production. This facility is being expanded, which upon completion in 2027 will lift daily transportation capacity to 1.4 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day.\nAnother important piece of infrastructure currently under construction is the 550,000-barrel-per-day Vaca Muerta Sur Oil Pipeline. This facility will connect the Loma Campana field in Neuquén Province to an export facility being built at the port of Punta Colorada in Río Negro Province. Upon completion, the pipeline will substantially increase takeaway capacity, thereby allowing hydrocarbon output to expand further. Pampa Energy, the Vaca Muerta’s eleventh-largest shale oil producer, invested $426 million to build a hydrocarbon treatment plant at the Rincon de Aranda field in Neuquén province. This is part of a $1.5 billion investment plan that will allow Pampa to scale up operations at the Rincon de Aranda field, which is pumping around 3,103 barrels of shale oil and 1.2 million cubic feet of shale gas per day. Those events demonstrate the feverish rate at which critical infrastructure is being built out so production will expand at a solid clip.\nThe Vaca Muerta shale continues to exceed all expectations, with the formation on track to become a recognized world-class asset for producing unconventional oil and natural gas. As additional critical infrastructure comes online and Argentina’s economy stabilizes, because of President Javier Milei’s strong pro-business reforms, foreign investment in the Vaca Muerta will rise, driving further development and production growth. The appeal of the shale formation is boosted by its low operating overheads, with lifting costs of around $5 per barrel, and Buenos Aires’ commitment to attracting investment by easing regulation, with capital controls to be removed in early 2026. For these reasons, Argentina’s oil production is on track to exceed one million barrels per day by 2030, cementing its place as South America’s third-largest oil producer.","content_hash":"e89bd09d2320c6df349eb2f350ee425f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":8017,"method_rank":0}

Some or all links contained within this article are paid links.\nThe stock market has been volatile during the ongoing tariff disputes between the US and the rest of the world. But according to one prominent market bear, the worst is yet to come.\nMark Spitznagel, founder and chief investment officer of Universa Investments, warned that a historic collapse may be looming, in an interview with MarketWatch.\n\"I expect an 80% crash when this is over. I just don't think this is it. This is a trap,\" he said on April 7.\n“This isn't Armageddon. That time will come as the bubble bursts,” he said.\nSpitznagel is no stranger to market mayhem. He gained notoriety during the 2020 COVID crash, when Universa’s flagship “Black Swan Protection Protocol” fund posted an eye-popping 4,144% return in the first quarter of that year.\nWhether or not you buy into Spitznagel’s outlook, it might be a good time to consider how to diversify beyond traditional stocks. Here are three simple ways to start.\n‘A very effective diversifier’ for bad times\nRay Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, recently underscored the importance of diversification — and the enduring value of one classic asset.\n“People don't have, typically, an adequate amount of gold in their portfolio,” he said in a February interview with CNBC. “When bad times come, gold is a very effective diversifier.” He suggests having 10-15% of a portfolio invested in gold.\nGold is considered a go-to safe haven. It can’t be printed out of thin air like fiat money, and because it’s not tied to any single currency or economy, investors often flock to it during periods of economic turmoil or geopolitical uncertainty, driving up its value.\nOver the past 12 months, gold prices have surged by more than 35%.\nOne way to invest in gold that also provides significant tax advantages is to open a gold IRA with the help of Priority Gold.\nGold IRAs allow investors to hold physical gold or gold-related assets within a retirement account, which combines the tax advantages of an IRA with the protective benefits of investing in gold, making it an attractive option for those looking to potentially hedge their retirement funds against economic uncertainties.\nTo learn more, you can get a free information guide that includes details on how to get up to $10,000 in free silver on qualifying purchases.\nIncome, even in a down market\nLike stocks, real estate has its cycles, but it doesn’t rely on a booming market to generate returns.\nEven during a recession, high quality, essential real estate can continue to produce passive income through rent. In other words, you don’t have to wait for prices to rise to see a payoff — the asset itself can work for you.\nIt’s also a time-tested hedge against inflation. As the cost of materials, labor, and land rises, property values often increase as well. At the same time, rental income tends to climb, giving landlords a revenue stream that adjusts with inflation.\nNew investing platforms are making it easier than ever to tap into the real estate market.\nFor accredited investors, Homeshares gives access to the $36 trillion U.S. home equity market, which has historically been the exclusive playground of institutional investors.\nWith a minimum investment of $25,000, investors can gain direct exposure to hundreds of owner-occupied homes in top U.S. cities through their U.S. Home Equity Fund — without the headaches of buying, owning or managing property.\nBacked by world-class investors like Jeff Bezos, Arrived makes it easy to fit these properties into your investment portfolio regardless of your income level. Their flexible investment amounts and simplified process allows accredited and non-accredited investors to take advantage of this inflation-hedging asset class without any extra work on your part.\nThe process is simple: browse a curated selection of homes that have been vetted for their appreciation and income potential. Once you find a property you like, you can select the number of shares you’d like to purchase.\nAnother option is First National Realty Partners (FNRP), which allows accredited investors to diversify their portfolio through grocery-anchored commercial properties, without taking on the responsibilities of being a landlord.\nWith a minimum investment of $50,000, investors can own a share of properties leased by national brands like Whole Foods, Kroger and Walmart, which provide essential goods to their communities. Thanks to Triple Net (NNN) leases, accredited investors are able to invest in these properties without worrying about tenant costs cutting into their potential returns.\nSimply answer a few questions – including how much you would like to invest – to start browsing their full list of available properties.\nStay in the know. Join 200,000+ readers and get the best of Moneywise sent straight to your inbox every week for free. Subscribe now.\nMogul Club is a real estate investment platform offering fractional ownership in blue-chip rental properties, which gives investors monthly rental income, real-time appreciation and tax benefits — without the need for a $250,000 down payment or 3 A.M. tenant calls.\nEach property undergoes a vetting process, requiring a minimum 12% return even in downside scenarios. Across the board, the platform features an average annual IRR of 18.8%. Their cash-on-cash yields, meanwhile, average between 10-12% annually.\nEvery investment is secured by real assets, not dependent on the platform’s viability. Each property is held in a standalone Propco LLC, so investors own the property — not the platform. Blockchain-based fractionalization adds a layer of safety, ensuring a permanent, verifiable record of each stake.\nGetting started is a quick and easy process. All you need to do is sign up for an account and then browse available properties. Once you verify your information with their team, you can invest in the properties of your choice in as little as 30 seconds.\nA finer alternative\nIt’s easy to see why great works of art tend to appreciate over time. Supply is limited and many famous pieces have already been snatched up by museums and collectors.\nArt also has a low correlation with stocks and bonds, which helps with diversification. But it’s not without drawbacks: fine art is an illiquid, high-risk asset whose value can be influenced by shifting tastes, trends and the art world's inner circle. It also requires proper storage, insurance and care — adding to the cost and complexity.\nIn 2022, a collection of art owned by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen sold for $1.5 billion at Christie’s New York, making it the most valuable collection in auction history.\nInvesting in art was traditionally a privilege reserved for the ultra-wealthy.\nNow, that’s changed with Masterworks — a platform for investing in shares of blue-chip artwork by renowned artists, including Pablo Picasso, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Banksy. They charge a 1.5% annual management fee and receive 20% of the profit when a painting sells.\nIt’s easy to use, and there have been 23 successful exits to date that have distributed roughly $61 million back to investors.\nSimply browse their impressive portfolio of paintings and choose how many shares you’d like to buy. Masterworks will handle all the details, making high-end art investments both accessible and effortless.\nNew offerings have sold out in minutes, but you can skip their waitlist here.

The company had another great earnings report for the third quarter, sending the stock higher again. The year's best-performing stock in the S&P 500 is up 128% just this year, and by an incredible 600% in the last 12 months.\nBefore Palantir's earnings, I noted three of the most important metrics that investors should consider when evaluating the results -- revenue growth, customer growth and the company's backlog. In all three cases, Palantir managed to exceed expectations, which is why the stock is setting new all-time highs.\nNow that the dust has settled, it's time to take a fresh look at Palantir in the wake of its earnings report. Should investors still be bullish, or is it time to start taking profits? Or perhaps investors would do well to sit back and wait.\nHere's a peek behind the curtain of Palantir stock.\nPalantir's earnings dominance\nPalantir operates dominant artificial intelligence (AI) platforms that specialize in pulling information from multiple sources to allow users to make real-time decisions. Its Gotham platform is used by governments and militaries to tap into satellites and scour other sources of information to help commanders position their troops and achieve objectives.\nThe company's work came to light when it was credited for helping the U.S. military track down 9\/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden. Under the Trump administration, it's greatly expanding its work to include Homeland Security, the State Department, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nMeanwhile, Palantir's Foundry platform is used by commercial customers to help manage a range of activities from hospital records to supply chains and reduce manufacturing costs. Both platforms operate in coordination with Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which allows users to type in detailed prompts to get recommendations and insights that are delivered through generative AI. When Palantir unveiled its AIP more than a year ago, its stock really took off.\nThe momentum continued in the second quarter, when Palantir's quarterly revenue topped the $1 billion mark for the first time, up 48% from a year ago. Income was $269.3 million, up 27% from last year. Breaking it down further, Palantir saw U.S. commercial revenue jump 93% to reach $306 million and U.S. government revenue rise 53% to $426 million.\nThe company's customer count also jumped, rising 43% from a year ago and 10% from the first quarter. Palantir closed 157 deals in the quarter valued at at least $1 million, and 42 that were valued at at least $10 million.\nIn addition, Palantir has a long runway of additional growth. The company says it has $2.42 billion in total remaining performance obligations, up from $1.37 billion in the second quarter of last year and up from $1.9 billion in the first quarter. When I analyzed Palantir before its most recent earnings report, I said I would consider anything over $2.15 billion to be a strong number -- and Palantir blew that out of the water.\nSo where do we go from here -- buy, sell, or hold?\nThe argument to buy\nSimply put, Palantir is a world-changing company that has exploded to become one of the most consequential of our time. With a market cap of more than $400 billion now, Palantir is bigger than Home Depot and Procter & Gamble. At the time of this writing, it ranks as No. 23 in the world in size.\nWith the U.S. government eager to expand Palantir's role and dozens of commercial clients lining up to take advantage of the company's unique abilities, I'm firmly convinced that it's just getting started. CEO Alex Karp has the same vision.\nIn his most recent letter to shareholders, he boldly states: \"With continued execution, and a focus on what matters and a near complete disinterest in what does not, we believe that Palantir will become the dominant software company of the future. And the market is now waking up to this reality.\"\nThe argument to sell\nI'm a Palantir bull but recognize that the valuation of this stock is out of control. For instance, the company has a price-to-earnings ratio (P\/E) of 777 and a forward price-to earnings ratio of 307. That's more than a nosebleed level that's overly inflated because Palantir is reinvesting a lot of its profits. But it would also be ridiculous for anyone to assume that the company will keep that same rate of growth.\nInstead of P\/E, let's use the price-to-sales ratio (P\/S) to forecast reasonable growth. Assume that Palantir generates 40% revenue growth in the next year -- a number that would actually be slowing from its current pace. With that growth, it would have annual revenue of roughly $4.4 billion. As the company has a forward price-to-sales valuation of 108, this would give it a projected market cap in a year of $471 billion -- which would give it roughly the same market cap as Netflix.\nThat's fine growth, but the market isn't going to keep paying this multiple if the market cap upside is only 18% in the next year -- especially when you consider how dynamic its growth has been so far.\nEither the valuation begins to return to Earth or the stock remains overly inflated. But I can't think of a reasonable argument based on math instead of momentum for Palantir to sustain its current valuation. With the stock price up 600% in the last 12 months, I couldn't blame anyone for a little profit-taking here.\nThe argument to hold\nThis is a simple play -- sit back and wait for more information. If you're not day trading, then it's often wrong to overreact to the news of the day because timing the market is virtually impossible. You'll tend to lose out on opportunities and rack up way too many fees by buying and selling too much. As long as you're confident in the quality of the company, there's nothing wrong with emulating the master of buy-and-hold investing, Warren Buffett.\nThe final call\nWhile the momentum is all for buying Palantir and the math says to sell, I'm bridging the middle and holding. I think that the opportunity surrounding Palantir is too valuable to discard, but I'm not eager to buy more of the stock at this valuation.\nI think that's the right play -- particularly if you have Palantir as part of a well-balanced portfolio. However, if the company is one of a few holdings or it makes up an overly large percentage of your overall holdings, then this is the ideal time to rebalance and reduce your overall exposure.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\nNvidia:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009,you’d have $462,306!*\nApple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $38,522!*\nNetflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $619,036!*\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, available when you joinStock Advisor, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\nPatrick Sanders has positions in Palantir Technologies.

The March 2025 deal wrapped up in May and marks another significant foreign acquisition in the US food sector, following a pattern that has seen Smithfield Foods sold to China’s WH Group in 2013 for $4.7 billion and Anheuser-Busch acquired by Belgian-Brazilian InBev in 2008 for $52 billion.\nThe acquisition comes at an important time when egg prices have been volatile due to repeated bird flu outbreaks, supply chain disruptions, and fires at major production facilities. For the freight industry, this sale represents a shift in control over one of the most transportation-intensive food products in the US.\nHillandale Farms ranks as the fourth largest egg producer in the US, housing 18.34 million layers across production facilities in the Northeast, Midwest and Southeast. What made Hillandale unique in the industry was its fully vertically integrated operations the company controlled everything from breeding chickens and producing feed to transportation and distribution.\nHillandale operates a fleet of approximately 250 trailers to transport eggs throughout New England, from Maine down to the Carolinas, with about 40 trucks and 100 trailers primarily traveling major highways through large cities. This extensive transportation network moves millions of dozens of eggs weekly to major retailers and distributors, making it a significant player in food freight.\nThe company’s transportation-intensive model extends beyond just egg delivery. As a fully integrated operation, Hillandale also manages:\n-\nFeed transportation from mills to farms\n-\nLive chicken transport between facilities\n-\nEquipment and supply distribution\n-\nWaste and byproduct hauling\nThe Hillandale sale continues a trend of foreign control over critical US food infrastructure. China now controls more than a quarter of US pig production through Smithfield Foods, while Brazil-based JBS has a 14% market share, meaning two foreign companies control two-fifths of US pig production.\nThe deal will double Global Eggs’ production output, giving the combined company 2024 revenue of about $2 billion. As part of the acquisition, Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual will invest $300 million in Global Eggs in exchange for an 11% stake.\nUnlike the Smithfield acquisition, which faced significant political resistance, the Hillandale sale has received minimal mainstream media coverage despite occurring during a period of elevated egg prices and supply concerns.\nHillandale has faced significant operational challenges in recent years that likely influenced the sale decision:\nBird Flu Devastation: The company’s Ohio facilities were hit by bird flu outbreaks that resulted in the culling of roughly 3 million chickens, disrupting production and requiring expensive biosecurity measures.\nCatastrophic Fires: In early 2023, a fire at Hillandale’s Connecticut facility killed an estimated 100,000 hens, further straining supply.\nFacility Closures: The company permanently shut down its Turner, Maine operations in December 2024, citing high costs of doing business in Maine and expensive feed transportation. Since 2015, the Maine facility had scaled down production by approximately two-thirds, from 2.3 million birds to under 500,000.\nThese setbacks contributed to the broader egg supply issues that have plagued American consumers, with wholesale egg prices reaching as high as $8.16 per dozen earlier this year before recent declines.\nThe sale has several implications for freight and transportation, especially for small carriers and owner-operators who rely on payment terms to keep their cash flow flowing. When Inbev purchased Anheuser-Busch payment terms went to 180 days, which removed many small fleet operators from the AB Inbev freight ecosystem unless they had serious backing or a terrific factor.\nBrazilian Import Competition: US imports of Brazilian eggs surged 93% in February 2025, as the US has boosted imports from Brazil due to domestic supply constraints. With a Brazilian company now controlling a major US producer, questions arise about future import strategies and potential supply redirection during crises.\nVertical Integration Under Foreign Control: Hillandale’s integrated model means the new Brazilian owners control not just egg production, but the entire supply chain, including transportation networks, feed mills, and distribution systems.\nRegulatory Oversight: Hillandale operates under multiple USDOT numbers across different states, with transportation operations that will now ultimately answer to foreign ownership.\nSupply Chain Security: During the 2022-2023 egg crisis, Hillandale’s integrated model and transportation capabilities were crucial for maintaining supply to major markets. That infrastructure is now foreign-controlled.\nThe egg industry represents a significant portion of agricultural freight. According to industry data:\n-\nTotal truck tonnage is projected to rise from 11.27 billion tons in 2024 to 13.99 billion tons in 2035\n-\nAgricultural freight, including perishable foods like eggs, faces increased costs with maintenance averaging $14,000 annually for owner-operators\nA little-known industry reality is that many premium organic and cage-free brands source from the same large producers, with differences often coming down to feed composition and housing systems rather than entirely separate operations. Store brand trailers regularly load alongside organic name-brand eggs that sell for four to five times the price at the same grocers.\nIndustry analysis shows Hillandale operates as “an industrialized organic brand that focuses on profit margin rather than dedication to organic ideals,” providing outdoor access strips rather than true pasture systems. This raises questions about whether Brazilian ownership will maintain even current welfare standards.\nThe acquisition transforms Global Eggs into a major international player with significant presence in North America, South America, and Europe. Faria noted plans for a potential IPO of Global Eggs on the New York Stock Exchange.\nUS antitrust enforcers are already investigating whether America’s top egg producers are engaged in illegal price fixing, with wholesale egg prices spiking 255%. In comparison, only 15% of the egg-laying flock was killed by bird flu.\nThe Hillandale sale represents more than just another corporate transaction. It’s the latest transfer of critical American food infrastructure to foreign control, with significant implications for supply chains, transportation networks, and ultimately food security. The freight industry should closely monitor how these ownership changes affect routing, pricing, and supply reliability in the months ahead.\nThe deal’s low profile compared to previous high-profile foreign acquisitions of American food companies may reflect timing and media attention cycles. Still, the implications for transportation and food security are no less significant.\nThe post What Brazil’s ‘Egg King’ Buying Hillandale Farms Means for US Eggs and Freight appeared first on FreightWaves.","content_hash":"700a6a5940a753ce708d47e05bd0f437","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":7208,"method_rank":0}

But over the trailing decade, nothing has come close to rivaling the gains delivered by cryptocurrencies.\nWhereas the benchmark S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has roughly tripled over the trailing decade, prominent payment-based digital currencies XRP(CRYPTO: XRP) and Dogecoin(CRYPTO: DOGE) have soared by more than 34,000% and nearly 117,000%, respectively, based on data from YCharts.\nWhile these popular cryptocurrencies have become staples in the portfolios of digital-asset investors, both Ripple-created XRP and Dogecoin appear primed for a difficult August, and a potentially rough second-half of 2025, for a variety of reasons.\nXRP's and Dogecoin's adoption rates aren't as impressive as you might think\nAside from the appeal of decentralization (XRP is only partially decentralized since it's the bridge currency developed for Ripple's payment network), one of the primary selling points of cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain networks is the ability to facilitate peer-to-peer and\/or cross-border transactions faster, safer, and considerably cheaper than existing methods.\nXRP, which is the bridge currency used in cross-border transactions for financial institutions, and Dogecoin, which is primarily used for peer-to-peer and merchant transactions, have seen their usage rates grow over time.\nHowever, adoption rates remain relatively tame. For instance, in the neighborhood of 300 global financial institutions are using RippleNet for cross-border payments. But what's worth noting is that not all of these banks are required to use XRP as the intermediary currency. While RippleNet grows in adoption, demand for XRP isn't increasing on a 1-for-1 basis.\nAs for Dogecoin, it received a boost when Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who's been a longtime Dogecoin enthusiast and small stakeholder, announced his company would accept DOGE for select goods. But outside of Tesla, DOGE token use cases are minimal, with around 2,500 merchants accepting it in 2024, based on data collected by Cryptopolitan.\nAlthough traditional payment methods are costlier and slower, they're still the undisputed top option.\nNeither XRP Ledger nor Dogecoin offers unbeatable networks\nTo build on the first point, neither XRP Ledger nor Dogecoin offers blockchain networks that stand out as unbeatable.\nTo give credit where credit is due, these blockchain networks are considerably faster and cheaper than the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT, which has been the standard for cross-border transactions for decades. Instead of waiting days for traditional payments to settle, XRP Ledger can validate and settle payments in three to five seconds for a fraction of a penny.\nMeanwhile, Dogecoin averages a settlement time of roughly one minute, with most transactions costing in the neighborhood of $0.02.\nHowever, Solana offers the ability to complete international transactions for a fraction of a cent in an average settlement time of 400 milliseconds. Similarly, Stellar, which is more commonly used for peer-to-peer transactions in similar fashion to DOGE, can settle for a fraction of a penny in five seconds or less.\nBuy the rumor, sell the news\nAnother reason to expect XRP and Dogecoin to struggle mightily in August, if not well beyond, is the common financial markets idiom, \"buy the rumor, sell the news.\"\nBoth tokens had tangible catalysts entering 2025. President Trump's November victory paved the way for the resignation of now-former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who was generally skeptical of digital assets and had ongoing litigation against Ripple. With Gensler leaving office on Jan. 20, Trump's inauguration date, it rolled out the red carpet for Ripple's litigation woes to be cleared up.\nAs for Dogecoin, Trump's victory led to Elon Musk's being used as a special employee for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Although this \"DOGE\" has absolutely nothing to do with actual DOGE tokens, Musk's having the president's ear was viewed as a positive for all digital assets -- especially Dogecoin.\nThe problem is that these catalysts are now firmly in the rearview mirror. Elon Musk is no longer part of DOGE, and Gensler left his role more than six months ago. With no clear immediate catalysts for XRP or Dogecoin, it may be time for investors to \"sell the news.\"\nCrypto is tethered to an exceptionally pricey stock market\nPerhaps the most-damning of all reasons XRP and Dogecoin can tumble in August, and possibly for many months thereafter, is the inextricable link between the crypto market and stock market.\nWhen cryptocurrencies were initially conceived, they were prominently viewed as a separate asset class that, in some instances, would act as a hedge against inflation and an alternative to stocks. But as time has passed, digital assets have ebbed and flowed in lockstep with equities.\nThe good news here is that Wall Street's major stock indexes spend a disproportionate amount of time climbing, rather than falling. Based on data published by Bespoke Investment Group in June 2023, the average S&P 500 bear market since the start of the Great Depression in September 1929 has lasted only 286 calendar days. In comparison, the typical S&P 500 bull market endured for 1,011 calendar days, or approximately 3.5 times as long as the average bear market.\nBut there's an asterisk that should be placed next to the current S&P 500 bull market. Specifically, this is the third-priciest continuous bull market when back-tested 154 years, based on data from the Shiller price-to-earnings ratio. When valuations become extended to the upside as they are now, it's simply a matter of when, not if, stocks endure a sizable downturn.\nIf the stock market corrects lower, there's a very high probability XRP and Dogecoin will follow suit at an accelerated pace.\nTrump’s Tariffs Could Create $1.5 Trillion AI Gold Rush\nThe Motley Fool’s analysts are tracking a massive shift in U.S. tech.

Israeli troops have been conducting ground operations in Gaza since Oct. 27, 2023, with pauses during two ceasefires.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday on Fox News that Israel intended to take control of all of Gaza. \"We intend to, in order to assure our security, remove Hamas there, enable the population to be free of Gaza and to pass it to civilian governance that is not Hamas and not anyone advocating the destruction of Israel. That's what we want to do.\"\nPressed again on that point, specifically on whether he meant Israel would \"take control of the entire 26-mile Gaza Strip,\" Netanyahu said: \"Well, we don't want to keep it. We want to have a security perimeter. We don't want to govern it.\"\nThe troop buildup comes during a tense time in relations between the United States and Israel. On July 28, Netanyahu and President Donald Trump had a private phone conversation that devolved into shouting amid White House concerns over how the Gaza Humanitarian Fund, a U.S.- and Israel-backed relief effort, is working, according to a senior U.S. official, two former U.S. officials and a Western official who were briefed on the matter.\nThe recent flare-up of tensions between Trump and Netanyahu began July 27. Appearing at an event in Jerusalem that day, Netanyahu said: \"There is no policy of starvation in Gaza. And there is no starvation in Gaza.\"\nWhen Trump was asked about those comments the next day during a trip to Scotland, he contradicted Netanyahu. He said that he had seen images of children in Gaza who \"look very hungry,\" that there is \"real starvation\" there and that \"you can't fake that.\"\nNetanyahu then privately demanded a phone call with Trump, the senior U.S. official and the former U.S. official briefed on the call said. The two leaders were connected within hours, those two officials said.\nNetanyahu told Trump on the phone that widespread starvation in Gaza is not real and that it had been fabricated by Hamas, said the senior U.S. official, two former U.S. officials and the Western official, all of whom were briefed on the call. Trump interrupted Netanyahu and began yelling, they said, saying that he did not want to hear that the starvation is fake and that his aides had shown him proof that children there are starving, they said.\nWhite House officials declined to comment on the phone call. Israeli officials declined to comment.\nOne of the former U.S. officials briefed on the call described it as \"a direct, mostly one-way conversation about the status of humanitarian aid\" in which Trump \"was doing most of the talking.\"\n\"The U.S. not only feels like the situation is dire, but they own it because of GHF,\" the former official said, referring to the Gaza Humanitarian Fund.\nThe phone call prompted a trip to the region last week by Steve Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, to find a unified path forward in the war.\nIsraeli officials were pleased with Witkoff's visit, according to the Western official and the source briefed on Israeli discussions. The Israelis viewed everything from his body language to the questions he asked as indicators that they were able to effectively communicate the challenges Israel faces. The Israeli officials also addressed international criticism of GHF with Witkoff, explaining why, in their opinion, some critics want it to fail, the source briefed on Israeli discussions said.\nGHF has been working in Gaza since May. It operates only in specific designated distribution sites that are far away from some Palestinians who need food, leading to large crowds that Israeli troops — who are stationed nearby — have at times fired upon. As of late July, more than 1,000 Palestinians had been killed while seeking food, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. GHF has been boycotted by the U.N., which has operated its own aid distribution network in Gaza.\nWitkoff pressed officials about whether current relief efforts can meet ongoing need or should expand further, according to the source briefed on Israeli discussions.\nWitkoff has since returned. He briefed Trump on his visit over dinner Monday night, according to a White House official. Their discussion included humanitarian aid in Gaza and Witkoff's meeting with Israeli officials and hostage families.\nAsked by reporters Tuesday whether he would support Israel's occupying Gaza, Trump said he is focused on getting people there food. As for a military occupation, he said: \"I really can't say. That's going to be pretty much up to Israel.\"\nWhite House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told NBC News: \"We do not comment on the President's private conversations. President Trump is focused on returning all the hostages and getting the people in Gaza fed.\"\nA new Gaza ceasefire has proven elusive. Israel does not believe Hamas is motivated to negotiate the release of the remaining hostages, the source briefed on Israeli discussions and the Western official said, and it believes a military offensive is the likeliest option.\nThe international community has recently been heaping pressure on Israel, with the United Kingdom, France, Canada and others saying they may move to recognize a Palestinian state at the U.N. General Assembly in September.\n\"It seems like we are at a brick wall, with countries saying they are recognizing Palestine,\" said the person briefed on Israeli discussions. \"Now all ideas are being exhausted.\"\nThe Western official said an offensive remains a very dangerous prospect for the Israeli military because Hamas is very dug in and there is \"no chance they can kill every fighter.\"\nThe Western official added that there is concern that Hamas will kill hostages or put them in the way of fighting if it is threatened.\nIsraeli forces know the general area where all the hostages are, said the person briefed on Israeli discussions and the Western official, one of whom added that the belief is that area is in central Gaza.\n\"Looking at the condition of hostages, it's clear that they don't have much more time,\" one of the sources added in reference to a recent video of an emaciated Israeli hostage inside a cramped Gaza tunnel digging his own grave.","content_hash":"75f027802c827b48fdd1c46f8d643731","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6957,"method_rank":0}

","published_at":"2025-08-08T20:15:00.000Z","source_id":"gdelt_finance_yahoo_com","source_name":"finance.yahoo.com via GDELT","crawl_method":"gdelt","language":"en","paywall":false,"text":"Even though it has a monopoly on critical technology and the artificial intelligence revolution in full swing, ASML Holdings(NASDAQ: ASML) has lagged both theNasdaq 100index and the iShares Semiconductor ETF(NASDAQ: SOXX) year to date, as well as over the past one, three, and five years.\nThis is kind of an amazing statistic, given ASML's monopoly on extreme ultraviolent lithography (EUV), which is needed to produce semiconductors below the 7 nanometer (nm) node. 7nm chips began to be produced in 2019, and the industry has progressed to 2nm chips, which will arrive by the end of this year. Furthermore, all the leading DRAM memory producers are just now adopting EUV, and DRAM demand is exploding because of the memory needs of AI systems.\nOf course, ASML has been known to have this monopoly for a while and entered the past five years at a higher valuation than peers. Yet the stock's underperformance has changed that, and shares now look like somewhat of a bargain, at least by growth stock standards.\nASML is at a decade-long discount\nAfter its recent post-earnings selloff, ASML now trades at roughly 25 times earnings. That valuation doesn't scream \"cheap\" on the surface. But again, ASML is an extraordinary company, and that valuation is the cheapest it has been over the past 10 years, with a few exceptions.\nMuch of the recent selloff has to do with near-term concerns over the 2026 growth outlook. On ASML's recent earnings release, management said that while the company is still preparing for a growth year next year, it wasn't guaranteeing it. That was a change from last quarter, when ASML said it was expecting a growth year in 2026, after a strong midteens growth expectation this year.\nManagement spoke of the overhang of tariffs, which could have both direct and indirect impacts. Tariffs may directly slow the several of ASML's end markets, as those end products are still mostly assembled in East Asia. There is also the question of Section 232 tariffs on semiconductors, which have not yet been announced. Should semiconductors get tariffed specifcally, many important chips could be directly affected, given the importance of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM) in the electronics supply chain.\nThere are also indirect impacts on the wider economy, which could also depress overall demand. Although chips tend to have la strong long-term growth outlook, it's still a very cyclical business at times. Last Friday, we perhaps saw the first signs of tariffs' impacts on the economy, as job creation for July came in well below target, while the stronger readings from May and June were also revised down.\nThe big innovation in chips today doesn't have to do with lithography\nAnother part of ASML's valuation compression may have to do with the technology of chipmaking itself.\nMajor chipmakers are now switching from finFET transistors, with the gate surrounding three sides of the transistor source, to gate-all-around transistors, in which the gate encircles the source on all four sides. This architecture also allows transistor sources to be stacked on top of each other in vertical fashion.\nIn addition, another innovation going on right now is backside power, in which the power controls of the chip are being built on the back side of the silicon and connected through the silicon surface to the front. This frees up more space on the front of the chip, allowing greater transistor counts and performance.\nLithography, which is what ASML does, has to do with shrinking transistors down to smaller and smaller sizes so that more can fit on a given piece of silicon. However, the enabling technologies of GAA and backside power have more to do with other areas of manufacturing technology, such as etch and deposition, novel packaging and wafer thinning, and increased metrology.\nThis could be why other major semicap equipment stocks in etch, deposition, and metrology have seen their valuations go up, as ASML's valuation has come back down toward them:\nBut near-termism has created an opportunity\nWhile the picture for 2026 and maybe the next couple of years are a bit murky for ASML, the long-term growth opportunity appears intact, as does ASML's competitive advantage in lithography.\nCountering the worries about a near-term slowdown in lithography intensity, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet noted:\nSo I think that after the 1.4 nanometer node, we will see again some litho intensity increase some more EUV layers. If you look at the long term also there, the Logic customers are extremely bullish about the need for more EUV layers. So yes, there is one node as it happened before with FinFET, where there's a bit of a pause. But I always explain the only reason for that pause is to enable more shrink moving forward. So for every node where you pause basically to change your transistor architecture, usually, you will see 3, 4, 5 nodes where you continue basically to shrink and there drive more litho intensity.\nBasically, the 2nm node may not see an increase in litho intensity as chipmakers focus on getting the new transistor and backside power right, but lithography intensity and shrink should still continue beyond that point into the future. On that note, ASML kept its 2030 revenue range outlook between 44 billion to 60 billion euros intact. That's relative to the 32.2 billion euros ASML has made over the past 12 months.\nIn that scenario, ASML should be making between 14 billion and 23 billion euros in net profit by 2030, relative to its 230 billion Euro market cap today.\nGiven ASML's technology moat and the strong long-term picture for advanced semiconductors and memory, that a seems like a very solid value for investors looking beyond the next year.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

One is led by SK Telecom, a telecommunications giant in Korea and includes gaming firm Krafton and chip startup Rebellions among other companies.\nThere are other teams led by some of the country's other prominent firms including LG and Naver.\n\"We are going through an important juncture in terms of our technological development. So Korea, at the national level, is focusing on ensuring that we lay the technical foundation to have our competitiveness,\" Kim Taeyoon, head of the foundation model office at SK Telecom who also leads the company's consortium, told CNBC.\n\"Korea has many entities that would excel at creating a big AI industry. And we could clearly see the possibility that we are very capable of creating a good AI stack,\" Kim added.\nA \"stack\" refers to various technologies that make up a product or other technology.\nSouth Korea's forte\nThe initiative aims to draw on the strategic position of some of South Korea's firms and the technology they develop that are crucial to AI.\nFor example, SK Hynix makes high-bandwidth memory (HBM) which is critical to Nvidia's products. Samsung is also another major memory player. SK Telecom has been expanding its business into data centers. While Rebellions, which is part of SKT's consortium, is developing chips designed to handle AI workloads.\nSamsung, meanwhile, has its own chip manufacturing business, also known as foundry.\n\"This means the country possesses the entire AI stack, from chips to cloud to AI models, and also benefits from a robust community of advanced AI researchers who are actively publishing papers and securing patents,\" The Futurum Group's Patience said.\nGiven the intricacies of technology supply chains, no one country can do it alone. The consortia will still rely on graphics processing units (GPUs) from American firm Nvidia which have become the gold standard for training AI models.\nMeanwhile, SK Telecom will train the models it develops on its own Titan supercomputer, which is made up of Nvidia GPUs, as well as an AI data center the company is developing with Amazon.\nAI model roadmap\nSK Telecom is not new to the AI model game. The company launched a beta version of its first chatbot based on its own large language model in 2022 called \"A.\" which is pronounced \"A dot.\" Since then, it has developed more advanced versions of the model and chatbot.\nSK Telecom's consortium plans to release its first model by the end of the year, Kim said. It will be initially focused on the market in South Korea, but could be used globally. The model will be open-source, meaning it will free for developers to use and build on, potentially with some licensing requirements.\nAny AI models coming out of South Korea's project will face intense competition from players including OpenAI and Anthropic as well as many of the strong open-source offerings out of Chinese firms like Alibaba and DeepSeek.\nCreating an AI model won't be a problem, given SK Telecom and other companies' already-proven track record in doing so.\nThe bigger challenge will be putting forward models that can compete with those coming out of frontier AI labs, which are pouring billions of dollars into research and development. Another issue will be getting traction among developers to build upon these models. That has what has made a success of other open-source models, like those from Alibaba.\nSK Telecom's Kim said the goal is to create models that can rival these other companies.\n\"Our first goal is to create a very strong state-of-the-art open source model and we already have an example of those open source models which are on par in terms of performance with those large tech (players) like OpenAI or Anthropic,\" Kim told CNBC.\nHe added that there will be models of different sizes that can be used by different industries.\nAn open-source national AI model could also provide benefits by giving businesses across the country access to the latest technology without having to rely on a tech giant from abroad.\nMeanwhile, South Korean AI models could be positioned as an alternative to U.S. and Chinese-developed systems.\n\"Beyond domestic benefits, a proven sovereign AI model presents significant export potential. Just as Korea excelled in memory chips, this could become a valuable product for other nations seeking alternatives to U.S. or Chinese systems, strengthening Korea's position in the global AI landscape,\" Patience said.\nAI sovereignty\nUnderpinning this push from South Korea is the concept of \"sovereign AI\" that has gained traction with many nations.\nThis is the notion that AI models and services, which governments see as having strategic importance, should be built within a country and run on servers located domestically.\n\"All major nations are increasingly concerned about AI sovereignty as the US and China vie for AI dominance,\" The Futurum Group's Patience said.\n\"Given AI's growing influence on critical sectors like healthcare, finance, defense, and government, countries cannot afford to cede control of their digital intelligence to foreign entities.\"\nOther countries are taking different approaches to their AI development. In the Middle East, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are relying heavily on American technology to develop AI. In Europe, a lot of hope is pinned on French startup Mistral AI to emerge as the region's leading company in the tech. However, Europe will also need to heavily rely on American chips and other technology.\nSouth Korea is attempting to tackle more parts of the technology supply chain itself as it builds out its AI capabilities, even though it will still rely on some infrastructure from companies like Nvidia as well as Amazon and Microsoft.\n\"This comprehensive, full-stack approach positions South Korea to stand out in the global race for sovereign AI,\" Patience said.","content_hash":"044fd3d31366d81c11331cdb2b54e2e2","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6727,"method_rank":0}

In the July 31 letter which was a response to a Swiss gold refinery's request for clarification on tariffs, the CBP said one-kilogram and 100-ounce gold bars should be categorized under a customs code that market watchers say will not exempt them from reciprocal tariffs. The CBP said in its ruling letter that the bars in question should not be classified as unwrought non-monetary gold bullion or dore — which is categorized with the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) code 7108.12.10. Instead, the agency said, the bars should be classified under the customs code 7108.13.5500. Switzerland, the world's largest gold refiner, shipped 192.9 metric tons of gold to the U.S. in January. In a Friday note to clients, Michael Hsueh, a research analyst at Deutsche Bank, said only gold fitting the 7108.12.10 classification was exempt from U.S. tariffs. He said uncertainty on gold tariffs \"re-emerged\" on the back of the FT publicizing the CBP's ruling, labeling the gold futures spike \"a reprise of the importing rush\" that took hold in late 2024 and earlier this year. Demand for gold, widely seen as a safe haven asset in times of market turbulence, has risen this year, sending prices soaring . The CBP's letter also explained that in line with new U.S. Executive Orders, all imported merchandise must now be reported to customs with details of either the reciprocal tariff that applies, or details of provisions that exempt the goods from reciprocal tariffs. The duty rate for gold varies based on its specific characteristics and country of origin, a spokesperson for the U.S. International Trade Commission said Friday. In its ruling letter, the CBP told the Swiss refiner that its one-kilogram and 100-ounce bars failed to qualify in the 7108.12.10 category, as they had been stamped and needled or lasered with identifying information. They were therefore too processed to qualify as unwrought. Deutsche Bank's Hsueh said in his note that while it was too early to make any final judgements on the CBP's letter, \"on the face of it the CBP ruling is applicable to [gold imported from] all countries.\" However, Hsueh suggested there could be ways for gold exporters to skirt around U.S. tariffs. \"The failure of tariff exemption is based on the nature of the manufactured gold bar and its HTS classification, rather than being dependent on the country of origin,\" he explained, referring to the International Trade Commission's Harmonized Tariff Schedule — the database that holds the customs codes for imported goods. \"There is nothing in the CBP ruling which precludes the gold refiner from adjusting its operations to produce gold in a format which fits HTS code 7108.12.10, thereby qualifying for tariff exemption. This could take the form of a cast bar which is only minimally processed after the fact, or granules which are likely to also qualify as minimally processed.\" Jitters ahead The new ruling on tariffs surprised the gold market, according to Joni Teves, strategist at Swiss investment bank UBS. \"This creates an issue for the global gold market which uses Comex gold futures to hedge positions, with the assumption that it can easily import metal into Comex warehouses in the US to physically settle contracts if needed,\" she said in a Friday note. \"The tariff adds costs to this process, and with the bulk of refining capacity sitting in Switzerland which faces 39% US tariffs, these costs would be quite high.\" Teves argued that until there is clarity on gold tariffs, markets were likely to \"remain jittery.\" \"Historically, the vast majority of Swiss gold exports to the US have fallen under the 7108.12 (unwrought) category, which is exempted from tariffs,\" she said. \"On average, this tariff-exempt category accounted for ~78% of Swiss gold flows to the US.\" Like Hseuh, UBS' Teves suggested that the gold industry may react by changing delivery standards — this could include allowing settlement in alternative locations such as London. \"In the long run, the existence of US tariffs on deliverable gold products raises the question on the role of futures trading in the US as a means to hedge and whether other centres eventually step up as alternatives,\" Teves added. \"There is still a lot of uncertainty around all this and until there is clarity, we expect the gold market and precious metals markets more generally to remain very nervous.\" Philippe Gijsels, chief strategy officer at BNP Paribas Fortis, told CNBC on Friday that he was more bullish than ever on gold. His target price for gold is $4,000 per ounce, but he believes that the metal could even exceed this price point. \"The news on the tariffs on gold risks creating a market dislocation like copper,\" Gijsels said. \"So volatility will increase, but we live more than ever in an uncertain world. In a world where the independence of the Fed lies in the balance and there are more questions about the long term sustainability of [government] debt, inflation will rise and we have to invest in real assets.\" \"I think [gold] could go still higher,\" Gijsels added. \"But indeed, it could be a rocky path.\" Deutsche Bank's Hseuh said in his note on Friday that much of the trajectory for gold depends on the intentions of the U.S. administration, which he argued remains \"unclear.\" \"If their intentions are to stimulate investment in and expand domestic gold refining capacity, then they may well obstruct the ability of foreign gold refiners to meet the standards required for tariff exemption,\" he said. \"Going further, they could even remove the tariff exemption for HTS code 7108.12.10, though this seems unlikely. Either of these actions would risk creating a bifurcated gold market whereby metal circulating amongst buyers and sellers in the US becomes divorced from the volume of metal similarly circulating outside the US.\"","content_hash":"babfbdc2652127a9497ab72506745ac0","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6703,"method_rank":0}

Chinese officials unveiled plans for a new global governance body — the World AI Cooperation Organization (WAICO) — aimed at setting international standards and norms around artificial intelligence. Framed as a bid to prevent monopolies and foster inclusivity, the move was also a clear shot across Washington's bow: a declaration that China intends not just to compete in AI, but to define its rules and global architecture.\nThat same week, the United States released its own high-level vision: Winning the Race: America's AI Action Plan. Spearheaded by AI czar David Sacks, the plan outlines a sweeping, three-pillared strategy focused on accelerating innovation, building infrastructure, and leading in international AI diplomacy. It is a good start — a robust and ambitious document — but it still reflects a fragmented and uneven approach.\nWhat is becoming clear is that the race for global AI leadership will be won not only by those who develop the most powerful models, but by those who can deploy them when and where they matter most. China's practical, application-first approach — deploying open-source AI to improve agriculture, logistics, education, public health, and other public services — makes its model especially attractive to countries seeking early, visible gains. Its export of utility and digital infrastructure — including power grids and smart city platforms in bundles like Huawei's compact \"AI-in-a-box\" systems — is enabling even low-resource nations such as Kenya, Thailand, and Egypt to scale AI applications without the need for expensive hyperscale data centers.\nTo be clear, China's approach is not without risk to its users. Its AI systems often come bundled with surveillance tools, opaque financing, and long-term strategic dependencies. But for many global south countries, these are acceptable trade-offs for tangible benefits. Beijing is meeting rising demand for AI access at cost, at scale, and at speed. In doing so, it is turning AI access into a powerful instrument of soft power, one that fuses technological exports with influence over digital norms, governance preferences, and strategic alignment.\nBy contrast, the U.S. approach remains overly anchored in Silicon Valley's commercial interests. American firms continue to lead in foundational models and generative AI, but the strategy often fails to connect technological excellence with global deployment or development impact. Without an accessible, adaptable model that serves diverse needs, the U.S. risks ceding the AI frontier to China by default.\nWith \"Winning the Race AI Action Plan\" now on the table, even with its imperfections, that may be starting to change. Its pillars — innovation, infrastructure, and diplomacy — signal Washington's recognition that AI leadership demands more than cutting-edge research. It requires trusted systems, trusted rules, and trusted partnerships.\nPresident Trump's high-profile visit to the Middle East in May reflected this growing awareness. Gulf states pledged to import up to 500,000 Nvidia chips annually and build new AI data campuses in the UAE. While these deals remain largely commercial and defense-driven, they underscore rising U.S. acknowledgment of AI's geopolitical heft, especially in regions where China has moved quickly to shape the terrain.\nAt the inaugural APEC Digital and AI Ministerial in Incheon, South Korea, U.S. officials took a further step, joining regional counterparts to discuss responsible AI standards, cross-border data governance, and inclusive digital development. Modest in scope but meaningful in signal, it showed a willingness to engage the multilateral arenas where China has been setting the pace.\nBut more engagement is needed. Once the domain of technical consensus, international standards bodies have quietly become battlegrounds, where norms on everything from algorithmic transparency to facial recognition are contested. China has moved swiftly to embed its preferred frameworks, language, and values into these technical settings. If Washington remains absent or reactive, it risks inheriting a global AI order built on someone else's blueprint.\nThe private sector is beginning to respond as well. This week, OpenAI released its first truly open model, a departure from its proprietary stance and a subtle nod to global demand for AI systems that are transparent, customizable, and adaptable. The headline was safety. The subtext was competitiveness: a need to align more closely with what the rest of the world increasingly wants.\nSovereign AI and who owns the future\nNone of these actions will matter without the infrastructure to back them up. AI runs not just on compute and capital, but on electricity, water, and bandwidth. Training large models can draw immense energy and consume millions of gallons of potable water. For countries facing climate stress and infrastructure constraints, these demands are not just high, they are prohibitive. They will determine who can realistically adopt AI and who gets left behind.\nChina is positioning itself to answer that call. From East Africa to Southeast Asia, Beijing is helping countries think differently about AI access, reframing AI as a utility, embedding it into national systems, and shaping political alignment in the process.\nBeijing's model appeals to countries pursuing \"sovereign AI\" — an emerging desire to build national control over algorithms, data flows, and digital infrastructure. With flexible, bundled solutions, China is offering governments not just access to AI, but ownership over how it's deployed and governed. Washington, by contrast, has yet to articulate a compelling answer for nations that want AI on their own terms — not just on Silicon Valley's.\nWashington and Silicon Valley must understand that winning the AI race means more than winning at home. The competition is global, and the global test is not who reaches artificial general intelligence (AGI) first. It is increasingly about who delivers AI that actually works for the many, not just the few.\nMost of the world will not judge the United States by its breakthroughs in autonomous reasoning. They will judge it by whether its systems solve real problems — health, education, transport, climate — and do so affordably, reliably, and equitably. This is the true arena of AI influence. The coming decade will reveal not just who leads in AI, but who earns the world's trust to lead with it.\n—By Dewardric McNeal, Managing Director and Senior Policy Analyst at Longview Global, and a CNBC Contributor","content_hash":"b5824153aad56ae887cf0653f516a80b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6681,"method_rank":0}

But due to President Donald Trump's tax and spending megabill signed on July 4, that support is set to shrink dramatically, experts say.\nThe \"big beautiful\" bill will cut about $186 billion from SNAP funding through 2034, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office.\nCuts to the program and significant cost shifts to states will leave millions of low-income Americans without some or all of the food assistance they need to put meals on the table, says Katie Bergh, senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research and policy institute.\n\"For decades, SNAP has been there for low-income families, and as a result, we have largely eliminated severe hunger and malnutrition in this country,\" Bergh says. \"But that's not a guarantee without the support that this program provides to help low-income families afford groceries.\"\nCurrently, people who get SNAP benefits receive an average of $6.20 per day, distributed through an Electronic Benefit Transfer card that reloads monthly and can be used at authorized grocery stores and retailers. These amounts could decline or reach fewer people under the \"big beautiful bill,\" Bergh says.\nSome of the changes to the program include:\n- Able-bodied adults ages 18 to 64 without dependents must now meet expanded work requirements of at least 80 hours per month to remain eligible for benefits. Previously, this requirement only applied to adults ages 18 to 54.\n- Veterans, unhoused people or those recently aged out of foster care will no longer be exempt from certain work requirements.\n- SNAP benefits will be more strictly limited to lawful permanent residents and U.S. citizens.\n- Up to 15% of benefit costs will now be covered by states, depending on a state's payment error rate, in addition to a 25 percentage-point uptick in administrative costs, from 50% to 75%.\nStates on the hook for high costs\nThe new budget bill increases the amount of administrative costs states need to cover, and for the first time in the program's history, requires states to foot a portion of the costs for food benefits, too.\nThose higher costs for SNAP could threaten the future of the program in some states altogether, according to the CBPP. That's because states need to balance their budgets annually, and if a state cannot make up the percentage of SNAP it needs to cover, officials will be left with few options for making adjustments, Bergh says.\nThe percentage of SNAP benefit costs a state will have to cover depends on its SNAP payment error rate. The error rate is the percentage of benefits incorrectly paid out by a state, by giving too much or too little to recipients. If a state's error rate is at or above 6%, it will have to cover 5% to 15% of SNAP benefit costs, determined on a sliding scale.\nIn 2024, the average state error rate was 10.9%, according to a report from the Department of Agriculture. Any state with an error rate above 10% will have to cover 15% of its benefit costs under the \"big beautiful\" bill.\nIf California has to cover 15% of benefit costs, it will owe $1.8 billion for SNAP funding in 2028, according to estimated projections from Feeding America, a national network of food service programs. Other states could owe hundreds of millions under the cost shift, Bergh says.\nHere's what could happen if your state can't foot the bill.\nFunding cuts from other state programs\nTo continue providing SNAP, some state officials may slash funding in other areas to make room in the budget. That could result in cuts to housing or public safety programs, according to a report from the CBPP.\nTax hikes could also be on the table, Bergh says, though changes would vary based on state budgeting.\nEligibility restrictions\nStates looking to cut costs may significantly restrict SNAP eligibility to reduce the number of people who qualify for the program, according to the CBPP.\nThat could be done by adding \"red tape\" that makes it harder for people who are eligible for benefits to access and keep them, Bergh says.\nShe says administrative barriers tend to impact the \"most vulnerable people,\" such as seniors and people with disabilities, as well as working families who lack the time to go back and forth with a SNAP benefits office.\nComplete program termination\nIn the situation that a state cannot come up with the money to compensate for the federal funding it's lost, state officials may decide it's necessary to cut SNAP entirely, Bergh says. It is not immediately clear how many states are at risk of losing benefits altogether, as error rates fluctuate from year to year and could change significantly before the benefits cost-shift to states goes into effect in October 2027.\nBecause food banks are \"already overburdened,\" Bergh says, \"they absolutely cannot fill the hole that losing SNAP would leave in a state.\" That means millions of low-income families would be left without basic food security if their states lose SNAP altogether, she says.\nWhat SNAP recipients should know\nPolicy centers and state officials are still awaiting additional guidance from the Department of Agriculture on the steps states need to take to comply with the new provisions and what the timeline for implementing changes will be, Bergh says.\nAlthough this is an unprecedented time, SNAP recipients should feel reassured that changes to SNAP aren't going to happen immediately, or all at once, she says.\n\"It is very hard to say at a national level what the impacts in particular states might be,\" Bergh says. But, \"nothing is going to change overnight.\"\nAs states await updates, it's best for recipients to confirm their contact information is up to date so they don't miss any important notices, per recommendations from state officials.\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

Of those, 640 were calls, and 628 were puts, a slightly bearish indication.\nOne of the top 20 unusually active options on Thursday was the Wayfair (W)Sept. 19 $72.50 put. Expiring in 43 days, I believe this particular option provides valuable insights into the current markets. Read on and I’ll explain.\nHave an excellent weekend. The NFL season is almost here.\nThe Option Itself\nAs I said in the introduction, one of Wayfair’s three unusually active options from yesterday's trading caught my attention, and not in a good way. I’ll get to that shortly. Meanwhile, here’s the put in question.\nThe Sept. 19 $72.50 put expires in 43 days. Its volume of 4,086 was 35.53 times the open interest. Two trades accounted for 4,000 of the total. Those trades both took place between 10:30 and 11 a.m. The remainder were little bets of one or two contracts.\nSomebody was either looking to protect on the downside or generate some income. I’ll consider which scenario seems more likely.\nAre These Two Bets Bullish or Bearish on W Stock?\nTo figure this out, I’ll consider both the long put and the short put.\nThe former is a bet that the share price will fall below the strike price in 43 days, generating a profit after accounting for the premium. If one or both of the trades for 2,000 contracts already own 200,000 Wayfair shares, then it would be a protective put to protect unrealized gains, allowing them to hold onto the shares.\nAlternatively, it could be a very bearish bet that the euphoria from Wayfair’s latest positive earnings surprise would quickly subside, returning to below $60, where it traded as recently as July 21. According to the data below, they’ve got a 33% chance of the share price falling to the $67.60 break-even.\nThe short put, or naked put, expects the shares to keep rising, enabling them to pocket the premium income. In this example, the annualized return from a successful bet would be a very healthy 58.2%. Given the profit probability is nearly 67%, it would suggest that the institutional or hedge fund investors see it continuing to move higher or tread water in the weeks ahead.\nIf I were to hazard a guess, I’d say it’s a little of both. Perhaps one investor was bullish and the other bearish, or vice versa. Alternatively, it could be the case of a large investor looking to capture pricing inefficiencies from the options market.\nHowever, my level of sophistication or lack thereof does not allow me to render an opinion on this front. Now back to Wayfair and its business.\nWayfair Is the Poster Child for Overheated Markets\nI am not a fan of Wayfair’s business or stock. Never have been. I don’t care that its shares are up 64% in 2025. It is not a good stock to own for most risk-averse investors.\nIn mid-March, I considered whether Wayfair stock's 52-week low meant it was a buying opportunity. While I wasn’t buying, I did suggest the Dec. 19 $95 call for those who were.\nThis particular call had two contracts traded yesterday. The ask prices are between 10 and 12 times higher than in March. Makes sense given the shares have more than doubled in the past five months. Options are made for situations like Wayfair.\nNow, I’ll outline the reasons why Wayfair is the poster child for overheated markets.\nThe U.S. economy has yet to reveal the damage inflicted by the Trump administration's historically high tariff rates. This week, the new tariff rates kicked in on Aug. 7 for approximately 100 of America’s trading partners, raising the average tariff rate to 18.3%, the highest since 1934, according to the Budget Lab at Yale.\nCompanies aren’t going to be able to hold off on price increases for much longer. Consumers will soon be paying a lot more for everyday items. For example, Stanley Black & Decker (SWK)has said that tariffs are costing them $800 million in 2025. Not surprisingly, its shares are trading at some of the lowest levels in more than a decade.\nCome the Q3 and Q4 earnings seasons, it could get very ugly for investors.\nAs for Wayfair, its stock is up about 10% since it reported Q2 2025 results before the markets opened on Monday. The company’s earnings press release ran with the headline Wayfair Announces Second Quarter 2025 Results, Reports Highest Revenue Growth and Profitability Since 2021.\nThe long and the short of the report: It made $15 million off $3.27 billion in revenue, a net margin of 0.5%. On a non-GAAP basis, its adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) was $205 million, a margin of 6.3%.\nSince Wayfair went public in October 2014, it’s had just six quarters out of 45 where it has made money on a GAAP basis from its continuing operations. The most recent example was this past quarter. Its best stretch of profitability was during COVID-19, when it had five consecutive profitable quarters from Q2 2020 through Q2 2021.\nBut that’s it.\nAccording to S&P Global Market Intelligence, Wayfair’s best quarter for a GAAP profit from continuing operations was $274 million on $4.3 billion in revenue in Q2 2020. Its best trailing 12-month EBITDA was $828.3 million as of Q1 2021, an EBITDA margin of 5.4%. The 12-month EBITDA margin as of June 30 was -0.7% on $12 billion in revenue, $3.3 billion less than in Q1 2021.\nThe company’s current enterprise value is $12.03 billion, 94.3 times its trailing 12-month EBITDA through June 30, more than double what it was in June 2021.\nSo, not only are today’s investors willing to pay twice as much for EBITDA profitability, they’re eager to do so even though sales have fallen in 11 of the past 16 quarters (on a trailing 12-month basis) since June 2021, its best situation in nearly 11 years as a public company.\nThe Bottom Line\nWith thousands of stocks available to invest in, it boggles my mind that even one investor bothers with Wayfair. It’s a lost cause.\nThat said, if you must invest in W stock, do so with options. It’s the only way to go given the risk.\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

But I think we will, so let's say this: I think the 4-year cycle is over,\" Matthew Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, told CNBC.\nWhat is the bitcoin cycle?\nGenerally, the bitcoin cycle refers to a four-year pattern of price movement that revolves around a key event known as the halving, a change to mining rewards that is written in bitcoin's code.\nThe halving happens roughly every four years, with the last one taking place in April 2024 and the one before that was in May 2020.\nWhen the halving occurs, the rewards in the form of bitcoin that are given to so-called miners — entities that keep the bitcoin network functioning — are cut in half. This reduces the supply of bitcoin into the market. Therefore, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin in existence.\nTypically, bitcoin would rally in the months after halving to eventually reach a fresh all-time high. Then bitcoin would plunge, dropping roughly 70% to 80% from its peak leading to the onset of a \"crypto winter,\" a prolonged period of depressed digital coin prices. The price of other cryptos would also fall dramatically in this period. Bitcoin would then trade within a range for a while, and as the next halving approaches, it generally sees its price appreciate. Then the cycle repeats.\nWhat's happened to the bitcoin cycle?\nThere was unprecedented market reaction around the last halving as bitcoin hit a fresh all-time high of above $73,000 in March 2024, about a month before the halving, rather than reaching new heights after the celebrated event as expected.\n\"In every previous cycle, new all-time highs came 12-18 months after the halving,\" Saksham Diwan, research analyst at CoinDesk Data, told CNBC.\nThe main factor was the U.S. approval of bitcoin exchange-traded funds which began trading in January 2024. ETFs track the price movement of bitcoin without an investor actually having to own the cryptocurrency itself.\nBig inflows into ETFs, and the hope that this could bring more traditional institutional investors who had previously stayed away from crypto, helped boost the price of bitcoin.\n\"This time, spot Bitcoin ETF demand essentially front-ran the typical post-halving price discovery. This was indeed the first clear indication that institutional flows could alter traditional cycle dynamics,\" Diwan said.\nWhat factors have helped alter the bitcoin cycle?\nThe ETF was the first major factor that disrupted bitcoin's four-year rhythm. It brought in investors with deep pockets who were interested in holding the cryptocurrency longer term.\nBut a number of other market factors have changed.\nBitwise Asset Management's Hougan points to \"blowups in crypto\" that often preceded the crypto winters. He referenced the crash of so-called initial coin offerings, or ICOs, in 2018 and the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in 2022.\nMeanwhile, the macroeconomic environment and regulation are becoming more supportive.\n\"Interest rates are more likely to go down than up in the next year, and the fact that regulators and legislators are now willing to engage with crypto rather than steadfastly refusing to deal with it will dramatically reduce the risk of future blow-ups,\" Hougan said.\nGary Gensler, former leader of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, had cracked down on the sector and opened a number of cases against crypto firms. Those in the industry said they were being unfairly targeted. Under the current administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, the SEC has dropped some cases against crypto firms. Washington has looked to introduce new laws around crypto and has even launched a bitcoin strategic reserve.\nMeanwhile, public companies are accumulating cryptocurrencies, especially bitcoin, as part of a new strategy.\n\"With increasing market maturity, long-term holder accumulation at all-time highs, and dampened volatility, the traditional 4-year rhythm is being replaced by more liquidity-sensitive, macro-correlated behavior,\" Ryan Chow, co-founder of Solv Protocol, told CNBC.\nWhere are we in the cycle now?\nOne key point to note is that historically the most significant price appreciation for bitcoin occurred between days 500 and 720 post-halving, according to Diwan of CoinDesk Data. Bitcoin peaked during this window in the 2016 and 2020 cycles, Diwan noted.\n\"If this pattern was to repeat, then we should watch for potential acceleration between Q3 2025 and early Q1 2026,\" Diwan said, adding that \"price action [in] this cycle has been notably subdued compared to previous post-halving periods.\"\nHougan, of Bitwise Asset Management, said the four-year cycle is over, but for it to officially be dead, bitcoin would need to have a good 2026, which he expects will happen.\n\"I don't think we've repealed volatility, but I think a) the forces that have historically created the four-year cycle are weaker than they were in the past and b) there are other very strong forces moving on a different timeline that I think will overwhelm our four-year tendency,\" Hougan said in an emailed comment.\nBitcoin's latest record high was hit on July 14 as it pushed above $123,000.\nAre 80% crashes a thing of the past?\nOne prominent feature of previous cycles is that bitcoin would plunge roughly 70% to 80% from its record high following the halving.\nCrypto industry insiders told CNBC this won't happen anymore, given the reasons they've outlined to support a changing four-year cycle.\n\"We believe the era of brutal 70–80% drawdowns is behind us,\" Chow, of Solv Protocol, said.\nHe noted the largest correction this cycle has seen was around 26% on a closing basis compared with around 84% post-2017 and 77% post-2021 all-time highs.\nLong-term holders of bitcoin as well as \"steady institutional inflows are contributing to greater downside absorption, Chow said. He added that there may be corrections in the range of 30% to 50% \"in reaction to macro shocks or regulatory surprises, but they're likely to be shorter and less violent than in previous cycles.\"\nHougan also said that 30% to 50% falls are possible but: \"I bet 70% pullbacks are a thing of the past.\"","content_hash":"b7e48acd0d02ff836c3b9b75418257fb","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6523,"method_rank":0}

Pump.fun's PUMP token has exploded 35% over the past week—making it the standout performer in an otherwise choppy market.\nWhat’s going on? Let’s zoom out:\nThe broader crypto market recovery comes as traditional markets find their footing after President Donald Trump's latest tariff announcements sent the S&P 500 tumbling 1.6% and the Nasdaq dropping 2.24% on Friday—their worst single-day losses since May and April. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq erased those losses today.\nThe cryptocurrency market’s 6.7% decline to begin August initially looked like the start of something uglier, but Monday's recovery has bulls breathing easier. Analysts attribute the drop primarily to profit-taking by traders following a strong rally in July, with no clear signs of panic selling or systemic weakness in the market. This narrative of \"healthy consolidation\" rather than collapse has emboldened dip buyers, with 95% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies posting gains in the past 24 hours.\nEthereum today is up nearly 3% to above $3,600, and XRP is clinging to that all-important $3.00 price point. But with no top 10 coin breaking the 3% barrier, the real fun is reserved for meme coin traders—who really needed it after the recent bloodbath they went through.\nPUMP price: Bulls defeat the FUD\nPump.fun's remarkable turnaround validates our prior analysis that aggressive buybacks would eventually overwhelm selling pressure and that signs point to a price recovery—or at least heavy pressure against bears.\nPump’s PUMP fell to as low as $0.002283 in late July, well below the ICO price of $.004 when the token launched on July 14. The company raised $600 million after selling out its ICO in just 12 seconds, and the hype propelled PUMP to above a $6 billion fully diluted value just days later.\nBut the hype didn’t last, the price of PUMP soon came tumbling down. The company turned things around for PUMP holders when it announced token buybacks at the end of July just as the token hit bottom, which it has since carried out daily. The company is taking the daily revenue generated from its launchpad and putting it back into the chart, so far buying $23 million worth of PUMP, according to its own figures.\nAs a result, PUMP is up more than 30% in the last seven days. So what do the charts say now?\nThe token currently trades at $0.0034 and is approaching a critical broken support near the $0.0035-$0.0040 after the weekly surge. In terms of price direction, the last few days generated respectable bullish support after the token bottomed. Prices have already broken past two resistance levels around the $0.003 and $0.032 marks, which is a good sign for day and swing traders.\nThe Relative Strength Index, or RSI, for PUMP sits at 67, approaching but not yet breaching the 70 overbought threshold. For context, RSI measures price momentum on a 0 to 100 scale. Readings above 70 typically signal overextension where profit-taking emerges while below 30 indicates oversold conditions ripe for bounces.\nAt 67, PUMP shows strong buying pressure without triggering automatic-selling algorithms, suggesting room for PUMP’s pump to grow. Traders would very likely interpret this as particularly bullish given the token's 35% weekly gain hasn't pushed the indicator into dangerous territory.\nThe Average Directional Index, or ADX, for PUMP is at 27, which marks a very interesting development. ADX measures trend strength regardless of direction. As a general rule, numbers below 20 indicate no trend, 20-25 shows developing momentum, and above 25 confirms established directional movement until prices register 40 points or more, at which point the trend is considered to be very powerful.\nPUMP's ADX crossing above 25 signals the bearish correction that drove prices down 47% from May highs is either over or not strong enough to maintain the same bearish direction in case bears remain in play.\nThe Exponential Moving Averages, or EMAs, for PUMP are also compelling. EMAs measure the average price of an asset over a set period of time. For PUMP, being such a young token, the 4-hour charts are where to look.\nThe 50-period EMA (the average price of the last week or 50 candlesticks of 4 hours each) currently trades below the 200-period EMA (the average price of the last month, more specifically, 200 candlesticks of 4 hours each), and this is a textbook bearish formation for prices. But the narrowing gap between these averages (considering the prices are finally going up) suggests an impending \"golden cross\" reversal if prices keep heading in the same direction.\nWhen the faster EMA50 crosses above the slower EMA200, it historically marks the beginning of sustained uptrends. Smart money appears to be front-running this technical milestone.\nThe coin is not there yet, but the price action can give bull traders some hope.\nThe Squeeze Momentum Indicator shows “off” status on the 4-hour chart, indicating volatility has already been released from recent compression. This diverges from daily timeframes showing continued squeeze, suggesting different trader cohorts are positioning for the next major move. When multiple timeframes align, explosive price action typically follows.\nThe indicator currently points to a possible bounce from to the current support, which would not be unexpected considering the price spike. A trader might say it’s a good accumulation zone for those expecting the recovery trend to remain in play for a while longer.\nKey Levels:\nImmediate support: $0.0030 (ascending trendline from July lows)\nStrong support: $0.0023 (July capitulation low and psychological floor)\nImmediate resistance: $0.003567 (current test level and prior rejection zone)\nStrong resistance: $0.004113 (50% retracement of entire decline, major breakout target)\nThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.","content_hash":"a5dd10dd00c9f790b2a63c75d12f9764","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6424,"method_rank":0}

On Monday, he introduced the “American Worker Rebate Act of 2025” — a bill that would send rebate checks to working Americans, funded by revenue from President Donald Trump’s tariff policies.\n“Like President Trump proposed, my legislation would allow hard-working Americans to benefit from the wealth that Trump’s tariffs are returning to this country,” Hawley said in a statement.\nTrump himself is open to the idea. Asked at the White House about a possible rebate for Americans from tariff revenue, he told reporters: “We’re thinking about that. We have so much money coming in, we’re thinking about a little rebate.”\nTo be fair, Trump also said the “big thing we want to do is pay down debt” — but added that “a little rebate for people of a certain income level might be very nice.”\nSo, how much money are we talking about and who would qualify?\nHow the rebate would work\nAccording to Hawley’s press release, the bill would provide rebate checks of “at least $600 per adult and dependent child (e.g. $2,400 for a family of four).” If tariff revenue exceeds projections for 2025, the bill could allow for “a larger credit per person.”\nHowever, the benefit phases out for higher earners — joint filers with an adjusted gross income over $150,000 and single filers earning more than $75,000 would receive a reduced amount.\nThe press release also noted that U.S. tariff revenue hit nearly $30 billion in June and several forecasts suggest it could surpass $150 billion for the year.\nWhile a rebate check might sound appealing, critics argue that the money could be better used elsewhere — particularly to reduce America’s growing debt burden.\n“I don’t think [a rebate] would be particularly good policy,” Alex Durante, senior economist at the Tax Foundation, told CNBC. “I would prefer that the revenue was used for deficit reduction rather than just cutting checks to people.”\nOthers warn the checks could add fuel to inflation — an issue still lingering after the pandemic-era stimulus measures.\n“People will go out and spend some of that money and that would further put upward pressure on prices and probably magnify inflationary effects,” said Joseph Rosenberg, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.\nHawley’s rebate checks are still just an idea — but you don’t have to wait for Washington to act to receive a financial boost. Savvy investors have long created their own passive income streams. Here are two simple ways to get started.\nStay in the know. Join 200,000+ readers and get the best of Moneywise sent straight to your inbox every week for free. Subscribe now.\nDividend stocks\nDividends are payments companies make to shareholders from their earnings, typically on a quarterly basis.\nInvesting in dividend-paying companies allows you to generate passive income without selling your shares — and it can be surprisingly satisfying. As John D. Rockefeller, one of the richest Americans in history, once said, “Do you know the only thing that gives me pleasure? It’s to see my dividends coming in.”\nWhile stock prices can rise and fall, companies with a strong track record of paying — and growing — dividends offer investors a steady cash flow. Over time, those increases can compound into a powerful income stream.\nIf you’d rather not pick individual stocks, dividend-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer a simple alternative. These funds hold a basket of dividend-paying companies, providing instant diversification across industries. Many also offer automatic reinvestment, allowing investors to compound their returns over time without lifting a finger.\nThe beauty of ETF investing is its accessibility — anyone, regardless of wealth, can take advantage of it. Even small amounts can grow over time with tools like Acorns, a popular app that automatically invests your spare change.\nSigning up for Acorns takes just minutes: link your cards and Acorns will round up each purchase to the nearest dollar, investing the difference — your spare change — into a diversified portfolio. With Acorns, you can invest in a dividend ETF with as little as $5 — and, if you sign up today, Acorns will add a $20 bonus to help you begin your investment journey.\nReal estate\nReal estate is another popular way to generate recurring income. When you own a rental property and tenants pay rent, you earn a steady monthly cash flow.\nIt’s also a popular hedge against inflation, as property values and rental income tend to rise alongside the cost of living.\nHowever, while real estate investing has clear benefits, being a landlord comes with challenges and barriers to entry. Managing a property involves finding and screening tenants, collecting rent and handling maintenance and repair requests (out of your own pocket) — and that’s assuming you can save enough for a downpayment and get a mortgage to buy the property in the first place.\nThe good news? These days, you don’t need to buy a property outright to reap the benefits of real estate investing. Crowdfunding platforms like Arrived offer an easier way to get exposure to this income-generating asset class.\nThe process is simple: browse a curated selection of homes that have been vetted for their appreciation and income potential. Once you find a property you like, select the number of shares you’d like to purchase and then sit back as you start receiving any positive rental income distributions from your investment.\nAnother option is First National Realty Partners (FNRP), which allows accredited investors to diversify their portfolio through grocery-anchored commercial properties without taking on the responsibilities of being a landlord.\nWith a minimum investment of $50,000, investors can own a share of properties leased by national brands like Whole Foods, Kroger and Walmart, which provide essential goods to their communities. Thanks to Triple Net (NNN) leases, accredited investors are able to invest in these properties without worrying about tenant costs cutting into their potential returns.\nSimply answer a few questions — including how much you would like to invest — to start browsing their full list of available properties.","content_hash":"14bcb7b0aff690889ac893d2d7cdd4c1","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6346,"method_rank":0}

Nearby neighbors like Pakistan (19 percent) and Bangladesh (20 percent) will also face hardships, along with Asian sourcing locales like Laos and Myanmar (40 percent), Vietnam (20 percent) and Cambodia and Indonesia (19 percent), but the adverse effects of Trump’s new duties to India’s burgeoning apparel and textile industry could prove devastating.\nRatings agency Moody’s said as much on Friday, commenting that the duties could stymie the growth of the country’s manufacturing sector.\nMoody’s predicted that should the weight of the full, 50-percent duties be thrust upon the country’s producers, India’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth could slow, contracting by 0.3 percent from its 6.3-percent forecast for fiscal 2025-2026.\n“Beyond 2025, the much wider tariff gap compared with other Asia-Pacific countries would severely curtail India’s ambitions to develop its manufacturing sector…and may even reverse some of the gains made in recent years in attracting related investments,” Moody’s said Friday.\nClothing Manufacturers Association of India (CMAI) president Santosh Katariya was more to the point, saying the imposition of the additional 25-percent tariffs “will deliver a crippling blow to the Indian apparel industry.”\nA 50-percent duty increase will up the cost of India-made apparel by 30 to 35 percent compared with analogous goods from countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh, “making Indian exports uncompetitive in the global market,” Katariya said.\n“Buyers are unlikely to bear such a substantial pricing gap, which could lead to a sharp decline in export orders,” he added, with multiple outlets reporting that he denounced the tariffs as “unjustified, unfair, and arbitrary.”\nAccording to the U.S. Fashion Industry’s 2025 benchmarking study released in July, which relied on input from 25 leading U.S. apparel executives at the nation’s largest brands and retailers, India earned a four-out-of-five score in terms of price competitiveness as a sourcing destination—a distinction that stands to be threatened massively should this reality take hold.\nThe CMAI’s sense of alarm is far from premature, according to recent reports.\nIndian publication NDTV Profit wrote Friday that the biggest American apparel purchasers, from Walmart and Target to Amazon and Gap, have pulled back on orders from India-based suppliers. Sources told the news outlet that exporters have received notice from U.S. brands and retailers demanding a pause on shipments.\nNDTV, which spoke to some of India’s most prominent exporters, reported that the heightened duties could drive down U.S. orders by 40 to 50 percent—a loss of $4 billion to $5 billion.\nThis comes just as India was gaining on apparel production stalwarts in the region. Total apparel exports grew 11.3 percent year-over-year in May, and industry insiders had been targeting double-digit growth again this year. In fiscal year 2025, India’s textile and apparel exports rose by 6.3 percent to reach $36.6 billion. Apparel exports alone saw a 10-percent increase, while textile exports grew by 3.61 percent.\nUSFIA’s study said “it has become more common for respondents this year to allocate more than 10 percent of their apparel sourcing orders to India, Cambodia, and Indonesia, signaling improved production capacity and a larger role for these countries as apparel suppliers for U.S. fashion companies”—while orders from China have, on the whole, decreased.\nIndonesia, India and Cambodia were the three most popular emerging sourcing destinations, the data showed, with more than 60 percent of executives saying they plan to increase sourcing from these countries over the next two years.\nBut that progress could be thwarted by tariffs, with global investment bank UBS estimating that $8 billion worth of exports—clothing and textiles among them—are now at risk.\nThe tariff ramp-up has prompted hand-wringing and contingency planning, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking an audience with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month. The country is also deepening its ties with the United Kingdom, having announced a landmark trade deal earlier this year.\nBut Trump appears undeterred by the shifting of allegiances and deepening of trade ties beyond U.S. borders. The president took to Truth Social on Friday to tout the “huge positive impact” tariffs have had on the American stock market and the hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue that are “pouring into our Country’s coffers.”\nStill, the president’s tariff agenda continues to face legal challenges, with a Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington expected to deliver a ruling on whether Trump overstepped his authority as Commander in Chief by imposing sweeping duties without the approval of Congress. The panel of 11 judges largely expressed skepticism about the president’s leveraging of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) for such a purpose.\n“If a Radical Left Court ruled against us at this late date, in an attempt to bring down or disturb the largest amount of money, wealth creation and influence the U.S.A. has ever seen, it would be impossible to ever recover, or pay back, these massive sums of money and honor,” Trump wrote Friday, clearly mulling the forthcoming decision.\n“There is no way America could recover from such a judicial tragedy, but I know our Court System better than anyone, there is no one in history that has gone through the trials, tribulations and uncertainties such as I, and absolutely terrible, but also amazingly beautiful, things can happen,” he added.","content_hash":"ee079b9176a863153245c108a7e8635b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6090,"method_rank":0}

The fund is run by BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world. Bitcoin currently trades at $115,000. But several Wall Street analyst have made predictions that imply big gains in the remaining months of 2025.\nGeoff Kendrick of Standard Chartered says Bitcoin can hit $200,000 this year. That implies 74% upside from its current price. Kendrick also believes Bitcoin can hit $500,000 in 2028.\nPeter Chung of Presto recently told CNBC Bitcoin can hit $210,000 this year. That implies 82% upside from its current price.\nTom Lee of Fundstrat Advisors thinks Bitcoin can hit $250,000 this year. That implies 117% upside from its current price. Lee also believes Bitcoin can eventually reach $3 million.\nJosh Olszewicz of Canary Capital recently told Schwab Network Bitcoin can hit $300,000 this year. That implies 160% upside from its current price.\nHere's what investors should know about the iShares Bitcoin Trust.\nMore institutional investors are adding Bitcoin to their portfolios\nBoston Consulting Group says institutional investors had about $130 trillion in assets under management (AUM) last year. If even a small percentage of that total were allocated to Bitcoin, its price could increase substantially in the future. And spot Bitcoin ETFs like the iShares Bitcoin Trust have been a powerful catalyst for institutional adoption since winning approval from the SEC in January 2024.\nTo elaborate, spot Bitcoin ETFs let investors add exposure to the cryptocurrency through existing brokerage accounts, which means they avoid the high fees and complexity that comes with trading on cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase. Moreover, SEC approval has legitimized Bitcoin in the eyes of institutional investors.\nRecently filed Forms 13F show an important trend: The number of large asset managers (i.e., those with $100 million in securities) with positions in the two most popular spot Bitcoin ETFs -- the iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund -- more than doubled during the first quarter. Investors have good reason to believe that trend will continue.\nPresident Trump vowed to make the United States the \"crypto capital of the world\" during his campaign last year, and his administration has already brought big changes to the regulatory environment. Cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins is now the SEC chairman, and in March, Trump signed an executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.\nAnother reason institutional investors are likely to become more involved in cryptocurrency is the asset class (now worth a collective $3.8 trillion) has simply become too big to ignore. And Bitcoin is the most logical starting point because it is the largest, most liquid, and best-known cryptocurrency, according to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan.\nMore public and private companies are putting Bitcoin on their balance sheets\nMore than 200 public and private companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, and the number of Bitcoin they hold has increased 85% since Trump won the presidential election in November, according to Bitcoin Treasuries. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is the best known, but Block, Mara Holdings, Semler Scientific, Tesla, and Trump Media also have large positions in the cryptocurrency.\nImportantly, I think more companies will add Bitcoin to their balance sheets in the years ahead for the same reasons discussed in the previous section: Spot Bitcoin ETFs have made adoption easier, cryptocurrency as an asset class is too big to ignore, and the regulatory environment under the Trump administration is much friendlier than under the Biden administration.\nBitcoin has declined sharply on several occasions in the past\nInvestors should bear in mind the forecasts I've discussed are nothing more than educated guesses. There is no guarantee that Bitcoin becomes more valuable in the future. And even if the forecasts are entirely accurate, gains are likely to be interspersed with periods of sharp declines. Bitcoin has fallen more than 20% from a record high three times in the last three years, and similar volatility is probable in the future.\nI think patient investors comfortable with those risks should have a position in Bitcoin, and the iShares Bitcoin Trust -- which bears an expense ratio of 0.25% -- is a relatively cheap and easy way to get that exposure.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

This two-way street allows your brain to influence your gut's functions—like motility, secretion, and immune responses. In turn, your gut influences your brain's emotional and cognitive centers.\nTo kick off their discussion, Chutkan asked Harris to look down at his stomach and consider its position in the body. \"It is in the absolute center of your body. It is literally the engine for everything,\" she said.\n\"I would imagine that if your car engine breaks down, even if the brakes are working, or the carburetor is working or something else, you are not going to get very far because your engine is not working. So the gut really fuels the entire body.\"\nEven if someone eats a healthy, plant-based, and fiber-rich diet — all of which are proven to maintain or improve gut function — if their pH balance is off or the gut lining is damaged, they won't be able to absorb nutrients properly, Chutkan explained.\n\"If the gut is not optimized, those nutrients aren't going to get absorbed and assimilated, and they're not going to get to the brain and the immune system and all the other parts of the body,\" she said.\nAnd that's why, according to Chutkan, the gut is the No. 1 organ you should focus on: \"Everybody in medicine thinks that their field is most important,\" she said. \"The neurosurgeons think it's the brain, but it's the gut.\"\nAn unhealthy gut can impact mood and memory\nThe enteric nervous system lives within the gut and is often called the second brain, Chutkan said. The system has more nerve cells than a spinal cord, and it allows the gut and the brain to communicate with one another.\n\"What are they telling each other?\" Chutkan asked.\n\"The brain is controlling things like gut motility, enzyme secretion and also nutrient absorption that we talked about. And the gut is controlling things like mood and memory. When I say controlling, not completely, but influencing dramatically.\"\nAs far back as the 1800s, when melancholia was the term used for what we now know as depression, people were treating it with diet, she said.\nIn 1859, physician Wooster Beach, suggested that those suffering from melancholia \"peruse interesting books, and converse with cheerful friends; and above all, be located amid pleasant scenery, where he can enjoy a water prospect, a country air, and country diet.\"\nThe bacteria in your gut form what's called the microbiome, and it's responsible for making certain chemicals in your body function correctly, according to Kaiser Permanente. Those chemicals include neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin that affect your mood and sleep, as well as postbiotics that can reduce inflammation and lower stress levels.\nWhen your gut is unhealthy and those chemicals are out of whack, you may experience mood swings, sleep disturbances and brain fog.\nEven conditions like Parkinson's diseases, have connections to gut health. \"We know that it begins in the gut,\" Chutkan said. \"There's a theory called a gut-first theory of Parkinson's.\"\nGerman neuroanatomist, Dr. Heiko Braak noticed abnormal proteins in the brains of people with Parkinson's. Those same proteins were present in the gut linings of those individuals years before they developed the brain disease. Braak's evidence is based on autopsies, but certain research has been done in mice to indicate that injecting those same abnormal proteins into the gut of the animals led to later development of Parkinson's disease.\n\"I think that's one of the clearest connections between the gut and the brain,\" Chutkan said.\n4 ways to improve your gut health\nNow that you know how important it is to keep your gut healthy, you may be wondering how to get your own in better shape.\nDr. Christopher Damman, a gastroenterologist at the Digestive Health Center at the University of Washington Medical Center, shared four ways to improve gut health with CNBC Make It in 2022. Here are his suggestions:\n- Think about this quote: \"Eat food. Mostly plant. Not too much,\" from Michael Pollan's book, 'In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto'\n- Give a Mediterranean diet a try\n- Eat whole foods and only use supplements for the nutrients you may be lacking\n- Remember the 'four phonetic F's': fiber, phenols, ferments and good fats\n\"Shift back to a truly healthy diet which has more balance to it,\" Damman said. \"The balance that we've been missing is whole foods and fiber.\"\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

President Donald Trump signed the tax increase into law last month as part of his signature spending bill.\nThe new tax rates take effect in 2026, but colleges such as Harvard, Yale and Stanford already are citing the tax as one of many reasons for making cuts across their universities. Each will be on the hook to pay hundreds of millions more in taxes, while also navigating reductions in research grants and other threats to funding by the Trump administration.\nA tax on college endowments was introduced during Trump's first administration, collecting 1.4% of wealthy universities' investment earnings. The law signed by Trump last month creates a new tiered system that taxes the richest schools at the highest rates.\nThe new tax will charge an 8% rate at schools with $2 million or more in assets for each enrolled student. Schools with $750,000 to $2 million will be charged 4%, and schools with $500,000 to $750,000 will continue to be charged the 1.4% rate.\nThe tax applies only to private colleges and universities with at least 3,000 students, up from the previous cutoff of 500 students.\n“The tax now will really solely apply to private research universities,” said Steven Bloom, assistant vice president of government relations for the American Council on Education. “It’s going to mean that these schools are going to have to spend more money under the tax, taking it away from what they primarily use their endowment assets for — financial aid.”\nThis small group of wealthy colleges faces a tax increase\nThe law will increase the endowment tax for about a dozen universities, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Association of College and University Business Officers.\nHarvard, Yale, Stanford, Princeton and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are expected to pay the 8% rate next year. The schools facing the 4% rate include Notre Dame, Dartmouth College, Rice University, University of Pennsylvania, Washington University in St. Louis and Vanderbilt University.\nSome universities are on the edge of the law's parameters. Both Duke and Emory, for instance, were shy of the $750,000-per-student endowment threshold based on last fiscal year.\nEndowments are made up of donations to the college, which are invested to maintain the money over time. Colleges often spend about 5% of their investment earnings every year to put toward their budgets. Much of it goes toward scholarships for students, along with costs such as research or endowed faculty positions.\nDespite the colleges' wealth, the tax will drastically impact their budgets, said Phillip Levine, an economist and professor at Wellesley College.\n“They’re looking for savings wherever possible,” Levine said, which could impact financial aid. “One of the most important things they do with their endowment is lower the cost of education for lower- and middle-income students. The institutions paying the highest tax are also the ones charging these students the least amount of money to attend.”\nFor example, at Rice University in Houston, officials anticipate the college will need to pay $6.4 million more in taxes. That equates to more than 100 student financial aid packages, the university said, but Rice officials will explore all other options to avoid cutting that support.\nHow colleges are adjusting to financial pressures\nIn the meantime, some universities are going forward with staff cuts.\nYale University says it will have to pay an estimated $280 million in total endowment taxes, citing the tax in a campus message implementing a hiring freeze. Stanford University announced plans to reduce its operating budget by $140 million this upcoming school year, which included 363 layoffs and an ongoing hiring freeze. The university spent months trying to determine where to reduce its budget, but said it would continue to support undergraduate financial aid and funding for Ph.D. students.\nResearch universities are under increasing financial pressure from reductions in funding from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies.\nNo university knows this pressure better than Harvard, the country's wealthiest college. Its $53 billion endowment puts it at the top of the list for the new tax, but it's also seeing massive portions of research funding under threat in its ongoing battle with the White House.\nThe federal government has frozen $2.6 billion in Harvard's research grants in connection with civil rights investigations focused on antisemitism and Harvard's efforts to promote diversity on campus. But the impact of other administration policies on the university could approach $1 billion annually, Harvard said in a statement.\n“It’s not like Harvard is going to go from one of the best institutions in the world to just a mediocre institution. That’s probably not going to happen,\" Levine said. “But that doesn’t mean it’s not going to be a bad thing — that there won't be pain and that students won't suffer.”\n___\nMumphrey reported from Phoenix.

It's a crucial time for investors. There have been virtually no signs of artificial intelligence (AI) losing its momentum. While it's still early, some of the leading AI stocks have already reported outstanding results that solidify their prolific roles in AI's coming of age.\nThese three AI stocks have delivered impressive earnings results and still trade at compelling valuations, making them no-brainer buys right now.\n1. ASML\nDutch company ASML Holdling(NASDAQ: ASML) builds complex equipment systems that are crucial to manufacturing the high-end chips used in AI. As one might guess in this ongoing AI boom, the company reported stellar earnings results for the second quarter of 2025, surpassing Wall Street estimates in both sales and earnings. Yet, the stock has veered lower and now sits nearly 40% below its all-time high. So what's going on?\nASML's management issued very cautious guidance for next year, citing uncertainty related to tariffs and geopolitical trade tensions (export controls) that could potentially threaten ASML's ability to grow its business. But here's the thing: ASML is the only company in the world that produces extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, which use highly concentrated UV light to etch patterns onto silicon.\nIf the world needs more and increasingly complex chips, that demand should trickle to ASML over time. That could be why analysts still anticipate ASML growing earnings by an average of over 17% annually for the next three to five years, even if management is erring to the side of caution for right now.\nMeanwhile, the stock's price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 25 is a five-year low. In other words, ASML, a mission-critical player in AI infrastructure, is the cheapest it's been since the AI boom started.\n2. Alphabet\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), continues to slump on concerns that AI models will continue to grow and eventually pressure Google's search engine advertising profits. While ChatGPT continues to swell in popularity, Google is doing just fine. Alphabet's Google ad revenue grew by an impressive 12% year over year in the second quarter. For now, at least, it appears that ChatGPT and Google can coexist profitably.\nThe stock isn't even down much, just 8% below its all-time high. Yet, it feels like Wall Street just isn't respecting the tech giant enough; shares trade at a P\/E ratio of only 20, versus an average of nearly 30 over the past decade.\nInvestors who buy here have much to be excited about, and it spans well beyond the search engine business. Alphabet's Google Cloud is rapidly growing due to AI tailwinds, and the company's Waymo subsidiary is establishing itself as the leader in the autonomous driving space, as its ride-hailing service continues to expand into new markets.\nIn all, analysts have Alphabet slotted for nearly 15% annualized earnings growth over the next three to five years, making the stock a bargain at just 20 times earnings today. Alphabet could outperform the market on growth alone moving forward, and could be a genuine game changer for your portfolio if sentiment improves and boosts the stock's valuation closer to its long-term norms.\n3. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\nGlobal foundry behemoth Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM) -- also known as TSMC --is the world's leading producer of semiconductors, and it continues to cement its status as a leading AI company and juggernaut in the broader tech space. Companies like Nvidia turn to TSMC to manufacture their AI chips, which has helped the company expand its market share to an estimated 35.3% in Q1 2025, up from 29.4% just a year ago.\nTSMC's AI momentum helped the company turn in a blowout second quarter. Research by McKinsey & Company estimates that companies will continue to invest in data centers over the coming years, with worldwide estimates projected to exceed $7 trillion over the next five years alone. All those data centers will need vast quantities of chips, which should keep TSM busy for the foreseeable future. Analysts estimate TSMC will grow earnings by an average of over 21% annually for the next three to five years.\nThe caveat with this stock is the geopolitical risk associated with TSMC's location in Taiwan, which has a long-standing dispute with China over the land's sovereignty. While an escalation of those tensions could impact TSMC's business, it's becoming hard to ignore the value here. The stock's P\/E ratio is just 27, a bargain for the growth that investors anticipate from TSM moving forward. This makes Taiwan Semiconductor a strong buy for anyone comfortable with the geopolitical risks.\nShould you buy stock in ASML right now?\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now.

It did not expressly ask the agencies to add more legal protections for investments, but directed them to clarify or potentially revise rules that could help shield the industry from litigation risk.\nAsset managers welcomed the news, saying it was a major step toward modernizing retirement savings.\n\"Expanding access to investments long out of reach will help ensure millions of Americans build stronger, more diversified portfolios designed to increase savings and address the practical considerations of DC plan fiduciaries,\" Jaime Magyera, head of retirement for leading asset manager BlackRock said in a statement, referring to defined-contribution plans like 401(k)s.\nThe move could be a boon for big alternative asset managers such as Blackstone, KKR, and Apollo Global Management by opening the $12-trillion market for all defined-contribution plans, of which 401(k)s are the most popular, to their investments. Some of those firms have already struck partnerships with asset managers who run those plans. A Blackstone spokesman said the firm welcomed the decision.\nBlackRock, which lobbied the Trump administration to expand asset options, plans to launch its own retirement fund that includes private equity and private credit assets next year.\nProponents have argued that younger savers can benefit from potentially higher returns on riskier investments in funds that get more conservative as they approach retirement.\n\"On the asset manager side, it's a $12-trillion retirement market that they have previously not had access to. For them, there's certainly a lot of opportunity,\" said Morningstar analyst Jason Kephart.\n\"From the individual investor standpoint, though, that's where it's less clear after all the additional fees, the additional complexity, and less transparency,\" Kephart added.\nThe new investment options carry lower disclosure requirements and are generally less easy to sell quickly for cash than the publicly traded stocks and bonds that most retirement funds rely on. Investing in them also tends to carry higher fees.\nIn defined contribution plans, employees make contributions to their own retirement account, frequently with a matching contribution from their employer. The invested funds belong to the employee, but unlike a defined benefit pension plan, there is no guaranteed regular payout upon retirement.\nRISKS AND REWARDS\nMany private equity firms are hungry for the new source of cash that retail investors could offer after three years in which high interest rates shook their time-honored model of buying companies and selling them at a profit.\nWhatever results may come from Trump's order, it likely will not happen overnight, private equity executives say. Plaintiffs' lawyers are already preparing for lawsuits that could be filed by investors who do not understand the complexity of the new forms of investments.\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink acknowledged in a recent call with analysts that the change posed challenges for asset managers.\n\"The reality is, though, there is a lot of litigation risk. There's a lot of issues related to the defined contribution business,\" Fink said. \"And this is why the analytics and data are going to be so imperative way beyond just the inclusion.\"\nCFO Martin Small said the industry may seek litigation reform before it can expand into the market.\nThe Department of Labor issued guidance during Trump's previous presidency on how such plans could invest in private equity funds within certain limits, but few took advantage, fearing litigation.\nEasing access to cryptocurrencies to be included in 401(k)s would be Trump's latest embrace of digital assets, and could be a potential boon for the sector, including asset managers that operate crypto exchange-traded funds, such as BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\"Bitcoin has moved beyond its early days as a merely speculative asset and is slowly entering into many investors’ long-term investment strategy,\" said Gerry O'Shea, head of global market insights at Hashdex Asset Management. \"This EO will help accelerate this trend.\"\nDemocratic Senator Elizabeth Warren wrote in June to the CEO of annuity provider Empower Retirement, which oversees $1.8 trillion in assets for more than 19 million investors, asking how retirement savings placed in private investments could be safeguarded \"given the sector's weak investor protections, its lack of transparency, expensive management fees, and unsubstantiated claims of high returns.\"\n(Reporting by Jeff Mason, Isla Binnie and Nandita Bose; additional reporting by Rishabh Jaiswal, Hannah Lang and Doina Chiacu; Editing by Dawn Kopecki, Rod Nickel, Diane Craft and Nia Williams)","content_hash":"69e4d886c4d67aa0efbc731e142f1228","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5730,"method_rank":0}

Specifically, the market’s volatility has been amplified by President Trump’s unpredictable tariff threats, as well as a surge in global geopolitical conflicts.\nA recent armed conflict between Israel and Iran, for instance, introduced the significant risk of a major disruption to the world’s physical crude oil supply, adding further stress to an already tense market. In this article, Kar Yong, a financial market analyst at Octa broker, shares his expert opinion on the current stake in the oil market and provides a forward-looking perspective on future trends.\nBrent сrude oil price plunged by almost 4.0% on Wednesday after President Trump said that there was ‘great progress’ in talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. This created uncertainty about whether the U.S. would follow through with its threat of new sanctions against Russia, a major global oil producer. ‘Any potential deal that eases sanctions would increase the availability of Russian crude in the market and after Trump’s remarks, the market is focusing on the possibility of some kind of a breakthrough in the U.S.–Russia talks on Ukraine and that is why we see crude oil prices lose some ground’, says Kar Yong.\nEarlier in the day, prices had seen some support after Trump imposed a new 25% tariff on India due to the country’s purchases of Russian oil, forcing traders to price in the possibility that India may be forced to look for alternative sources of crude oil supply. However, the new tariff wouldn’t take effect until August 28, leaving enough time for diplomatic maneuvering and thus further contributing to the overall market uncertainty.\n‘To be honest, the current situation is a complete mess’, argues Kar Yong. ‘On the one hand, traders need to react to a series of political and geopolitical developments, which are very difficult if not impossible to predict. On the other hand, the market is influenced by conflicting signals on supply and demand as OPEC plans to increase supply. On the surface, this measure is supposed to respond to strong demand, but in reality, it aims to regain market share from non-OPEC producers, particularly U.S. shale’.\nIndeed, grasping investors’ sentiment and keeping a pulse on the market is very difficult when a trader needs to constantly monitor numerous dynamic factors, which are continuously shifting and changing, sometimes quite rapidly. Trump’s aggressive trade policy, with its ever-evolving deadlines and new tariff threats, complicates traders’ decision-making and creates a climate of significant market uncertainty. Focusing on the fundamental variable of the market is perhaps the only way to avoid being lost in the headlines. As Kay Yong says, ‘Fortunately, we can always study the fundamentals. The good old supply and demand figures provide some much-needed clarity amidst the geopolitical noise. Personally, I think that long-term fundamentals are turning bullish and more factors favour a long, bullish position’.\nBearish Factors\nOPEC+ recently agreed to a significant production increase for September, adding 547,000 barrels per day.[1]\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) has noted that production from non-OPEC+ countries, particularly the United States, Brazil, and Guyana, is expected to be more than sufficient to meet global demand growth in the coming years.[2]\nGlobal recession risks. For example, Goldman Sachs’ economists believe that the U.S. economy is growing at a ‘below-potential pace’ and has increased the chance of a recession.[3]\nBullish Factors\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, has justified its upcoming supply increase by citing a strong global demand and low oil inventories.[4]\nThe total volume of commercial refined oil products in storage at five major ports (Amsterdam, Antwerp, Fujairah, Rotterdam, and Singapore) is some 3.4 million barrels (MMbbl) below last year’s level.[5]\nU.S. crude inventories fell by 3 MMbbl in the week ended 1 August, a larger draw than analysts predicted.[6]\nU.S. crude oil production is likely to slow as the current WTI price is very close to break-even for many producers, which disincentivises new drilling and investment.[7]\nSaudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, hiked its September crude oil prices for Asian buyers for the second consecutive month.[8]\nGeopolitical tensions and supply risks—particularly, secondary sanctions on Russia’s trading partners and Middle East instability—could potentially limit the supply of new crude oil.\nPotential Scenarios\nTechnically, Brent crude oil looks weak. It has been trading within a descending parallel channel since September 2023. Recently, it has fallen below a key support level, with technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) signalling negative momentum.\n‘Although short-term technicals remain bearish with clear targets of 65.10, 63.30, and 60.70, the long-term fundamentals are slowly turning bullish.

There aren't a lot of successful stocks trading for less than $5 a share. Less than 4% of U.S. exchange-traded equities are currently trading and wading in that pool. With lower prices come higher risks, but also potential upside if an out-of-favor company has some bullish catalysts in the works.\nAMC Entertainment(NYSE: AMC) and Grab Holdings(NASDAQ: GRAB) are two names that I think can deliver market-beating returns in the next couple of years. Let's take a closer look at these two stocks with market caps above $1 billion and price points below $5 that I think are worth buying in August.\n1. AMC Entertainment\nLike the crimson-colored walls, curtains, and carpeting at your local multiplex, AMC investors have been seeing red in recent years. The country's largest movie theater chain has plunged more than 99% from its frenzied peak four summers ago. It doesn't mean that the value of the company is less than 1% of what it was in 2021. AMC has diluted its shareholders with a deluge of new shares and a head-shaking preferred equity unit conversion.\nThis isn't a very favorable backdrop for a stock pitch, but I'm a sucker for theatrical narrative arcs and redemption stories. There's no point in dwelling on the past. Let's talk about the future. Movie theater stocks have had to deal with pandemic shutdowns in 2020, a screenwriter strike in 2023, and the streaming video revolution. Audience levels are substantially lower than they were before the COVID-19 crisis, and -- to be fair -- they were already trending lower for several years before that. It doesn't mean that it's curtains for AMC. The industry is finding ways to bounce back.\nAMC reports its second-quarter results next week, shortly after Monday's market close. It was a great quarter for movie studios and the exhibitors that they serve. After a 12% year-over-year decline in domestic ticket sales for the industry in the first quarter, receipts soared 37% in the second quarter according to Box Office Mojo. Rival Cinemark was the first to report this earnings season last week. The country's third-largest operator saw its revenue rise just 28%, but it was weighed down by its international operations. Its U.S. revenue rose 33%. It's also worth noting that price per ticket and concession revenue per patron inched higher. Cinemark's operating profit and net income more than doubled. All of this bodes well heading into AMC's marquee moment.\nAnalysts see AMC posting a small loss on a 30% increase in revenue. Earlier this week I wrote about how AMC is in a good place to surprise investors with a quarterly profit on Monday afternoon. Who cares if audience counts are below pre-pandemic levels? The folks who are pulling up to the ticket takers are willing to spend about 30% more than they were in 2019 for a better experience that now includes reserved seating and premium formats. They're also spending more on concessions on ramped-up offerings and the widespread arrival of mobile ordering making the experience more convenient.\nAMC isn't Cinemark. It's not going to pay a dividend anytime soon the way that Cinemark started earlier this year. AMC's five-year chart shows a 94% decline compared to Cinemark more than doubling. However, just as Cinemark earned the market's respect when it turned profitable in 2023, next week -- and this month -- could be AMC's close-up moment.\n2. Grab Holdings\nGrab may not be a household name to you, but it's a different story in Southeast Asia. The regional super-app got its start in 2012 when a pair of Harvard MBA students launched a ride-hailing business in Malaysia. In the next two years it would roll it out to seven other countries in the region. Over time it would go on to add restaurant and grocery delivery, a digital payment platform, and offer financial services including a rapidly growing business providing business loans.\nToday it serves 46.2 million monthly transacting users, a 13% increase over the past year. Revenue is growing even faster as engagement levels and its monetization skills improve. Revenue has been accelerating in the last three quarters, including a 23% year-over-year jump on the top line in last week's financial update. The bottom line is growing even faster.\nGrab had the misfortune of hitting the market just as the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) craze was at a frenzied peak in 2021. Initially valued at $40 billion -- a new record for a SPAC -- it trades for less than half of that today. It doesn't seem right. Revenue has more than quadrupled. It was posting 10-figure annual losses when it hit the market, and now it's profitable. Its dominance in the region has attracted a lot of global giants with substantial stakes in the company. It's a good time to grab some Grab.\nShould you invest $1,000 in AMC Entertainment right now?\nBefore you buy stock in AMC Entertainment, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and AMC Entertainment wasn’t one of them.

After taking a backseat to the jobs report earlier this year, inflation data will take center stage next week as investors try to discern whether the Federal Reserve will cut in September. The latest consumer price index is set to release Tuesday, and the producer price index is due out Thursday. Other economic data such as retail sales is also on deck. A quarter-point cut is widely anticipated at next month's Fed meeting, fed funds futures pricing shows. But, any suggestion that inflation is getting away from the central bank's 2% target, just as the labor market shows significant weakening, will add to stagflation fears, and thwart that outlook. \"The most important thing is the CPI data,\" said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. He added, \"That will definitely dictate monetary policy.\" Hotter inflation readings could also hobble a stock market that's near all-time highs. In recent weeks, investors have been scanning nervously for any catalysts that could knock the S & P 500 . The broad market index has scaled a barrage of scary tariff headlines and conflicts abroad to recoup its April losses and top 6,400 at the end of last month. .SPX YTD mountain S & P 500 in 2025 But more strategists and technicians are worried a pullback is around the corner, of 5% or worse, citing high valuations, flagging momentum and rising concentration risk. This week, DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas pointed out the S & P 500 is trading at a ratio of around 22 , based on different forward price-to-earnings multiples, that reflect \"peak confidence.\" There's also the seasonal weakness, given that August is a historically poor month for equities . On average, the S & P 500 loses 0.3% in August , according to data going back to 1990, from Wolfe Research. This week marked the one-year anniversary of the global market sell-off following the unwind of the yen carry trade. \"Weird things tend to happen in August,\" Woods said. \"And I am just concerned that there's a headline that could spook this market — this market has been on a tremendous run — and cause us to correct if we were to pull back.\" On Friday, however, the major averages each closed out a winning week. The S & P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rallied 2.4% and 3.9%, respectively, in the period. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was higher by 1.4%. Growing politicization of Fed, data At least some of the early estimates suggest the risk to inflation is to the upside. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, are projected to land at a 3% handle on a year-over-year basis, according to FactSet consensus estimates. If that comes to pass or the metric comes in hotter than expected, that could muddy the inflation outlook. CPI and PPI also comes just one week ahead of the Fed's Jackson Hole meeting in Wyoming, on Aug. 21-23, which will likely shape expectations for the September meeting, when the central bank is projected to cut for the first time since December. But the next batch of inflation reports that come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics could bring with it new questions around the trustworthiness of government data going forward, after President Donald Trump last week fired the BLS commissioner following the issuance of a weak jobs report . There's more. On Thursday, Trump said he's nominated Council of Economic Advisors chair Stephen Miran to a key seat on the Fed, to replace Adriana Kugler, who resigned last week . Miran is a potentially dovish pick who could act in opposition to Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump has repeatedly criticized for not lowering interest rates, and raises questions of the future for Fed independence. \"If the perception of the Fed is that it is becoming politicized, that could really upset markets, both the bond market and the equity markets,\" said Nanette Abuhoff Jacobson, global investment strategist at Hartford Funds. Tariffs and talks One item that may be a positive for markets is a news report saying Trump and Russia President Vladimir Putin could meet as soon as next week , with the U.S. expected to step up pressure on Moscow to end the conflict in Ukraine . Other potential catalysts include the Aug. 12 trade deadline for China, after which steep tariffs are expected to go into effect. Many expect that the date will be postponed. Earnings season slows to a trickle next week, before Nvidia draws attention once more at the end of the month. More than anything, investors expect there are still potential for some fireworks for an unsettled market before the summer comes to a close. \"I think that we are probably going to be more in a digestion phase than anything else,\" Freedom Capital Markets' Woods said.

Hawkish comments from ECB Governing Council member Holzmann on Wednesday boosted EUR\/USD to a 1-week high, undercutting the dollar, as he stated there is no need for the ECB to cut interest rates further.\nThe dollar was also under pressure from increased expectations for a Fed rate cut after the recent weaker-than-expected US payroll and PMI reports. Losses in the dollar accelerated Wednesday on dovish comments from Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and Fed Governor Lisa Cook, who signaled their support for interest rate cuts.\nAlso, questions about the Fed’s credibility continue to weigh on the dollar after Fed Governor Adriana Kugler resigned last Friday, which could prompt President Trump to nominate a new governor who is more dovish and could undermine Fed Chair Powell’s influence.\nMinneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said, “The economy is slowing and in the near term it may become appropriate to start adjusting the federal funds rate lower.”\nFed Governor Lisa Cook said last Friday’s US July jobs report is “concerning” and that “the revisions are somewhat typical of turning points” in the US economy.\nIn recent tariff news, President Trump announced today that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India’s purchases of Russian oil. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports would be announced “within the next week or so.” Last Thursday, President Trump raised tariffs on some Canadian goods to 35% from 25% and announced a 10% global minimum, along with tariffs of 15% or higher for countries with trade surpluses with the US, effective after midnight on August 7. According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 95% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and 68% at the following meeting on October 28-29.\nEUR\/USD (^EURUSD) Wednesday rose by +0.75% to a 1-week high. The euro rallied Wednesday on hawkish comments from ECB Governing Council member Holzmann, who said he sees no reason for the ECB to cut interest rates again. Gains in the euro accelerated Wednesday after the dollar tumbled on dovish comments from Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and Fed Governor Lisa Cook, who signaled their support for interest rate cuts.\nOn the bearish side for the euro was Wednesday’s Eurozone economic news that showed German June factory orders unexpectedly posted their biggest decline in 5 months. Also, the euro is struggling due to concerns that President Trump’s tariff policies will curb economic growth in the Eurozone.\nEurozone June retail sales rose +0.3% m\/m, right on expectations.\nGerman June factory orders unexpectedly fell -1.0% m\/m, weaker than expectations of a +1.1% m\/m increase and the biggest decline in 5 months.\nECB Governing Council member Holzmann said, “In my view, there is no longer any reason for the ECB to lower interest rates further and we should wait and see what economic developments arise, particularly outside Europe, and how we respond to them.”\nSwaps are pricing in a 12% chance of a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\nUSD\/JPY (^USDJPY) Wednesday fell by -0.37%. The yen strengthened against the dollar Wednesday after Japan’s nominal wages in June accelerated from May, a hawkish factor for BOJ policy. Higher T-note yields on Wednesday limited gains in the yen. Also, the yen has negative carryover from Tuesday when the minutes of the June 16-17 BOJ meeting showed policymakers were concerned about ending its QE program too quickly.\nJapan’s June labor cash earnings rose +2.5% y\/y from +1.4% y\/y in May, although weaker than expectations of +3.1% y\/y.\nDecember gold (GCZ25) on Wednesday closed down -1.30 (-0.04%), and September silver (SIU25) closed up +0.079 (+0.21%). Precious metals settled mixed on Wednesday. The decline in the dollar index to a 1-week low on Wednesday was bullish for metals. Also, dovish Fed comments on Wednesday from Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and Fed Governor Cook were bullish for precious metals as they signaled their support for interest rate cuts. Demand for precious metals as a store of value has increased after recent weaker-than-expected US economic news may prompt the Fed to cut interest rates as soon as next month. The chance of a Fed interest rate cut at the September FOMC meeting has risen to 95% on Wednesday from 40% last Friday.\nGains in precious metals prices were limited, and gold turned lower Wednesday on hawkish comments from ECB Governing Council member Holzmann, who said there is no longer any reason for the ECB to lower interest rates further. Also, strength in stocks and higher T-note yields on Wednesday weighed on precious metals.\nPrecious metals still have safe-haven support on concerns that President Trump’s tariff policies will weigh on global economic growth prospects. Finally, precious metals continue to receive safe-haven support from geopolitical risks, including the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Most people chase it with lottery tickets or other unproductive strategies, only to learn that luck is fickle and discipline is what's actually valuable. A far more grounded route is to pick a high-conviction growth asset, invest steadily, and let compounding over time do the work.\nIn that vein, Solana(CRYPTO: SOL) has become a darling of developers and financial institutions alike thanks to lightning-fast transactions at industrial-scale throughput, and its nearly nonexistent fees. Its price could soar if it continues to successfully compete in a handful of different and emerging nichrs. But could it ever climb fast enough to turn an investor's disciplined contributions into $1 million by 2030?\nThe numbers suggest there's a long shot here\nSolana currently trades at about $162 per coin. Therefore, hitting a portfolio value of $1 million in five years demands either a huge starting stake, or a face-melting run for the asset's price.\nSo let's follow the second option there, and assume an aggressive but not impossible eightfold move to roughly $1,344 per coin by mid-2030. Under that scenario, an investor dollar-cost averaging (DCAing) a sum of $2,100 per month for each and every of the next 60 months would accumulate enough of the coin that, when multiplied by the future price, lands just over the $1 million target.\nBut those figures are prohibitively expensive for most investors; $2,100 a month is $126,000 in out-of-pocket costs, all of which would be allocated to a cryptocurrency that's inherently volatile, and far riskier than most other investments.\nThat makes the millionaire-maker prospects of Solana a very tall order during the next five years, and it's especially fraught, given that history rarely indulges straight-line forecasts like the one we've made here.\nWhat would need to go right for growth of this scale to happen?\nLet's turn to the question of how Solana might well grow as much as it needs to during the next five years, despite it probably being a long shot.\nBoston Consulting Group (BCG) suggests the potential tokenized market could become as large as $16 trillion by 2030, up from just $13 billion today. If Solana captures even 5% of that value, demand for its native token would rocket. There is some early evidence to suggest that Solana is indeed capturing these inflows quite aggressively, given that it now has $480 million in tokenized assets on its chain, up from just $172 million at the start of this year.\nNext comes regulated demand, which would need to increase sharply -- and it is. Asset issuers have filed Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications pending with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and they are likely to hear back from regulators by the end of the year. If regulators say that the ETFs can be issued, and they probably will, there could be huge inflows on the way. And that could power Solana's price to rise well beyond its last bull-market peak.\nFinally, Solana needs to keep matching its capabilities to new drivers of demand for the coin.\nDecentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) is a live example of this process in action. Several DePIN providers have found success on the network already. Every packet sent over the chain burns a dusting of Solana as fee revenue, thereby creating constant buying pressure. AI agent frameworks building on the chain hope to do the same, and they could power big returns as well.\nThe case for patience\nOf course, any of these dominoes could refuse to fall. Furthermore, investors must keep a cold eye on risk.\nSolana is still in the process of proving its stability to institutional investors, whose standards are far higher than what might be obvious. Additionally, the chain competes with equally hungry rivals like Ethereum. Its path toward much higher prices is not going to be free of bumps, and it might never get there.\nRemember that even if everything goes perfectly, the five-year millionaire plan still demands a commitment of more than $2,000 each month, which is out of reach for many households. This is probably not a millionaire-maker coin anymore, even if it's technically possible for it to happen.\nTherefore, a more realistic approach is to lower the monthly allocation, extend the schedule to a 10-to-15-year horizon, and treat any upside shock as a welcome bonus rather than a necessity.\nThe longer you hold, the less accuracy you need in short-term predictions, which are notoriously difficult to land accurately.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

Markets: Stocks on Friday are finishing the week out strong. The technology sector and in particular Apple are big reasons why — more on Apple shortly — but there's decent strength across the board with most of the 11 sector indexes in positive territory except for the industrials, real estate, and utilities. Rally mode: Apple's reversal of fortunes continued Friday as shares climbed more than 4% — bringing its week-to-date advance to roughly 13%, on pace for its third-best weekly performance in the past decade, according to FactSet data. The only other better weeks in that time frame came in late July 2020, fueled in part by a blowout earnings report amid a pandemic-fueled surge in electronics purchases, and in early May 2018, which also coincided with strong quarterly results and guidance . With this week's surge, Apple shares have crossed over their 200-day moving average, a positive technical milestone, and are trading at their highest levels since \"Liberation Day\" on April 2. The driver of this week's resurgence, of course, is Apple returning to the good graces of President Donald Trump with its $100 billion additional investment commitment to U.S. manufacturing. Trump's tariff policies — and, more specifically, his public-pressure campaign on Apple to build iPhones in the U.S. — have been a major overhang on Apple shares this year. Couple that with dual threats to its lucrative services business and its apparent aimlessness on artificial intelligence, and that's how you get Apple shares entering this week down 19% year to date, which put the stock in the bottom 15% of all companies in the S & P 500 during that stretch. The market reaction over the past three days is clearly signaling that investors are feeling better about the tariff threat and, at least for now , are willing to put aside their other concerns. We're certainly feeling better about the stock now, too, after last week's strong earnings report. During Trump's first term, CEO Tim Cook earned plaudits for his ability to maintain a good relationship with the president and minimize Apple's exposure to that batch of tariffs. Up until a few days ago, it didn't seem to be working this time around. But once again, Cook showed why betting against him has been a losing proposition for investors. Big deal: The thawing IPO market may get one of its biggest — and unique — deals of all time later this year. On Friday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump administration is planning to sell stock in government-controlled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. According to the report, at least some people in the administration are discussing values for the companies in the ballpark of $500 billion or more — in that range, it could be a historically large stock offering depending on how many shares are sold. The biggest initial public offering in U.S. stock market history is Alibaba in 2014, which saw the Chinese e-commerce and cloud giant raise nearly $22 billion, according to Renaissance Capital data . The only deal larger was Saudi Aramco's 2019 listing on the Tadawul in Riyadh. There's a Club-stock connection to the chatter: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon and Wells Fargo chief Charlie Scharf have gone to Washington to discuss the administration's plans for Freddie and Fannie with Trump, according to the report. So, too, have the leaders of Morgan Stanley , JPMorgan Chase , Citigroup and Bank of America , the report said. This is a complicated deal given the nature of Fannie and Freddie, which the government has controlled since 2008, and plenty of details could change from here. Still, a deal of this magnitude and structure is certainly one to watch. Goldman and Wells Fargo have been beneficiaries of the recent uptick in dealmaking and IPOs, in particular. In early June, we discussed the heating up of the IPO market, and it's only gotten hotter since then. There were 26 IPOs in July, and already there have been seven in in the early days of August, according to Renaissance Capital . For the year, we've seen 130 IPOs already versus just 150 in all of 2024, Renaissance's data shows. Next week: It's a lighter week of earnings with only five companies in the S & P 500, and one company in the portfolio scheduled to report: Cisco after the closing bell on Wednesday. Some other notable earnings releases to look out for are CoreWeave , Cava , Brinker , Deere , Tapestry , and Applied Materials . It will be heavy on the data side with the July consumer price index and producer price index due out, along with the government's retail sales report. In other events, on Thursday at noon ET, we'll have our August Monthly Meeting. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

According to FactSet, if that percentage holds, it will represent the highest percentage of quarterly earnings beats since the third quarter of 20221.\nEarnings will continue rolling in over the coming weeks, with tech titan Nvidia set to report at the end of August.\nUntil then, here are some key insights from the last results:\nAMD & Super Micro: Trump's trade policy is hitting the semiconductor sector\nAMD beat on revenue, but missed earnings estimates slightly. The chipmaker posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.48, a hair below the expected $0.49 a share.\nLisa Su, AMD's CEO, said the firm's AI revenue declined on a year-over-year basis largely due to US export restrictions, which have prevented AMD from selling its MI308 AI chip to China.\nShares were down as much as 8% on Wednesday.\nSuper Micro, meanwhile, missed slightly on both earnings and revenue. The chipmaker said revenue came in at $5.76 billion, below the expected $5.89 billion, and earnings per share came in at $0.41, below the $0.44 Wall Street expected.\nThe miss was partly fueled by the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs, Charles Liang, the CEO, said on a call with analysts on Tuesday.\nShares of the chipmaker were down 17% after the results.\nWhat it means: AI chip manufacturers are caught in the crossfire of the trade war. That's expected to remain a key concern as the US irons out the details of its trade relationship with China.\nThe US and China have until August 12 to strike a trade deal before higher tariffs kick in, another headwind that could rattle the market and semiconductor stocks in particular.\n\"Industry-wide tariff impact is only now being felt and could result in headwinds for the entire semiconductor industry,\" Gadjo Sevilla, a senior analyst at EMARKETER, wrote in a note.\nMcDonald's: US consumers are in a precarious position\nWhat happened: McDonald's beat on earnings and revenue expectations for the quarter, but voiced concerns about the health of lower-income consumers and the ability of Americans to keep spending.\nThe fast food franchise said revenue came in at $6.84 billion for the quarter, above the $6.7 billion analysts expected. Earnings per share came in at an adjusted $3.19, above estimates of $3.15.\n\"Re-engaging the low-income consumer is critical,\" Chris Kempczinski, the CEO, said on the company's earnings call, adding that low-income Americans were more likely to visit the chain than other income groups. \"This bifurcated consumer base is why we remain cautious about the overall near-term health of the US consumer.\"\nWhat it means: Consumer spending is in focus for retail giants and for Wall Street, given the cumulative effects of inflation in recent years and Trump's tariffs.\nEconomists say tariffs could stoke inflation, as companies can pass along the cost of import duties to consumers. For now, though spending remains fairly strong, even as concerns have risen recently around a pullback among both high and low-income households.\nPalantir: Hype for AI still strong\nWhat happened: Palantir blew past estimates for second quarter earnings. The data software firm revealed that its revenue surpassed $1 billion for the first time, reflecting a 55% year-over-year increase.\nShares popped as much as 10% after its results, bringing the stock up 130% year-to-date.\nWhat it means: The AI trade is alive and well, with firms still benefitting from the hype for artificial intelligence.\nWedbush Securities called Palantir the \"Messi of AI\" in a note to clients shortly after the firm reported earnings. In a separate note, analysts lifted their price target for the stock to $200 a share, implying 15% upside from current levels.\n\"Palantir remains one of our top tech names to own in 2025 and this deal represents another opportunity for PLTR to capitalize on while continuing to generate unprecedented traction for its entire portfolio across the federal and commercial landscapes,\" analysts said.\nMicrosoft and Meta: Mega-cap tech still dominates\nWhat happened: Microsoft and Meta both beat on earnings last week.\nMicrosoft took in $76.4 billion in revenue and $3.65 in earnings per share, above estimates of $73.8 billion and $3.37 a share. The company also joined the $4 trillion club for the first time as its stock surged following its earnings report, with shares up 26% year-to-date.\nMeta, meanwhile, took in $47.5 billion in revenue and $7.14 in earnings per share, above estimates of $44.83 billion and $5.89 a share. The stock is up 27% year-to-date.\nWhat it means: Mega-cap tech is still dominating the market.\nTech was best-performing area of the S&P 500 in July, with the sector up 5% in the month. The Nasdaq hit 14 record highs in July, causing Deutsche Bank to declare that \"tech-ceptionalism\" has resumed for the market.\nThe strong outperformance of large-cap stocks accelerated, further widening the gap between small-cap peers.\n\"We continue to favor US large cap Tech over its small cap counterpart, as it takes a highly speculative market (i.e. 2021) or Big Tech to fall out of favor (i.e. 2022, Q4 2024) for the latter to outperform,\" Nicholas Colas, the co-founder of the research firm DataTrek, wrote in a note.","content_hash":"d3a2c16746673265206d2a032d8c6a79","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5581,"method_rank":0}

Tech stocks are the muscle behind U.S. markets these days, accounting for 34% of the makeup of the entire S&P 500. They are also outperformers, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is outperforming both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average so far this year.\nThe lesson here? You need to have tech stocks in your portfolio if you want to outperform the market. Tech stocks are immensely popular these days as companies are racing to train large language models (LLMs) to customize their platforms with generative artificial intelligence (AI) offerings in order to roll out new services and customer experiences before their competitors.\nThe race to build AI products is far from over, and buying stocks that will be best positioned to capitalize on the trend is a smart way to invest right now. If you're looking for the best tech stocks for August, I'm recommending Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM).\nNvidia\nThe unquestioned leader in tech stocks right now is chipmaker Nvidia. As the creator of the most advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) that top companies use to power their AI platforms, Nvidia has grown to be the most valuable publicly traded company in the world and was the first to crack the $4 trillion milestone.\nNvidia's GPUs can be combined with other chips into clusters that can work faster and more powerfully, which is why they are so prized by companies building AI applications. Jon Peddie Research estimates that Nvidia has a staggering 92% of the GPU market.\nThe company will report earnings for its second quarter of fiscal 2026 on Aug. 27, and analysts are expecting another blowout quarter. Of 66 analysts who cover Nvidia on Yahoo! Finance, 59 of them rank Nvidia as a buy or strong buy.\nAlphabet\nAlphabet already reported its quarterly earnings, and Wall Street was impressed. Revenue in Q2 was up 14% to 96.4 billion, while net income was up 19% to $28.19 billion. Alphabet's earnings per share also jumped to $2.31, a 22% gain from a year ago.\nThe report was a welcome return to form for Alphabet, which has struggled so far in 2025 amid concerns that platforms such as ChatGPT would eat into the company's massive Google search business. There are also legal issues, as Alphabet is battling with the Justice Department over allegations that it has an illegal monopoly, and there are concerns that the company could be split up.\nBut Alphabet has been able to put those concerns to rest, at least for now. Revenue from Google Cloud was particularly strong in the second quarter, rising 32% to $13.6 billion, as the company's Google AI platform is incorporated into its Chrome browser and Google search engine. Alphabet also saw strong growth in Google Search (revenue was up 11.7%) and Google Advertising (up 10.4%).\nAlphabet's stock also trades at a low 20.6 price-to-earnings ratio --incredibly attractive for a tech stock that continues to show strong growth.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\nThis one goes hand-in-hand with Nvidia, really. If you believe in the growth story powering Nvidia's GPUs, then Taiwan Semiconductor, also known as TSMC, has the same kind of tailwinds. TSMC is a fabricator of GPUs -- it doesn't design them, but it is one of the biggest companies in the world that actually makes them for Nvidia and others.\nIt's a rapidly growing field, as Mordor Intelligence says the GPU market will be $82.7 billion this year and explode to $352.5 billion by 2030. TSMC has an estimated 62% market share of the global foundry market, so it's going to benefit no matter which company has the lead in the GPU race over the next decade. Nvidia's major competitor, Advanced Micro Devices, is also a TSMC customer.\nTSMC is also growing its footprint in the U.S. rapidly, with plans to invest $165 billion in facilities in Arizona that should shield it from any tariff concerns in the future.\nTSMC's Q2 earnings included revenue of $30.07 billion, up 44.4% from a year ago. The company is projecting Q3 revenue even higher, to be between $31.8 billion and $33 billion.\nThe bottom line\nEach of these companies is at the forefront of the explosive growth in AI, which is the dominant trend driving the stock market today. All of them would be excellent buys in August to capitalize on the market-driving power of tech stocks.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\nNvidia:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009,you’d have $462,306!*\nApple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $38,522!*\nNetflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $619,036!*\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, available when you joinStock Advisor, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\nPatrick Sanders has positions in Nvidia.

The plan envisions the disarming of Hamas, which has run the enclave since 2007, the return of all the hostages, and the demilitarization of the entire Gaza Strip and Israeli control of it.\nIt also calls for the eventual establishment of an as-yet-unnamed Arab authority in the strip.\nRead more from NBC News:\nNBC News reported earlier that commercial satellite images showed the Israeli military building up troops and equipment near the border with Gaza that would support a possible new ground invasion of the Hamas-run Palestinian enclave.\nThe Israeli move marks another escalation of the conflict, which began after the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw around 250 taken hostage. Israel believes about 20 of the 50 hostages remaining in Gaza are still alive.\nThe Israel's air and ground offensive since then has killed more than 61,000 people in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to local health officials.\nIsrael has also upended the aid distribution system in the enclave, and hunger has surged. Last week, the world's leading body on hunger, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, sounded the alarm that the \"worst-case scenario of famine\" was now unfolding in Gaza under Israel's deadly military offensive and crippling aid restrictions.\nReactions to the plan\nEchoing President Donald Trump's comments on Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee told CBS News before the Gaza City announcement that the Israeli government should make its own decisions about taking control of the Gaza Strip, saying, \"it's not our job to tell them what they should or should not do.\"\nThe United States remains the biggest supplier of arms to Israel, with American spending on Israel's military operations reaching more than $17.9 billion from Oct. 7 last year to Sept. 30, according to Brown University's Costs of War Project.\nHostage families, many of whom worry a new offensive will endanger the remaining living hostages in Gaza, protested the government overnight, with police using water cannons and tear gas to disperse the crowds.\nCalling the decision a \"disaster,\" Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said it would \"take many long months, lead to the deaths of the hostages, the killing of many soldiers, cost the Israeli taxpayer tens of billions, and result in diplomatic collapse.\"\nWestern governments including Australia and the U.K. also criticized the move, with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying it would \"only bring more bloodshed.\"\nUrging the international community to step in, Turkey also condemned Israel's ongoing military operations, describing them as part of an \"expansionist and genocidal policy.\"\nEarlier in an interview with Fox News in Jerusalem, Netanyahu said that Israelis \"intend to\" take over Gaza \"in order to assure our security, remove Hamas there\" and pass the enclave \"to civilian governance that is not Hamas and not anyone advocating the destruction of Israel.\"\nHe said Israel, which already controls about three-quarters of Gaza, does not want to \"keep\" it long term.\n\"We want to have a security perimeter. We don't want to govern it. We don't want to be there as a governing body,\" he said. \"We want to hand it over to Arab forces that will govern it properly without threatening us and giving Gazans a good life. That's not possible with Hamas.\"\nA senior Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, said in an interview with Al Jazeera on Thursday that any new steps the Israeli government takes in Gaza will not succeed.\n\"The Israeli occupation seeks to break the will of the Palestinian people through more bloodshed and destruction of homes,\" he said. \"But it will fail.\"\nIn recent weeks, global opinion about Israel's military actions in Gaza appears to have shifted as images of emaciated children have appeared in media outlets around the world.\nFinding food has become more difficult and deadly for Palestinians following the introduction of a new aid distribution system led by the American and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation in late May, after Israel lifted a two-and-half-month blockade.\nAccording to the United Nations, 1,200 Palestinians have been killed and more than 8,100 injured since then while trying to obtain limited humanitarian aid.\nThe Israeli military, which the United Nations human rights office says is responsible for most of the killings, says it does not target civilians.\nSeveral aid organizations have blamed GHF's aid distribution methods for the death of Palestinian civilians. Doctors Without Borders, a medical aid organization also known by its French name, Médecins Sans Frontières, criticized GHF's aid distribution in a report issued Thursday.\n\"The medical data is clear. This is not aid. It is orchestrated killing,\" the report said.\nGHF called the group's accusations \"false and disgraceful,\" saying they were aiding Hamas.","content_hash":"34d8c2409023db29da25934b76ec7c8f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5505,"method_rank":0}

Is now the time to buy the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO)? That answer isn't exactly a straightforward yes or no. Here's what you need to consider.\nWhat does the S&P 500 index do?\nThe S&P 500 index is meant to be a collection of companies that are broadly representative of the U.S. economy. The list of roughly 500 stocks is selected by a committee, with the companies picked generally being large and economically important within the industries in which they operate. The index is weighted by market capitalization, so the largest companies have the greatest effect on performance.\nThere are nuances here, of course. The market cap weighting can lead to a small number of companies having a disproportionate effect on the overall index's performance. Changes to the index can cause odd price moves in the stocks that are being added and removed. But overall the approach used to create the S&P 500 index seems to provide a good picture of \"the market.\"\nIs the S&P 500 index worth buying right now?\nThere are a number of ways to invest in the S&P 500 index, from mutual funds to exchange-traded funds (ETFs). One of the most cost-effective ways is to buy the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF. This particular S&P 500 tracker has a tiny expense ratio of 0.03%, which is as close to free on Wall Street as you can get. But being a good option for tracking the S&P 500 doesn't mean that now is the right time to buy the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF.\nAfter all, the S&P 500 is currently trading near all-time highs. The average price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio for the index is around 27x, which is kind of lofty, and the dividend yield is a miserly 1.2%.\nIf you're currently invested in the market and are simply looking to add more money to your investments, it might make sense to sit on cash for a little while. You could also select an ETF that has more of a value focus and highlights \"cheap\" stocks, like the Vanguard Value Index ETF(NYSEMKT: VTV). The average P\/E of the Vanguard Value Index ETF is around 20x, and it has a dividend yield of around 2.2%.\nBut there's another view to consider. What if you're just starting out as an investor or are early in your investment journey? In such situations, it's likely far more important that you build the saving and investing habit, rather than trying to time the market's peaks and valleys.\nThe S&P 500 index has a long history of rising over the long term, with even the biggest bear markets of the past looking like mere blips when you examine a performance graph. If the question you're really asking is whether or not you should start investing, the answer in virtually every case is going to be \"Yes.\" The Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF is a great choice for a new investor.\nThere's still another angle to consider. What if you aren't an active investor, and you're following a regular saving and investing plan that includes the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF? If you're putting money away every month, you shouldn't stop no matter what the level of the market is. You are basically dollar-cost averaging. That's a great way to invest, but you'll throw a monkey wrench into your plan if you suddenly switch to trying to market-time.\nSaving and investing is the big goal\nThere are most certainly active investors who already have sizable savings and who may want to hit the pause button on investing in the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF, or any other S&P 500 tracker. For this type of investor, there could be better choices, from individual stocks to ETFs with a more specialized focus.\nBut for new investors or those who are dollar-cost averaging, buying the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF, even when the S&P 500 index looks expensive, is probably a good call. History suggests that simply saving and investing (in a broad-based index fund like the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF) is a long-term winning strategy. Your ability to stick to a saving and investment plan will probably have a bigger effect on your wealth than anything else you do.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

While shares of massive technology companies pushed the benchmark S&P 500 up over 50% the past three years, the healthcare sector is little changed in that time.\nThat gap has put the 60-stock sector at nearly its biggest discount to the broader market in 30 years, which some investors hope is an inflection point for the battered group.\n\"The valuation is extremely cheap and the relative performance is at an extreme,\" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital, whose healthcare holdings include diversified giant Johnson & Johnson and medical device maker Stryker.\n\"So at this point, it seems like a pretty decent setup to get some outperformance.\"\nThe price-to-earnings ratio for the healthcare sector, based on earnings estimates for the next year, has fallen to 16.2 times from nearly 20 a year ago, according to LSEG Datastream.\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500's rally to records has driven the index's P\/E ratio to over 22 times -- giving the broader market a significant premium over the healthcare sector.\n'BAD NEWS IS PRICED IN'\nSome high-profile healthcare names are at even cheaper valuations. For example, Merck is trading at a forward P\/E of 8.7, against its long-term average of 14.5, while fellow drugmaker Bristol Myers Squibb trades at 7.4 against its average of 15.8, according to LSEG.\nYear-to-date, shares of both Merck and Bristol Myers are down roughly 20%.\nThe group is drawing bets from some value investors such as Patrick Kaser, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, whose portfolio is overweight the sector including owning shares of CVS Health and European drugmakers GSK and Sanofi.\n\"Our perspective is a lot of this bad news is priced in and then some,\" Kaser said. \"To bet against the sector from here, you're essentially continuing to bet on the valuation gap, which is already large, continuing to widen.\"\nThe group's decline means the total market value of the S&P 500 healthcare sector is about $4.8 trillion, not much higher than the $4.3 trillion value of Nvidia, the semiconductor company that has symbolized the artificial intelligence boom.\nIndeed, some investors said a shift in capital away from Nvidia and other massive tech companies could spark healthcare shares. Such a move appeared to occur in the first quarter, investors said, when the healthcare sector rose 6% while declines in tech and megacap stocks dragged indexes lower.\nFears of an economic downturn also could help healthcare shares, at least on a relative basis. The group is often viewed as a defensive area in rockier economic times.\nEconomic fears flared following last Friday's weaker-than-expected employment report, while some strategists say the market could be due for a pullback after surging over 20% since its April lows.\n\"During the first quarter, healthcare did great even as tech rolled over, as the fears of an economic slowdown got to more economically sensitive stocks,\" said Chris Grisanti, chief market strategist at MAI Capital Management, adding he expects healthcare \"will perform better in a more difficult market.\"\nMore clarity on regulatory issues, including tariffs, also could support healthcare, investors said.\nBut some value investors are hesitant to dive into the group. Michael Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners, said he is wary some healthcare shares could be \"value traps,\" preferring to overweight areas including industrials or financials.\n\"There's been just so much of an overhang in the sector,\" Mullaney said. \"There are better places to go with cleaner stories.\"\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; additional reporting by Laura Matthews and Suzanne McGee; Editing by Bill Berkrot)","content_hash":"1a24f3d20a056977411f4ad4434728e1","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5175,"method_rank":0}

Adjusted earnings per share tallied 50 cents — much better than the 12 cents analysts had penciled in, according to Yahoo Finance.\nRevenues for the three months ended June 28 slipped 6 percent to $797 million.\nThat included results from Michael Kors, where sales were down 5.9 percent, and Jimmy Choo, which was off 6.4 percent. The Versace business was not included as it is being categorized as a discontinued operation.\nAlthough the company hyped its sequential improvement — and Idol got plenty of kudos for it from analysts on the conference call — it was a relatively low bar as fourth-quarter adjusted losses totaled $581 million with a 15.4 percent decline in sales.\nBut there was some progress there to celebrate.\n“In our retail channel, we are starting to see encouraging signs of momentum,” Idol said, pointing to both better traffic trends in the full-price stores, more full-price sell throughs on new styles and a positive turn in the average unit retail prices.\n“We view these as early but meaningful indicators that our strategies are gaining traction,” Idol said.\nMichael Kors has exited 30 percent of its U.S. department stores over the past year and is on track to close 75 underproductive stores of its own this year.\nIdol said the Michael Kors full-price channel would be the first part of the brand to turn around.\n“We’re getting close to that right now,” he said. “That’s a very good indicator, as you know. If you’ve got the full-price channel working, that’s an area where you can really kind of solidify the rest of the company.\n“We moved very quickly last October, November around the full price,” the CEO said. “It was making sure that we got different product to the floor more quickly. We took a very focused approach to our strategic pricing architecture and that is absolutely paying off.”\nThe brand is also going to start selling some of its full-price looks in its outlet channel with a program called Icons, which mirrors what other brands have done.\nCapri also plans to spend $350 million on store renovations over the next three years and to start to see what Idol said would be “very nice returns on the $100-plus million that we spent over the last couple of years on our data analytics and replatforming our e-commerce areas.”\nWhile sources have said that Capri tried to sell Jimmy Choo this year and that there have been interested parties, including the brand’s cofounder Tamara Mellon, Idol was clear he planned to hold onto the brand.\n“We’re excited about the growth opportunity that Jimmy Choo represents for the company,” he said. “When we bought Jimmy Choo many years ago, one of the reasons we bought it is because it has an incredible name and history and heritage with the fashion luxury consumer. It’s highly recognized. And it is in the shoe business, and we thought we would actually learn a lot from them, which we have.\n“Over the years, I’m not sure this has been clear, but we’ve actually bought two manufacturing facilities,” Idol said. “So we produce over 50 percent of our own product in-house. We are truly vertical with Jimmy Choo’s two beautiful factories that we have in Italy.…Store fleet is in excellent shape. We spent a lot of money over the years renovating the stores…and so the investments we’ve made, now we can leverage.”","content_hash":"b3c9c72ca2ac2a24ad16f3d81e9fa369","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5142,"method_rank":0}

Affirm began reporting customer repayment data to credit bureaus earlier this year, but it is a move not yet matched by other major short-term loan providers.\nShort term loan provider Affirm is currently reporting payment activity to Experian and Transunion but other major players in the space, including Klarna and Afterpay, are calling for strong consumer protections to ensure users aren’t unfairly penalized if payment data is shared with credit bureaus.\nQuestions about how this process would work intensified after FICO announced in late June that its new FICO Score 10 BNPL and FICO Score 10 T BNPL models would be the first from a leading credit scoring provider to incorporate BNPL data. The move marks what FICO called a \"significant advancement in credit scoring,\" reflecting the growing role of BNPL in the U.S. credit ecosystem.\nAfterpay Head of Credit and Underwriting Juan Hernandez said in a blog post last week that the company does not currently report to credit bureaus in the United States and has no plans to \"until we see concrete evidence that BNPL data reflecting responsible payment behavior will help, not hurt, the credit scores of our customers.\"\nMeanwhile, a Klarna spokesperson told FOX Business that the company supports credit reporting that benefits consumers, which is why the company shares data in the U.K. and reports term loans in the U.S. so it is visible to consumers but excluded from credit scores.\n\"While the U.S. credit reporting framework doesn’t reflect how short-term BNPL products are used, we look forward to a system where these products can contribute positively to consumers' credit standing,\" the spokesperson said.\nDespite becoming a fast-growing credit product, these loans, which allow consumers to split payments over time, have historically not reported timely payments to credit bureaus, which means paying on time hasn't boosted scores. However, if consumers miss payments, they can still be penalized with late fees. Klarna said it will also ban someone from using its service if they miss payments.\nWhen applying to join Afterpay or being assessed for a higher spending limit, the company may perform a credit check, which may appear on a customer's credit report and be visible to other credit providers, according to its website. Klarna's website explains that it will only do soft credit checks, which don't affect someone's credit or be visible to other lenders, when consumers use the pay in four installments, pay in 30 days or pay over time options, as well as if they apply for a Klarna Card.\nOver the past decade, this payment method has seen increased demand as an alternative to credit cards. It was initially used online for retail, particularly e-commerce, fashion and consumer goods. However, BNPL has since expanded beyond apparel and is now used for purchases ranging from electronics and beauty products to groceries, home goods, and even travel and event tickets. Underscoring how ubiquitous the service has become, a June 2023 survey by the Federal Reserve found that nearly two-thirds of consumers had been offered a BNPL product in the past year.\nGiven its significant rise in popularity, experts argue it’s essential to inform both policymakers and consumers alike about the benefits and risks of these loans, from late fees to the implications of credit bureau reporting.\n\"Far beyond just determining loan eligibility, these scores impact everything from interest rates and insurance premiums to housing options and even employment prospects,\" Hernandez said. \"For the average American, understanding and maintaining a good credit score isn't just about financial health—it's become a component of overall well-being in modern society. But what if the credit scoring system wasn’t able to ensure that responsible repayments on loans positively influenced someone’s credit score?\"\nFor instance, Afterpay published a white paper called \"A Modern Approach to Credit,\" highlighting how the traditional credit system was built around outdated products and assumptions.\nThe current system \"struggles to adapt to new forms of financial behavior – even when those behaviors reflect strong financial health,\" Hernandez said in the blog post explaining the white paper.\nThe paper also argues, according to Hernandez, that it is critical that regulators embrace alternative data, such as real-time transactions and spending behavior, to create more inclusive and accurate credit assessments. This would better reflect modern financial realities while also ensuring that creditworthy individuals aren’t unfairly excluded from financial opportunities.\nIt could take at least another ten years to fully modernize the system, and by then \"financial behaviors may have evolved again – and a new generation of consumers will still be underserved by a system that wasn’t built for them,\" he warned, adding that someone's financial health should be measured through real behavior, such as how someone earns, saves, spends and repays.","content_hash":"c6c9fd5639fb343001f7023664b8bdf0","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5105,"method_rank":0}

(COP) produced lower FCF in Q2, and investors seemed bored with the company. This is despite claims that it would boost free cash flow. Nevertheless, COP stock still looks too cheap here, based on its historical yield metrics.\nCOP is at $93.28 in midday trading on Friday, Aug. 7, below its pre-earnings price action. For example, it peaked recently at $97.99 on July 29.\nConocoPhillips reported on Aug. 7 that its Q2 operating cash flow (OCF) after working capital changes of $3.485 billion (see page 1 of the Supplemental Data tables).\nThat was well below the $6.115 billion OCF in Q2 and $$4.919 billion in 2024 Q2.\nIn addition, for the first 6 months, its OCF was $304 million lower than the H1 figures from last year (i.e., $9.6 billion in H1 2025 vs. $9.904 billion in H1 2024). That represents Y\/Y decline of -3.1%.\nSo, as you might expect, investors have not been impressed. Despite slightly lower capex spending (and not including net changes in W\/C), ConocoPhillips' adjusted free cash flow (FCF) was reported as $1.4 billion.\nHowever, this did not cover the $2.2 billion cash dividends and share buybacks. This can be seen on page 9 of its shareholder deck.\nThat could be why Conoco said in its earnings release it will find $1 billion more in cost reductions and margin enhancements.\nHowever, these savings, which could boost FCF, won't kick in right away. Conoco said it will take effect on a “run rate basis by year-end 2026.”\nThe net result is that Conoco's cash balance dropped, as it was used to finance the dividend and buybacks. That may be why COP stock has been flat for the past 6 months.\nDividend Yield and Price Target\nThe dividend per share (DPS) payment was kept stable at 78 cents for Q3. That gives the stock an annual DPS rate of $3.12. So, at today's price, COP has a 3.345% dividend yield:\nHowever, it seems likely that Conoco will raise its DPS next year. If it were to raise this by 5% to 82 cents quarterly, the next 12 months (NTM) dividend payments would be:\n$0.78 +($0.82 x 3) = $3.24 forward DPS\nAs a result, its forward dividend yield is higher at 3.473% (i.e., $3.24 \/ $93.28).\nHowever, that is well below its historical dividend yield. For example, Yahoo! Finance reports that the 5-year average has been 2.64%. Similarly, Seeking Alpha says it's been 2.95%.\nTherefore, assuming COP stock eventually reverts to its mean yield of 2.795%, it could trade at:\n$3.24 DPS \/ 0.02795 = $115.92 target price\nThat provides a potential upside of +24.3% from today's price.\nAnalysts Agree COP is Undervalued\nYahoo! Finance says the average of 28 analysts is $116.93, and Barchart's mean survey price is $115.36. Moreover, some surveys have higher price targets.\nFor example, Stock Analysis shows that 16 analysts have an average of $120.38, and AnaChart.com reports that 21 analysts have an average of $118.90.\nSo, the average analyst survey price target is $117.89, representing a potential upside of +26.4%.\nThe bottom line is that, assuming ConocoPhillips can get its act together, including raising its FCF profile, COP stock looks undervalued.\nThe problem is that this could take a while, and COP stock may not reach this upside right away.\nAs a result, it makes sense to set a lower buy-in price and collect income by shorting one-month out put options in lower strike prices.\nShorting OTM Puts in COP\nFor example, look at the Sept. 5 expiry chain shows that the $90.00 strike price put option has a midpoint premium of $1.63. This strike price is over 3.5% below today's price, i.e., it's out-of-the-money (OTM) and represents a potential lower buy-in point for an investor.\nIn return, the investor receives an immediate yield of 1.81% (i.e., $1.63\/$90.00 = 0.01811 = 1.811%).\nThis means that an investor who secures $9,000 in cash or buying power, after ending an order to “Sell to Open” 1 put contract at $90.00, can make $163.00. The $9,000 acts as collateral in case COP falls to $90.00 and the account is assigned to buy 100 shares.\nThe point is that the breakeven price is lower at $90.00 - $1.63, or $88.37. That represents a 5.2% lower buy point for an investor.\nMore risk-averse investors can look to sell short the $89.00 put strike price. That premium is lower at $1.30, but the one-month yield is still attractive at 1.46% (i.e., $1.30\/$1.89).\nThe bottom line is that this is a way for investors to get paid while waiting to see if COP stock will fall. It also allows an investor to get a lower buy price while waiting.\nInvestors can learn more about how this works at the Barchart Options Learn Center, where there are a series of tutorials explaining various options strategies. For example, two popular strategies are covered call and short-put plays.\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

ANET stock is up over +17% today after its Q2 earnings release yesterday. Should investors copy this trade?\nANET is at $138.76, up +17.5% from $118.12 yesterday, and up from a recent low of $86.25 on June 20.\nThe unusual call options activity can be seen in today's Barchart Unusual Stock Options Activity Report. It shows that almost 15,000 call options contracts have traded at the $150 strike price expiring Oct. 17, 2025, which is 72 days from now.\nThat $150 strike price is out-of-the-money (OTM) since it's +8.37% over today's elevated price. This is a very bullish signal from long-term buyers of these call options.\nThe heavy volume of call options is over 79 times the prior number of call options outstanding. That means an institutional investor has taken a huge position.\nLet's look at why they are so bullish on the ANET stock.\nStrong Earnings and Free Cash Flow (FCF) Results\nArista Networks provides data center and cloud networking software products for financial, technology, and data-driven solutions providers. It's directly benefiting from the huge amount of capital being spent on artificial intelligence (AI) driven investments by many tech companies.\nThat can be seen in its latest results released on Aug. 6. For example, Q2 revenue was up +10% Q\/Q to $2.2 billion and up +30% Y\/Y. In addition, its 6-month revenue is up +29% Y\/Y to $4.21 billion.\nThis revenue was significantly higher than analysts' expectations of $2.11 billion - i.e., an upward surprise of +4.3%. Analysts are likely to increase their revenue forecasts. That could be one reason why ANET stock is up so much.\nAnother reason is that Arista Networks is also very profitable. For example, its Q2 operating income of $1.08 billion represents 49% of its $2.2 billion in revenue. Moreover, its operating cash flow (OCF) for the six months was 43.7% of the $4.21 billion in revenue.\nSince ANET has very little capex spending (just $52.4 million for the six months), its free cash flow (FCF) of $1.79 billion represents 42.5% of 6-mo sales. This could push FCF forecasts higher.\nHigher FCF Forecasts and Price Targets\nAnalysts surveyed by Seeking Alpha are projecting $8.42 billion in revenue for 2025 and $9.95 billion for 2026, a Y\/Y gain of +17.6%. Yahoo! Finance says analysts have an even higher 2026 forecast of $10.31 billion.\nI suspect that after today's +4.3% revenue surprise, analysts will likely increase their revenue forecasts. As a result, we can project around $10.7 billion for 2026.\nThat means that the next 12 months (NTM) revenue will average around $9.56 billion. Applying a 43.7% OCF margin, and assuming capex rises 10% to $115 million (i.e., $52.4m x 2 x 1.1), here is the FCF forecast:\n$9.56 billion x 0.437 = $4.178 billion OCF\n$4.178 b - $0.1150 capex = $4.063 billion FCF\nThat $4.06 billion FCF is +13.5% higher than the projected $3.58 billion run rate FCF for 2025 (assuming the first half $1.79 billion FCF doubles).\nThat could push ANET stock's value higher. For example, using a 2.0% FCF yield metric (i.e., 50x FCF), the market cap could rise over $203 billion from $174 billion today:\n$4.063b FCF \/ 0.02 = $203.15 billion\n$203.15b \/ $173.87 b mkt cap today = 1.1684 -1 = +16.8% upside\nThat sets the price target for ANET at $162.00 per share (i.e., $138.76 x 1.168).\nThat could be why investors are so bullish on ANET stock.\nHow the Call Options Play Works\nThe $150 strike price calls have a midprice premium of $6.25 per call contract. That sets the breakeven price at $156.25. This is below the expected price target of $162 and the call option is likely to be profitable.\nFor example, let's say that in two months ANET stock has risen to $160. The $150 strike price call option is likely to trade for more than the instrinsic value of $10 (i.e., $160-$150). It could have some $2 or $3 in extrinsic value, so the call option premium would be $12 or $13.00.\nSo, the investor who bought in at $6.25 could double their money (i.e., $12.50\/$6.25 = 2) in just 2 months.\nThat could account for the heavy volume in today's call options due in 2.5 months on Oct. 17. In other words, the investors believe that the target price will be reached in over 2 months.\nHowever, that has a huge amount of risk. Keep in mind our target price is based on the next 12 months (NTM) revenue and FCF projections. The market may not yet come to see this in two months.\nTherefore, investors should be careful in following institutional investors in this call option play. They can study Barchart's Options Learning Center tabs to better understand the risks with call options.\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

The deal would ultimately fall apart, and today, most Figma's shareholders are likely thankful it did.\nFigma went public on Aug. 1, and its stock price more than tripled, quickly catapulting to a more than $59 billion market cap, due to insatiable demand from investors. Large IPOs have seen success this year, as the market has begun to thaw after a few difficult years. While Figma is certainly a very promising company and the stock has begun pulling back to a market cap of $44 billion, it's still valued for more than twice as Adobe's offer. Does Figma truly deserve this monstrous valuation?\nThe right ingredients to make a big splash\nAs I mentioned above, large IPOs like CoreWeave and Circle have performed tremendously well. It could perhaps be due to a lack of IPOs in recent years or exuberance around the crypto and artificial intelligence sectors. IPOs that can show big growth and some semblance of profitability have been met with high praise and excitement.\nAnd that's exactly what Figma offered. Between the first quarter of 2023 and the second quarter of 2025, Figma generated average quarterly revenue growth of 10%. In the second quarter of 2025, Figma grew revenue 41% year over year, and is now on pace for $1 billion in annual revenue. The company also achieved decent profitability in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025. In its preliminary second-quarter results, management projected $9 million to $12 million in operating profits.\nAt Figma's initial projected valuation of $13.6 billion to $16.5 billion, that didn't look so bad in today's environment. Plus, Figma has an AI angle. The company is essentially the Google Sheets of design and user interface, allowing designers and coders to collaboratively build an array of projects with high-quality graphics. In 2023, Figma released Dev Mode, which easily translates designs into code. Other AI features on Figma include the ability to automate many tasks and First Draft, an AI tool that allows users to transition from a blank canvas to user interfaces that can be edited with a simple prompt.\nFigma already counts 95% of Fortune 500 companies as clients. Management also sees huge potential to incorporate more AI tools and capture business from the 1 billion new applications that are expected to be made by 2028.\nFact or Fiction: Figma should trade close to a $60 billion market cap?\nAt this valuation, Figma trades somewhere in the range of over 44 times 2025 revenue, assuming the company keeps growing quarterly revenue at a 10% rate. That is an extremely expensive valuation. If investors do view Figma as an AI play or a monopoly in the space, that could lead to a higher premium valuation.\nHowever, there's no certainty that Figma will hold this position forever because AI is clearly going to have a big use-case in design and coding. After all, OpenAI's ChatGPT already demonstrated some pretty impressive capabilities in this regard. Recently on CNBC, Figma co-founder and CEO Dylan Field said that superintelligence is not likely to replace Figma's graphics engine or technology.\n\"I think that's not stuff that you can learn from looking at code and sort of various places on the internet,\" said Field. \"It's not part of the pretraining data mix. I believe that doing that at scale -- it's quite difficult.\"\nHowever, it's really tough to know how far AI and superintelligence can go. Figma will also likely need to invest heavily in AI. I certainly think Figma has strong potential, and I did expect the stock to jump out of the gate. But at this kind of valuation, the stock has run too far, too fast. The risk-reward proposition is no longer favorable, which is why I think investors should wait for dips before buying.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

At least one of these will need to be dropped – she faces an impossible trilemma,\" NIESR said.\nIt's worth noting that NIESR's forecast for the budget deficit could be even higher, at around £51.1 billion, if Reeves wants to keep around £9.9 billion's worth of fiscal \"headroom\" that the Treasury had planned for, but which has been slowly eroded after U-turns on welfare reforms and winter fuel payment cuts for pensioners.\n\"For the Chancellor to really shift the dial and build a reasonably sized buffer against her fiscal rules, she will have to look at either raising VAT or raising income taxes. VAT is the least distortionary tax but is also the most regressive. So, rises in income tax rates are likely to be the best answer, as we have previously argued,\" NIESR said, but added that there were few palatable options for the chancellor.\nNo good options on tax rises\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer was asked about the NIESR report on Wednesday, and the suggestion that tax rises would be necessary, but said he did \"not recognise\" the figures. Nonetheless, he declined to rule out hiking VAT, income tax and corporation tax in the fall, Sky News reported.\n\"Some of the figures that are being put out are not figures that I recognise, but the budget won't be until later in the year, and that's why we'll have the forecast then and we'll set out our plans,\" he said.\nNIESR said Chancellor Reeves faces \"unenviable decisions\" for the Autumn Budget, when she will unveil taxation and spending plans for the year ahead.\n\"Unfortunately, the most politically acceptable choices for tax increases would either raise very little revenue or would have large distortionary effects, or both,\" the think tank said, suggesting some measures — such as extending income tax thresholds — would \"particularly affect poorer households.\"\nOther measures, such as cutting the current £20,000 tax-free cash ISA allowance, or increasing the rate of capital gains tax, could disincentivize saving, the think tank warned.\nThe government could also reverse cuts to employees' national insurance contributions (NICs) but \"while this would generate significant revenue over the parliamentary term,\" it would again breach the manifesto pledge not to raise taxes on working people, and could have strong \"distortionary effects via discouraging job creation and so would likely increase unemployment.\"\nWhen Reeves announced her government budget last fall, she unveiled a £70 billion boost to public spending to be funded by higher borrowing and £40 billion in tax rises, which mostly hit British businesses.\nAt the time, she insisted it was a one-off move, telling lawmakers that \"we're not going to be coming back with more tax increases, or indeed more borrowing.\"\nReeves could potentially adjust corporation tax rates and allowances which could also raise significant tax revenues, but this would run contrary to her previous pledge to cap corporation tax at 25% for the lifetime of the parliament.\nIt would also likely have a negative effect on business confidence, which has already taken a hit after a hike to employer NICs that took effect in April.","content_hash":"afee7f7bdee1bbc1f8802298daba6c3a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4945,"method_rank":0}

The July figures represent a 26.4% increase from June and nearly 20% increase year-over-year, Streaty said.\nThe share of EV sales in July also accounted for about 9.1% of total sales of passenger vehicles that month, the largest monthly share on record, according to Cox.\n\"We're seeing significant volume in new EVs,\" said Liz Najman, director of market insights at Recurrent, an EV marketplace and data provider.\nMeanwhile, there were nearly 36,700 used EVs sold in July, a record monthly high, Cox data shows.\nSpecific EV models — the Chevy Equinox EV, Honda Prologue and Hyundai IONIQ 5 — also saw record-breaking sales last month, Najman said.\nThere were 8,500 Equinox EVs sold in July, the highest monthly EV total in the U.S. for any model outside of Tesla, which is the market leader, Najman said.\n(This comes as Tesla's sales have declined for two consecutive quarters, by about 12% year-over-year in Q2 and 9% in Q1, according to Cox data.)\n$7,500 tax credit puts EVs near price parity\nThe tax credits — worth up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used EVs — aim to make EV purchases more financially enticing for consumers.\nThe EV tax breaks were one of many policies the Biden administration adopted to try try to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.

If a company grows its dividend on a regular basis, that can help ensure that inflation doesn't diminish the value of the payout over time. And the longer you hang on, the higher your dividend income becomes.\nDividends increases are by no means a guarantee, and that's why it's important to focus on quality stocks. Three solid dividend stocks that you may want to consider loading up on today include Target (NYSE: TGT), T. Rowe Price Group (NASDAQ: TROW), and Chevron (NYSE: CVX). Not only do these stocks offer high yields in excess of 4%, but they have also grown their payouts over the years, have strong financials, and they look incredibly cheap right now.\n1. Target\nRetail giant Target has been struggling with generating much growth this year as consumers cut back on discretionary spending amid economic challenges. But despite the headwinds, the company's financials aren't all that bad. For the period ended May 3, Target's net sales declined by just 3%, to $23.8 billion. And its net earnings actually improved by 10%, to more than $1 billion, as the company has been cutting costs.\nShares of Target have been under pressure this year as investors brace for continued struggles from the retailer. But while it may not be a great growth stock to own right now, Target remains a dependable option for dividend investors. It yields 4.5%, and the company raised its dividend by just under 2% this year, extending its streak of increases to 54 consecutive years.\nAt an incredibly low price-to-earnings multiple of only 11, Target can be a great value buy today. The business may not be experiencing strong growth, but with a low payout ratio of just 49%, it can make for a great dividend stock to buy and hold.\n2. T. Rowe Price Group\nGlobal investment firm T. Rowe Price is another solid dividend stock to add to your portfolio today. Year to date, it's down around 6%, but its overall performance has been steady.\nDuring the first six months of the year, the company's net revenue totaled $3.5 billion, which was virtually unchanged from a year ago. Rising costs did, however, chip away at its bottom line, which was down 6%, with earnings totaling just under $1 billion over the past two quarters.\nThe stock yields 4.9%, and T. Rowe has increased its dividend for 39 consecutive years. In February, it announced it was increasing its dividend by more than 2%. Its payout ratio is modest at 56% of earnings, leaving plenty of room for the company to continue making more rate hikes for the foreseeable future.\nTrading at less than 12 times earnings, this is another cheap dividend growth stock worth buying right now.\n3. Chevron\nRounding out this list of high-yielding dividend growth stocks is oil and gas giant Chevron. It pays 4.5%, as it also provides investors with a terrific source of recurring cash flow. While there is volatility that comes with investing in this sector, Chevron is a leading player in it, making it one of the safer options for dividend investors to consider. Amid a myriad of economic cycles and challenges, it has remained a solid dividend growth stock -- Chevron has raised its payout for 38 straight years.\nThe company has experienced volatility this year due to falling oil prices. Over the past six months, its revenue totaled $92.4 billion, which was down 7% year over year. And its adjusted earnings fell by 32% to $6.9 billion. But its cash flow from operations totaled $13.8 billion, which was still considerably higher than how much it paid out in dividends -- $5.9 billion.\nThere will be fluctuations in earnings for Chevron, but with the company growing its exposure in the industry, including its recent acquisition of Hess, which has a strong portfolio of assets in Guyana, this is a continually growing business that investors can rely on for the long haul.\nChevron's stock trades at 18 times its estimated future earnings (based on analyst expectations). By comparison, the average stock on the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) trades at a forward earnings multiple of 24. For an industry leader, Chevron's valuation looks incredibly cheap.\nTrump’s Tariffs Could Create $1.5 Trillion AI Gold Rush\nThe Motley Fool’s analysts are tracking a massive shift in U.S. tech. Over $1.5 trillion is already flowing into infrastructure, AI, and advanced manufacturing… and the number keeps climbing.\nIt builds the tech infrastructure that Apple, OpenAI, and others suddenly can’t live without. We just released a full write-up on this under-the-radar stock — and why now might be the exact moment to move.\nDavid Jagielski has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Some mild short covering emerged in sugar futures today after the Brazilian real (^USDBRL) rallied to a 4-week high, discouraging export sales from Brazil's sugar producers.\nOn Tuesday, sugar prices fell to 5-week lows on signs of stronger sugar production in Brazil. Last Thursday, Unica reported Brazil's Center-South sugar output in the first half of July rose +15% y\/y to 3.4 MMT. Also, the amount of sugarcane being crushed for sugar by Brazil's sugar mills has increased to 54% from 50% the same time last year.\nThe outlook for higher sugar exports from India is negative for prices after Bloomberg reported that India may permit local sugar mills to export sugar in the next season, which starts in October, as abundant monsoon rains may produce a bumper sugar crop. India's Meteorological Department reported today that cumulative monsoon rain in India is at 500.8 mm, or 4% above normal as of August 4. Also, the Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association said last Thursday that it will seek permission to export 2 MMT of sugar in 2025\/26.\nThe outlook for higher sugar production in India, the world's second-largest producer, is bearish for prices. On June 2, India's National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories projected that India's 2025\/26 sugar production would climb +19% y\/y to 35 MMT, citing larger planted cane acreage. That would follow a -17.5% y\/y decline in India's sugar production in 2024\/25 to a 5-year low of 26.2 MMT, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).\nSugar prices have retreated over the past four months, with NY sugar falling to a 4.25-year low last month and London sugar sliding to a 4-year low, driven by expectations of a sugar surplus in the 2025\/26 season. On June 30, commodities trader Czarnikow projected a 7.5 MMT global sugar surplus for the 2025\/26 season, the largest surplus in 8 years. On May 22, the USDA, in its biannual report, projected that global 2025\/26 sugar production would increase by +4.7% y\/y to a record 189.318 MMT, with global sugar ending stocks at 41.188 MMT, up 7.5% y\/y.\nSigns that the recent slide in sugar prices to 4-year lows has sparked a pickup in demand are positive for sugar prices. China's June sugar imports soared by 1,435% to 420,000 MT. Also, Coca-Cola agreed to use cane sugar in Coke beverages sold in the US instead of high-fructose corn syrup, which could boost US sugar consumption by +4.4% to 11.5 MMT from 11 MMT currently, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\nSugar prices also have support from reduced sugar production in Brazil. Unica reported last Thursday that the cumulative 2025\/26 Brazil Center-South sugar output through mid-July fell by -9.2% y\/y to 15.655 MMT. Last month, Conab, Brazil's government crop forecasting agency, said 2024\/25 Brazil sugar production fell by -3.4% y\/y to 44.118 MMT, citing lower sugarcane yields due to drought and excessive heat.\nThe outlook for higher sugar production in Thailand is bearish for sugar prices. On May 2, Thailand's Office of the Cane and Sugar Board reported that Thailand's 2024\/25 sugar production rose +14% y\/y to 10.00 MMT. Thailand is the world's third-largest sugar producer and the second-largest exporter of sugar.\nThe International Sugar Organization (ISO) raised its 2024\/25 global sugar deficit forecast to a 9-year high of -5.47 MMT on May 15, up from a February forecast of -4.88 MMT. This indicates a tightening market following the 2023\/24 global sugar surplus of 1.31 MMT. ISO also cut its 2024\/25 global sugar production forecast to 174.8 MMT from a February forecast of 175.5 MMT.\nThe USDA, in its bi-annual report released May 22, projected that global 2025\/26 sugar production would climb +4.7% y\/y to a record 189.318 MMT and that global 2025\/26 human sugar consumption would increase +1.4% y\/y to a record 177.921 MMT. The USDA also forecasted that 2025\/26 global sugar ending stocks would climb +7.5% y\/y to 41.188 MMT. The USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) predicted that Brazil's 2025\/26 sugar production would rise +2.3% y\/y to a record 44.7 MMT FAS predicted that India's 2025\/26 sugar production would rise +25% y\/y to 35.3 MMT due to favorable monsoon rains and increased sugar acreage. FAS predicted that Thailand's 2025\/26 sugar production will climb +2% y\/y to 10.3 MMT.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

However, Hill is optimistic that newcomers will continue to stream into the region and drive absorption.\n“We're not seeing any slowdown on migration trends,” he said. “So that's still a net positive of 6% or so. It's down from COVID highs, but in line with pre-COVID numbers. So we're not seeing any concerns whatsoever on the various demand metrics that we look at.”\nStill, demand can only currently do so much to salve the issues with supply in many of MAA’s markets, as new lease pricing fell below expectations in Q2. The REIT’s same-store revenue declined 0.3%, which was slightly below the -0.2% projection of Michael Lewis, an analyst for Truist. Still, MAA noted strength in some markets, especially its smaller metros.\nNew lease rents struggle\nSun Belt deliveries are continuing to burn off from past peaks hit last year, according to executives at MAA.\n“If we look at the quarterly supply that's been delivered, it has dropped off pretty good over the last two quarters, and I expect it'll drop off even more in Q3 and Q4,” MAA Chief Strategy and Analysis Officer Tim Argo said on the earnings call last month.\nMAA saw new lease pricing recover through April, but then it fell below the REIT’s expectations in May and June, with a 4.8% decline in the second quarter, according to the earnings report. That was still a 150 basis point year-over-year improvement.\nExecutives at the REIT don’t think residents are suffering rent increase fatigue. Instead, they point to other apartment operators’ focus on maintaining occupancy as a main factor muting rent increases.\n“As we got into May, we saw that market operators began to focus a little bit more on occupancy, which clearly had an impact in terms of the rate of the recovery that we expected,” Argo said.\nHowever, MAA is getting 4% to 5% increases on renewals and has visibility into September and even earlier October, which is cushioning the impact of new leases. Blended lease rates turned positive during the quarter at 0.5%.\n“We continue to see renewals play a larger part of the combination and continue to see the real rates be strong,” Argo said.\nMid-tier strength\nMAA’s executives continue to see strength in the same areas that they have over the last few quarters, with mid-tier markets performing well. “Our Virginia markets remain strong and other mid-tier markets such as Kansas City, [Missouri]; Charleston, [South Carolina]; and Greenville, [South Carolina], all demonstrated strong pricing power,” Argo said.\nFredericksburg, Virginia; Kansas City; and Northern Virginia posted same-store revenue growth of 5.1%, 3.8% and 3.7%, respectively. Argo noted the renewal rate has gone down at MAA’s Arlington, Virginia, property. Still, he didn’t seem concerned about the Washington, D.C., metro area. That echoed the sentiment of other REITs.\n“Strength in the Washington, D.C., area, particularly Northern Virginia, has been a theme among the apartment REITs in our coverage universe that have reported 2Q25 results so far,” Lewis said in a report shared with Multifamily Dive.\nOut of MAA’s larger markets, Argo said Tampa, Florida, showed pricing recovery, while Houston was steady.\n“We also continue to see a slow but steady recovery in Atlanta, which had our largest year-over-year improvement in both blended pricing and occupancy of any of our higher concentration markets,” Argo said.\nBY THE NUMBERS\nSOURCE: MAA\nHeavy supply in Phoenix; Austin, Texas; and Nashville, Tennessee, continues to dampen new lease pricing. The firm’s largest same-store declines were in Austin, 4.0%, Jacksonville, Florida, 2.9%, and Memphis, Tennessee, 2.9%.\n“We have seen the uncertainty and higher leasing pressure particularly impact the leasing velocity in our lease-up portfolio [in Austin],” Argo said. “And in turn, we pushed the stabilization dates by one quarter for three of our lease-up properties — West Midtown, Vale and Val Vista.”\nClick here to sign up to receive multifamily and apartment news like this article in your inbox every weekday.","content_hash":"dcd3b9a44d0a7d607c96a19d876fb062","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4767,"method_rank":0}

I don’t wanna do that.’ So suppliers are pretty keen to figure out how to maintain those prices.”\nConsumers nationwide have been pulling back their spending in response to President Donald Trump’s tariffs on multiple countries, which are expected to result in higher prices for everyday goods.\nAccording to a recent survey from market research company Numerator, 87% of consumers are worried about tariffs impacting their finances.\nAlso, 80% of consumers are adjusting their finances or shopping habits in response to tariffs, including delaying nonessential or expensive purchases, buying fewer imported goods, searching for sales and coupons, and switching to shopping at lower-priced retailers and discount stores.\nRelated: Walmart has an alarming consumer boycott problem\nWayfair struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior first appeared on TheStreet on Aug 6, 2025\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Aug 6, 2025, where it first appeared.","content_hash":"c0042f3d9ebd15fa9574702425aebede","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4541,"method_rank":0}

On Polymarket, traders are slightly less convinced, seeing a 79% chance of a cut. Traders are positioning for reductions at the following two meetings as well.\nAdd in strong earnings from major companies and a weakening U.S. dollar, and the outlook is looking a little stronger for equities and other risk assets. The Nikkei 225 rose 0.65% today, the Euro Stoxx 50 is up 1.2% and the S&P 500 closed up 0.73% on Wednesday. The Nasdaq Composite closed up 1.2% on news of chip tariff exemptions and President Trump signaling he may appoint dovish members to the Fed.\nIn a sign of long-term institutional interest, the State of Michigan Retirement System (SMRS) said boosted its bitcoin exposure through spot ETFs in the second quarter.\nYet the real story may be how little BTC is moving. The cryptocurrency’s 30-day implied volatility, as tracked by the BVIV index from Volmex, has dropped to 36.5%, a level not seen since October 2023, when bitcoin traded under $30,000.\nThe pattern resembles Wall Street's bull markets, where implied volatility tends to shrink as optimism grows. In previous cycles, bitcoin's price and volatility moved in tandem.\nStructured crypto projects that allow investors to sell out-of-the-money call options to generate yield may be playing a part in reducing the volatility.\nStill, geopolitical risk isn't going to go away. Trump levied an additional 25% tariff on India over its Russian oil purchases, which could lead to a “mini crunch in supplies if Delhi draws on other crude sources instead,” Hargreaves Lansdown said in an emailed note. That would likely force OPEC+ members to amp up production to avoid a crisis, Hargreaves Lansdown said.\nOn top of that, while peace talks on Ukraine have been advancing, recent nuclear rhetoric suggests there’s a long way to go.

The rise of ultra-popular fast fashion websites Shein and Temu had cut into sales for the jewelry store chain, which has 1,326 company-operated stores in the U.S. Other detrimental factors: rising interest rates, inflation and tariffs on goods from China.\nKnown for its ear piercings and teen fashion accessories, the chain joins other companies facing bankruptcies and store closings such as At Home, Big Lots, Joann Fabrics, Kohl's, JCPenney, Macy's and Party City.\nHere's what to know, including which stores are closing.\n83387715007\nKroger: Supermarket chain closing two more stores, adding to list of closures\nWhy is Claire's filing for backtuptcy?\nAhead of the Aug. 6 bankruptcy filing, the company had sought to find a buyer for all or part of the business, and identified 18 stores it would close, according to filings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.\n\"This decision is difficult, but a necessary one. Increased competition, consumer spending trends and the ongoing shift away from brick-and-mortar retail, in combination with our current debt obligations and macroeconomic factors, necessitate this course of action for Claire's and its stakeholders,\" said Claire's CEO Chris Cramer in the news release. \"We remain in active discussions with potential strategic and financial partners and are committed to completing our review of strategic alternatives.\"\nEarlier this year, Claire's deferred payments on debt interest as a way to conserve cash, Bloomberg reported. U.S. tariff policy uncertainties has led to concerns about Claire's ability to pay a $475 million loan due in December 2026, according to Bloomberg.\nAnother sign of financial pressure and cash flow problems at Claire's: the company had increasingly fallen behind on its bills over the past year, according to Ragini Bhalla, spokesperson for business credit report provider Creditsafe.\n\"These patterns once again reveal that the retailer has been struggling to handle its financial obligations and delaying paying more of its outstanding bills,\" she said in July 30 report shared with USA TODAY.\nWhich Claire's and Icing stores are closing?\nA total of 18 Claire's and Icing stores will be closing, with clearance sales concluding no later than Sept. 7, according to the company's court filings.

The permit was issued this week.\nElon Musk's EV company has been running a limited ride-hailing service for invited riders in Austin since late June. The select few passengers have mostly been social media influencers and analysts, including many who generate income by posting Tesla fan content on platforms like X and YouTube.\nThe Austin fleet consists of Model Y vehicles equipped with Tesla's latest partially automated driving systems. The company has been operating the cars with a valet, or human safety supervisor in the front passenger seat tasked with intervening if there are issues with the ride. The vehicles are also remotely supervised by employees in an operations center.\nMusk, who has characterized himself as \"pathologically optimistic,\" said on Tesla's earnings call last month that he believes Tesla could serve half of the U.S. population by the end of 2025 with autonomous ride-hailing services.\nThe Texas permit is the first to enable Tesla to run a \"transportation network company.\" TDLR said Friday that this kind of permit lets Tesla operate a ride-hailing business anywhere in the state, including with \"automated motor vehicles,\" and doesn't require Tesla to keep a human safety driver or valet on board.\nTesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nAs CNBC previously reported, Tesla robotaxis were captured on camera disobeying traffic rules in and around Austin after the company started its pilot program. None of the known incidents have been reported as causing injury or serious property damage, though they have drawn federal scrutiny.\nIn one incident, Tesla content creator Joe Tegtmeyer reported that his robotaxi failed to stop for a train crossing signal and lowering gate-arm, requiring a Tesla employee on board to intervene. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has discussed this incident with Tesla, a spokesperson for the regulator told CNBC by email.\nTexas has historically been more permissive of autonomous vehicle testing and operations on public roads than have other states.\nA new law signed by Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott goes into effect this year that will require AV makers to get approval from the state before starting driverless operations. The new law also gives the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles the authority to revoke permits if AV companies and their cars aren't complying with safety standards.\nTesla's AV efforts have faced a number of challenges across the country, including federal probes, product liability lawsuits and recalls following injurious or damaging collisions that occurred while drivers were using the company's Autopilot and FSD (Full Self-Driving) systems.\nA jury in a federal court in Miami last week determined that Tesla should hold 33% of the liability for a fatal Autopilot-involved collision.\nAnd the California DMV has sued Tesla, accusing it of false advertising around its driver assistance systems. Tesla owners manuals say the Autopilot and FSD features in their cars are \"hands on\" systems that require a driver ready to steer or brake at any time. But Tesla and Musk have shared statements through the years saying that a Tesla can \"drive itself.\"\nSince 2016, Musk has been promising that Tesla would soon be able to turn all of its existing EVs into fully autonomous vehicles with a simple, over-the-air software update. In 2019, he said the company would put 1 million robotaxis on the road by 2020, a claim that helped him raise $2 billion at the time from institutional investors.\nThose promises never materialized and, in the robotaxi market, Tesla lags way behind competitors like Alphabet's Waymo in the U.S. and Baidu's Apollo Go in China.\nTesla shares are down 18% this year, by far the worst performance among tech's megacaps.","content_hash":"574ee356da347d929d827b7c0c088a81","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4135,"method_rank":0}

They're 24-7, non-custodial, permissionless, available anywhere. And we've launched a few months ago the first 60 of them, offering them on the Kraken platform through much of the world and hopefully in Europe soon,” said Mark Greenberg, Vice President and General Manager, Consumer Product and Business at Kraken in a conversation with Scott Melker on The Street Roundtable.\nCurrently, the product is available in Kraken’s “rest of world” markets, spanning Latin America, most of Asia, and the Middle East. “Over time, we hope to offer them, as I said, in Europe as well. We'll hopefully be able to do that in the next few weeks,” Greenberg said.\nJoin the discussion with Scott Melker on Roundtable here.\nThe appeal is clear for markets with limited equity access. “Even as a Canadian, I don't have a lot of access to certain equity. So I was trying to buy an equity adjunct in Europe the other day and turns out actually my broker doesn't even allow that. What we're planning to do here with xStocks is allow folks around the world to buy stocks in everything… not everybody can buy especially fractional components of that if they only have say 10 or 20 dollars that they want to put into something like Tesla.”\nThe infrastructure is fully backed. “The stocks are held one to one backed in a SPV, a special purpose vehicle in Jersey. And then they are… minted into tokens through a prospectus in Europe and then offered. And so basically every time you mint one of these tokens, a share is bought and then those tokens can be sold, bought or sold on Kraken or on Dex's or on lots of other exchanges.”\nGreenberg contrasted Kraken’s approach with more limited tokenized offerings from big institutions. “A lot of these early things, right? Like you could only buy and sell it back to the issuer… You couldn't even send it to yourself somewhere else… that's actually what we were trying to avoid… And for sure, xStocks, I think, is at the forefront of that.”\nKraken also plans to integrate tokenized stocks with traditional equities and everyday spending.\n“Soon we're going to be launching a card in Europe and the UK… if you want to hold your… money in Tesla… you can absolutely do that. And then you can buy your coffee with it… you can do that with Tesla or Fartcoin or USDC.”\nThe card launch, Greenberg added, is “hoping just a few weeks away, actually for our launch in Europe.”\nTokenized market surges\nAs per RWA.XYZ, a data tracker for tokenized real-world assets, the market for tokenized stocks is showing steady growth.\nThe sector’s total value currently stands at $391.70 million, up 0.30% from 30 days ago. Monthly transfer volume has surged 34.01% to $314.69 million, indicating heightened trading activity. The number of monthly active addresses is 53,194, up 1.57%, while the total number of holders has climbed 14.90% to 61,160, signaling expanding adoption across global markets.\nThe largest tokenized equity by value is EXOD (Exodus Movement Inc. Class A), issued via Securitize on the Algorand network, with a market value of $281.6 million and an 83.72% share of the tracked total.\nOther notable assets include TSLAx (Tesla Inc.) on Solana with $9.93 million in value, up 102.9% over the past month, and MSTRx (MicroStrategy Inc.) at $4.26 million, up 56.53%. Traditional market heavyweights like SPYx (S&P 500 ETF), NVDAx (NVIDIA Corp), and AAPLx (Apple Inc.) also feature prominently, reflecting investor interest in blue-chip tokenized equities.\nKraken exec says tokenized stocks will let you ‘buy coffee with Tesla’ first appeared on TheStreet on Aug 8, 2025\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Aug 8, 2025, where it first appeared.","content_hash":"9a6a8c1bc52e97c2fed9258165e3a3b4","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4034,"method_rank":0}

The S & P 500 is pointing to a higher open this morning after a modest pullback yesterday, keeping the index on track for a positive week. The Dow, after a sharp reversal yesterday, also was on track for a positive open. 2. Several analysts defended Club name Eli Lilly after yesterday's 14% plunge on disappointing data for its obesity pill. Morgan Stanley called it \"overdone. JPMorgan said the pullback creates a \"compelling entry point.\" Goldman Sachs said the sell-off implies the pill is an impaired asset, which simply isn't the case. We downgraded Lilly yesterday. Lilly shares were up about 1.7% in the premarket. 3. Shares of The Trade Desk sank 30% this morning. The digital advertising company beat analyst estimates on revenue and adjusted EBITDA, but guided for slowing revenue growth in the third quarter. Bank of America double downgraded shares to underperform, citing an uncertain trajectory from here and competitive pressures from Club name Amazon . 4. Texas Roadhouse posted strong second-quarter same-store sales growth and said the third quarter is off to a better-than-expected start. However, beef inflation is eating into profits, but that should not have been a surprise to anyone. We reiterated our hold-equivalent rating last night in our analysis for Club members. 5. Tesla is breaking up its Dojo supercomputer team, Bloomberg News reported, as leader Peter Bannon leaves the electric vehicle maker. As a result, the report said Tesla will increase its reliance on Club name Nvidia and peer AMD for computing power. 6. Shares of Expedia surged nearly 15% this morning after the travel company reported a strong second-quarter earnings beat and raised its full-year outlook for bookings, revenue and operating profitability. Ad sales helped helped drive the results. 7. Take-Two Interactive's bookings exceed the high end of guidance. The video-game publisher reaffirmed that \"Grand Theft Auto 6\" is due out May 26, 2026. There were no updates on pricing for the long-awaited game, which is more than a decade in the making. Shares popped more than 4%. 8. Pinterest shares fell nearly 13% this morning after a mixed quarter. The digital pinboard's revenue slightly beat expectations but earnings per share came up a few cents short. Global monthly active users were better than expected, but missed in the U.S. and Canada. 9. Melius Research increased its price target on Club name Apple price target to $260 a share from $240. The firm also raised its fiscal 2026 earnings per share estimates thanks to higher gross margins. Apple shares have climbed 8.4% over the past two sessions following its latest U.S. investment pledges . 10.

And their growing popularity could point to a generally positive user experience. But experts warn of a few problematic aspects of these platforms.\nFor one, many aren't regulated. \"They don't have to prove that they work, they don't have to prove that they're safe,\" Vaile Wright, a psychologist and senior director at the American Psychological Association said on an episode of podcast \"Speaking of Psychology.\"\nAnother problem with these apps, she said, is that they \"don't have to prove that they keep your data private.\" For example, \"you might not want your boss to know that you're using an app to help you reduce your alcohol use,\" she said.\nIf these tools aren't FDA cleared, they're not compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which protects sensitive health information. \"There is no regulatory body or law that keeps your personal health information safe,\" Wright said. That means they can't guarantee that a data breach won't happen. This, of course, is not specific to wellness apps.\nConsumers need to be aware of what are the benefits and what are the potential risks.Vaile WrightPsychologist\nThese apps are also operating under a very specific business model that prioritizes their bottom line, she said. \"But it's a challenging space to [prioritize profit] and so sometimes what happens with that tension is they make bad choices.\nIn 2023, the federal trade commission issued a proposed order banning online therapy platform BetterHelp from sharing consumers' data for advertising. The company was charged with sharing sensitive customer data with Facebook and Snapchat. BetterHelp was required to pay consumers $7.8 million, which it began sending out in 2024.\n\"It's not that these apps can't be helpful,\" Wright said. \"I think they really can be. It's just consumers need to be aware of what are the benefits and what are the potential risks by using them.\"\nHere's how to keep your information safe\nBefore deciding to use one of these apps, read the terms of service and privacy policy. It's hard, Wright said, because you have to \"get through it with all of the legalize.\" But it will at least keep you somewhat informed of their practices.\nYou can also do your homework about the company at large.\n\"You have to go to the website and really look at who's developing it,\" Wright said. \"Do they have experts on there? Advisory boards? What are they saying that the app is built on? Is it built on some known psychological principle like cognitive behavioral therapy?\"\nThat kind of info can give you a sense of the company's internal policies.\nUltimately, \"you have to make your own informed decision about what you're comfortable with,\" she said. \"It's about entering into it as informed as you can be.\"\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

Azerbaijan took back full control of the region in 2023, prompting almost all of the territory's 100,000 ethnic Armenians to flee to Armenia.\nTrump said the two countries had committed to stop fighting, open up diplomatic relations and respect each other's territorial integrity.\nThe agreement includes exclusive U.S. development rights to a strategic transit corridor through the South Caucasus that the White House said would facilitate greater exports of energy and other resources.\nTrump said the United States signed separate deals with each country to expand cooperation on energy, trade and technology, including artificial intelligence.\nHe said restrictions had also been lifted on defense cooperation between Azerbaijan and the United States.\nBoth leaders praised Trump for helping to end the conflict and said they would nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize. \"So who if not President Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize?\" Aliyev said.\nTrump has tried to present himself as a global peacemaker in the first months of his second term. The White House credits him with brokering a ceasefire between Cambodia and Thailand and sealing peace deals between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Pakistan and India.\nHowever, he has not managed to end Russia's war in Ukraine or Israel's conflict with Hamas in Gaza.\nU.S. officials said the agreement was hammered out during repeated visits to the region and would provide a basis for working toward a full normalization between the countries.\nSenior administration officials told reporters the agreement marked the first end to several frozen conflicts on Russia's periphery since the end of the Cold War and said it would send a powerful signal to the entire region.\nThe peace deal could transform the South Caucasus, an energy-producing region neighboring Russia, Europe, Turkey and Iran that is criss-crossed by oil and gas pipelines but riven by closed borders and longstanding ethnic conflicts.\nArmenia plans to award the U.S. exclusive special development rights for an extended period on the transit corridor, administration officials told Reuters this week. The so-called Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity has already drawn interest from nine companies, including three U.S. firms, one official said on condition of anonymity.\nDaphne Panayotatos, with the Washington-based rights group Freedom Now, said it has urged the Trump administration to use the meeting with Aliyev to demand the release of some 375 political prisoners held in the country.\nAzerbaijan, an oil-producing country that hosted the United Nations climate summit last November, has rejected Western criticism of its human rights record, describing it as unacceptable interference.","content_hash":"8c03f03868b8c3199e0d802f285c5454","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3638,"method_rank":0}

It's Miran\nEconomists and investors have spent the last week wondering who would replace Adriana Kugler on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors after her abrupt resignation. On Thursday, they got their answer: President Donald Trump said he would nominate Stephen Miran, the chair of the Council of Economic Advisors. Miran will serve out the remainder of Kugler's term, which ends Jan. 31, 2026, Trump said, while the president searches for a permanent replacement. Miran's appointment to the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee — which still needs Senate confirmation — would put a Trump loyalist on the board at a time when the White House is pressuring the central bank to lower interest rates.\n2. Tech's art of the deal\nSome of the biggest names in tech have showered the White House with special deals this week. OpenAI kicked things off Tuesday when it announced it would give the federal government access to the enterprise version of ChatGPT for just $1 through the next year. A day later, Apple CEO Tim Cook presented Trump with an engraved gift as he announced that the company would expand its domestic investments. (But as CNBC's Kif Leswing reports, Cook has so far avoided making the ultimate concession: a fully made-in-America iPhone.) Most recently, a government agency on Thursday said Amazon's cloud business agreed to give the government as much as $1 billion in discounts through 2028. Speaking of OpenAI, CEO Sam Altman will join CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" in the 8 a.m. ET hour to discuss the launch of the company's GPT-5 model. Watch CNBC live here.\n3. Critical Intel\nWhile those tech companies raced to curry favor with the Trump administration, Intel's CEO got a public shaming. Trump said in a Truth Social post Thursday morning that CEO Lip-Bu Tan is \"highly CONFLICTED\" and \"must resign, immediately.\" The president gave no explanation in his post, but Trump's comments follow a report that Sen. Tom Cotton sent a letter to Intel's board chair questioning Tan's ties to Chinese companies. Trump's reprimand comes just months into Tan's tenure at Intel's helm. The former CEO of Cadence Design Systems was brought in as the company looks to reverse its trend of declining sales. Shares slid more than 3% in Thursday's session, further sinking the stock amid an already-tough quarter. Follow live markets updates here.\n4. Crocs' stomping\nRubber is meeting the road for Crocs, the maker of those clog-themed shoes. Shares lost more than 29% of their value in Thursday's session, marking their worst day in 14 years. Driving the sell-off was the shoemaker's poor outlook: The Colorado-based company caught Wall Street off guard by sharing expectations for a year-over-year revenue decline of 9% to 11% in the current quarter. Investment firm Baird called the guidance \"disappointing,\" while Needham said the company is facing a \"dramatic deterioration of trends\" in the back half of 2025.\n5. RTO gains steam\nIs work from home so last-year? New data expected next week from CRBE shows that's increasingly the case, CNBC's Diana Olick reports. Companies are tracking and enforcing office attendance at the highest level since 2020, according to the forthcoming survey. On average, firms surveyed said they wanted employees in office 3.2 days per week.

According to Dodge, it provides more than 6 million potential combinations for customization through multiple wheel choices, interior seat colors, seat belt colors, and exterior colors and designs. It can also be customized to include seating for five, six or seven passengers.\nThe second new vehicle is the 2026 Charger Scat Pack, featuring a Sixpack twin-turbo inline-six engine. The Charger will be available in a high-output, 550-horsepower option, as well as a standard-output, 420-horsepower variant — called the Charger R\/T. It will also be available as a two-door coupe or four-door sedan.\n\"This next generation Charger lineup delivers the most horsepower and most torque of any muscle car in its class, the widest body of any car in the industry, an award-winning interior, and, perhaps most important, what our customers have told us they want: the power to choose what fuels them,\" said Dodge CEO Matt McAlear in a statement.\nThe launches come as Stellantis has been trying to recover from financial issues. New CEO Antonio Filosa last week on the automaker's earnings call teased that the company would be bringing back popular nameplates that had been discontinued in the U.S. and launching new products in an effort to reconnect with customers.\nThe announcement adds the Jailbreak customization feature to Dodge's previously announced 2026 model year Durango lineup. It also builds on the existing Charger lineup, which includes all-electric offerings through the Charger Daytona. The new muscle cars join Dodge's offerings one day before the 10th anniversary of the automaker's \"Roadkill Nights\" drag racing event, which attracts tens of thousands of people in Pontiac, Michigan.\nMcAlear said during the media event that U.S. sales for the existing Durango rose more than 50% from the first quarter of 2025 to the second quarter. Retail sales for the Durango were up 47% over the first half of 2024, he added.\n'It's about choice'\nMcAlear told reporters last week that the 2026 lineup is meant to meet customers where they are and meet the demands of the market at large.\n\"It's all about options and giving every customer what they need and a configuration they want. It's about choice,\" McAlear said at a media event last week.\nDodge's lineup build-out comes as automakers are grappling with changing policies surrounding electric vehicles under the Trump administration.\nMcAlear said several months ago, he believed there would be about a 30% industry-wide EV mix. But now, given changing EV policies, he said he doesn't see that number being higher than 20% for a while.\n\"While regulatory standards will always move and attitudes around EVs will continue to evolve, we know one thing that doesn't change: people's desire for performance,\" McAlear said during the media event.\nIn terms of pricing, the 420-horsepower Charger R\/T will be available starting at $49,995. The 550-horsepower Charger Scat Pack will cost $54,995, while the all-electric two-door Charger Scat Pack has a price tag of $59,995.\nDodge is putting together pricing for the SRT Hellcat and the Jailbreak customization access, McAlear said.\nOrdering will open this month for some options, but Dodge said other customizations will become available in the first half of 2026.","content_hash":"1a89c9d6ff6ace08479cb8603bd8704d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3534,"method_rank":0}

The change also comes days after Trump's sprawling new tariffs took effect, and a month after the president signed several tax cuts and changes to the tax code into law.\nLong confirmed to NBC News that he is leaving the job.\n\"It is a honor to serve my friend President Trump, and I am excited to take on my new role as the ambassador to Iceland. I am thrilled to answer his call to service and deeply committed to advancing his bold agenda. Exciting times ahead!\" Long said in a text message to NBC News.\nBessent will become the sixth person this year to oversee the critical agency under Trump. Danny Werfel, who was nominated to the role by President Joe Biden, also held the job until Trump's inauguration in January.\nThe temporary appointment adds to Bessent's long list of tasks such as managing trade talks with China, Canada and Mexico as well as other countries that are still trying to negotiate tariff rates. Bessent is also currently helping with the search for the next Federal Reserve chair. The IRS is part of the Treasury Department.\nUnder the Trump administration, the IRS has faced sweeping job cuts as part of a push by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\nA Treasury Department spokesperson declined to comment.\nBefore being confirmed by the Senate to run the IRS, Long was a congressman from Missouri from 2011 until 2023. Before serving in Congress, he was an auctioneer.\nOne day before his removal, Long sent all IRS employees an email saying, \"Please enjoy a 70-minute early exit tomorrow. That way you'll be rested for my 70th birthday on Monday,\" The New York Times reported.\nInternal vs. \"external\" revenue\nTrump's government is shaking up how the nation collects revenue. The United States is now collecting billions of dollars more in tariff revenue every month due Trump's new import taxes. So far this year, importers, which include small and large U.S. businesses, have paid more than $100 billion in customs duties to the U.S. government.\nTrump has long promised to set up an \"external revenue service\" for collecting those tariff revenues but the task still falls to the Treasury Department and Customs and Border Protection, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security.\nLast month, Trump signed into law his \"big, beautiful bill,\" which includes sweeping tax cuts, spending initiatives and service cuts. The Senate passed the contentious bill thanks to Vice President JD Vance's tiebreaker.\nThe law extends the expiring tax cuts he enacted in his first term, in 2017, while temporarily slashing taxes on tips and overtime pay and allowing deductions on auto loan interest payments. It also includes hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending on the military and on carrying out Trump's mass deportation plans.\nRepublicans battled over how much they should cut federal safety net programs in the spending bill as well as how much to raise the deduction cap on state and local taxes, or SALT.\nThe legislation is projected to increase the national debt by $3.3 trillion over 10 years and lead to more than 11 million people losing health insurance coverage due to Medicaid cuts and other provisions.","content_hash":"929dc6d5ac0df09a4f82d49ffc3578e6","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3438,"method_rank":0}

Keep reading to find out which tax cuts are temporary and how to maximize the savings while they last.\n4 Trump Tax Cuts Set To Expire in 2028\nThe OBBBA includes provisions for some temporary federal income tax cuts. All are retroactive to Jan. 1, 2025. While the cuts don’t apply to payroll tax, you can claim them whether you take the standard deduction or itemize.\nCheck Out: 8 Ways Trump’s ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ Could Offer Tax Relief\nNo Tax on Tips\nThe OBBBA lets tipped workers in certain industries deduct up to $25,000 in tips from their taxable income. The deduction phases out for taxpayers who have a modified adjusted gross income of $150,000 ($300,000 for joint filers).\nNo Tax on Overtime\nIf you receive qualified overtime pay, you’re allowed to deduct up to $12,500 of it ($25,000 for joint filers) from your taxable income under the OBBBA. This cut phases out at $150,000 ($300,000 for joint filers) in modified adjusted gross income.\nNo Tax on Car Loan Interest\nThe OBBBA deduction for car loan interest applies to loans used to purchase a new car, minivan, van, SUV, pickup truck or motorcycle. To qualify, the vehicle’s final assembly must’ve occurred in the U.S. The deduction phases out after $100,000 ($200,000 for joint filers) in modified adjusted gross income.\nDeduction for Seniors\nSeniors ages 65 and older get up to a $6,000 deduction ($12,000 for joint filers) under the OBBBA. The deduction phases out once your modified adjusted gross income exceeds $75,000 ($150,000 for joint filers).\nHow To Maximize Your Savings Before the Tax Cuts Expire\nWhile these cuts are not permanent, their tax savings can go a long way if you make good use of the money. Here are a few things you could consider doing with the savings.\n-\nPay down debt: You can make a nice dent in your credit card balances by using your tax savings to make extra payments each time you get paid. A popular debt payoff strategy is to start with the account that has the highest interest rate.\n-\nBulk up your emergency savings: An emergency savings account is your best defense against having to use a credit card or high-interest loan to cover an unexpected expense. Fidelity suggests starting with a $1,000 savings goal, then working toward saving enough to cover three to six months’ worth of living expenses.\n-\nMax out retirement account contributions: Start with your 401(k) if your employer matches your contributions. If you don’t have one or already get the full employer match, consider contributing to an individual retirement account — or, if you have an eligible health insurance plan, a health savings account.\n-\nSave for when the tax cuts end: The sudden decrease in take-home pay might throw your budget off. Having a little extra saved will help ease you through the transition. Keep this money separate from your emergency savings.","content_hash":"958df9c1c4ae3a94df2df3a3c3679d80","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3390,"method_rank":0}

Following Friday's trade, Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust will own 490 shares of TXRH, increasing its weighting to about 2.35% from 2.17%. We're buying the post-earnings pullback in Texas Roadhouse, adding back half the 80 shares we sold around $190 in May, and upgrading our rating to 1. The steakhouse chain reported mixed second-quarter results after Thursday's closing bell. There was a ton to like in the results, with comparable sales accelerating from the first quarter to 5.8% in the second quarter, with traffic accounting for most of the increase. The third quarter is also off to a great start with comps up 5.3% through its first five weeks. The only issue with the quarter was costs out of the company's control. Rising prices forced the company to increase its commodity cost inflation outlook again, pressuring restaurant margins. Analysts lowered their earnings per share (EPS) forecasts for 2025 and 2026 as a result, and negative earnings revisions are why the stock is getting hit on Friday. TXRH YTD mountain Texas Roadhouse YTD Beef inflation is a problem — there's no getting around that — but the commodity won't increase in perpetuity. The cure for higher prices is higher prices — and at some level, consumers will seek alternatives, and there will be a big push next year to increase cattle herds to capitalize on the commodity strength. Now that the company has reduced expectations — and the stock has adjusted as a result — the attention should shift back to the strong same-store sales. Texas Roadhouse's outperformance in this metric indicates the brand is loved, and there are no issues getting people to dine in their restaurants despite strategic menu price increases and economic uncertainty. There aren't a lot of restaurant companies of Texas Roadhouse size delivering consistent mid-single-digit comp growth. Lastly, the company wasn't that aggressive with its share buyback program in the second quarter. They'd rather use that cash to buy franchise locations. Plus, it sounds like the company is preparing for an accelerated unit growth expansion program in 2026. The historical cadence is about 30 new company-owned locations per year, but management's comments suggest that next year's number could be in the high 30s. This was a great thing to learn. Even with these expansion plans, we still anticipate management will be more opportunistic with the buyback this quarter, given the stock's current levels, much like how they were buyers around here in the first quarter.

Ultimately, Beyond took an ownership stake in Kirkland's Inc., a home decor chain with around 300 stores across the U.S., and gave it the exclusive license to develop and create Bed Bath & Beyond Home stores, as well as Buy Buy Baby stores.\nKirkland's later rebranded to The Brand House Collective and plans to convert some of its existing Kirkland's Home stores into more Bed Bath and Beyond shops. Friday's launch in Nashville is the first of six planned for the market and, pending the results, it plans to convert around 75 additional stores through 2026.\nThe company said it chose Nashville for the launch because of its proximity to its corporate headquarters, which will allow it to \"closely manage every detail and set the standard for future rollouts.\"\nWhile the relaunch is exciting for fans of the legacy brand, it comes at a difficult time for the home decor market. In many ways, Bed Bath & Beyond's bankruptcy was the fault of its management team and execution missteps, but it also faced macro challenges as well, experts said at the time. Competition from players like Amazon, Walmart, Home Goods and Wayfair has made it harder for other brands to capture customer spend, and the overall sector has been soft for several years because of high interest rates and the sluggish housing market.\nEven the current leaders in the home decor space have seen soft trends and it's unlikely that will change until interest rates fall and the housing market picks back up, some analysts have said.","content_hash":"57058f8f2ce6f0651deb3f01e56a9cca","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3326,"method_rank":0}

Miran will hold that seat for a few months until the Jan. 31 term expires while the president looks for a different candidate to nominate for a full 14-year term as Fed governor.\nBut how will the nomination impact the central bank and the decisions it makes on setting interest rates? Here are three things you need to know about Miran’s views and what they could mean for the Fed.\nMiran wants lower interest rates\nMiran, who criticized the Fed last fall for cutting rates, warning that lower rates could perpetuate inflation further, is now in favor of cutting rates.\nMiran, who holds a PhD in economics from Harvard University, believes that the Trump administration’s policies, from immigration to trade and deregulation, which he has helped create, are disinflationary. This contrasts with many on the Fed who believe the president’s tariffs could lead to higher inflation. If the Senate were to confirm Miran in time for the Sept. 16-17 policy meeting and the full committee is not convinced to lower rates at that time, Miran would likely dissent in favor of cutting rates. That would mark three on the committee who could dissent: Fed governors Chris Waller and Michelle Bowman both dissented at the July policy meeting, preferring to lower rates by 25 basis points.\nRead more: How the Fed rate decision affects your bank accounts, loans, credit cards, and investments\nMiran's 'Mar-a-Lago Accord' favors a weaker dollar\nMiran favors a weaker dollar as a way to offset higher inflation from tariffs while also increasing exports, narrowing the trade deficit, and boosting growth. He is the author of what he dubbed the \"Mar-a-Lago Accord,\" a reference to the 1985 Plaza Accord that succeeded in depreciating the dollar's value. The Mar-a-Lago Accord seeks to devalue the dollar while retaining the greenback as the world’s reserve currency. As one who favors a weaker dollar, Miran favors lower interest rates, which could lead to a weaker dollar if US rates are lower than the interest rates of other central banks around the world. The president has pushed for a 3 percentage point drop in the Fed’s benchmark policy rate. Investors will watch for how much Miran will push for the policy rate to drop if confirmed.\nMiran wants a less independent Fed\nMiran has advocated for major changes to the Fed. In a paper co-authored in 2024 with the now chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Miran called for an overhaul of the central bank by Congress that would give the White House more control over firing Fed governors, as well as not allowing Fed governors to serve in the executive branch for four years following their term as governor. He also argued for subjecting the Fed’s independent budget to congressional appropriations. The proposals for allowing the president to dismiss Fed officials at will have stirred fears that the move could politicize the central bank and push the Fed to make policy according to the whims of the political cycle and not the economic cycle.","content_hash":"d3dfa625cedc678dc257934c72f0f2a9","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3280,"method_rank":0}

The company's ridesharing performance indicators as well as EBITDA and free cash flow margins reached all-time highs, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n-\nBofA upgraded CommScope (COMM) to Buy from Underperform with a price target of $20, up from $4, following its decision to sell CCS, its flagship segment, to Amphenol (APH). CommScope has been making progress with paying down debt over the past few quarters and the CCS sale is another step in the company's breakup, designed to eliminate the risk of default and expose the sum-of-parts value, the firm tells investors.\n-\nBaird upgraded Fastenal (FAST) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $55, up from $47. The firm believes the market is underestimating the company's earnings power.\n-\nPiper Sandler upgraded HubSpot (HUBS) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $675, up from $645. The company's Q2 report was \"better-than-feared\" with a sales beat against a backdrop of negative investor sentiment, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n-\nStifel upgraded ESAB (ESAB) to Buy from Hold with an unchanged price target of $141.

While the company's second half of 2025 billings guidance was raised by one point to 15% year-over-year, the current refresh cycle at 50% attainment creates uncertainty of core appliance growth once the cycle is complete in 4-6 quarters, the firm tells investors in a research note. Rosenblatt, KeyBanc and Piper Sandler also downgraded Fortinet to Neutral-equivalent ratings.\n-\nMorgan Stanley downgraded Caterpillar (CAT) to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $350, up from $283. While the quarter contained some clear positives, the negatives indicate a \"steady deterioration\" in Caterpillar's fundamentals and skew the stock's risk to the downside, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n-\nCiti downgraded Opendoor Technologies (OPEN) to Sell from Neutral with a price target of 70c, down from 80c. The firm cites its significantly reduced sales estimates, the 250% rally in the shares since July 1, and slowing home purchase and resell activity for the downgrade.\n-\nJefferies downgraded Six Flags (FUN) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $25, down from $41.

Negotiations, of course, will keep happening, and countries could see some reprieve.\nRemember, Trump walked back on \"Liberation Day\" tariffs a week after all the pomp and ceremony in the Rose Garden, and the July 9 deadline was pushed to Aug. 1, and then to Aug. 7.

Former House Speaker Paul Ryan told CNBC this week that the Supreme Court could end up disqualifying the duties that have been ordered under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act enacted by Congress in 1977.\n\"If they were going to rule against the wealth, strength, and power of America, they should have done so LONG AGO, at the beginning of the case, where our entire Country, while never having a chance at this kind of GREATNESS again, would not have been put in 1929 style jeopardy,\" Trump said of the courts' potential actions around tariffs. \"There is no way America could recover from such a judicial tragedy.\"\nLegal challenges to the imposition of higher U.S. tariffs by the White House have centered on arguments that they may exceed emergency powers granted to the President by Congress in the 1970s. However, Alan Wolff, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said in a report this week that these levies being struck down would lead to a \"massive amount of red tape\" around who would receive refunds.\n\"This is a bell that cannot easily be fully unrung,\" Wolff said.\nMarket impact\nTrump said the tariffs have had a \"huge positive impact\" on the stock market. Markets this year have appeared to respond positively whenever the White House has dialed back on tariffs, and have reacted negatively when Trump has pressed the case for higher duties on imports to the U.S.\nFor example, when Trump suspended the initial \"liberation day\" tariffs in early April for the next 90 days, the Nasdaq Composite soared 7% in just a few minutes, with other major market averages also posting large gains that week. Since then, the market has seen specific sectors jump whenever Trump backed off targeted threats, such as those against semiconductor imports. Companies such as AMD and Marvell, as well as Apple, then posted solid gains with the duties granting broad exemptions to any company that announces plans to add manufacturing in the U.S.\nThe rallies, however, have often proven short-lived as the president has frequently changed gears on his tariff rhetoric.

The company says it produces about 12,000 bikes per week, a manufacturing feat that has become increasingly uncommon in the U.S.\n\"All the way back to World War II era, pretty much every bike sold in the United States was made in the U.S.,\" said Guardian Bikes co-founder and CEO Brian Riley. \"By the time you get to the '70s, '80s, '90s, it all evaporated.\"\nOver the last four decades, many American factories have shut down as production moved overseas in search of cheaper labor and larger supplier networks. Between 1997 and 2023 the number of U.S. manufacturing firms and plants dropped by 25% as global trade barriers fell, according to the World Resources Institute.\nNow, as companies like Apple, IBM and Johnson & Johnson pledge billions towards U.S. manufacturing and politicians call for reshoring, Guardian offers a glimpse into the possibilities and difficulties of being \"Made in America.\"\n\"It wasn't easy,\" said Riley. \"It even took kind of getting into losing money for a little bit.\"\nGuardian Bikes used to rely on a Chinese original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to build its product based on specifications provided by Guardian. But long shipping times and quality concerns prompted a pivot.\nStarting in 2022, Guardian opened its own plant in the Midwest with the help of $19 million in financing from JPMorgan. Riley said the higher cost of producing domestically is offset by automation, lower inventory costs, and in some cases, tariffs.\n\"With the most recent tariff environment, we're starting to get either cost parity or in some cases, the domestic parts are cheaper than what you can get out of China,\" said Riley.\nBut building a domestic supply chain from scratch isn't easy. Many parts, like bicycle chains and reflectors, are no longer made in the U.S. at scale.\nExperts say finding input suppliers is one of many challenges companies face in bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. Meanwhile, countries like China and Vietnam have become manufacturing powerhouses, investing billions more in factories and training.\nEven with new tariffs and federal subsidies under the CHIPS Act, some economists remain skeptical of a true U.S. \"manufacturing renaissance.\"\n\"Think about how much a pair of sneakers would cost if they were made here in the United States, or a phone or any number of the items that you go to a retail store to purchase.

Everyone is talking about AI. Earlier this week, we hosted a dinner with 17 CFOs from some of the world’s largest companies, where they talked about how they’re using AI in their jobs. Some are using it to highlight how different words are likely to impact sentiment on earnings calls, based on historical data. Many use it to create scenarios around earnings projections against the vagaries of tariffs, policy shifts, technology investments and more. They’re creating hyper-personalized data sets and go-to-market strategies that not only use AI agents but tailor interactions to customers’ AI agents. I also learned about their strategies for embedding AI knowledge throughout their organizations, from top-down learning to metrics for getting promoted into the senior ranks. And while most are not yet cutting jobs in response to AI, they’re also not adding to their overall headcount.\nThe dinner, sponsored by Deloitte and ServiceNow, was conducted under the Chatham House rule to encourage conversation by sharing highlights anonymously. But during my on-the-record chat with economist Rebecca Patterson, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former chief investment strategist at Bridgewater Associates, we heard about the impact of a shift in fiscal policy. “It’s not just the fact that Congress ignored the Congressional Budget Office and historical norms in enacting the reconciliation bill,” she noted. “It’s also the size of the increase to future deficits at a time when the economy has been growing above its long-term potential. I thought we would see some fiscal hawks push back more and water down the ultimate bill, or that there would be a longer fight. I was wrong.”\nPatterson also said she expects policies under the Trump Administration to “lean towards” structurally higher inflation. And she talked about the continued strength of the U.S. relative to other economies and the transformative impact of AI.\nInsights from leaders on the front lines are critical in shaping the themes of this column and underscore the unique role that Fortune plays in convening and creating connections. Next up is Brainstorm Tech, which Andrew Nusca will lead on Sept. 8 to 10 in Park City, Utah. One Strategy Group CEO David Meadvin told me yesterday that “there’s nowhere better for genuine relationship building.” I believe him.

Bloomberg first reported on Bannon's departure, and added that Musk ordered his team to shut down, with engineers in the group getting reassigned to other initiatives.\nTesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nSince early last year, Musk has been trying to convince shareholders that Tesla, his only publicly traded business, is poised to become an an artificial intelligence and robotics powerhouse, and not just an electric vehicle company.\nA centerpiece of the transformation was Dojo, a custom-built supercomputer designed to process and train AI models drawing on the large amounts of video and other data captured by Tesla vehicles.\nTesla's focus on Dojo and another computing cluster called Cortex were meant to improve the company's advanced driver assistance systems, and to enable Musk to finally deliver on his promise to turn existing Teslas into robotaxis.\nOn Tesla's earnings call in July, Musk said the company expected its newest version of Dojo to be \"operating at scale sometime next year, with scale being somewhere around 100,000 H-100 equivalents,\" referring to a supercomputer built using Nvidia's state of the art chips.\nTesla recently struck a $16.5 billion deal with Samsung to produce more of its own A16 chips with the company domestically.\nTesla is running a test Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, and a related car service in San Francisco. In Austin, the company's vehicles require a human safety supervisor in the front passenger seat ready to intervene if necessary. In San Francisco, the car service is operated by human drivers, though invited users can hail a ride through a \"Tesla Robotaxi\" app.\nOn the earnings call, Musk faced questions about how he sees Tesla and his AI company, xAI, keeping their distance given that they could be competing against one another for AI talent.\nMusk said the companies \"are doing different things.\" He said, \"xAI is doing like terabyte scale models and multi-terabyte scale models.\" Tesla uses \"100x smaller models,\" he said, with the automaker focused on \"real-world AI,\" for its cars and robots and xAI focused on developing software that strives for \"artificial super intelligence.\"\nMusk also said that some engineers wouldn't join Tesla because \"they wanted to work on AGI,\" one reason he said he formed a new company.\nTesla has experienced an exodus of top talent this year due to a combination of job terminations and resignations.

Crypto proponents estimate that even an “extremely conservative” allocation of 0.5% to 2% of new 401(k) contributions flowing into cryptocurrency could generate billions in additional demand. The math is compelling: with millions of workers potentially directing 1%-10% of their paychecks, plus employer matches, into crypto-enabled retirement plans, the market could see what supporters call a “monster catalyst.”\nDon't Miss:\n-\nTrade crypto futures on Plus500 with up to $200 in bonuses — no wallets, just price speculation and free paper trading to practice different strategies.\n-\nGrow your IRA or 401(k) with Crypto – unlock the power of alternative investments including a Crypto IRA within your retirement account.\nAlthough crypto is a small part of the 401(k) plan market, it could grow substantially in 2025. The regulatory shift comes at a time when Bitcoin ETFs like the iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT) have already demonstrated massive institutional appetite, with the most popular fund ballooning to over $50 billion in total assets.\nThe Employer Bottleneck Reality\nHowever, regulatory approval represents just the first hurdle. The real challenge lies with America’s risk-averse employers and plan administrators. Many fiduciaries are disinclined to include crypto in plan line-ups on the basis that some of them may have high volatility and risk profiles, creating a significant bottleneck between policy and practice.\nAs of mid-2025, only five employers had adopted private market offerings with crypto allocations, typically ranging between 5% and 20% of portfolios. This glacial adoption rate highlights a critical disconnect between regulatory possibility and workplace reality. Companies remain hesitant to shoulder potential liability for employee losses, particularly given crypto’s notorious volatility that can produce 50% swings.\nMany employer-sponsored plans currently maintain restricted investment menus, often limited to mutual funds or excluding individual ETFs entirely. For plans that don’t currently allow spot ETFs, the leap to “raw crypto” becomes even more unlikely. This structural conservatism could severely limit crypto’s penetration, even in a more permissive regulatory environment.","content_hash":"4a897a552a3b83732b706080676fba7b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2864,"method_rank":0}

Claire's is also facing a $500 million loan that's due in December 2026, Bloomberg reported. It also decided to defer interest payments on its debt to help preserve capital.\nIn better times, the store targeted a younger demographic with a wide selection of affordable jewelry, hair accessories and beauty products. Today, the retailer, which sources from China, is facing higher import costs due to President Trump's tariffs. Consumers are also curbing their spending in response to the current economic climate.\nUs Retail Closures Hit Highest Level Since Pandemic\nOne of the company's other core challenges, according to Foss, is that its target demographic \"is notoriously fickle and heavily influenced by the trends they are seeing online, leaving some of the mall mainstays like Claire’s or Forever 21 struggling to keep up with the changing trends and preferences of its customer base.\"\nClaire's first filed for bankruptcy protection in March 2018\/ Elliott and Monarch took control of the retailer when it emerged later that year.\nFoss said a bankruptcy filing can be a good option for a struggling retail chain as it allows a company to refocus, trim its debt and slim down its retail footprint, but \"retailers that have emerged from Chapter 11 only to file again a few years later often find themselves liquidating and shutting their doors entirely, with some kind of online presence remaining.\"\nHowever, the company still hasn't filed a document outlining its proposed path in bankruptcy.\nThe company operates under two brand names: Claire’s and ICING. There are more than 2,750 Claire’s stores in 17 countries throughout North America and Europe and 190 ICING stores in North America. There are more than 300 franchised Claire’s stores, located primarily in the Middle East and South Africa. Claire's products are also sold in thousands of concessions locations in North America and Europe, according to its website.","content_hash":"ed64f65ec45f4f319bf18bd886fa7bd9","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2858,"method_rank":0}

The latest round of funding also included an $18 million growth investment from last year led by BlackRock, and comes as advisors are increasingly interested in using private market allocations in model portfolios — especially for mass affluent clients, who historically haven’t had access to alternatives.\nThe Chicago-based company, which currently works with about 200 RIAs and has $32 billion in client assets under administration, will use the funding for product development and new hires while also putting some toward its recently completed acquisition of the TAMP assets from Freedom Advisors. “Advisors are seeking turnkey access to private markets,” GeoWealth CEO Colin Falls said in a statement.\nREAD ALSO: Vanguard’s Joe Davis on AI and the ‘Second Half of the Chessboard’ and VOO Becomes First ETF to Top $700 Billion in Assets\nStrike a Pose\nModel portfolios were designed to take some of the thinking out of asset allocation, offering clients pre-built investing strategies based on their goals and risk levels. “Clients often feel overwhelmed by the sheer multitude of investment options,” said Sam Mockford, a CFP at Citrine Capital. “When it comes time to rebalance, if I did not have a recipe to follow, I could fall prey to recency bias, herd mentality, etc., and harm my clients in the long-term.”\nModel portfolios’ popularity among advisors is showing no signs of slowing.

The bad news is that's $4,200 less when compared to a year ago, according to global data and technology company Cotality. However, this will strongly depend on where you live.\n\"At the peak of home price gains, annual equity increases surged to as much as $55,000. However, with price increases slowing considerably and appreciation remaining sluggish, home equity is unlikely to accumulate at the same pace as it did during the pandemic, or even pre-pandemic, when annual gains averaged about $11,000,\" Cotality Chief Economist Slema Hepp said in a statement accompanying Cotality's Homeowner Equity Report for Q1, noting that the decline could point to homeowners using their equity for other things.\nDon't Miss:\n-\nThe same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90\/share.\n-\n‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones.

The Northeast is seeing a particular rise in home prices, which leads to higher equity. Homeowners in Rhode Island have the highest year-over-year equity boost at $36,500, and New Jersey is close behind at $35,700. In New York City, homeowners are enjoying an average of $20,600 equity boost while Boston dwellers have an average of $25,200 gain.\nStill, 27 states have seen an annual equity loss in Q1. Hawaii is dealing with the highest, which sank $65,900, followed by Washington, D.C. which dropped $29,600 and Florida, which fell by $26,300.

Users of its main ride-hailing app in Atlanta and Austin can order robotaxis from Alphabet subsidiary Waymo. It also struck a deal with electric carmaker Lucid Motors and autonomous driving company Nuro to put 20,000 Lucid vehicles, owned by Uber and running Nuro’s self-driving tech, on the road in the next six years.\nSpeaking on the company’s second-quarter earnings call Wednesday, Khosrowshahi raised Uber’s publicly stated ambitions. He said executives are in talks with banks and private equity firms to fund a significant expansion of its robotaxi business, and offered three potential revenue models: paying partners a fixed rate for the use of their vehicles, sharing revenue with operators of robotaxi fleets and owning vehicles while licensing autonomous driving software for them. “Once we prove the revenue model, how much these cars can generate on a per-day basis, there will be plenty of financing to go around,” he said confidently. In the interim, Khosrowshahi has smaller plans:\n-\nUber said it will dedicate a “modest” amount of its $7 billion in annual cash flows to fund robotaxi deployments, and could sell minority stakes in companies to finance further expansion. Competing nascent efforts are underway: Tesla launched a robotaxi service in Austin in June, and Waymo, while a partner in two cities, is active in five.\n-\nUber posted a better-than-expected revenue increase of 18% in the second quarter on Wednesday and unveiled a $20 billion share buyback plan as it offered an upbeat outlook for the third quarter. Khosrowshahi cited a “continued confidence in the business” when talking about the buyback, which also hints at why he’s willing to seek financing for the robotaxi expansion.\nReasonably Robotic: On the earnings call, Uber said there has been no dip in demand in cities where robotaxi services have launched. That’s among the many appealing factors of a potential expansion: another would be the prospect of better margins if the company relies on fewer human drivers. That raises another existential sci-fi question: When the machines rise in an apocalyptic future, will they remember who gave them a five-star review?\nThis post first appeared on The Daily Upside.

Delis faces eight charges, and Tsalikidis has been charged with 12 offenses, including aiding and abetting the others.\nAlthough ASIC is not alleging that the men operated the scam themselves, it says the group played a key role in processing victim funds. Those funds were allegedly transferred from Australian bank accounts to offshore accounts or converted into cryptocurrency.\nThe case underscores how investment scams are costing ordinary Australians hundreds of millions in lost savings every year. So far in 2025, Scamwatch has received more than 90,000 scam reports, amounting to roughly $98 million (Australian $147 million) in reported losses. Around half of those involved investment fraud.\nIn 2024, Australians lost nearly $213 million, or Australian $319 million, to scams, with fake investment schemes consistently ranking as the most damaging.\nThe specific scam in which the four men were charged Thursday used fake comparison websites and Facebook ads to lure victims. Investors were contacted by phone or email and sent high-quality fake prospectuses that closely mimicked materials from real financial services firms.\nASIC Issues Warning Over Bitget's 'Unlicensed' Crypto Futures Products in Australia\nThe phony products promised fixed returns between 4.5% and 9.5% over one to ten years.\nASIC has not disclosed how much money was allegedly laundered in this case or how many victims were affected, and did not respond to a request from Decrypt for clarification. The matter is scheduled for a committal mention on October 30, 2025.\nIt follows a string of recent enforcement actions by the regulator. Among them, Brendan Gunn, brother of Olympic breakdancer Rachel \"Raygun\" Gunn, was charged in March with one count of dealing with suspected proceeds of crime related to crypto fraud.\nASIC has also issued warnings to crypto ATM operators over rising fraud and money laundering risks, signaling a broader crackdown as financial crimes surge across digital platforms.","content_hash":"f9da52541843e8bef93b7ba4601fe09a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2801,"method_rank":0}

And millions of Americans are feeling the weight: The Education Data Initiative says more than 42 million borrowers owe a staggering $1.77 trillion dollars in student loan debt, with the average individual balance topping $38,000.\nMany of those borrowers may soon see their monthly payments go up, thanks to a section of President Trump's “One Big, Beautiful Bill” that includes changes to current student loan repayment plans.\nHere’s what you need to know about the President’s new repayment process.\nDon't miss\n-\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n-\nI'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast)\n-\nRobert Kiyosaki warns of a 'Greater Depression' coming to the US — with millions of Americans going poor. But he says these 2 'easy-money' assets will bring in ‘great wealth’. How to get in now\nWhat are my new options?\nAfter July 1, 2026, new borrowers will have two choices: A standard fixed repayment plan or the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP).\nRAP is an income-based student loan repayment plan that the Trump administration says will simplify the loan repayment process, as it will replace all preexisting income-based plans for new borrowers, such as SAVE, PAYE, REPAYE and ICR.\nRAP, however, is a little less forgiving than the current income-based repayment plan. Your monthly payments will now be estimated based on your adjusted gross income (AGI), which is your total earnings before taxes after certain deductions. Additionally, RAP will no longer cap your payments at a portion of your discretionary income, and monthly payments can range from 1% to 10% of your AGI.\nPlus, if you were expecting loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years with the usual IBR plan or after 10 years with Public Service Loan Forgiveness, you need to know that RAP will have a 30-year timeline.\nAnd you may not be able to use RAP to fund your entire education, either. In the administration’s efforts to combat the rising costs of college, Trump has lowered lifetime borrowing limits, hoping that if students can’t take on the whole cost with loans, schools will lower tuition prices. Under RAP, Parent PLUS loans have a limit of $65,000 per child, and graduate students have a lowered limit of $100,000.\nNote that while all new borrowers are required to enroll in either RAP or the standard fixed plan after July 1, 2026, current borrowers can remain on the present income-based repayment plan.","content_hash":"6cf7cb0be27536feee6257c943fb4bff","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2800,"method_rank":0}

What it ended up being was a blow for many stocks, reminiscent of the COVID lows that occurred back in March 2020. Like buying stocks amid that panic, investors who bought back in April have enjoyed some fantastic returns.\nThree stocks that have been among the biggest winners since the Liberation Day tariffs were announced are Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ: HOOD), Rocket Lab Corporation (NASDAQ: RKLB), and Opendoor Technologies (NASDAQ: OPEN). Here's a look at how they've performed and whether they are still good buys. The following returns are as of the close on Aug. 4.\nRobinhood Markets: Up 152%\nFintech stock Robinhood fell to less than $40 a share shortly after Liberation Day. But as tariffs were paused and negotiations have been taking place, investor sentiment has rebounded, and shares of the popular trading platform have soared since then.\nRobinhood's trading platform is popular with retail investors, and it's often a good gauge of just how much excitement is in the stock market. It has also been experiencing some terrific growth due to that bullishness.\nOn July 30, the company reported second-quarter results, and revenue rose 45% year over year, totaling $989 million. Its net income also more than doubled to $386 million. The company has launched tokenization, which Chief Executive Officer Vlad Tenev calls \"the biggest innovation our industry has seen in the past decade.\" It's currently only available in Europe, but it lets investors hold stock tokens via the blockchain, giving investors greater access to the markets with no commissions.\nRobinhood's focus on innovating and catering to retail investors makes it a compelling growth stock to own. It is expensive, however, trading at more than 50 times trailing earnings. But for the growth potential it possesses, the premium may be justifiable. If you're willing to buy and hold for years, it may not be too late to buy the stock.\nRocket Lab: Up 145%\nIn early April, Rocket Lab stock was trading below $20; as of Monday's close, it was closing in on $45. Rocket Lab is in the business of sending rockets into space, with 68 launches of its Electron rocket under its belt already. A big catalyst may still be waiting in the wings if Rocket Lab's larger Neutron rocket makes a successful debut later this year. That larger rocket can take on bigger payloads and result in greater growth opportunities and missions for the company in the future.","content_hash":"3a8cd456c1e0d04ad8fd98a6c0a9c6b6","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2796,"method_rank":0}

According to Wilson, more than half of the wins came from e-commerce sellers.\nWilson also highlighted what he called “outsized” growth in reverse logistics, which now represents over 10 percent of GXO’s current pipeline. Reverse logistics also accounts for a similar “high-single-digit, low-double-digit” percentage of revenue, according to Kristine Kubacki, GXO’s chief strategy officer.\nKubacki said the new e-commerce wins are driving the reverse logistics demand. The company is presently leveraging AI to enhancing reverse logistics capabilities and drive future growth opportunities.\n“About a third of e-commerce orders are returned on average, which really reflects the material drag on our customers’ margins,” Kubacki said. “We can help unlock with AI the opportunity to rapidly resell products and help our customers unlock further margins. We’re actually using that same tool that we’ve used on the inbound side around proactive replenishment on the back-end side for reverse logistics.”","content_hash":"5c1b10d1f6acf7c12f942237591f2457","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2791,"method_rank":0}

Overall, its topline came in at $2.25 billion, beating the Street’s expectations by a small margin.

The number of monthly active users on its PlayStation platform rose 6% from a year ago, alongside an increase in total hours played. That’s while the Sony Music segment logged a 5% revenue increase despite a hefty forex impact.\nThe Japanese entertainment group raised its operating income forecast for the year ending March to ¥1.33 trillion ($9 billion), up 4% and roughly in line with analyst estimates. Back in May, in the midst of uncertainty around Washington’s new import tax regime, Sony had warned its profit would take a ¥100 billion hit. Following Japan’s trade deal with the US, Sony said it now sees a tariff impact of around ¥70 billion. Shares in the company erased earlier losses to rise 4.1% in Tokyo on Thursday.\n“From the second quarter onward, we expect uncertainties such as US tariffs to become more pronounced, and we intend to proactively address these risks,” Chief Financial Officer Lin Tao said on a call after the release of the company’s fiscal first-quarter report. Sony is closely monitoring the situation and preparing with various scenarios in mind, she added.\nThe Japanese company produces image sensors used in Apple Inc.’s iPhone cameras and across the wider smartphone industry, which would be caught up in any additional levies on semiconductors. US President Donald Trump’s threat to impose a 100% tariff on chip imports and another possible levy on products containing them weighs on Sony and other hardware makers. The declared tariffs, if implemented, may force a rejig of supply chains with far-reaching implications for exporters.\nConfidence in Sony has been strengthened by resilient growth in the groups less likely to be caught up in export taxes. It plans to rein in costs and focus on profitability with the PlayStation group, which will release Ghost of Yōtei, a sequel to Sony’s hit game Ghost of Tsushima, in October.\n“The PlayStation business is performing quite well, and the number of PlayStation Plus subscribers is growing faster than expected, said Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda. “Additionally, the anime and smartphone game business has seen major hits and large-scale events, further fueling expectations for strong growth in this unit.”","content_hash":"315e3ff6341ad98d48157e70e9ebf131","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2762,"method_rank":0}

Subscribe to our free daily Nrn newsletter.\nMcDonald’s is showing signs of recovery from two rare negative quarters in Q4 and Q1. The company reported a second quarter same-store sales increase of 2.5% in the U.S. business before the market Wednesday, driven by the McCrispy Strips launch, the Minecraft Meals promotion, and “good progress on value offerings,” according to chief executive officer Chris Kempczinski.\n“Our $5 Meal Deal continues to resonate as we recently celebrated the one-year anniversary of the program,” he said during the company’s earnings call. “We’re also getting incrementality from our McValue platform.”\nChief financial officer Ian Borden added that the Minecraft promotion — the company’s largest global campaign ever — boosted guest counts in its more than 100 markets, with collectibles running out faster than anticipated.\nFurther, the McCrispy Strips launch in early May led to a “groundswell” in sales and higher levels of customer satisfaction, Borden said. It also laid the groundwork for the much-anticipated return of the Snack Wraps in early July, which has generated a positive consumer response.\nDespite these positive trends, executives remain wary about the general state of consumers, specifically low-income consumers, with whom the chain overindexes.\n“Overall, QSR traffic remained challenging and visits by low-income consumers declined by double-digits versus the prior-year period,” Kempczinski said. “Re-engaging low-income consumers is critical as they typically visit more frequently. This bifurcation is why we remain cautious about the near-term health of the consumer and will be agile about value offerings.”\nThe evolution of value continues\nThis agility was recently illustrated with the addition of the premium Daily Double Burger to the McValue platform. On that platform, there is just 8% of crossover between $5 Meal Deal customers and buy-one-get-one for $1 customers, which provides more room for adjustment.\n“We’re going after two very different occasions and users, but (McValue) is compelling to both,” Kempczinski said.\nThe company is also pushing strong value offerings through its MyMcDonald’s loyalty program. The program currently includes about 185 million 90-day active members globally, or about one-fourth of all guests, with a goal of reaching 250 million by 2027. Those members visit nearly three times more than non-members.\n“We have exceptional value and affordability scores among those (loyalty) consumers. You see an uptick in frequency when we have a loyal consumer, from 10 visits from those who are non-members to 26 visits with loyalty members,” Kempczinski said. “So, we feel good about loyalty and where we are with McValue.”","content_hash":"f5218506f3a33e5e7a7e516277b5aef3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2753,"method_rank":0}

And while the company didn't grow last quarter, it appears investors are more encouraged by new CEO Spencer Rascoff's turnaround plan.\nMatch beats expectations as management looks to turn around Tinder\nIn the second quarter, Match's revenue was flat year over year, which beat expectations, while earnings per share of $0.49 met expectations. Yet, the company also guided for revenue between $910 million and $920 million in the third quarter, which would mark a reacceleration to 2% to 3% growth.\nMatch Group has been in a severe funk since the end of 2021, and the stock had fallen more than 80% from its late-2021 highs as growth reversed to declines, especially at the company's largest app, Tinder.\nTinder is still under pressure, down 7% in the quarter, but Rascoff is optimistic on his turnaround plan for the app. Rascoff has streamlined Tinder's staff, laying off 20% of middle managers, reducing team size, introducing more artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, and speeding up the introduction of new features. While Tinder's revenue continues to decline, Rascoff noted there have been underlying improvements.\nFor the first time in a long time, Tinder's pace of product innovation is strong. To track progress, I am focused on metrics connected with user outcomes -- things like match rate, contact exchange, and inferred IRL meetups. Many of these deeper signals are trending up, and we're actively exploring ways to give investors more visibility into these metrics.\nMeanwhile, the company's second-biggest app, Hinge, continues to outperform, growing a strong 25% in the quarter.\nThe turnaround remains to be seen, but Match Group is cheap\nMatch Group probably won't see a massive turnaround until Tinder stabilizes and the company fixes some of the pain points that have affected the Gen Z generation's use of the app. Tinder still accounts for over half of revenue, so it's vital that Rascoff at least stops the declines there.\nThat being said, Match Group only trades around 9 times this year's free cash flow guidance, so it's still a cheap stock even after today's surge. Whether the stock can become a compelling turnaround or value trap will depend on execution at Tinder under Rascoff's new initiatives.","content_hash":"6efc98d096365a589da6614b49b3adbd","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2729,"method_rank":0}

Such expenses can take a toll. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reported that approximately 100 million Americans owed over $220 billion in medical debt.\nIt’s difficult to avoid rising healthcare costs, especially when you need care, but American businessman and television personality Mark Cuban might have some solutions — read on to find out.\nWhy Mark Cuban Thinks Healthcare Is Too Expensive\nMark Cuban highlighted the broken healthcare system in December 2024. He took to Bluesky, calling healthcare pricing “horrific.”\nHe said hospitals and doctors tend to bear the full financial burden when patients fail to pay deductibles, copays or coinsurance. To compensate for these unpaid amounts, they often increase their prices.\nCuban explained that hospitals and doctors face administrative challenges in collecting those large amounts from patients and medical debt can lead to bankruptcy.\nCheck Out: Mark Cuban: Trump’s Tariffs Will Affect This Class of People the Most\nHe also identified issues with the health insurance agency. Cuban explained that health insurance agencies don’t actually provide insurance to those covered by self-insured entities, such as an employer that insures its employees and pays for their claims directly.\nWhile Cuban identified several flaws with healthcare costs, he also suggested three ways to lower your costs.\nTransition Away From Insurance Companies Approving and Denying Claims\nWhen a self-insured business hires an insurance company to review insurance claims, it’s in the insurance company’s financial best interest to deny claims, saving the business money. The business doesn’t have to pay for services that are denied, which can ultimately boost their bottom line.

Could It Be a Bargain Buy?\nKey Points\n-\nASML has a strong competitive moat that could position it for long-term growth.\n-\nThe company is projecting 15% growth this year, although management is cautious about next year.\n-\nThe stock is trading at a relatively modest price-to-earnings ratio of 25.\nThe demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products and services remains strong. Tech companies have reported earnings recently, and they still remain committed to investing heavily in AI, in an effort to grow their businesses and take advantage of next-gen technologies.\nYou might be tempted to invest in leading AI chipmaker Nvidia and other highly valued stocks to capitalize on these growth opportunities, but there may potentially be a better, more underrated option available. One stock that's been sliding over the past year but that is critical in AI chip development is ASML (NASDAQ: ASML). It may be one of the best buys out there right now.\nASML's key role in chipmaking\nDutch-based ASML makes photolithography machines. They are integral in chipmaking because they are necessary to etch patterns on silicon wafers. The company doesn't have any direct competition for its extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, which are used in creating the most advanced chips. The sophisticated machines give the business a strong competitive moat, which can put ASML in a great position to benefit from strong and continued demand in the AI chip market.\nIn the company's most recent quarter, which ended on June 29, ASML reported net sales totaling 7.7 billion euros ($8.9 billion), which rose 23% year over year. Net income totaling 2.3 billion euros ($2.7 billion) increased by more than 45%.\nFor the full year, the company is projecting 15% revenue growth and for its gross profit margin to be around 52%. ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet, however, remains cautious about the following year. \"Looking at 2026, we see that our AI customers' fundamentals remain strong. At the same time, we continue to see increasing uncertainty driven by macro-economic and geopolitical developments.\"\nThat uncertainty may be a reason why investors haven't been all that eager to buy the AI stock this year.\nThe stock is trading well below normal levels\nOver the past 12 months, shares of ASML are down 15%. The stock has been underperforming the market this year and it's trading at a modest price-to-earnings multiple of just 25 -- that's right in line with the S&P 500 average. Investors, however, are often paying far higher multiples for big players in AI. Nvidia, for instance, trades at nearly 60 times earnings.","content_hash":"2a2fdfa10c72bbdbe0edfd0f467c4b1e","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2709,"method_rank":0}

The AI company's stock has surged more than 140% since the beginning of the year. Earnings beats , lucrative military contracts and the firm's CEO boasting about \"crazy, efficient revolution\" in terms of growing revenue while downsizing headcount, have all helped build buzz around the firm. The firm's shares popped 7.85% on Tuesday, after it reported $1 billion quarterly revenues for the first time, way ahead of analyst expectations. Since then, the stock has extended its gains and was last seen 1% higher in pre-market trading. PLTR YTD line Palantir share price Speaking to CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" this week, Ives, who is global head of tech research at Wedbush Securities, outlined why he still sees huge upside ahead for the stock. Ives runs the Wedbush AI Revolution ETF, which counts Palantir among its top holdings. Labeling Palantir \"the Messi of AI\" — a reference to legendary Argentinian soccer star Lionel Messi — Ives said: \"I believe this is going to be a trillion-dollar company in the next two to three years.\" \"There's no company that has what they have when it comes to software and use cases, and I think they're exploding across the board,\" he explained. \"And the government … they're really going to take the lead when it comes to AI on the sovereign front, and that's why they're one of our top names, and again, I think a trillion-dollar [market cap] in the next two, three years.\" Palantir currently has a market cap of around $432 billion, according to LSEG data. In a note on Tuesday, Ives raised his price target for Palantir from $160 to $200, citing \"continued hyper growth demand for the company's AI product suite.\" If the stock achieves Wedbush's new target price, it would mark a 9.8% premium on Thursday's closing price. Earlier this week, Palantir CEO Alex Karp said the firm was \"obliterating\" the so-called \"Rule of 40,\" a key metric investors use to evaluate potential returns on tech stocks. The metric ranks businesses by evaluating revenue growth and margins, with a score over 40% considered good. According to Karp, Palantir's score is 94%. Ives told CNBC on Wednesday that some investors already saw Palantir stock as overpriced, but warned that this approach could lead to missing out on the company's growth trajectory. \"If you focus just on valuation, you missed every transformational tech stock the last 20 years,\" he said. \"Many investors, they've hated [Palantir shares] at $20, despised it at $50, [been] screaming from the mountaintops at $100, $150, [but] they're revolutionizing tech.\" — CNBC's Alex Harring contributed to this article.","content_hash":"8f2c6a23721bd493b8fd3418075f6803","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2703,"method_rank":0}

We always seem surprised when we hear that higher prices are hurting demand and a company isn’t doing that well. That’s how I felt about the plummeting price of Chipotle stock.

The financial numbers were solid, but management served them with a side of disappointing guidance for the next quarter.\nBloomin's stock was down 28.5% at 3:20 p.m. ET.\nCrunching the Q2 numbers and Q3 targets\nBloomin's second-quarter revenues rose 0.3% year over year, landing at $1 billion. Adjusted earnings dropped from $0.51 to $0.33 per diluted share. The trends pointed downward, but analysts still expected worse. Your average Wall Street firm would have settled for earnings near $0.28 per share, on revenues in the neighborhood of $980 million.\nBut Bloomin's Q3 guidance set up some low near-term targets. The bottom line should show a net loss of at least $0.10 per share, versus the current analyst projection of a $0.05 profit per share.\nCan Bloomin' Brands cook up a Chili's-style comeback?\nThe company is taking notes from the Brinker International (NYSE: EAT) playbook, hoping to reignite lackluster customer interest with a simpler menu and friendlier dining experience. Those are the key ingredients in the Chili's parent's recent success recipe, and I don't mind watching rivals like Bloomin' following a similar path.\nBut the turnaround won't be easy. Bloomin's adjusted restaurant-level operating margin shrank from 14% to 12% over the last year. Carrabba's Italian Grill is doing OK, but same-store sales growth was flat in the flagship Outback chain and down 5.8% at the Bonefish Grill.\nAnd Bloomin's management isn't acting with confidence right now. The company has an unused share buyback authorization of $96.8 million available. That's about 18% of the stock's current market value, so the buybacks could make a real difference for shareholders.\nThe bullish move would be to take a loan and use most of that buyback allowance while the stock is cheap -- Bloomin's shares are down by 63% over the last 52 weeks, after all. But the company didn't repurchase and retire any shares at all in the second quarter.\nBloomin' is a hometown hero in the Tampa Bay area, where the company is headquartered and these words were written. I sure hope for the best, but the lack of management courage scares me. So I'll largely watch this Chili's-style turnaround attempt from the sidelines.","content_hash":"1e96732c57ed973835ed1d39867ca305","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2674,"method_rank":0}

Iovance’s workforce will still have more than 1,000 people following the job cuts, which will affect full-time employees as well as contractors, according to the spokesperson.\n“After careful evaluation of our long-term goals, operational needs, and resources, we have implemented a strategic restructuring that includes a selective reduction in force to support our mission to innovate, develop and deliver TIL cell therapy to patients in need,” the spokesperson wrote in an email, referring to the type of cellular medicine Iovance specializes in. “This restructuring will extend our cash runway, and we remain on track to deliver on our financial goals.”\nIn a second quarter earnings report Thursday afternoon, the company said that 19% of its workforce would be impacted by the cuts. The restructuring will save Iovance more than $100 million annually and enable it to operate through the fourth quarter of 2026. Iovance will also “continue to optimize and refine its cost structure” through what it described as “operational excellence initiatives” over the next few quarters, it said in a statement.\nIovance had about $307 million in cash on hand at the end of June.\nThe layoffs come after a slow commercial start for Amtagvi, a cell therapy Iovance developed for an advanced form of skin cancer. Amtagvi is the first marketed cellular medicine made by engineering human cells known as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or “TILs.” The therapy originated from research at the National Institutes of Health in the 1980s and got to market only after decades of fine-tuning, as well as multiple regulatory delays.\nAmtagvi was cleared in February 2024 for people whose melanoma progressed after a commonly used immunotherapy or targeted cancer medication. It’s derived from a patient’s tumor tissue in a complex, weekslong manufacturing process. Upon approval, analysts and investors were skeptical of its sales potential, given questions about demand and the complex logistics involved. At about $515,000, the drug’s list price was also at the time the highest of any cell-based medicine for cancer in the U.S.","content_hash":"2c5ee7e80d2b0894a61412d93addf5bb","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2662,"method_rank":0}

Net income, meanwhile, was down from the previous quarter but up from the year-ago quarter.

Pundits tracking the company were modeling the equivalent of just under $12 billion for revenue, and $0.95 per share on the bottom line.\nAlthough Novo Nordisk continues to post double-digit increases thanks largely to Wegovy and Ozempic, it has been in the investor doghouse so far this month. That's because at the end of July, it significantly cut its guidance for both total sales and operating profit.\nWithering competition\nMuch of this has to do with the intense competition Novo Nordisk is facing due to the runaway success of those medications.\nThese days, pharmacy sector powerhouse Eli Lilly is doing brisk business with a directly competing product, Zepbound, while third parties are copying Wegovy's semaglutide molecule for their own compounded products.

On the other hand, it actually raised its full-year sales performance target to approximately $1.055 billion -- up from its previous guidance for about $1.01 billion.\nWith the stock seeing a big pullback despite a strong second quarter and encouraging performance outlook for the rest of the year, today's trading could present a worthwhile buying opportunity for risk-tolerant investors.\nShould you buy stock in Upstart right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Upstart, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Upstart wasn’t one of them.

At the same time, demand for Light Commercial Vehicles (LCVs) with a gross vehicle weight of up to 6T reached 52k units, marking decreases of 5% MoM and 4% YoY.\nThe PV segment, in particular, saw diminished demand from urban consumers.

That marked the second time since 2018 and for a similar reason: high debt load and the shift among teens heading online away from physical stores.\nClaire's Chapter 11 filing follows the bankruptcies of other teen retailers including Forever 21, which filed in March for bankruptcy protection for a second time and eventually closed down its U.S. business as traffic in U.S. shopping malls fades and competition from online retailers like Amazon, Temu and Shein intensifies.\nClaire's, based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois and founded in 1974, said that its stores in North America will remain open and will continue to serve customers, while it explores all strategic alternatives. Claire's operates more than 2,750 Claire’s stores in 17 countries throughout North America and Europe and 190 Icing stores in North America.\nIn a court filing, Claire's said its assets and liabilities range between $1 billion and $10 billion.\n“This decision is difficult, but a necessary one,” Chris Cramer, CEO of Claire’s, said in a press release issued Wednesday. “Increased competition, consumer spending trends and the ongoing shift away from brick-and-mortar retail, in combination with our current debt obligations and macroeconomic factors, necessitate this course of action for Claire’s and its stakeholders.”\nLike many retailers, Claire's was also struggling with higher costs tied to President Donald Trump's tariff plans, analysts said.\nCramer said that the company remains in “active discussions” with potential strategic and financial partners. He noted that the company remains committed to serving its customers and partnering with its suppliers and landlords in other regions. Claire’s also intends to continue paying employees' wages and benefits, and it will seek approval to use cash collateral to support its operations.\nNeil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, a research firm, noted in a note published Wednesday Claire's bankruptcy filing comes as “no real surprise.”\n“The chain has been swamped by a cocktail of problems, both internal and external, that made it impossible to stay afloat,” he wrote.","content_hash":"51782d13c882381829a03914d1be4263","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2640,"method_rank":0}

Analyst Aaron Rakers highlighted Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices as beneficiaries of Tesla's decision to shut down its custom-built AI training supercomputer Dojo team, which was first reported by Bloomberg on Thursday. Pete Bannon, Tesla hardware design engineering vice president, is leaving the company after joining from Apple in 2016, CNBC confirmed. Remaining employees are being reassigned to Tesla, Bloomberg's report said, citing people familiar with the matter. Dojo's end is \"an indication that the company is stepping back from its internal AI-optimized silicon efforts,\" said Rakers. \"This should be viewed as a positive for NVIDIA and AMD as this likely increases Tesla usage of general purpose GPUs for AI.\" Rakers highlighted that Tesla has been notably expanding its graphics processing units, or GPU, infrastructure. Tesla has bought several thousands of Nvidia GPUs such as the H100, in an effort to scale its training compute power. \"During the 2Q25 earnings call, Tesla disclosed that the company has deployed a ~50k NVIDIA H100 training cluster Cortex. The same week Elon Musk posted that Tesla was deploying an add'l 16k NVIDIA H200 GPUs at its Texas Gigafactory; running at ~67k NVIDIA H100 equivalents,\" Rakers said. Musk said in early 2024 that while a Dojo supercomputer would cost $500 million to build, \"Tesla will spend more than that on Nvidia hardware this year.\" Nvidia GPUs were being used for Tesla's other efforts beyond Dojo, such as training and inference of its Grok AI chatbot. TSLA 1Y mountain Tesla stock performance over the past year. The analyst acknowledged that the Bloomberg report is markedly different from Musk's comments during Tesla's second-quarter earnings call, during which he said that the Dojo 2 supercomputer is expected to operate at scale next year and that the Dojo 3 and the Ai6 inference chip would find convergence, meaning they would integrate in some way and be the same chip. Tesla's custom-designed Ai6 AI chip was intended for in-vehicle inference for Tesla's Full Self-Driving system. The Dojo supercomputer was designed to train AI models on data captured by Tesla vehicles, and has been part of Musk's heavy emphasis to investors over the past year that Tesla is an AI and robotics company, not just an electric vehicle company. Tesla shares edged slightly lower before Friday's market open. The stock is down about 20% year to date.","content_hash":"5cad5a6f4b398af94b4c60ee61f61779","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2630,"method_rank":0}

The luxury electric vehicle (EV) maker's stock had dropped 9.3% as of 3:04 p.m. ET. The fall comes as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up by 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively.\nThe stock is seeing a retreat after the company released its latest earnings report, underwhelming investors.\nLucid's Gravity SUV sales aren't where they need to be\nThe company's quarterly report revealed soft sales of its new Gravity SUV, a critical product for Lucid's turnaround efforts. The less-than-hoped-for SUV sales meant the company missed Wall Street's targets on its top and bottom lines. Lucid reported a loss of $0.24 per share on $259 million in sales when a loss of $0.21 per share on $280 million was expected.\nCEO Marc Winterhoff addressed his frustrations with the performance, telling Yahoo! Finance: \"This is something I've said before, and I say it again, we're not where we want to be with the Gravity at this time of the year. We actually wanted to be ahead, making significant ... progress every day,\" He said that the company's SUV sales would ramp up \"drastically\" in the second half of the year and help improve the lackluster numbers.\nChallenges remain\nExpectations for Lucid's early sales of Gravity weren't out of reach by any means. The fact that the company wasn't able to hit them speaks to the difficulty of selling high-priced EVs in this market. Demand for EVs and luxury goods isn't particularly strong at the moment, and competition continues to heat up from Chinese operators.

Old repairs, surprise code violations, and sometimes, if you're really unlucky, a decades-old septic line buried in your neighbor's yard.\nOne North Carolina homeowner learned this the hard way when they tried to sell their house and got hit with a curveball from next door. \"My neighbor won't let me sell due to old septic line,\" they wrote in a Reddit post.

And despite repeated efforts, the neighbor \"absolutely refuses to speak to me,\" they said. \"They've contacted my agent and the county numerous times to talk about the issue, but when redirected to talk to me, they shut it down.\"\nTo make matters worse, the county isn't allowing the home to be sold unless the problem is resolved—and the only solution they're offering involves digging up both the front and back yards to relocate the septic system and the well. Cost: $30,000 to $40,000. \"The only solution they are offering is to dig up the yard and pay 1\/3 of what I paid for the house,\" the homeowner wrote.\nTrending: Accredited Investors: Grab Pre-IPO Shares of the AI Company Powering Hasbro, Sephora & MGM—Secure $0.63 Shares Before 8\/14\nCommenters were stunned. \"It's insane that you can be sold a house with essential systems on someone else's property without it being disclosed,\" one said.

These include oil and gas, petrochemical, electric utility, light rail traction, data center, and other commercial buildings.\nThe company's fiscal third quarter saw a slight 1% decline in revenue, which missed expectations, but a 3% increase relative to the prior quarter. Yet on the bright side, earnings per share of $3.96 increased 4%, beating expectations and helped out by an encouraging expansion in gross margins.\nPowell's revenue growth may seem unexciting, given the recent need for more electricity to power artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, which is leading to a reacceleration in electricity demand in the U.S. In that light, there was a lot going on under the surface. Powell's electric utility segment was actually up a whopping 31%, so that fits in with the current trends. Additionally, commercial and light industrial revenue was up 18%.\nHowever, Powell also has a significant oil and gas and petrochemical business, and those segments declined 8% and 36%, respectively.\nYet the company's overall booking trends seemed positive, as bookings grew 45% quarter over quarter, leading to a 7% sequential growth in backlog.\nPowell may be a sneaky play on electrification\nPowell now trades at just a 16.7 multiple based on 2025 estimates, which ends next quarter. That may seem appropriate for a company with low growth, but as the electric utility segment makes up more of the business, the company may surprise to the upside. In the June quarter, the electric utility segment made up 26% of revenue, and commercial & industrial made up another 17%.\nTherefore, if these segments can continue growing as they have, they could eventually become the major driver of the business in the years ahead.","content_hash":"31b28d2f86a6a604faeb72ab3a400f59","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2593,"method_rank":0}

It's a win-win: You get to save and invest for retirement, securing your future, and you get a tax break along the way by being able to lower your taxable income in the year you make contributions.\nFor many people, a 401(k) will be their largest source of retirement income, so it's natural to wonder how your savings stack up against your peers' and if you're saving enough. According to statistics released by Fidelity, the average 401(k) for millennials -- those born between 1981 and 1996 -- is $67,300.\nIt's not time to press the panic button yet\nBefore deciding if you're lagging behind in 401(k) savings, it's important to note that low or high balances can skew averages, so these numbers shouldn't be taken as a definitive benchmark. That said, if your 401(k) savings aren't where you want them to be, there's still time, as the oldest millennials are 44 and have around two decades until retirement.\nThe best thing you can do at this point is move 401(k) savings up higher in your financial priorities. That doesn't mean increasing your contributions to the point where it could jeopardize your current livelihood. However, even slight increases can make a huge difference over time -- especially with the power of compound earnings.\nI recommend that you review your current contribution rate, make sure you're taking advantage of your full employer match (if it's offered), and decide if you need to cut expenses somewhere in order to be able to comfortably increase your contributions.\nThe $23,760 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook\nIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

In fact, despite the persistent high-rate environment and economic uncertainty, Upstart's loan origination volume grew by a staggering 89% year over year in the first quarter of 2025.\nUpstart's management is calling for the company to produce its first billion-dollar revenue year ever in 2025. Think about that -- not even during the extreme low-interest environment of 2021 did Upstart ever manage a billion dollars.\nThere are other reasons for Upstart shareholders to be optimistic. The company's loan data shows that it does a more effective job of predicting loan defaults than the traditional FICO model. And after several years of losses, Upstart managed an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20% in the latest quarter and is virtually breakeven on a GAAP net income basis.\n1 big reason to buy Upstart now\nTo be clear, Upstart's personal loan vertical has been firing on all cylinders. But it's the two newer verticals -- auto loans and home loans, specifically home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) -- that are most exciting.\nThe auto lending market is a massive one that is several times the size of the personal loan industry. And in the latest quarter, Upstart's auto originations were nearly five times what they were a year ago.\nMortgages could be the really big opportunity here. Upstart's HELOC origination volume, which launched a little over a year ago, grew 52% sequentially in the first quarter. Combined, auto and home loans make up about 2% of the company's total loan originations today but could end up being the biggest driver of growth.\nOne key statistic worth knowing is that U.S. homeowners are sitting on an all-time high $35 trillion in home equity, and many are just waiting for the opportunity to tap into it at lower rates.\nTrump’s Tariffs Could Create $1.5 Trillion AI Gold Rush\nThe Motley Fool’s analysts are tracking a massive shift in U.S. tech. Over $1.5 trillion is already flowing into infrastructure, AI, and advanced manufacturing… and the number keeps climbing.\nFollowing a major tariff policy shift, a new AI Gold Rush is taking shape, and we think the real winner is a company 1\/100th the size of NVIDIA.","content_hash":"21498a480db1d930781234ab015f8de8","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2563,"method_rank":0}

It only delivered low double-digit upside if you bought during those 2024 highs and barely eeked out new highs as Bitcoin (BTCUSD) raced ahead.\nMore News from Barchart\nMore recently, even Ethereum (ETHUSD) has started delivering significant gains, with BNB remaining behind. Bitcoin is up 25% in the year to date, while Ethereum is up 20%. BNB lags behind, up 11%.\nCEA Industries’ Pivot Causes BNB to Gain\nCEA Industries (VAPE) rebranded to BNB Network Company (BNC) and changed its stock ticker to BNC, effective Aug. 6, 2025. However, due to the recency of this change, I’ll still call it CEA Industries in this article.\nCEA Industries is a Nasdaq-listed company that announced earlier this week that it had closed a $500 million private placement to pivot toward a corporate treasury strategy heavily focused on acquiring and holding BNB as its primary reserve asset.\nThis could make the company one of the largest corporate holders of BNB. If you’ve heard of MicroStrategy, now known as just Strategy (MSTR), the approach of CEA Industries to BNB is very similar.\nIts private placement attracted over 140 subscribers and included investors like YZi Labs, Pantera Capital, G-20 Group, and others like Arche Capital, Exodus Point, and Blockchain.com, with Cantor Fitzgerald serving as the lead financial advisor and sole placement agent.\nFollowing the initial announcement on July 28, BNB hit a new all-time high above $860 per coin.\nUpgrades Keep BNB in the Game\nThe BNB Chain has undergone noteworthy upgrades in 2025, and it has reduced block times to under 1 second (currently at 0.75 seconds). In turn, it slashed transaction fees to about $0.01, and the chain handled peak daily volumes of 17.6 million transactions last month. These changes have boosted efficiency.\nThe auto-burn mechanism recently completed its 32nd quarterly burn and removed 1.59 million BNB from circulation. Corporate adoption is accelerating, with U.S.-listed firms such as Windtree Therapeutics (WINT) allocating up to $520 million for BNB treasury holdings, Nano Labs (NA) aiming for $1 billion in purchases to hold 10% of circulating supply, and CEA, of course.","content_hash":"5b07e9928d0621e1ae6000b67447471a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2562,"method_rank":0}

The Department continues taking significant steps to ensure accountability, in turn protecting consumers and safeguarding the integrity of the financial system.”\nThe compliance failures identified by NYDFS were largely tied to Paxos’ one-time partnership with Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. The two companies teamed up in 2019 to issue Binance’s dollar-pegged stablecoin, BUSD. The relationship with Binance eventually landed Paxos in hot water: in 2023, NYDFS launched an investigation into Paxos’s issuance of BUSD, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sent Paxos a Wells notice informing the company of its intention to sue (a year later, the SEC decided to drop its enforcement action) and Paxos ultimately decided to stop issuing BUSD altogether at the order of NYDFS.\nThe fine announced Thursday is tied to NYDFS’ original investigation. According to NYDFS’ press release, the investigation revealed that Paxos didn’t have appropriate controls in place to effectively monitor for illicit activity occurring through Binance. And when illicit activity was identified, the regulator said, the company “failed to escalate red flags” to Paxos’ higher-ups and board members.\nIn addition to the Binance-related compliance issues, NYDFS said its investigation into Paxos turned up other deficiencies in its compliance program, including an “unsophisticated” Know Your Customer (KYC) program that allowed illicit actors to open multiple accounts and remain undetected, and a “deficient” transaction monitoring system that prevented Paxos from “detecting obvious patterns of money laundering.”","content_hash":"a40d18bd1ef6ba6dcb0558d4f49d7128","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2561,"method_rank":0}

Signs of stronger sugar production in Brazil are undercutting sugar prices. Last Thursday, Unica reported Brazil's Center-South sugar output in the first half of July rose +15% y\/y to 3.4 MMT. Also, the amount of sugarcane being crushed for sugar by Brazil's sugar mills has increased to 54% from 50% the same time last year.\nMore News from Barchart\nThe outlook for higher sugar exports from India is negative for prices after Bloomberg reported that India may permit local sugar mills to export sugar in the next season, which starts in October, as abundant monsoon rains may produce a bumper sugar crop. India's Meteorological Department reported today that cumulative monsoon rain in India is at 500.8 mm, or 4% above normal as of August 4. Also, the Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association said last Thursday that it will seek permission to export 2 MMT of sugar in 2025\/26.\nThe outlook for higher sugar production in India, the world's second-largest producer, is bearish for prices. On June 2, India's National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories projected that India's 2025\/26 sugar production would climb +19% y\/y to 35 MMT, citing larger planted cane acreage. That would follow a -17.5% y\/y decline in India's sugar production in 2024\/25 to a 5-year low of 26.2 MMT, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).\nSugar prices have retreated over the past four months, with NY sugar falling to a 4.25-year low last month and London sugar sliding to a 4-year low, driven by expectations of a sugar surplus in the 2025\/26 season. On June 30, commodities trader Czarnikow projected a 7.5 MMT global sugar surplus for the 2025\/26 season, the largest surplus in 8 years. On May 22, the USDA, in its biannual report, projected that global 2025\/26 sugar production would increase by +4.7% y\/y to a record 189.318 MMT, with global sugar ending stocks at 41.188 MMT, up 7.5% y\/y.\nSigns that the recent slide in sugar prices to 4-year lows has sparked a pickup in demand are positive for sugar prices. China's June sugar imports soared by 1,435% to 420,000 MT. Also, Coca-Cola agreed to use cane sugar in Coke beverages sold in the US instead of high-fructose corn syrup, which could boost US sugar consumption by +4.4% to 11.5 MMT from 11 MMT currently, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.","content_hash":"b7348ebb1a0ff0e5d24b7d7e31b752d4","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2551,"method_rank":0}

Waiting to retire until you reached 65 ensured that you'd receive your full benefits. That's no longer the case. Beginning in 2026, the full retirement age will officially be 67 after several decades of gradual increase.\nHowever, 65 remains a popular age to claim Social Security retirement benefits. One reason why is that it's still the eligibility age for Medicare. But how much could you expect to receive if you begin collecting Social Security at 65?\nMultiple averages\nThe latest annual statistical supplement published by the Social Security Administration (SSA) includes lots of data. There are actually multiple average Social Security benefits for age 65, because Social Security has multiple types of benefits. We're focused only on retired worker benefits, though.\nThe average monthly Social Security benefit for a retired worker aged 65 listed in SSA's report was $1,563.06. That translates to $18,756.72 annually.\nHowever, there is a disparity between the sexes. The average monthly benefit for men was $1,733.08, well above the average monthly benefit for women of $1,409.73. This difference is due to higher average earnings for men.\nKeep in mind, though, that the actual averages in August 2025 are almost certainly higher than those numbers. SSA's most recent annual statistical supplement was released in December 2024. Moreover, its figures were based on data from one year earlier.\nHow much you'll forego by retiring at 65\nThe amount of benefits you'll receive if you retire at age 65 might not be anywhere close to the average. Your retirement benefit hinges on how much you made during the 35 years of your highest earnings. However, whatever your benefit amount is from retiring at 65, you can calculate how much you're foregoing by retiring before the full retirement age of 67.\nSocial Security will reduce your benefit by five-ninths of 1% for each month you retire before your full retirement age, up to a maximum of 36 months. If you retired exactly at age 65 and your full retirement age is 67, you'll receive roughly 86.7% of the benefits you'd get if you had waited until 67.","content_hash":"09c7e8e36281149bea3352d0d8b097af","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2549,"method_rank":0}

Just seven companies with at least $10 million in liabilities filed for Chapter 11 protections, compared with 14 in the same period last year.\n-\nThe restructuring advisory firm predicts there will be 16% fewer filings this year compared to 2024, as less large healthcare companies and providers declare bankruptcy.\n-\nHowever, the dip may be short lived. Challenging market conditions, including impacts from cuts to Medicaid, could hit providers’ bottom lines as early as 2026, potentially spurring a new wave of bankruptcies, according to Gibbins.\nDive Insight:\nThe results follow two quarters of heightened healthcare bankruptcy activity, including 19 filings during the fourth quarter of 2024 and 17 filings in the first quarter of 2025. Hospital and physician practice bankruptcies were elevated during that time, with eight and six companies filing, respectively, according to the report.\nHowever, in the second quarter, there were zero provider bankruptcy filings, according to Gibbins’ analysis.\nInstead, the lion’s share of the seven healthcare filings came from pharmaceutical companies, with five filing for bankruptcy during the quarter. One medical supply company and one senior care company also declared bankruptcy during the period.\nStill, the report is not a reason for optimism about the sector’s financial health, Gibbins analysts said. Providers in particular have been hit hard by policy changes in Washington, including the introduction of tariffs on critical supplies and general market volatility. Looming Medicaid cuts are likely to spell future trouble.\n“The unprecedented funding cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are deeply troubling for the future of healthcare,” said Clare Moylan, principal at Gibbins Advisors, in a statement. “Hospitals serving vulnerable communities — especially those with high Medicaid populations and dependent on supplemental payments — face the greatest risk.”\nPresident Donald Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” into law on July 4, following significant pushback from hospital lobbyists and nonpartisan analysts.\nThe sprawling legislation cuts roughly $900 billion from Medicaid over a decade, in part through creating work requirements, which will kick in at the end of 2026.","content_hash":"d775cbc782b21790de08207b2d2bc8e2","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2546,"method_rank":0}

This means they are not directly insured by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which protects customers up to £85,000 if a firm fails.\nDelays to Revolut have been a point of contention for the government, which has come under fire from the U.K. tech industry for not doing enough to ensure the country can compete effectively with the U.S. and other key hubs.\nBailey stressed that there was \"no trade off between financial stability and growth in the economy.\" However, he suggested that he was open to rule changes to enable the fintech sector to flourish.\n\"We are very open to making changes where they're appropriate,\" he said.","content_hash":"2f8ace95585418a0cd7b2a5aa3d736f9","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2543,"method_rank":0}

The Street-high price target of $58 suggests an ambitious upside potential of 33.5%.\nOn the date of publication, Neha Panjwani did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Economists have grown worried in recent days that the economy is slowing. A weak July payrolls report and massive revisions to prior months reinforced the specter of a slowdown that had started to emerge in other data. The result is that markets are now pricing in the strong possibility of an interest rate cut when the Federal Open Market Committee meets again on Sept. 16-17. Traders also see a near certainty of a second cut by the end of the year, and nearly a 50-50 chance of third reduction, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool. \"So, we are back to the 'bad is good' mantra, with the Fed expected to save the day by cutting rates early and big enough to prevent a recession — something the U.S. President would likely welcome,\" Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at Barclays, said in a Friday note. \"However, we are not convinced a September cut is a given, yet.\" CPI landmine There are multiple landmines in place between now and the Sept. 16-17 gathering, with next week's inflation reports the first in focus.

President Donald Trump fired the BLS commissioner last Friday after the July jobs report. The July producer price index, considered a gauge of wholesale prices, comes next Thursday. Markets will be looking closely for upside pressure coming from Trump's tariffs. \"A hawkish print would likely be a reality check for markets, and reinforce the current narrow leadership in quality\/growth\" stocks, Cau said. \"On the other hand, a soft CPI print would likely cement rate cuts expectations, lift equities higher and help broadening\/Momentum unwind, on top of capping near term dollar upside, in our view.\" The strategist still sees \"a decent case for equities to grind modestly higher by year end, but the rest of the summer is unlikely to be plain sailing.\" Similarly, JPMorgan chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli sees easing monetary policy, likely cutting rates at each of the three meetings through the end of 2025, \"before pausing indefinitely.\" \"It's not unprecedented for the Fed to ease when stocks are at or near all-time highs.

Baby boomers aged 60+ have risen from 35.1% to 41.5%, while millennial CEOs in their 30s and 40s have grown from 13.8% to 15.1% over the past eight years, according to the Conference Board and Esgauge.\nWhile Gen X still holds the largest share of CEO positions, research indicates that they’re losing ground with baby boomers CEOs, who appear to be bypassing the next generation in favor of younger leaders. Experts credit this shift to the rise of AI in the workplace, with millennials bringing the digital expertise needed to guide the growing number of companies embracing advanced technology in their business strategies.\nMillennials are leading the charge in adapting to advanced tech in the workplace. Data shows about 50% of millennials use generative AI at work, compared to 34% of Gen X and just 19% of baby boomers. Millennials are also more optimistic about their potential, with 55% viewing AI-driven solutions positively, compared to 37% of Gen X and 36% of boomers.\nWhile many boomer CEOs are hesitant to adopt AI personally, they recognize it as the future and understand it will take adaptable leadership to guide companies forward. As a result, they’re increasingly choosing younger millennials over Gen X counterparts to take their place in the C-suite.\nMillennials strike a balance due to their industry experience, having grown up with the internet, and a forward-thinking approach to AI in business. Gen Z is still too early in their careers, while Gen X tends to be more hesitant about the technology.\nAnother factor has labeled Gen X professionals as the “forgotten generation,” with boomers favoring millennial successors due to workplace ageism and the belief that Gen Xers are nearing retirement. About 22% of employees aged 40 and older report being overlooked for challenging assignments, while 16% have seen a pattern of younger staffers being promoted over them.\nBillion-dollar companies are paving the way, with giants like Red Lobster, Lime, and Kickstarter all naming millennials as CEOs in recent years.

Industry experts expect profit margins to shrink as companies find they can no longer rely on price hikes to boost revenue. U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs have already pushed up prices on some of P&G products, the company has said.\nThe tariffs, which importers are tending to pass on to consumers, are most likely to hit the poorest Americans worst, said policy researchers at the Budget Lab at Yale and the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity.\n\"It does feel like there are certain cohorts of the consumer, definitely on the lower-income side, that are feeling pressure right now,\" Chipotle Mexican Grill Chief Financial Officer Adam Rymer told Reuters.\nDefinitions of \"low income\" can vary widely, and depend on the number of dependents or children in a household and where consumers live.\nBank of America, the second biggest U.S. consumer-facing bank, in research notes has described earners of $50,000 or less as \"lower income,\" and more likely to be living paycheck to paycheck. However, Chipotle, with its $10 burritos, has a benchmark of $75,000 or less. Coke has previously said \"low-income\" is less than $40,000 per year, while P&G did not immediately respond to questions about its definition.\nChipotle will consider the financial burdens on its lower-income consumers when weighing future price hikes, Rymer said.\nConsumer products bellwether P&G struck a cautious tone in its forecast for its upcoming fiscal year, saying shoppers across incomes were reining in spending due to Trump's tariffs and immigration crackdown, along with rising interest rates and inflation.\nCoca-Cola is marketing more affordable sodas to lower-income consumers, CEO James Quincey said, and brewer Molson Coors added that such buyers are looking for smaller pack sizes.\nConsumers have been tightening their wallets as inflation ticks up and companies raise prices on everyday purchases like Hershey chocolate and Tide laundry detergent.

The ubiquitous fast-food chain reported perkier sales in its most recent quarter, buoyed by deals and other promotions designed to bring wayward customers back into the fold.\nMost Read from Fast Company\nIn its second quarter ending on June 30, McDonald’s global same-store sales were up 3.8%. At U.S. stores, sales rose 2.5% as the average customer bought more per order, according to the company. The sales numbers beat estimates and reversed four quarters of dropping same-store sales for the fast-food giant, which has been scrambling to again make its brand synonymous with a low-cost meal.\nWith inflation still looming and Trump’s unpredictable barrage of tariffs sowing economic uncertainty, McDonald’s is navigating some choppy waters. While everyone eats at McDonald’s to some extent, the company’s business is particularly driven by low-income customers who visit the chain much more often. When menu prices go up, those customers vanish or visit less frequently—and a meaningful chunk of the company’s sales go with them. In the first quarter of 2025, McDonald’s saw its worst sales drop since the lockdown phase of the pandemic kept its customers at home.\n“Reengaging the low-income consumer is critical, as they typically visit our restaurants more frequently than middle- and high-income consumers,” McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski said on the company’s earnings call, noting that this situation is pronounced in the U.S. “With the low-income consumer, despite improvements in wage gains, real incomes are down . . . that absolutely is going to put pressure on visits into the [quick-service restaurant] industry.”\nKempczinski mentioned that rising “anxiety and unease” among low-income consumers, coupled with real financial shortcomings, pressures Americans to spend less. He touted McDonald’s progress on low-cost options for the company’s Q2, but said the split nature of its customer base meant it isn’t out of the woods yet.\nMcDonald’s menu meets the moment\nMcDonald’s has quite a few levers to pull to bring once-loyal customers back under the golden arches. A $5 meal deal introduced last year courted cash-strapped customers with a McDouble or McChicken sandwich, a small soft drink, small fries, and a four-piece order of nuggets.

Revenue for the restaurateur grew even faster, up 5%, and profits faster still.\nOperating income increased 11% and earnings as calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) grew 12% to $3.14 per share. That's not quite as much as the $3.19 adjusted profit, which backed out a nickel's worth of one-time charges. But it's more than 3 times faster than same-store-sales growth, indicating strong improvement in profit margins.\nIs McDonald's stock a buy?\nManagement did not provide guidance for what to expect, sales-wise or earnings-wise, the rest of this year. Analysts who follow the stock, however, are forecasting more modest earnings growth of only 4.5% through the end of this year, and $12.25 per share in GAAP profit by year-end.\nValuation-wise, that works out to a rich 25x multiple on this globe-spanning fast-food restaurant stock. In an expensive stock market where the average S&P 500 stock is selling for more than 29 times earnings, that may sound like a bargain. To me, though, paying 25 times earnings for 4.5% earnings growth and a 2.4% dividend yield seems too expensive to justify.\nI wouldn't buy McDonald's stock at this price.\nShould you invest $1,000 in McDonald's right now?\nBefore you buy stock in McDonald's, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and McDonald's wasn’t one of them.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily C-Store Dive newsletter.\nDive Brief:\n-\nArko Corp.’s total revenue dropped for the fifth straight quarter as the convenience retailer continues its store dealerization strategy, according to its Q2 earnings report released on Wednesday.\n-\nTotal revenue fell from over $2.3 billion earned during last year’s Q2 to about $1.9 billion in the latest quarter, according to the report. Arko also saw year-over-year drops in merchandise and fuel contribution, which leadership said resulted from the dealerization program and a challenging macroeconomic environment.\n-\nArko launched the dealerization program — in which it converts company-operated c-stores to wholesale locations — in May 2024 as a way to reduce expenses. But over a year later, most of the financial gains haven’t materialized, leaving investors anxious about the program’s future.\nDive Insight:\nArko’s leadership has said since last summer that the dealerization program should help the company yield a cumulative annualized operating income benefit of over $20 million.\nExecutive Vice President and CFO Robert Giammatteo said on Wednesday’s earnings call that Arko is close to a third of the way towards this goal. But attendees on the call repeatedly questioned Kotler and Giammatteo about when they expect the millions in savings to bear fruit, why it’s taking a while to do so and if the initial $20 million goal has changed in recent months. Arko’s stock price is also down nearly 30% compared to this time last year.\nKotler said that getting the dealers equipped with proper licensing to run the stores is taking longer than anticipated, but despite any slowdown, Arko is “very pleased” with the progress. He emphasized that all is going according to plan.\n“This is a long term play, and we want to make sure that [the dealers] continue to make money, and we want to make sure that they get all of their licenses in order to continue to operate from the minute that we stop operating,” Kotler said.\nThis isn’t the first time investors have expressed concern about the program. In February, analysts asked why Arko was ramping up the strategy even after it saw full-year revenue declines in 2024 because of it. At the time, Giammatteo reassured them that the program was accretive, and that Arko would see gains begin in late 2025 or 2026 once it built out more of a runway with the conversions.","content_hash":"916c057a5379276924732ffcec48a845","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2479,"method_rank":0}

This includes over 70% growth in its share price in the last three months. This stellar rally in ORCL stock is led by solid momentum in its business, especially cloud, and an expected acceleration in its growth rate in fiscal 2026.\nThe technology company wrapped its fiscal 2025 with a strong fourth quarter, delivering double-digit revenue growth. This performance strengthened investors’ optimism, especially as Oracle’s management signaled that the company’s growth rate is likely to accelerate in the coming quarters. With expectations of an even faster pace of revenue growth in fiscal 2026, the company is laying the groundwork for sustained stock gains.\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nSupermicro’s Earnings Selloff Explained: Should You Buy SMCI Stock Now?\n-\nAmazon’s $36M Bet on Quantum Computing: What Investors Need to Know\n-\nAMD Stock Slips After Q2 Earnings, But Here’s Why It’s a Buying Opportunity\nThe Catalyst Behind ORCL Stock\nA major driver behind Oracle’s surge is the explosive growth in its cloud services. Revenues from cloud services and license support were notably strong in the fourth quarter, and demand for its cloud infrastructure, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), continues to skyrocket. OCI’s non-cancelable bookings suggest potential revenue growth of over 70% in the coming fiscal year, a figure that points to long-term scalability and strength in Oracle’s cloud offerings.\nThe company’s evolution into a cloud-first enterprise software leader is playing a central role in its growth story. Oracle is becoming a go-to technology partner for businesses undergoing digital transformation, offering a full suite of cloud-based applications that help streamline operations. Oracle’s recent integration of more than 100 AI agents into these platforms adds a layer of automation and intelligence, potentially accelerating adoption across industries that require innovative and efficient solutions.\nArtificial intelligence is another key pillar in Oracle’s expansion strategy. Through its Autonomous Database and AI-powered data platform, Oracle is offering enterprise clients the kind of performance, flexibility, and cross-cloud compatibility that are essential in today's AI-driven landscape. Crucially, Oracle’s infrastructure is designed to integrate across major cloud providers—including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud — making it a compelling option in a multi-cloud world.","content_hash":"50727d1653c31b8b11e99f3a63526a54","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2472,"method_rank":0}

The post follows criticism of Tan by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, who has questioned his ties to China. Tan was named CEO of Intel in March.\nIntel shares were down more than 3% in mid-morning trading Thursday after Donald Trump called on social media for the company’s CEO to “resign, immediately.”\nLip-Bu Tan was named CEO of Intel in March, replacing Pat Gelsinger. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) has questioned Tan’s ties to Chinese companies in recent days and has raised concerns about a criminal case at Cadence Design, where Tan served as CEO until 2021 in a letter sent to the company’s chairman Wesnesday.\n“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!,” he wrote.\nIntel did not immediately respond to Fortune‘s request for comment about Trump’s demand.\nReuters has reported Tan has invested at least $200 million in a number of Chinese companies, including some linked to the country’s military. That has led to previous criticism of him from the investment world.\n“The simple fact is that Mr. Tan is unqualified to serve as the head of any company competing against China, let alone one with actual intelligence and national security ramifications like Intel and its tremendous legacy connection to all areas of America’s intelligence and the defense ecosystem,” Bastille Ventures partner Andrew King told Reuters.\nHe was also CEO of Cadence during a period when the company unlawfully exported semiconductor design tools to a People’s Republic of China military university. (Cadence pleaded guilty to those charges and paid a $140 million fine last month.)\nTan’s appointment as CEO at Intel was initially cheered by investors. Shares jumped 10% on the news earlier this year and he was seen as eminently qualified and was the first outsider to ever be named a leader at the company. He has overseen plans to cut 25,000 jobs this year, but the company did surpass analyst expectations in its most recent earnings.\nTrump inserting himself into the affairs of leading a non-governmental company is unique, but not without precedent. In 2009, Barack Obama asked the CEO of General Motors to resign, but that was part of a government restructuring plan for the automaker that involved an aid package for GM.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com","content_hash":"d1040a1c745948f8f392080752f06892","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2468,"method_rank":0}

Earlier this year, MongoDB acquired Voyage AI, a startup specializing in vector-based search models, and launched a public preview of its Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. Coupled with the release of the Voyage 3.5 retrieval models and enhanced vector database capabilities, these initiatives allow developers to use natural language to query data and create AI-powered applications more efficiently.\nMongoDB carries a market capitalization of $18.6 billion. Year-to-date, shares have climbed roughly 0.4%, still trading well below their late-2024 highs. The pullback reflects broader caution toward high-growth tech valuations. MDB trades at an enterprise value-sales ratio of 7.1x and a trailing price-earnings ratio of 55x, significantly above sector medians of 2.9x and 22.9x, highlighting a premium valuation even as analysts point to solid fundamentals and long-term AI-driven growth potential.","content_hash":"7e3b079def8235867fda17c2c1c2231c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2434,"method_rank":0}

The news offset Lilly's strong quarterly results.\nThe company said in a Phase 3 trial, patients taking a 36 milligram dose of its oral GLP-1 drug, orforglipron, without food and water restrictions showed an average weight loss of 12.4%, or 27.3 pounds, in a 72-week period. That's below the 15% average weight loss of rival Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Wegovy injectable treatment. Some on Wall Street were looking for orforglipron to come in closer to that level.\nIn an interview, Lilly CEO David Ricks argued that the company wasn't disappointed with the results even though they were \"one or two points below what (the) Street had.\" Ricks added the goal was to create a pill that was convenient to take, could be made on a huge scale, and would provide weight loss that was competitive with other GLP-1 medicines, \"and that's what we've achieved.\"\nThe company explained that it plans to seek regulatory approval of orforglipron by the end of the year.\nEli Lilly Reports Better-Than-Expected Q2 Results\nAlong with the orforglipron announcement, Lilly released its second-quarter financial data Thursday, reporting adjusted earnings per share of $6.31, with revenue up 38% year-over-year to $15.56 billion. Both exceeded Visible Alpha forecasts by a wide margin.\nThe gains came from soaring demand for its current weight-loss drug, Zepbound, which had a 172% jump in sales to $3.38 billion. Sales of another GLP-1, Mounjaro, used to treat both obesity and Type-2 diabetes, were up 68% to $5.20 billion.\nLilly raised its full-year adjusted EPS range to $21.75 to $23.00, compared to the earlier estimate of $20.78 to $22.28. It sees revenue of $60 billion to $62. billion, versus the previous outlook of $58 billion to $61 billion.\nShares of Eli Lilly traded at their lowest level since January 2024.

This is mostly due to Ripple’s (the company behind XRP) legal headwinds turning into tailwinds. The Securities and Exchange Commission is now much more lax when it comes to cryptocurrencies. Plus, President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump both have their own crypto tokens. Before the election, Trump vowed to promote cryptos.\nRipple’s legal wins and Trump’s reelection caused XRP to surge, and it is now up 508.8% from its 52-week low. The rally is warranted, since the administration’s attitude toward crypto gives it a window of a few years where it can aggressively expand and become an established part of the global banking system.\nMore News from Barchart\nXRP was originally built to streamline cross-border remittances as a bridge currency for financial institutions and to reduce the friction of traditional systems like SWIFT. Over the years, its use cases have expanded beyond payments to include smart contracts, decentralized identity protocols, tokenized assets, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\nAnd these are mainly the reasons why investors are so bullish on XRP going forward. But theres another reason worth factoring in, which could supercharge its performance.\nXRP Could Become One of the Highest-Yielding Cryptos\nXRP has underperformed its similarly sized peers until recently, and the gains have also plateaued in recent months. Unlike many other altcoins that allow staking, XRP has lacked any yields that give holders an incentive to buy and hold long term.\nThis is changing with the introduction of DeFi protocols like MoreMarkets, which enable XRP holders to earn substantial yields on their tokens without relinquishing control. By depositing XRP into specialized smart contract vaults, users can access automated DeFi strategies that were previously reserved for institutions. In turn, this could make XRP into one of the highest-yielding cryptocurrencies available.\nRetail investors would be able to get yields through the XRP Earn Account through self-custodial smart contract vaults that automatically allocate funds to vetted third-party DeFi strategies. The yields could be as high as 20%, although 5% is what you get during the initial testing phase. Investors have already deposited $2.5 million into the platform as of July 24.","content_hash":"7b46b4efee7eca7764366b2f23710fbd","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2402,"method_rank":0}

The stock has underperformed many of its midstream peers, and its return trails the Alps Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP), which is in the green this year.\nOne source of comfort for Energy Transfer investors has been its high dividend yield, which currently stands at almost 7.5% after the company announced an increase in its quarterly payout last month. In this article, we’ll explore whether ET stock is ready for a rebound after the frustrating YTD underperformance.\nMore News from Barchart\nThe Case for Midstream Energy Companies\nTo begin with, let’s build an investment case for midstream companies that are primarily involved in the transportation, storage, and processing of energy products. While the midstream energy industry does not witness outsized growth, two drivers could help support higher growth over the next few years. The first is artificial intelligence (AI), where tech companies are increasing their investments, including towards power-guzzling data centers, which looks like a structural tailwind for the energy sector.\nThe second is President Donald Trump’s trade and tariff policy. The U.S. is looking to push defense and energy exports in a bid to bridge the trade deficit with trading partners with whom it has a large deficit. We saw this play out with the E.U., and something similar could be on the table as the U.S. eventually signs a trade deal with China and India, two of the world’s biggest energy importers.\nHowever, despite the seemingly positive fundamentals, midstream energy stocks haven’t really rallied in 2025. This is in part due to the outperformance last year, where midstream stocks, including ET, delivered strong returns in anticipation of favorable policies under the Trump administration.\nWhile midstream stocks in general are having a tepid year, ET's underperformance stands out. For midstream companies like Energy Transfer, incremental growth comes either from acquisitions or new growth projects. ET reported a 13% year-over-year rise in its 2024 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), which was primarily led by the acquisition of Crestwood Equity Partners and WTG Midstream. However, the company expects its EBITDA growth to be 5% at the midpoint for 2025, as there wasn’t any bump from inorganic growth as we saw last year.","content_hash":"62beb9846fb444c8d56be70392b68abd","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2398,"method_rank":0}

The company’s revenue increased 41% year over year to more than $252.3 million, and net income tallied $44.8 million, up 84%. Its number of paid subscribers was 10.9 million (up from 8 million a year ago), and its daily active users neared 48 million (up from 34 million last year).\n“I’m happy to report another quarter of great results, driven by product-led growth, a delightful learning experience, and fast iteration,” wrote Luis von Ahn, Duolingo’s cofounder and CEO, in a letter to shareholders. “Our user growth and engagement remain strong, and our subscription performance and profitability exceeded expectations.”\nVon Ahn thinks there’s plenty of room to grow, too, especially as AI is helping boost user engagement and profitability.\n“We believe we’re still early in our user growth journey,” he continued. “We’ve delivered innovation while growing profitability—through strong performance across all subscription tiers, continued investment in our core product, and new subjects that help us increase engagement. We remain focused on building for long-term engagement and growth.”\nNotably, the blowout quarter comes after Duolingo was among the first large companies to publicly lean into AI—including replacing human contractors with AI. For a while, it appeared that the strategy was backfiring. But now, that’s not so clear.\nInvestors seem happy, as the price of Duolingo shares shot up significantly after hours. As of the closing bell at 4 p.m. ET, Duolingo stock was trading for less than $344 per share—but as of 4:10 p.m. ET, shares were trading for $426.60. That’s an increase of more than 24%.\nDuolingo’s shares had been on a downward slide in recent weeks. Over the past month, the stock was down more than 13%. But overall, it’s more than doubled during the past calendar year.\nThis post originally appeared at fastcompany.com\nSubscribe to get the Fast Company newsletter: http:\/\/fastcompany.com\/newsletters","content_hash":"80657006128c3bf7f67db553619fad91","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2328,"method_rank":0}

See today's video update from Mike above.) The key indexes stayed out of danger by hiding behind their big brothers, the Nasdaq giants that embody both defense and aggression in this bull market. Apple 's jailbreak rally extended for a third day, the big Mag 7 laggard trying to make it up in a hurry, while carrying the Nasdaq-100 to a fresh high and offsetting another cluster of post-earnings selloffs in individual stocks (today it was Trade Desk , Microchip Tech and Block ). For the week, the NDX was up some 3.7%, almost three percentage points ahead of the equal-weight S & P 500 , enabling the standard-weight S & P 500 to hold within 1% of last week's intraday peak. Over the course of the week, acute concern over last Friday's poor employment report and broader apprehension toward the volatility-prone month of August was salved by increasing expectations of a September Fed rate cut, a glass-half-full take on new tariffs that emphasizes the room for exemptions and a broader sense that the brute force of the AI-buildout theme is too tough to fight. There is some sense that the mere anticipation of seasonal turbulence and concern over how far the four-month rally has travelled had investors a bit cautious entering the week, forestalling or even preventing any consequential pullback from taking hold. Much commentary about the extreme punishment handed out to stocks of companies missing forecasts or offering less-than-stellar outlooks. Shows how far prices ran relative to the fundamentals for the typical company. But the aggregate earnings growth (+11.8% vs a year ago, says FactSet), heavily influenced by the half-dozen largest tech bellwethers, keeps the chains moving for now. The S & P 500 is at levels first reached two weeks ago, in a healthy uptrend, with widely acknowledged likely support around 6150, both the old February peak and around the 50-day moving average – less than a 4% drop from here. Sometimes an overbought market can come back into balance with some sideways churn, allowing the overheated groups to cool and leaning on fewer big names to stay supported. This is the ideal scenario for bulls. Plausible, but not guaranteed.","content_hash":"3194e1bf556a31c7d617fa9d2a1b7ff4","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2271,"method_rank":0}

Note that the practise played a crucial role in the Lehman Brothers collapse and subsequent 2008 financial crisis.\nSince the new guideline allows rehypothecation in crypto without the SEC or Fed's oversight, it's worse, Fischer argued.\nJoin the discussion with Scott Melker on Roundtable here.\nStaking crypto assets and receiving duplicate tokens for trading is no different from Lehman Brothers borrowing customers' assets and using them as collateral to make other bets in the market, she warned.","content_hash":"d89ebdbb79bb3eb52d8def0bd689e7d0","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2166,"method_rank":0}

It said demand would likely recover in 2026, driven by key sectors such as the photovoltaic industry and electronics.\nHowever, jewellery and silverware demand is likely to weaken further due to high prices, while coin and bar demand has been undercut by previous robust purchases and high prices, the bank added.\nOn the supply side, silver mine output continues to rise at a modest pace, HSBC said.\nThe bank's supply-demand model projects a silver deficit of 206 million ounces in 2025, widening from a 167 million ounce deficit in 2024. That is expected to narrow to 126 million ounces in 2026.\nHSBC also said a weaker U.S. dollar this year, as forecast by HSBC research, is silver positive, while ongoing debates over Federal Reserve rate cuts and central bank policies could impact prices going forward.\n(Reporting by Sherin Elizabeth Varghese and Noel John in Bengaluru; Editing by Jan Harvey)","content_hash":"cfb2cd3c7efce0c4feb55b2609fafb22","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":1876,"method_rank":0}
