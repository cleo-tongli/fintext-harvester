His own co-host, New York University business school professor and entrepreneur Scott Galloway, who's 60, invested $800,000 in both Apple and Amazon back in 2009. Today, those investments total $40 million, a cornerstone of his $150 million net worth.
Elson wants the same opportunity to invest in the tech companies defining his generation. He sees those chances in OpenAI and SpaceX, standout innovators that have soared to valuations of $300 billion or more.
The problem? Both companies are private.
OpenAI and SpaceX top a growing class of companies making it big without the public markets. Rather than expose themselves to public market scrutiny and quarterly earnings pressures, these companies are raising round after round of fresh funds from venture capital firms. Over the last 10 years, global startup funding has more than tripled, with VC investments projected to hit $400 billion this year, according to data from PitchBook.
""The people who have access to the highest quality companies that are creating the most amount of value, i.e., OpenAI and SpaceX, are the people in VC who are already rich,"" Elson said. ""That's a big problem for our generation.""
Seduced by fabulous success stories like Galloway's, and empowered by the proliferation of digital trading platforms plus the investing advice on platforms like TikTok, Zoomers have become a generation of investors. The average Gen Z investor starts trading at 19 years old, compared to baby boomers' typical kickoff at 35 years old.
But there's also a gnawing sense that Gen Z missed out on the boom times. And they're not entirely wrong.
The public markets now offer fewer stocks to choose from and higher price tags. Companies are waiting 14 years on average to go public, Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida's Warrington School of Business, has found. More private companies are valued in the tens and even hundreds of billions, a feat usually reserved for public companies.
In 2025, an IPO is less a promise of what's to come for a company and more a signal that you've already missed out on its biggest gains. That shift has more investors setting their sights on secondary markets, where stock purchases of private companies are limited to traders accredited by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. And whereas the public markets are open to anyone with a brokerage account, just 13% of Americans qualify for that accreditation.
""It almost feels like a private members-only club,"" says Vivian Tu, the 31-year-old personal finance educator behind 'Your Rich BFF.' ""If you're already rich, you can invest in this stuff, and if you're not, sucks to suck. You're locked out of the club.""
Those rules aren't sitting well with Gen Z investors.
Warren Buffett famously advised traders to invest in what they know. That's what Galloway did back in 2009 when he bought shares in Apple. The iPhone was still relatively new, but it was clear the technology was a game changer. He could get in relatively early and profit from the stock's exponential rise as Apple built on the momentum of its spectacular innovation.
These days, some of the most exciting tech companies innovate without needing to IPO. Elson points to OpenAI's release of ChatGPT in 2022, which drew 1 million users in 5 days. ""If we were living in the 1980s, there's a very, very high likelihood that OpenAI would've been public at that point,"" Elson says. Investors would have said: ""Oh my God, this is an incredible tool. I want to buy some stock.""
But most investors were frozen out. In March, OpenAI was valued at $300 billion — a 900% spike in two years. The major beneficiaries included Microsoft, VC megafirm Sequoia Capital, and tech billionaire Peter Thiel.
The critique that the public markets don't create enough value for mom and pop investors is virtually as old as public markets themselves. But the markets hit an inflection point in 2021 when a record 1,035 IPOs, raising a staggering $286 billion, were followed by an abrupt collapse. Investors, desperate for liquidity, began turning more to secondary markets to sell portions of their stakes. If companies can raise plenty of capital while keeping their investors happy, that has increasingly allowed them to put off their IPOs indefinitely.
""It's pretty simple: Why go public if you have access to all the benefits while staying private?"" says Deedy Das, a principal at Menlo Ventures. Das sums up the thinking of top-dollar startups this way: ""I have all this administrative burden off my shoulders; I don't have to have that predictable revenue; I can take riskier bets; I don't have to explain to retail investors what my vision is. I can just run my business.""
With so much pent-up demand, it's been extraordinarily expensive for retail investors to get in when a hot company finally goes public.
Take Figma, the design software maker, and its recent red-hot IPO.
When it debuted in July, Figma's stock opened at $85 a share, more than double its $33-a-share IPO price. Since the overwhelming majority of IPO shares were allocated to institutional investors and not retail investors — which is typical for public listings — most retail investors paid a significant premium. At the end of the day, the frenzy had sent Figma's valuation soaring to more than 60 times its revenue in the biggest first-day jump for a multibillion-dollar tech company in decades. By the first week of August, however, Figma had shed billions of dollars in market value as the stock came back down to earth, leaving many of those same retail investors holding the bag.
As of August 11, Figma's stock was valued less than its opening day price, meaning any retail investor who backed the company on its first day of trading has since lost money. Institutions that bought in at the IPO price, on the other hand, are holding stock that's still worth more than double what they paid for it.
Of course, there are still plenty of public companies creating massive wealth for shareholders. Palantir's stock has surged over 1,800% since it began trading in 2020. Circle's shares have jumped 140% above their opening price in the crypto company's June IPO, though the stock has fluctuated wildly in that period. The public markets are still broadly considered the best place for companies to get returns to their employees and investors, since their liquid nature allows shareholders to cash out anytime.
But the biggest stock gains will always be reserved for the savvy investor who spots a big opportunity early. And increasingly, these opportunities are not in the public markets. Lots of investors — including Zoomers like Elson — want in on the action happening on secondary markets.
""Because of this dynamic where great companies have no incentive to go public, giving access to retail is heavily in our generation's financial interest,"" Elson said.
While this might present bigger opportunities, it also carries significant risks.
It's galling to retail investors that there's so much private company stock floating around — but they can't get to it.
Getting your hands on private stocks generally means buying them from early investors that hold large chunks of equity or from early employees, who got stock as part of their compensation agreements. These so-called secondary sales generally must be approved by, if not facilitated by, the startup itself. And not a lot of companies, OpenAI included, are inclined to allow their employees or investors to sell shares on secondary platforms.
In an attempt to democratize access to private company equity, platforms like EquityZen, Forge Global and Hiive, which broker secondary investments into pre-IPO companies, are picking up steam. UBS projects the secondary market will hit a record-breaking $180 billion this year, up from $156 billion in secondary transactions in 2024.
EquityZen, which launched in 2013, says its user base has doubled in the past year; more than 770,000 individual investors and institutions are now registered on the marketplace. The company says it has brokered secondary sales for companies like Circle and Omada Health before their IPOs, as well as other startups that still haven't gone public, like Impossible Foods. The company wouldn't comment on whether it's facilitated any deals with OpenAI or SpaceX.
These deals tend to be costlier than regular trading. Most secondary market platforms charge fees, often 5% of the sale, and require investors to put up anywhere from $5,000 to $100,000 or more to participate.
The bigger catch is that not just anyone can access these platforms. On most major secondary platforms, investors must meet the SEC's stringent bar for accreditation: a net worth of over $1 million, excluding their primary residence, or a salary of at least $200,000 for the past two years and the expectation of earning that same income again.
The SEC says the rule was set up to protect retail investors, who tend to underperform the broader market with their stock picks. These investors are generally advised to back index funds over individual stocks to minimize the chance of catastrophic losses. The private markets are even more risky since, without disclosure requirements, private deals can obscure key details about a startup's operations and pricing.
But the requirement has been criticized by some as paternalistic, particularly amid surging activity on the private markets. After all, Americans can engage in plenty of high-risk activities with their money, from gambling to cryptocurrency investing to prediction market betting, with little to no regulation.
""In a world in which anyone can invest in any meme coin they want, how reasonable is it that you're not allowed to invest in startups?"" said Peter Walker, head of insights at Carta, a software platform that helps private companies manage their cap tables.
In June, the US House of Representatives passed the Equal Opportunity for All Investors Act, which would allow investors who passed a financial literacy test to qualify for accreditation, paving the way for them to make private market bets. The Senate isn't yet scheduled to review the bill, however, and President Donald Trump has not said if he would support it.
In a burgeoning market with minimal oversight, the stakes are high. Linqto, once a prominent marketplace for pre-IPO shares, declared bankruptcy in July. The SEC is currently investigating claims that the platform sold securities to non-accredited investors and charged its users excessive margins. The company told BI it had also discovered ""serious defects"" in the business ""that raise questions about what customers actually own.""
It's unclear whether the thousands of investors who locked their cash away in Linqto will ever see that money again. Linqto said it's working with an unsecured creditors committee in its bankruptcy proceedings to develop a plan to reorganize the company and ""maximize value for customers.""
As for getting a piece of OpenAI or SpaceX, a few financial firms are creating workarounds. In one example, exchange-traded funds like the ERShares Private-Public Crossover ETF can buy stakes in top private companies, and retail traders can buy those ETFs on the public markets. In December, the fund announced that SpaceX had become its top holding. But without regular public disclosures of SpaceX's finances, investors can only guess at the company's real-time value.
In Europe, where SEC regulations don't apply, the stock trading app Robinhood has sold blockchain ""tokens"" of OpenAI and SpaceX stock. The tokens attempt to mirror the price of stocks without actually giving retail traders any stake in the company. Last month, OpenAI posted a statement on X saying the company had not partnered with Robinhood and that the tokens ""are not OpenAI equity.""
Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev explained the app's approach in an interview with Bloomberg last month. ""One of the biggest opportunities and also a big tragedy is that private markets are where the bulk of the interesting appreciation and exposure is nowadays,"" he said. ""It's a shame that it's so difficult to get exposure in the US. We're obviously working to solve that.""
Matt Kennedy, a senior strategist at the IPO-focused firm Renaissance Capital, says it's perfectly understandable that the market's slowdown may be frustrating to new investors. Back in 2021, new subscribers to the firm's newsletter asked one question more than any other: How can I invest in pre-IPO companies?
""There's this sense that, at the IPO, it's already too late. They want to get in on the ground floor,"" Kennedy said. But the firm advises investors to ""be careful what you wish for.""
""Yes, you're not going to get that $20-million-in-annual-sales, fast-growing tech company that could be a behemoth,"" Kennedy said. ""But you're also not going to get those less established companies without a solid track record. There's more margin of safety with a company that has $100 million or more in revenue.""
Barry Ritholtz, the founder of Ritholtz Wealth Management, echoed that sentiment. ""A private company like OpenAI comes along, and suddenly people are salivating and getting FOMO and saying, I could pick the next one,"" Ritholtz said. ""History tells us, the odds are you cannot.""
Many young investors see those risks as worth taking — if not for the potential financial upside, then for the crash course in market literacy.
Juliette Richert, a senior associate at The Artemis Fund, has made three angel investments since joining the fund three years ago. Richert, who's now 26, says she hasn't seen any returns yet. Even if she never does, she thinks those bets were valuable opportunities for her early investment learnings.
""Can I burn the money for the sake of learning something rather than anticipating any specific return?"" she said. ""For early investors like myself, I think that's a really healthy way to go about it.""
It's the Gen Z way. Rather than follow well-trodden paths of previous generations, Gen Z investors are determined to pounce on opportunities where they find them and seize their financial destinies.
""There's this desire for control and autonomy, the 'American dynamism' mindset: make your own way, versus depending on the system,"" Richert said.
Throw in prediction markets, fractional real estate, and collectibles from sports cards to sneakers, and it's clear that Gen Z isn't just investing differently — they're redefining what ""investing"" even means.
""Young people are smart,"" Galloway said in conversation with Elson on a recent episode of their podcast. ""They said, you know what, fuck this. I can't buy a home. Stocks are crazy expensive. So what am I going to do? I'm going to create my own asset classes. And I'm going to create my own volatility.""

Norway’s $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund will stay invested in Israel, NBIM deputy CEO says
When asked about Norway's sovereign wealth fund winding down its investments in Israeli companies, Trond Grande, deputy CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), said the fund would continue to be invested in Israel.
NBIM manages the fund on behalf of the Norwegian population.
""In this benchmark — this is kind of anchored all the way up to Parliament here in Norway — Israel is part of our benchmark,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday. ""So that's a sign that we are [still going] to be invested there.""
On Monday, NBIM announced that, amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza, it was ""simplifying"" its investments in Israel. That would involve selling all holdings of Israeli companies that aren't in its equity benchmark index ""as soon as possible,"" and terminating contracts with external asset managers in Israel to bring all remaining investments in the country in house. The move came after a request from the Norwegian Finance Ministry that NBIM review its management mandate and its investments in Israeli firms.
At the end of June, the fund was invested in 61 Israeli companies, 11 of which were not in the Finance Ministry's equity benchmark index.
""Due to the conflict and due to opinion here in Norway, I should say there's a lot of scrutiny around specifically our holdings in Israeli companies, and that has come under increased scrutiny over summer and into the last week,"" Grande told CNBC.
""What we're doing now is really not down-weighing, I wouldn't put it like that, but we are trying to simplify our portfolio in Israeli equities, because we have ethical guidelines as well. What's key to us is that we're not invested in companies that could be in some way, shape or form, contributing to violating the ethical guidelines that we have.""

U.K. unemployment rate at a 4-year high
Hannover Re shares fall as LA wildfires eat into first-half earnings
Shares of Hannover Re were 2% lower by 8:48 a.m. London time (3:48 a.m. ET), making it one of the worst performers on the Stoxx 600 index.
The German reinsurer maintained its full-year guidance on Tuesday, after second-quarter net profit came in at 833.5 million euros ($968 million).
Analysts had been expecting net income for the quarter to reach 837.2 million euros, according to LSEG data.
Hannover Re said its results came despite ""high catastrophe losses"" in the first quarter and noted that large losses were ""far more moderate"" in the second quarter. Expenditures for large losses totaled 976.1 million euros in the first half, driven by the California wildfires that gripped the state earlier this year.
""Overall, we can look back on a good business performance in the first half-year,"" CEO Clemens Jungsthöfel said in a statement alongside the results.
""We have further strengthened Hannover Re's resilience and continue to invest in our efficient positioning and capacity for innovation. Even in volatile times, we are thus able to offer our clients high-quality risk protection.""

U.S. tourists spending less in Britain, retail body says
Figures from the Association of International Retail show American visitors spent less in the U.K. last year compared to 2019.
The group says that the decision to end tax-free shopping for international visitors back in 2021 has meant that Americans now wait until getting to mainland Europe to make their purchases. The Association also advocates for VAT-free shopping for international visitors coming into the U.K., claiming it could add a significant boost to the economy.

World’s largest sovereign wealth fund reports 5.7% first-half return
Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund — the largest of its kind in the world — posted a return of 5.7% in the first half of the year, citing strong returns on financial stocks.
On its equity investments, which accounted for 70.6% of holdings at the end of June, the fund saw a 6.7% return. Its fixed income investments saw a 3.3% return, while its real estate investments returned 4%.
The fund's unlisted renewable energy infrastructure holdings returned 9.4%.
Overall, the fund's return was 5 basis points lower than the return on its benchmark index.
""The result is driven by good returns in the stock market, particularly in the financial sector,"" Nicolai Tangen, CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) — which manages the fund on behalf of the Norwegian population — said in a statement on Tuesday.
The strength of the Norwegian krone weighed on the fund's value in the first half. As the krone gained around 11.5% against the U.S. dollar in the reporting period, it contributed to a fall in value of 1 billion kroner ($97.7 million), NBIM said.
Set up in the 1990s to invest excess revenues from Norway's oil and gas industry, the fund currently invests in more than 8,500 companies across the world. Owning almost 1.5% of all listed companies, it's the world's biggest single investor in stocks.
In the first quarter of the year, the fund reported a $40 billion loss after a sell off in the tech sector.
The results come a day after NBIM announced it would sell all its investments in Israeli companies that aren't in its equity benchmark index ""as soon as possible,"" and terminate contracts with external asset managers in Israel.
""These measures were taken in response to extraordinary circumstances,"" Tangen said on Monday. ""The situation in Gaza is a serious humanitarian crisis. We are invested in companies that operate in a country at war, and conditions in the West Bank and Gaza have recently worsened. In response, we will further strengthen our due diligence.""

Here are the opening calls
Good morning from London, and welcome to CNBC's live blog covering all the action and business news in European financial markets on Thursday.
Futures data from IG suggests a generally positive open for European indexes, with London's FTSE 100 seen opening 0.15% higher, France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX are seen opening around the flatline, and Italy's FTSE MIB slightly higher.
The pullback in sentiment among European bourses comes ahead of the latest indicator of the state of health of major regional economies, with gross domestic product readings from the U.K. and European Union on Thursday.
European markets had ended the day higher on Wednesday, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index rising 0.55% after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rallied to new records yesterday. Investors are gearing up for more inflation data to assess the state of the U.S. economy.
The producer price index, due Thursday, will be significant factors in the direction interest rates take at the Federal Reserve's next meeting in September.

What to keep an eye on Tuesday
There are no major earnings reports from Europe on Tuesday, but analysts will be looking out for the latest U.K. jobs data, due at 7 a.m. London time, and economic sentiment data from Germany.
Investors are also keeping an eye on the latest U.S. consumer price index report, hoping to gather potential insight into how the Federal Reserve will handle short-term interest rates, especially as the S&P 500 hovers near an all-time high.
Economists polled by Dow Jones expect the index to advance 0.2% month over month in July, and 2.8% on an annualized basis. So-called core consumer price index, which strips out food and energy from the reading, is expected to climb 0.3% month over month and 3.1% year over year.

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) are up +0.63%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) are up +0.58%.
Stocks gained ground after today’s US CPI report was largely in line with market expectations, thus strengthening expectations for a Fed rate cut at the September meeting. On a year-on-year basis, the July headline CPI of +2.7% y/y was slightly weaker than expected, but the core CPI of +3.1% y/y was slightly stronger than expected. The chances for a Fed rate cut at its Sep 16-17 meeting improved to 95% after today's CPI report from 88% on Monday.
The 2-year T-note yield fell -3.8 bp to 3.731% on the CPI news. However, the 10-year T-note rose by +1.0 bp after a new attack by President Trump on Fed Chair Powell. Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post today that he is considering allowing a lawsuit against Mr. Powell related to construction work at Fed buildings. The markets are concerned about the inflation risks involved with the attempt by the Trump administration to push Mr. Powell out of the Fed as a means to push interest rates lower.
The July US CPI report of +0.2% m/m was in line with market expectations. The July CPI year-on-year figure of +2.7% y/y was unchanged from June and was slightly weaker than expectations for a +0.1 point increase to +2.8%. The July US core CPI report of +0.3% m/m was in line with expectations. The July year-on-year core CPI figure of +3.1% y/y was up from June's +2.9% and was slightly stronger than market expectations of +3.0%. July's headline CPI of +2.7% y/y and core CPI of +3.1% y/y were up from the post-Covid 4.25-year lows of +2.3% and +2.8%, respectively, posted earlier this year.
President Trump signed an executive order overnight extending the US-China tariff truce by 90 days through November 10 to allow more time for negotiators to reach a final deal. That was in line with reporting yesterday by CNBC. The executive order postponed today's original deadline. That followed previous news that Nvidia and AMD agreed to pay the US government 15% of their revenues on sales of certain lower-powered AI chips sold to China in exchange for export licenses to allow those sales. However, Bloomberg reported today that China's government urged Chinese companies to avoid using Nvidia's H20 processors, particularly for government-related purposes.
The markets are awaiting this Friday's Trump-Putin summit in Alaska for any progress in ending the Russian-Ukrainian war. President Trump on Monday downplayed expectations of a breakthrough, saying the summit is a ""feel-out meeting"" to end the war in Ukraine. Also, recent comments from Ukrainian President Zelenskiy dampened hopes for a quick end to the war when he rejected any talk of Ukraine ceding territory to Russia.
In recent tariff news, President Trump early Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China, which was to expire on Tuesday, for another 90 days. Last Wednesday, President Trump announced that he will impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. Still, companies would be eligible for exemptions if they demonstrate a commitment to building their products in the US. However, the US will levy a separate tax on imports of electronic products that employ semiconductors. Also, President Trump announced last Wednesday that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil. Last Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced ""within the next week or so."" According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.
The market's focus this week is on corporate earnings results and any new trade or tariff news. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to fall by -1,000 to 225,000. Also on Thursday, the July final-demand PPI is expected to increase to +2.5% y/y from +2.3% y/y in June, and the July PPI ex-food and energy is expected to rise to +2.9% y/y from +2.6% y/y in June. On Friday, July US retail sales are expected to climb +0.5% m/m and retail sales ex-autos are expected to rise +0.3% m/m. Also on Friday, July manufacturing production is expected to remain unchanged m/m. Finally, the University of Michigan's Aug US consumer sentiment index is expected to climb by +0.3 to 62.0.
Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 95% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and 62% at the following meeting on October 28-29.
Earnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 82% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates.
Overseas stock markets today are higher. The Euro Stoxx 50 is up +0.06%. China's Shanghai Composite rallied to a 10-month high and closed up +0.50%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 today closed up +2.15% and posted a new record high.
Interest Rates
September 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) today are down -4.5 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield is up +1.0 bp at 4.295%. T-notes received an initial boost from the CPI report but then fell back after President Trump launched another broadside against Fed Chair Powell regarding construction costs on Fed buildings. T-note prices have support from today's -2.0 bp decline in the 10-year inflation expectations rate to 2.380%.
European government bond yields today are trading higher. The 10-year German bund yield is up +4.9 bp at 2.745%. The 10-year UK gilt yield is up +5.4 bp at 4.619%.
Swaps are discounting the chances at 5% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.
US Stock Movers
The Magnificent Seven are all trading higher today except for Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA). Nvidia is trading slightly lower after a report that the Chinese government is discouraging Chinese companies from buying Nvidia AI chips even if the US government allows the sale. Meta (META) is the best performer of the Seven with a gain of more than +2%.
Chip stocks are leading the Nasdaq 100 index higher, with gains of 5% or more in Microchip Technology (MCHP), ON Semiconductors (ON), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), and Texas Instruments (TXN).
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is showing outsized gains today due to gains of more than +3% in Goldman Sachs (GS) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH).
Hanesbrands (HBI) is up more than +20% after the Financial Times reported that a deal is nearing for Gildan Activewear to acquire Hanesbrands for as much as $5 billion in enterprise value.
Paramount Skydance (PSKY) is up +7% after Guggenheim started coverage on the company with a buy rating and a $13 price target due to a positive outlook for the merged entities of Paramount Global and Skydance Media.
Starbucks (SBUX) is up about +2% on an upgrade to outperform from neutral from Baird.
Cardinal Health (CAH) is down more than -8% after its fiscal Q4 operating income was below market expectations.
Getty Images (GETY) is down more than -8% on disappointment after releasing Q2 earnings and guidance.

The Russell 2000 (-0.16%) rose to the moment, trailed by the S&P 500 (-0.25%), Nasdaq (-0.30%), and Dow (-0.45%). They all started the day in the green, but dipped below the line intraday. Meanwhile, the Cboe Volatility Index closed out the day up 7.5%.

Retail-Popular Stocks Are the Stars In After Hour Earnings
While a significant portion of today's earnings went out this morning, there's a star-studded cast of earnings due out after the close. In particular, retail-popular names which will be closely scrutinized.
After market close, we'll be getting results from satellite player AST SpaceMobile ASTS, airtaxi firm Archer Aviation (ACHR) , and hydrogen energy company Plug Power (PLUG) . Plus, we'll expect commentary from pre-revenue Sam Altman-backed nuclear upstart Oklo (OKLO) .
We're over the mid-day hump. These are the three big trends making moves intraday:
Dow, Russell Sag; S&P and Nasdaq Stay Flat
Despite some big movers within the indexes, the Dow Jones (-0.4%) is the only major U.S. index breaking in a particular direction. The other three household names are fairly flat, namely the Nasdaq (+0.00%) and S&P 500 (-0.07%). But even the Russell 2000 is pretty tame (-0.10%) for the moment.
Marijuana Reclassification is Back on the Docket
President Donald Trump has weed stocks moving again today, amid reports that his administration is looking into reclassifying marijuana. His predecessor made similar strides, but the Drug Enforcement Agency still has yet to complete its rule-making process on the devil's lettuce.
As a result of the chatter, some marijuana-focused exchange-traded funds are making moves today, like the AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF (MSOS) (+20%) and Amplify Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ) (+19.2%).
Monday.com and C3.ai Really Wish It Wasn't Monday
Software earnings have been particularly strong this earnings season, with a healthy number of beats and raises.
However, Monday.com (MNDY) (-27%) is not among them. It's having a really bad Monday after releasing its earnings this morning. Rising R&D costs were to blame for pushing the productivity software firm back into a loss, overshadowing its 27% year-over-year march in revenue.
C3.ai (AI) (-22%) is another name wishing that Monday never came. The enterprise AI company is similarly-situated, a tech company getting hammered after showing their earnings. Announcing preliminary results for its latest quarter, C3.ai's sales declined year-over-year, while its loss widened, a result that CEO Thomas Siebel called ""completely unacceptable."" The company's planned earnings call is set for Sept. 3.

Morning Movers: Albermarle, TKO Group, Electronic Arts, Intel
The market has been open for nearly an hour now. Here are the stocks making moves:
Albemarle
The world's largest EV battery producer has gyrated in recent days, but it's up today after closing a key lithium mine in China. The move has helped catapult lithium prices. Albermarle (ALB) is up 8% today, making it the best-performer in the S&P 500.
TKO Group Holdings
TKO Group Holdings (TKO) , the parent company of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), has sold the exclusive broadcast rights on its 43 annual live events to Paramount. The deal is worth $7.7 billion over 7 years, starting next year. TKO is up 6.3% on the news.
Electronic Arts
Electronic Arts EA just hit an all-time high after a weekend playtest of forthcoming title Battlefield 6. The free weekend event was a massive success, with the company saying over 5 millon players participated. On game app Steam, the game saw a peak of 521,000 concurrent players, an all-time high for the franchise. EA is up 3.6%.
Intel
Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is reportedly on his way to the White House, per WSJ, just days after President Donald Trump said that he ""must resign"" because of ""ties to Chinese businesses."" The news of the meeting has been well-received by investors, who had sold the beleaguered chipmaker on Trump's comments. Today, Intel is up 4.2% to start the morning.
Morning Headlines
Aside from that, here are the other stories making headlines this morning:
President Donald Trump has announced that he will deploy the National Guard in Washington, D.C. in an effort to tackle crime, remove homeless encampments, and ""liberate"" the city.

S&P 500 scores upgrades from UBS and Citi as BoFA Survey shows bullishness
This morning, the S&P 500 is scoring two upgrades from investment banks, who are feeling more bullish on the index. UBS (UBS) and Citi (C) are both hiking their year-end targets, while UBS is issuing its first-ever 2026 year-end target.
The two are the latest names on Wall Street to raise their respective outlooks, citing stronger fundamentals and less perceived impacts from tariffs.
Bookends don't tend to be big days for earnings, but per TipRanks, we're set for about 137 earnings reports today. Many of these reports are already in this morning, including gold mining companies Barrick Mining B and Franco-Nevada (FNV) , productivity software Monday.com (MNDY) , and pharmaceutical company Roivant (ROIV) , among others.
Here's what is out among today's largest reports:
Results from one-time retail-favorites AMC Entertainment (AMC) are also out this morning. There's more to come, too. After market close, we'll be getting results from AST SpaceMobile ASTS, Archer Aviation (ACHR) , and Plug Power (PLUG) .
Economic Data
There is no big economic data inbound today, just the 3-month and 6-month bill auction at 11:30 a.m. ET today. However, investors will have their eyes peeled for commentary around this week's most-anticipated drop: inflation.
That report is due out tomorrow, sure to be a market-mover. Since the market tumbled after tariff turbulence in April, economists and Americans have held heightened inflation expectations. That has yet to really show itself, but some hawkish Fed leaders like Alberto Musalem say they expect tariff impacts to crop up in the prints this quarter.",302d8af65ddfaa3690c145652b2cceb8,trafilatura,7537,0

The fact is, however, beverage behemoths Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) and PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) are quite different. That's why their stocks have been moving in opposing directions for over a year now. Since mid-May of 2024, Coke shares are up a solid 10%, while PepsiCo's stock is down 20%.
Is this disparity an omen or an opportunity? For a long while, it was the former. As time has marched on and the underpinnings of their respective performances have evolved, however, it's now become the latter.
Comparing and contrasting Coca-Cola and PepsiCo
They may both be in the beverage business, but they're not the same.
Coca-Cola, for instance, is only in the drinks market. Its brands include Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juices, Dasani water, Costa coffee, and of course, its powerhouse namesake cola, just to name a few. But it's still only drinks. Not so for PepsiCo. While it's also the name behind Mountain Dew, Tropicana, and Gatorade, the company also owns snack chip company Frito-Lay, which makes Doritos, Cheetos, and a range of Frito and Lay's branded products. Moreover, PepsiCo owns Quaker Oats.
These aren't the only differences, though. Whereas PepsiCo owns the majority of its bottling and chip production facilities, Coca-Cola has made a point of getting out of the bottling business so it can focus on what it does best. That's marketing. Third-party bottlers near the geographical markets they serve now handle the majority of Coke's production work, taking on the cost-based risk of doing so.
This nuanced difference is the chief reason for the decidedly different performances of these two companies' stocks. In an inflation-riddled environment like the one we've been stuck in since 2023, Coke's margins remain relatively high since the bulk of the cost in this business is borne by bottling itself. PepsiCo is its own bottler, though, and as such is forced to absorb higher materials, facility, and logistics costs even if it does enjoy more direct control of its production.
The company's exposure to the snack chip market has proven particularly problematic. Although PepsiCo is mostly able to manage its costs and pricing for its beverages, that's not the case for its potato chips and similar snacks. The necessary price increases on these goods have not been well received by consumers. North America's food business slipped 2% year over year during the second quarter of this year, for example, leading to a 13% decline on a constant-currency operating basis. Those results extend a long streak of weakness for PepsiCo's business, too, going all the way back to the last half of 2023. It was only a matter of time before this headwind finally started being priced into the stock.
These sellers, however, have arguably overshot their target.
Plenty of bullish argument
There's plenty of evidence to support that argument, too, like PepsiCo stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Its trailing-12-month P/E currently stands at 18 times this year's projected earnings of $8.01 per share. That's cheap for this stock, particularly in comparison to Coke stock's 2025 P/E ratio of more than 23.
However, the biggest value disparity lies in these two stocks' differing dividends. Coca-Cola's forward-looking yield of 2.9% is respectable, but markedly less than PepsiCo's projected dividend yield of 4%. There's little risk of PepsiCo's dividend not being paid in the future, or, for that matter, its 53-year streak of annual dividend growth being broken anytime soon. The $5.56 worth of per-share dividends it's dished out over the course of the past 12 months is considerably less than the $8.16 per share it earned last year, despite all the aforementioned challenges, as well as the similar bottom-line figure it expects to report for this year.
Perhaps the chief reason PepsiCo stock is fizzing with underappreciated value at this time, however, is the fact that it's performed so poorly even though the company is finally figuring out -- and fixing -- what's been holding it back the most lately.
One of these initiatives is a rethinking of its products. As an example, its recent acquisitions of Siete Foods and Sabra offer instant access to authentic brands in the Mexican and Middle Eastern segments (respectively) of the food market at a time when that authenticity is in demand. The company's also responding to the ongoing consumer shift away from sugary soft drinks and salty snacks and toward healthier options. It's putting more focus on its Simply line of snack chips, for instance, which have no artificial colors or flavors. At the same time, following its recent acquisition of health-minded soda brand Poppi, PepsiCo has unveiled a new prebiotic cola.
It's not just an overhaul of its product lineup, though. PepsiCo is also embracing technology as a means of improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of its supply chain, where it needs help the most. Although this part of the turnaround journey began over a year ago, its AI-powered warehouse robotics are now starting to demonstrate their intended efficiency, while its partnership with Salesforce to create tailor-made AI customer service agents is showing promise as a time-saving and cost-lowering service solution.
The top is popped
There's still work to be done, to be sure. However, the company is moving in the right direction, especially on the cost-cutting front, but also in terms of product relevancy. We're only seeing slight upside from these initiatives so far, but a slow start is to be expected within the consumer goods industry, which requires lots of tedious production steps and suffers from a slow-moving sales pipeline anyway.
Just because the business is a slow one doesn't necessarily mean investors have plenty of time to think things over, though. Once the majority of investors recognize that PepsiCo's revamp is exactly what the company needs, the undervalued stock could start moving pretty quickly to a richer valuation.
In fact, it's starting to look like this is happening anyway. While still well below their mid-2023 peak, PepsiCo shares are also still up 12% from their June low. That's the biggest uninterrupted gain this ticker's seen in a few years, suggesting that at least some investors are starting to become believers in the turnaround effort.
In other words, if you're interested, you might not want to linger on the sidelines much longer just waiting to see what happens. This stock could run away from you pretty quickly, in light of everything that's changed for the better in just the past few months.

This is Western Australia mining territory. Buried in this vast terrain is a massive pit, full of what looks like mounds of worthless dirt.
But appearances can be deceiving: this pit is home to a million-tonne stockpile containing critical minerals, better known as rare earths, which are crucial for making electric vehicles, wind turbines and defence equipment.
And Australia is betting big on this discovery with a billion dollar loan to a mining company to extract these metals - and disrupt a supply chain that China has monopolised.
Will the gamble pay off?
China's chokehold on rare earths has hit home with US President Donald Trump's trade wars. When Beijing restricted exports, a powerful bargaining chip in tariff negotiations, it sent manufacturers around the world into their war rooms. China, they realised with alarm, had the power to stop their factories.
Ford even halted production of its popular Explorer SUV for a week at one of its Chicago plants - a bold move while grappling with Trump's tariffs.
A month later, CEO Jim Farley revealed the pause was triggered by a shortage of rare earths, admitting the company was still struggling to secure reliable supply. ""It's day to day,"" Mr Farley told Bloomberg TV.
Beijing has since agreed to let rare earth minerals and magnets flow to the United States, which eased the bottleneck.
But without a US-China trade deal, the fear is that the disruption could return.
""The West dropped the ball – that's the reality. And China was in for the long run. It saw the benefit and was willing to invest in it,"" says Jacques Eksteen, chair for extractive metallurgy at Curtin University.
Why rare earths matter
The phrase ""rare earths"" - referring to 17 elements on the periodic table which are lightweight, super strong and resistant to heat, making them useful in small electric motors - is something of a misnomer.
""Rare earths are not rare or scarce. Gold is scarce, but it's not a critical material,"" Professor Eksteen explains.
Rare earths are critical, however. Take the average electric vehicle – there might be rare earths-based motors in dozens of components from side mirrors and speakers to windscreen wipers and braking sensors.
The problem is therefore not amount, but the fact ""somewhere in the supply chain you've got one or maybe a few countries controlling that bottleneck"", Professor Eksteen adds.
In the 90s, Europe and France in particular had a prominent rare earths industry. Today, almost all these minerals come from China, which has spent decades mining and refining at scale.
China now accounts for more than half of global rare earth mining, and almost 90% of processing.
The US sources 80% of its rare earth imports from China, while the European Union relies on China for about 98% of its supply.
""China has since very deliberately and overtly sought to control the market for the purposes of supporting their downstream manufacturing and defence industries,"" says Dan McGrath, head of rare earths for Iluka Resources, in between driving us around the company's vast Eneabba site.
But Mr McGrath, and Iluka, are hoping to make a dent in that control - even if it wasn't necessarily in the company's original plan.
For decades, Iluka has been mining zircon in Australia - a key ingredient in ceramics, and titanium dioxide used in the pigmentation of paint, plastics and paper.
It just so happens the byproducts of these mineral sands include dysprosium and terbium - some of the most sought-after rare earths.
Over the years, Iluka has built up the stockpile, and is now worth more than $650m (£440m).
This was the easy part, however. The processing or refining is another matter altogether.
""They're chemically very similar so to try and separate them requires a huge number of stages,"" Professor Eksteen explained.
""Also, you've got residues and wastes that you have to deal with out of this industry, and that's problematic. They often produce radioactive materials. It comes at a cost.""
And that is one of the reasons the Australian government is loaning Iluka A$1.65bn ($1bn; £798m) to build a refinery to meet demand for rare earths which Iluka sees growing by 50-170% by the end of the decade.
""We expect to be able to supply a significant proportion of Western demand for rare earths by 2030. Our customers recognise that having an independent, secure and sustainable supply chain outside of China is fundamental for the continuity of their business,"" says Mr McGrath.
""This refinery and Iluka's commitment to the rare earth business is an alternative to China.""
But the refinery will take another two years to build and come online.
""Without the strategic partnership we have with the Australian government, a rare earths project would not be economically viable,"" Mr McGrath says.
A strategic necessity
China's recent willingness to turn supply of rare earths on and off has spurred trading partners to diversify their suppliers.
Iluka says because automakers for example plan their production years in advance, it is already fielding requests for when its refinery does come online.
Rare earths are critical to the green transition, electric vehicles, and defence technologies – making their control a pressing national priority.
""The open international market in critical minerals and rare earths is a mirage. It doesn't exist. And the reason it doesn't exist is because there is one supplier of these materials and they have the wherewithal to change where the market goes, whether that be in pricing or supply,"" Australia's resources minister Madeleine King says.
Canberra sees government intervention as necessary to provide an alternative supply, and help the world rely less on China.
""We can either sit back and do nothing about that... or we can step up to take on the responsibility to develop a rare earths industry here that competes with that market,"" Ms King adds.
But there is something that Australia will have to contend with as it invests and works to expand a rare earths industry – pollution.
In China, environmental damage from years of processing rare earths has led to chemicals and radioactive waste seeping into waterways - cities and people bearing the scars of decades of poor regulation.
With rare earths, it's not so much about the mining footprint, rather the processing that is a dirty business – because it involves extraction, leaching, thermal cracking and refining which produce radioactive components.
""I think there is no metal industry that is completely clean... unfortunately, it's a matter of picking your poison sometimes,"" Professor Eksteen says.
""In Australia, we've got mechanisms to handle that. We've got a legal environment and a framework to work with that to at least deal with it responsibly.""
The EU has in the past accused China of using a ""quasi monopoly"" on rare earths as a bargaining chip, weaponising it to undermine competitors in key industries.
The bloc - which is home to hundreds of auto manufacturers that so desperately need rare earths - said even if China has loosened restrictions on supplies, the threat of supply chain shocks remains.
Even if building a brand new industry will take time, Australia seems to have a lot going for it in the rare earths race, as it tries to be a more reliable and cleaner source.
And one that - crucially - is independent of China.",46b09b913fe217e3ce32c12d05f40183,trafilatura,7449,0

Here What Investors Need to Know,2025-08-12 20:15:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Paul Atkins, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has unveiled a host of new initiatives under the umbrella of Project Crypto. He says he wants to modernize the SEC's rules and regulations to encourage innovation. One part of his vision is the development of so-called super-apps that let investors access a wide array of assets and financial services in one place -- or even many services beyond finance.
Atkins thinks the previous SEC leadership was wrong to argue that almost all cryptocurrencies are securities. Under Project Crypto, he says, the SEC will issue clear guidelines on how to categorize crypto assets. That includes clarity on what is -- and is not -- a security. Moreover, he wants to find ways to bring tokenized securities to the U.S. This would mean U.S. investors could access tokenized public (and possibly private) equity.
Tokenized assets would form part, but not all, of the super-app offer. Read on for more about what super-apps are and what investors need to know about them.
What are super-apps?
Super-apps would serve as a one-stop shop where investors could access various digital trading and asset management services. For example, you might log on to buy or sell cryptocurrencies alongside traditional securities within the same account. You might also access staking and crypto lending products.
If this comes to fruition, a brokerage account could give customers more access to digital assets and banking services. Atkins says there's nothing in current securities laws to stop SEC-registered trading platforms from listing non-securities. Another possibility could be to access traditional investments from a crypto platform.
Super-apps have taken off in parts of Asia. For example, China's WeChat is much more than a messenger app. It works as a photo editor, translator, payment gateway, taxi booking service, food delivery app, and more. However, attempts to replicate the service in North America or Europe have not been successful. Some of that is regulatory, but it is also cultural -- consumers may not want to do everything in one place. Plus, competition from existing players may make it hard for one app to rule them all.
Who benefits from super-app growth?
If the super-app market can establish itself, several existing crypto exchanges and brokerages could be well positioned to capitalize on shifts in consumer behavior. It may also serve to open decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to more investors.
Here are some of the biggest potential gainers:
Integrated crypto platforms and brokerages
Major cryptocurrency platforms like Coinbase(NASDAQ: COIN) and brokerages like Robinhood(NASDAQ: HOOD) are already positioning themselves as super-app market leaders. If there is customer appetite for this type of financial one-stop shop, which is far from certain, they may be able to secure a first-mover advantage.
Robinhood's digital wallet already sets it apart from other brokerages that sell crypto. It is now developing its own blockchain and has added a host of products recently. This year, it added a robo-advisor investment platform and crypto staking to its product lineup for U.S. investors. It plans to make banking services available later this year. In July, the pioneer of low-cost investing launched tokenized stocks in Europe, meaning it will be ready to introduce them in the U.S. if and when the SEC gives the green light.
Coinbase's Base App is already stepping into super-app territory. The replacement to the Coinbase Wallet is a place where users can trade crypto, make payments, and interact with other users on a social media feed. It's a user-friendly self-custody crypto wallet that connects to DeFi applications, making them significantly more accessible to everyday users. Coinbase Chief Executive Officer Brian Armstrong told CNBC that the company plans to become an ""everything exchange"" and plans to roll out tokenized real-world assets in the coming months.
Decentralized finance (DeFi)
At the moment, many DeFi applications are difficult to manage for people who aren't used to crypto. It can involve setting up a crypto wallet, understanding gas (user) fees, and navigating some fairly inaccessible protocols. Once you've set them up, many take active management -- you often can't just leave funds in a yield-earning DeFi account.
Super-apps could be a missing part of this puzzle, as they would make DeFi more accessible and easier to use. If you're looking for cryptocurrencies that may benefit from super-app growth, consider some of the more established DeFi players. These include decentralized lenders, such as Aave(CRYPTO: AAVE) and decentralized exchanges, and Uniswap(CRYPTO: UNI).
It's also worth noting that Atkins' announcement comes as lawmakers consider legislation that would clarify what constitutes a security. The House passed the Clarity Act in July, but it still needs to go through the Senate. It isn't clear how any legislative changes would affect the SEC's plans.
The not-so-super side of super apps
The changing digital asset landscape in the U.S. could bring a number of opportunities for investors. For example, recent guidance from the SEC makes it easier for U.S. investors to earn staking rewards, which can be a powerful benefit for long-term investors.
But more relaxed regulations might open the way for increased fraud and theft, and they might reduce protections for consumers in the event of platform failure. Super-apps could also run into problems with data-protection laws.
It will be important to pay attention to what rules new platforms -- including super-apps -- have to follow in terms of custody and fraud protection. If the SEC green-lights tokenized securities that can be traded on platforms that aren't registered as brokers, pay attention to what assets you actually own and how they are supported or issued.
Super-apps: opportunities and risks
The crypto market continues to offer the potential for high rewards to investors who are comfortable with high risks. However, there may not be an appetite in the U.S. and Europe for integrated financial service platforms, even if regulators encourage this type of growth. If they do take off, the onus will be on investors to do considerable due diligence on both the platform they use and the assets they buy.

The opening paragraph stated, ""The August employment report, released on August 1, showed 73,000 jobs added, missing expectations of 102,000, with significant downward revisions of 258,000 jobs for May and June, bringing the three-month average to 35,000, the lowest since May 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).""
The report immediately changed the outlook for interest rate cuts at upcoming FOMC meetings. The probability of a 25 basis point cut at the September meeting is now 95.1%. By the December meeting, the CME Fed Watch tool is projecting a 54.3% that rates could be at 3.50-3.75%.
If this aggressive rate-cutting comes to fruition, there could be some excellent opportunities for traders, investors, and consumers.
Interest rates dictate borrowing costs, directly impacting corporate and consumer behavior. Higher rates increase the cost of capital, limiting business expansion and squeezing cash flows, which can depress stock prices. Meanwhile, bonds become more attractive for their steady yields. Conversely, lower rates reduce borrowing costs, enabling companies to invest in growth and consumers to spend more freely on big-ticket items like homes or vehicles. This dynamic often sparks stock market gains, particularly in rate-sensitive sectors.
While the broader economy may take 12-18 months to reflect rate changes fully, markets react faster. Traders price in expectations well before Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decisions, creating short-term volatility and opportunities. The federal funds rate, which governs overnight lending between banks, sets the tone. The markets are already adjusting for a lower-rate environment.
Historically, rate cuts signal economic stimulus. In 2020, post-COVID cuts to near-zero rates spurred a 50% S&P 500 rally within six months. Lower rates reduce the cost of debt, boosting corporate profits and consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 68% of U.S. GDP. Sectors tied to borrowing, spending, or stable cash flows—like consumer discretionary, technology, real estate, financials, and utilities—tend to outperform in such cycles.
Consumer Discretionary (XLY)
Low rates fuel consumer discretionary outperformance by reducing financing costs for purchases like vehicles, electronics, or travel. With disposable income rising, consumers are poised to spend more as borrowing becomes cheaper. Companies with strong e-commerce or experiential offerings stand to gain the most.
Stock to Consider: Amazon (AMZN)
Amazon's diversified revenue streams—e-commerce, AWS, and advertising—position it to capitalize on increased consumer spending. In Q2 2025, AWS revenue grew 17.5% year-over-year, while advertising hit $15.7 billion. With a forward P/E of 38, AMZN offers growth at a reasonable valuation for a tech giant. Risk: Rising logistics costs could pressure margins if fuel prices spike.
Technology (XLK)
Tech thrives in low-rate environments as cheaper capital funds innovation and expansion. The XLK ETF has historically gained over the six months after the rate cuts. With AI and cloud computing driving demand, tech firms with strong balance sheets are well-positioned for the remainder of 2025.
Stock to Consider: Microsoft (MSFT)
Microsoft's cloud segment (Azure) grew 31% year-over-year in Q2 2025, fueled by AI infrastructure demand. MSFT balances growth and stability with a forward P/E of 32, August 2025, with a 0.8% dividend yield. MSFT has now exceeded $4 trillion market cap. MSFT continues trading near all-time highs.
Real Estate (XLRE)
Lower rates reduce mortgage and financing costs, boosting demand for residential and commercial properties. The XLRE ETF has increased returns in the year following rate cuts. Lower rates could accelerate real estate activity.
Stock to Consider: Prologis (PLD)
Prologis, a logistics REIT, benefits from e-commerce-driven warehouse demand. Q2 2025 occupancy hit 95.1%, with rental income up 9.9%. Trading at a forward P/FFO in the mid-20s, PLD offers a 2.8% dividend yield. Watch industrial leasing trends; softening demand in oversupplied markets could cap upside. During the 2020-2023 low interest rate cycle, the stock price was low at $60 and rallied to $175.
Financials (XLF)
Low rates spur lending and trading activity, boosting bank profits. The XLF ETF has historically outperformed the S&P 500 in rate-cut cycles. Financials would be primed for gains if the FOMC follows through on its rate cuts.
Stock to Consider: JPMorgan Chase (JPM)
JPMorgan's diversified operations—commercial banking, wealth management, and trading—deliver consistent earnings. Aggressive rate cuts have historically elevated stock market participation, which would be bullish for JPM.
Utilities (XLU)
Utilities shine in low-rate, slow-growth environments due to stable demand and high debt loads. This is because utilities are capital-intensive and benefit from lower borrowing costs.
Stock to Consider: NRG Energy (NRG)
NRG has a significant presence in retail energy, selling electricity and gas directly to residential and commercial customers. NRG has expanded its renewable energy portfolio, including solar and wind assets. The company aims to generate relatively steady cash flows from these segments. Any new regulatory shifts toward clean energy could drive growth.NRG continues to trade near its all-time high even after the new administration took office.
In Closing…
Rate cuts in the latter half of 2025 could unlock significant upside for consumer discretionary, technology, real estate, financials, and utilities. By focusing on fundamentally strong ETFs and stocks like AMZN, MSFT, PLD, JPM, and NRG, traders can position for growth while managing risks. Stay vigilant for macroeconomic shifts, particularly inflation or geopolitical surprises, that could alter the Fed's trajectory. With disciplined analysis, these sectors offer actionable opportunities for professional traders and investors.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inflation-likely-moved-higher-last-235216195.html,3ee5e26f84e644db74c1cec69f2284bf,"Inflation likely moved higher last month as tariffs bite , putting the Fed in bind","Inflation likely moved higher last month as tariffs bite , putting the Fed in bind",2025-08-12 04:45:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. inflation was unchanged in July as rising prices for some imported goods were balanced by falling gas and grocery prices, leaving overall prices modestly higher than a year ago.
Consumer prices rose 2.7% in July from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Tuesday, the same as the previous month and up from a post-pandemic low of 2.3% in April. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 3.1%, up from 2.9% in June. Both figures are above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.
The new numbers suggest that slowing rent increases and cheaper gas are offsetting some impacts of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs. Many businesses are also likely still absorbing much of the cost of the duties. Tuesday's figures probably reflect some impact from the 10% universal tariffs Trump imposed in April, as well as higher duties on countries such as China and Canada.
Brian Bethune, an economist at Boston College, said that overall U.S. tariffs — calculated as the amount of duties paid by U.S. companies divided by overall imports — has reached 10%, the highest in decades, and will likely keep rising for months.
“Those cost increases will be passed on to the consumer in some way, shape, or form,” Bethune said. Some companies could return to “shrinkflation,” he added, in which they reduce the package size of a good while keeping the price the same.
And companies that are absorbing tariff costs, which would cut into their profit margins, are less likely to hire new employees, he said.
The Federal Reserve may now be in a difficult spot.
Hiring slowed sharply in the spring, after Trump announced tariffs in April. The stalling out of job gains has boosted financial market expectations for an interest rate cut by the central bank at its next meeting in September, and some Fed officials have raised concerns about the health of the job market. A rate cut by the Fed often, but not always, lowers borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, and business loans.
Economists are divided over how Fed officials will read the data in the coming months. Some argued that the worsening jobs picture will outweigh lingering inflation concerns and lead the Fed to cut at its next meeting in September. Yet some say that with core inflation notably above 2% and rising, the Fed will postpone that decision.
Chair Jerome Powell has warned that worsening inflation could keep the Fed on the sidelines — a stance that has enraged Trump, who has defied traditional norms of central bank independence and demanded lower borrowing costs.
On Tuesday, Trump attacked Powell again for not cutting rates and suggested he would allow a lawsuit against the Fed to proceed because of the rising costs of its extensive building renovation. It wasn't clear what lawsuit he was referring to.
On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.2% in July, down from 0.3% the previous month, while core prices ticked up 0.3%, a bit faster than the 0.2% in June.
Gas prices fell 2.2% from June to July and have plunged 9.5% from a year earlier, the government's report said. Grocery prices slipped 0.1% last month, though they are still 2.2% higher than a year ago.
Tariffs appeared to raise the cost of some imported items: Shoe prices jumped 1.4% from June to July, though they are still just 0.9% more expensive than a year ago. The cost of furniture leapt 0.9% in July and is 3.2% higher than a year earlier.
Coffee costs nearly 15% more than a year earlier, mostly because of troubled harvests overseas, though steep duties on imports from Brazil could push those prices higher in the coming months. Nearly all U.S. coffee is imported.
Tuesday's data arrives at a highly-charged moment for the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collects and publishes the inflation data. Trump fired Erika McEntarfer, then the head of BLS, after the Aug. 1 jobs report also showed sharply lower hiring for May and June than had previously been reported.
The president posted on social media Monday that he has picked E.J. Antoni, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation and a frequent critic of the jobs report, to replace McEntarfer.
Adding to the turmoil at BLS is a government hiring freeze that has forced it to cut back on the data it collects for each inflation report, the agency has said. UBS economist Alan Detmeister estimates that BLS is now collecting about 18% fewer price quotes for the inflation report than it did earlier this year. He thinks the report will produce more volatile results, though averaged out over time, still reliable.
Smaller companies are trying to avoid raising prices and some have turned to novel ways of raising funds.
Clothing maker Princess Awesome, which designs matching clothes for children and adults, has seen its costs jump 15% to 20% because of the tariffs. The company has joined a lawsuit seeking to block the duties. Rebecca Melsky, CEO and co-founder of the firm, says it is prohibitively expensive to make the cotton blend fabrics it uses in the United States.
For now, the company has instituted a “tip jar” on its website where it asks customers to help defray the cost of goods.
“We have not across the board raised prices because of the tariffs -- yet,” she said.
Trump has insisted that overseas manufacturers will pay the tariffs by reducing their prices to offset the duties. Yet the pre-tariff prices of imports haven't fallen much since the levies were put in place.
Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that foreign manufacturers have absorbed just 14% of the duties through June, while 22% has been paid by consumers and 64% by U.S. companies. Yet the economists expect that by this fall consumers will bear two-thirds of the burden, while foreign exporters pay a quarter and U.S. companies handle less than a tenth.
Many large corporations are raising prices, including apparel makers Ralph Lauren and Under Armour, and eyewear company Warby Parker. Most of those increases weren't in place for Tuesday's inflation report.
Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble, maker of Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, said late last month that it would lift prices in August on about a quarter of its products by mid-single-digit percentages. Walmart has also raised prices.
And cosmetics maker e.l.f. Beauty, which makes a majority of its products in China, said on Wednesday that it had raised prices by a dollar on its entire product assortment as of Aug. 1 because of tariff costs, the third price hike in its 21-year history.

These stocks may offer higher potential returns to faithful shareholders in the long run. Including growth stocks in a diversified portfolio can complement investments in other asset classes, like value stocks or dividend-paying companies.
If you have cash to put to work right now and want to put some of that to work in growth-oriented businesses, here are two stocks to consider buying right now and holding indefinitely.
1. Amazon
Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) continues to demonstrate its abilities as an e-commerce and cloud computing powerhouse in a rapidly evolving business landscape. In the second quarter, Amazon's e-commerce business, which includes online stores and third-party seller services, accounted for approximately $102 billion out of its total $167.7 billion in net sales, up 11% year over year. That represented roughly 61% of Amazon's total revenue for the quarter.
The company's other core growth catalyst is Amazon Web Services (AWS). While not accounting for as large a piece of the business as e-commerce does, it remains Amazon's leading driver of profitability. AWS delivered $30.9 billion in revenue in Q2 alone, an 18% increase year over year and accounting for about 18% of Amazon's total net sales in Q2 2025. In terms of profitability, AWS generated $10.2 billion in operating income in the three-month period, which was more than half of Amazon's total operating income of $19.2 billion for the quarter.
Another key area to watch as its long-term growth runway evolves is Amazon's advertising segment. In Q2, Amazon generated $15.7 billion in ad revenue, which was a 23% increase from the same quarter one year ago. While that revenue figure is still a relatively small piece of the pie for Amazon, the growth rate surpassed the increase in its core retail business and highlights the role this asset-light segment could play in the years ahead.
AWS is one key part of the business that showcases Amazon's evolving approach to artificial intelligence (AI) and related technologies like machine learning (ML). For example, Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that simplifies the development and scaling of generative AI applications. It uses a selection of foundation models from various AI companies and Amazon's own models, and also facilitates the creation and deployment of AI agents.
Beyond Bedrock, AWS provides a wide range of AI services, including SageMaker (a fully managed ML service for building, training, and deploying ML models at scale), Amazon Q (a generative AI-powered assistant for businesses and developers), and Amazon Connect (a cloud-based contact center solution that uses AI for purposes like AI assistants).
Amazon's continued status as the world's leading e-commerce company and its aggressive investments in AI could make it a compelling buy for investors of all trading styles and interests. Amazon still looks like a smart stock to buy and hold forever.
2. Carnival Corp.
Carnival Corp.(NYSE: CCL) is known for being the world's largest cruise company, operating multiple cruise lines that cater to various travel preferences across ages and budgets. Carnival owns and operates Carnival Cruise Line, Princess Cruises, Holland America Line, P&O Cruises, Cunard, Costa Cruises, AIDA Cruises, and Seabourn.
Carnival demonstrated a remarkable recovery since the pandemic-induced shutdowns, but it has still faced challenges related to its substantial debt burden acquired during that era. And, of course, there are now growing concerns that macro developments could turn and consumer spending might falter, affecting businesses like Carnival's.
The good news is that the company has consistently reported occupancy rates above pre-pandemic levels, reaching 104% as of the end of Q2 2025. Carnival had a strong second quarter overall as well, reporting record revenues of $6.3 billion, and it exceeded its own guidance by more than tripling adjusted net income. Customer deposits also hit an all-time high of $8.5 billion. Bookings for 2025 are at an all-time high in both pricing and occupancy, and early bookings for 2026 are even showing similar strength.
As a whole, the cruise industry is attracting younger travelers and first-time cruisers, which is proving to be the tide that lifts all boats. Last year, Carnival's revenue reached an unprecedented $25 billion in fiscal year 2024, a 15% increase year over year. The company also achieved its first annual profit since the pandemic in 2024, reporting a $1.9 billion profit driven by increasing operating income and expanding margins.
Carnival has been actively reducing its substantial debt load, which increased significantly during the pandemic's height. For example, in May of this year the company refinanced $993 million of 7.625% senior unsecured notes due in 2026. The new notes are priced at 5.875% maturing in 2031, which is expected to save over $20 million in annual interest expenses through 2026.
With the stock trading up nearly 100% over the last year alone, it seems that many investors are growing bullish about the company. If you have the risk tolerance to put cash into the cyclical cruise industry, Carnival is looking like an increasingly attractive buy in this space.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/president-trump-now-supports-intel-144034566.html,1e965a7de39ee1f877ea2e8bedc61ffc,President Trump Now Supports Intel CEO Lip - Bu Tan -- What It Means for Investors,President Trump Now Supports Intel CEO Lip - Bu Tan -- What It Means for Investors,2025-08-12 15:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"U.S. President Donald Trump, who just last week demanded the resignation of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan, reversed course on Monday. In social media posts on Aug. 8, the president initially labeled Tan as ""highly conflicted"" over alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party, citing illegal actions by Cadence Design Systems(NASDAQ: CDNS) while Tan was its CEO as the proof. After the two met on Monday, Trump now calls Tan a ""success,"" and supports his leadership of the chip giant.
The conflicting attention on Tan brought additional scrutiny on the semiconductor stock as it struggles to regain its competitiveness in an industry it once dominated. It also means investors would be well advised to make sense of the news and the implications it might have for Intel shareholders before buying the stock.
Lip-Bu Tan and China
The initial issue arose after Cadence pleaded guilty on July 28 to unlawfully exporting its semiconductor design tools to a Chinese chip manufacturer and a university with ties to the Chinese military. Tan was Cadence's CEO when these transfers occurred.
On Aug. 6, Arkansas's Republican Senator, Tom Cotton, sent a letter to Intel's Chairman of the Board Frank Yeary, asking questions about Tan's China ties. President Trump learned of Cotton's letter soon after, and on Trump Media's Truth Social platform, he called on Tan to resign ""immediately."" He stated that there was ""no other solution to this problem"" but did not provide any additional details.
Tan countered Cotton's accusations, releasing a letter to Intel employees on Thursday, Aug. 7, stating that there had been ""misinformation"" circulating about his past roles at Walden International and Cadence Design Systems. He also affirmed his dedication to U.S. security interests and mentioned Intel's discussions with the Trump administration regarding the issues raised.
Intel's board of directors also released a statement supporting Tan and emphasizing the board's commitment to U.S. security and economic interests, noting that Intel's investments, including domestic manufacturing, align with President Trump's stated agenda.
Tan then visited Trump at the White House to make this case. An Intel spokesperson described the meeting as a ""candid and constructive discussion,"" outlining the commitment Intel has made to bolstering U.S. leadership in manufacturing and technology. Trump responded by hailing Tan's success and rise as an ""amazing story,"" adding that Tan will spend time with members of Trump's administrative cabinet and bring suggestions to him over the next week.
Shareholder implications
Intel's stock price recovered after releasing the news. Nonetheless, the challenges that Tan faces in getting Intel back on track remain considerable.
Intel's board hired Tan back in March 2025 specifically to turn the company around. After decades of industry leadership, it has fallen behind its top competitors in recent years. Efforts by past CEOs to resolve Intel's issues have so far proven unsuccessful.
In 2021, former CEO Pat Gelsinger put forth a plan to regain the technical lead by 2025 and turn its foundries into a third-party chip manufacturing business. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators thwarted the company's plans to catch up technically, and its efforts to upgrade foundries were beset with setbacks, prompting Gelsinger to leave the company last year.
When Intel's board appointed Tan, it likely hoped that Tan could replicate his previous success at Cadence. Since taking the job, he has streamlined the management team, and now the client group and the data center and AI group report directly to him. Additionally, he elevated Intel's technical leadership and began the process of reducing the workforce to approximately 75,000 employees by the end of the year (a one-year staff reduction of over 30%).
Tan has made it clear that a comeback will take years. It's still far too early if his initiatives will succeed. So far, its financials suggest little has changed. Revenue for the second quarter of 2025 was $12.9 billion, amounting to flat growth from year-ago levels. There has also been a considerable increase in costs and expenses, and Intel's Q2 net loss widened to $2.9 billion.
Still, the fact that Tan persuaded Trump to reverse course is undoubtedly a victory for the CEO. Additionally, its price-to-book ratio is just over 0.9. Since that means Intel stock is worth less than its assets minus its liabilities, one has to assume its troubles are more than priced into the stock.
Should investors buy the pullback in Intel stock?
Intel was arguably a speculative buy before this recent news and likely remains so. Indeed, the company faced considerable uncertainty before Trump initially turned on Tan. Although Tan has averted a crisis by winning over Trump, Intel still faces an uphill battle in making the venerable tech giant competitive.
However, with its price-to-book ratio under 1, Intel is unlikely to have further downside without conditions worsening further. Thus, the news probably just gives investors more time and reason to initiate a speculative Intel position.

For the capital-intensive mining equipment finance sector, the stakes are particularly high.
Dubbed the “Great Equipment Squeeze” by industry insiders, these tariffs are forcing financiers, manufacturers, and end-users to rethink cost structures, sourcing strategies, and risk management in a landscape shaped by rising trade barriers and supply chain uncertainty.
Tariffs that bite deep
The tariff regime introduced in 2025 imposes levies ranging from 10% to as high as 34% on a broad range of machinery components and finished products crucial to mining and heavy industries.
As detailed by Ketaki Bhosale in her April 2025 Cognitive Market Research report, the heaviest burden falls on construction and earthmoving equipment components — hydraulic cylinders, transmission systems, and steel frames — which now face a 25% tariff, primarily impacting imports from China.
Industry data from the Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM), a major North American trade association, cited by Bhosale, shows average cost increases of 18% to 26% for imported components. That squeeze is being felt by global giants like US-based Caterpillar Inc. and Italian-American company CNH Industrial, both of which depend on intricate supply chains with Chinese-sourced subsystems.
Caterpillar, the world’s largest mining equipment maker, sits at the heart of the sector’s tariff-driven turbulence, with its deep global footprint making it especially vulnerable to component price hikes and supply chain delays. CNH Industrial, while more peripheral, supplies versatile construction machinery — like excavators and wheel loaders — that often support surface mining and quarrying, positioning it as a quiet but essential player also feeling the squeeze.
Caterpillar’s $1.5bn warning
Caterpillar’s latest earnings underscore just how costly the tariff environment has become. According to Reuters, the company warned it could face up to $1.5 billion in extra costs this year due to tariffs, with $400–500 million already hitting margins in Q3. CEO Joe Creed told investors that tariffs remain “a significant headwind” to profitability in the second half of 2025, especially as they raise costs on key components such as sensors and control systems used in mining trucks and excavators.
This scale of exposure is a bellwether for the wider sector: when an industry leader must absorb nine-figure quarterly impacts, financiers take notice. Higher equipment costs flow directly into more cautious underwriting, increased collateral demands, and extended loan repayment terms.
Financing in the crosshairs
Bhosale’s research estimates tariffs on high-value mining subcomponents — hydraulic drive units, advanced sensing systems, and gear assemblies — have added 15–30% to costs in some cases. China’s restrictions on rare-earth exports have compounded the problem, raising prices for magnet-based systems critical in both mining and renewable energy equipment.
With asset prices surging and delivery timelines stretching, lenders are recalibrating deal structures. In practical terms, that means higher down payments, shorter financing terms for certain categories, and stricter project risk assessments. Bloomberg’s trade coverage notes that companies are delaying purchases or restructuring procurement contracts to adapt.
Supply chains on the move
To mitigate costs, manufacturers are rethinking sourcing strategies. As Bhosale notes, procurement teams are increasingly turning to suppliers in India, Turkey, and Latin America. Others are blending domestic assembly with imports from lower-tariff markets such as Poland, Thailand, and South Korea.
Bloomberg has reported that companies like Komatsu stand to save hundreds of millions in tariff exposure if trade conditions with China improve — a clear sign of how central sourcing decisions have become to bottom-line performance.
The project cost ripple
Mid-sized manufacturers surveyed by Cognitive Market Research estimate per-unit cost hikes of 15–22% since the tariffs took effect. Mining operators, especially those reliant on imported heavy machinery, report delays and budget overruns that ripple through project timelines.
These pressures ultimately feed back into financing. With returns on investment harder to project, leasing activity is slowing in both mining and agricultural equipment segments, as buyers weigh whether to commit capital under such uncertainty.
A new financing reality?
Industry reporting and trade analysis from sources such as Reuters and Bloomberg underscore a broader shift toward diversified supply chains and increased localisation as companies seek to reduce exposure to ongoing geopolitical and tariff-related shocks. For the mining equipment finance sector, the message is clear: risk models must now routinely incorporate tariff volatility, raw material supply constraints, and transportation disruptions as key factors.
The Great Equipment Squeeze is more than a temporary disruption — it represents a structural transformation of how machinery procurement and financing operate. Success will favour financiers who can manage volatility without freezing capital flows, and manufacturers agile enough to redesign supply chains for resilience and cost stability. In this reshaped landscape, flexibility is no longer optional — it is essential.

In a roundtable discussion with reporters on Thursday, finance chiefs from the two firms spoke glowingly of the business potential of agentic AI tools, that is, artificial intelligence programs designed to make decisions autonomously with little or no human intervention.
Jamie Miller, chief financial and operating officer at PayPal, emphasized that, for now, her team is using AI agents to produce first drafts of internal content. That includes things like “executive-level materials, where it’s really summarization of a strategy,” she told reporters.
“We have not yet done, at least to my knowledge, AI-generated 10-Ks,” she said. “I think we’ll work our way to some form of assistance on that. … Within finance itself, there are lots of opportunities to leverage AI, and we see a lot of that internally.”
Robin Washington, who started her role as Salesforce’s first chief operating and financial officer four months ago, said that she personally uses AI tools to prepare for analyst questions and to better understand competition. “We are very much using [AI] to astutely understand the landscape,” she said. Washington added that artificial intelligence has helped cut down her prep work for earnings calls to “hours instead of days.”
Though the discussion was mostly sparse on other concrete use cases for rank-and-file employees, both finance chiefs maintained that AI tools are set to fundamentally change the workforce, eventually.
“My boss always says we’re probably the last set of managers to just manage humans,” Washington said. “We’re going to have AIs autonomously working side-by-side helping us make decisions.”
In an email, Salesforce spokesman Tyler Ng said that the company’s “Agentforce for Sales” program “helps reps spend more time selling by letting AI handle routine tasks like lead follow-up and outreach around the clock.”
“Recently, the AI agent analyzed over 7,800 unworked leads — accounts with no rep outreach or activity — to prioritize high-intent prospects, personalize messaging and book 50+ meetings, generating $460K in net-new pipeline in just three weeks,” he said. “The real power comes from AI and humans working together: while AI handles repetitive tasks, reps focus on building relationships and closing deals.”
And while big-ticket AI investments have coincided with recent layoff plans at several companies, such as Microsoft, the finance heads of Salesforce and PayPal emphasized that the emerging technology will instead reinforce the need for human skills. Washington cited things like “problem-solving, emotional intelligence and higher-level decision making.”
“AI brings the data directly to us, and it enhances our ability to … do the art of the possible,” she said.
For her part, Miller emphasized the continued need for “curiosity, systems thinking, self-starting” among employees.
“I was in a board meeting last week, and someone joked, ‘sounds like it’s the revenge of the liberal arts grad, finally,’” she said.
The two leaders’ roundtable discussion coincided with the release of new survey data from Salesforce measuring CFO sentiment on AI. In a survey of 261 global finance chiefs, the company found that about a third have adopted an ""aggressive” approach to the emerging technology. Just 4% said they have a “conservative” AI strategy, and the lion’s share of respondents (63%) said they’re taking a moderate approach.
Conducted in June in partnership with Morning Consult, the survey also found that respondents, on average, are allocating about a quarter of their existing AI budgets specifically to AI agents.
Meanwhile, 61% of the CFOs said that “AI agents/digital labor” are “critical” to competition. The company “defines digital labor as a hybrid workforce where humans and autonomous AI agents work together to accomplish more than either could on their own,” spokesman Ng said. In addition, about a third of respondents said that artificial intelligence “requires them to have a riskier mindset around technology investments.”
Part 2 — This week
Here’s a list of important market events slated for the week ahead.
Part 3 — Weekly listen: St. Louis Blues exec on Business of Sports podcast
Steve Chapman, EVP and chief revenue and marketing officer of professional ice hockey team the St. Louis Blues, talked to Business of Sports: Playmakers Beyond the Competition hosts Ken Dubinsky and Chris Roseman, to discuss his love of hockey, undergoing the process of changing the team’s logo and jerseys and streaming’s effect on sports media.
When discussing the switch to streaming, Chapman highlighted that it allows the team to bring the product directly to the fans, but it’s not without challenges
“The challenge is the financial model is changing and and if anybody tells you that they know exactly what's going on, they're lying because they don't,” Chapman said. “Everybody's trying to figure out how to build bridges to wherever it is that we're going to end up. And so that's what we're doing right now. I think that's what a lot of teams in professional [sports] are doing related to local regional sports networks,” Chapman said.
He continued: “It is something that is at the forefront of what we're working on right now, but I've got to tell you, it's actually unbelievably interesting. It's unbelievably motivating to try to figure out how to take this to the next level because at the end of the day, you want to give the product to the fans.”",c7d9127c9409f8a40657fcaf1effc461,trafilatura,6025,0
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-3-yielding-dividend-stock-095300966.html,b53443cf5f72e91380faeed7cae19282,This 4 . 3 %- Yielding Dividend Stock Could Double Its Payout In 8 Years,This 4 . 3 %- Yielding Dividend Stock Could Double Its Payout In 8 Years,2025-08-12 19:15:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Despite raising its dividend payment by 8% annually over the past 12 years, Brookfield Infrastructure stock offers a high yield that is more than triple the market average.
Brookfield Infrastructure grew second-quarter funds from operations by 9% year over year, when adjusted for fluctuating currency exchange rates.
If Brookfield Infrastructure's bottom line continues growing at its present pace, the company could double its payout in about eight years.
Investors looking for ways to pad their passive income stream with dividend stocks typically have two basic options. You can choose dividend payers that offer high yields, but these stocks tend to raise their payouts slowly, if at all. On the other hand, you could buy shares of businesses expected to raise their payouts quickly. Unfortunately, rapid payout raisers tend to offer yields that are less than the risk-free interest rate you can receive from a basic savings account.
If you're not excited about low-yield payout growers or risky high-yield stocks, I've got good news. Brookfield Infrastructure(NYSE: BIPC) is a highly reliable dividend grower that offers a juicy 4.3% yield at recent prices. Here's why it looks like a perfect dividend growth stock for folks who want to see their payouts grow but can't accept low yields up front.
A perfect foundation for steadily growing dividend payments
Every day, millions of workers rely on Brookfield Infrastructure's massive portfolio of utility, energy, transport, and data-related assets to do their job. Whether it's pipelines that deliver natural gas, fiber optic cables that deliver data, or shipping containers that carry goods, demand for the assets this company invests in is reliable.
With heaps of assets subject to depreciation and amortization, funds from operations (FFO) is the preferred metric for evaluating Brookfield Infrastructure's cash flows from one period to another. Income-seeking investors adore this business, because about 85% of FFO comes from regulated utility businesses and entities that sign long-term contracts.
The company targets a payout ratio between 60% and 70% of FFO. Despite raising its payout by 8% annually over the past 12 years, the latest dividend payment was in the preferred range at 68% of FFO generated during the quarter. That means raising the dividend payment at roughly the same pace as the company's bottom line shouldn't be a problem.
Brookfield Infrastructure's dividend payout has grown by 8% annually over the past 12 years. Continuing at this pace probably won't be a problem. If we adjust for foreign exchange rates, second-quarter FFO rose by 9% year over year.
Second-quarter FFO that grew 9% year over year hit the top end of Brookfield Infrastructure's expected growth rate over the long term. If it can maintain this pace, the dividend payments that freshly acquired shares deliver could double in about eight years.
Two avenues for growth
Brookfield Infrastructure has investment-grade credit ratings from the major rating agencies. It's also a subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management(NYSE: BAM), a leading alternative asset manager with over $1 trillion in assets under management.
Brookfield Infrastructure's parent boasts an ""A"" credit rating from Fitch, and an ""A-"" rating from S&P Global. Over the past 12 months, Brookfield Asset Management raised a whopping $97 billion in capital, which gives Brookfield Infrastructure a lot of opportunities to acquire new assets.
Brookfield Infrastructure recently acquired 5,500 miles of pipelines capable of transporting 2.5 million barrels per day of refined products between Texas and New York. The company expects enough profit from the pipeline to repay its principal investment in about seven years. Operating this pipeline seems like a great way to generate a profit, but it isn't Brookfield's only option. In the first seven months of 2025, the company sold nine assets for proceeds of around $2.4 billion.
Brookfield Infrastructure refers to selling assets it's developed as a capital recycling program. Whatever you want to call it, it's been a tremendous source of profit. For example, the company recently sold a stake in its U.K. ports operation for $385 million, which was 7.5 times more than it paid in 2009. That works out to a 19% internal rate of return.
With Brookfield Asset Management at its back, Brookfield Infrastructure doesn't just get the benefit of cheap and plentiful capital. It also has access to around 2,500 investment professionals who have their fingers on the pulse of the alternative-asset landscape. Continued growth at the top end of management's expected range of 5% to 9% isn't guaranteed, but it isn't an entirely unreasonable expectation either. For most investors, adding some shares of this stock to a diverse portfolio now and holding them indefinitely looks like the right move.

President Donald Trump has a bold plan for America’s immigration system — a $5-million “gold card” visa designed to attract wealthy foreigners and pay down the national debt.
“It’s going to sell like crazy,” Trump said at the first cabinet meeting of his second term. “It’s a bargain.”
Trump said the gold card would come with “green card privileges” and serve as a route to American citizenship for wealthy foreigners willing to pay the price.
He adds that revenue from the “gold card” could help pay down the U.S. national debt, which currently stands at a staggering $36.22 trillion.
“If we sell 10 million, that's $50 trillion, Trump stated. “That means our debt is totally paid off, and we have $15 trillion above that.”
Hurdles in the way
While Trump is confident in the gold card’s potential, not everyone shares his optimism.
“People who could actually afford and want to use a $5 million golden visa … do not necessarily want to be subject to U.S. taxation,” said immigration lawyer Charles Kuck.
Sharvari Dalal-Dheini, director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told CNN that the program can’t move forward without congressional approval.
“Congress would have to legislate a new program,” she said. “I really don’t know what legal authority you would have to just create this new program out of whole cloth,” she.
While the feasibility of Trump’s gold card remains uncertain, the broader conversation around paying down debt — including Americans’ personal debt — is more relevant than ever.
If the U.S. debt crisis has got you thinking about your long-term financial health, here are some practical ways to improve it.
Build a safety net
Life is unpredictable. Unexpected medical bills, car repairs, or job loss can quickly derail your budget if you’re unprepared. That’s why an emergency fund is essential.
The size of the emergency fund you need will vary based on your circumstances, job security and financial responsibilities. Personal finance expert Dave Ramsey suggests have an emergency fund that can cover three to six months of living expenses.
You don’t have to build it overnight. Starting small is better than not starting at all. And your money doesn’t have to sit idle. High-yield savings accounts offer significantly higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts, allowing your emergency fund to grow while remaining easily accessible.
These days, some banks and financial institutions offer high-yield accounts that pay up to 4.5%, making it easier to maximize your savings without locking it away in long-term investments.

Break free from high-interest debt
Compounding interest on debt is what makes it costly and difficult to pay off. The longer high-interest debt lingers, the more it snowballs, potentially costing you thousands over time.
Take credit cards, for example. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the average credit card interest rate in November 2024 was a whopping 21.47% — making credit card debt one of the most expensive types of consumer debt in the U.S.
If you’re carrying high-interest balances, make paying them off a top financial priority. One effective strategy is the avalanche method, tackling the debt with the highest interest rate first.
This approach should allow the borrower to pay less over time. Since high-interest balances rack up the biggest charges, this approach should allow the borrower to pay less over time.
For those looking to simplify their debt and reduce interest costs, Credible provides a free online service to compare lending options. With just a few clicks, you’ll see all the lenders willing to help pay off your credit cards or other debts with a single personal loan.
Homeowners may also have another option: tapping into home equity. Rates on HELOCs and home equity loans are typically lower than APRs on credit cards, making it an appealing option for homeowners with substantial equity.
You can compare real loan rates offered by different lenders side-by-side through LendingTree.
Building wealth isn’t just about saving — it’s also about making your money work for you. Passive income allows you to generate earnings with minimal ongoing effort, providing financial stability and long-term growth.
One of the most time-tested strategies to generate passive income is through real estate investing. Owning a rental property can generate monthly cash flow from tenants while also serving as a potential hedge against inflation as property values and rental prices tend to rise along with the cost of living over time.
However, being a landlord comes with its challenges. You need to find and screen tenants, ensure rent is collected on time, and deal with maintenance and repairs out of your own pocket.
That’s assuming you can afford a down payment and qualify for a mortgage on a rental property in the first place.
The good news? You don’t have to buy a property to invest in real estate anymore. First National Realty Partners (FNRP) allows accredited investors to diversify their portfolio through grocery-anchored commercial properties, without taking on the responsibilities of being a landlord.
With a minimum investment of $50,000, investors can own a share of properties leased by national brands like Whole Foods, Kroger and Walmart, which provide essential goods to their communities. Thanks to Triple Net (NNN) leases, accredited investors are able to invest in these properties without worrying about tenant costs cutting into their potential returns.

This is not a standard factory upgrade. To reduce the cost of manufacturing, Ford has upended the moving assembly line system launched by its founder Henry Ford more than 112 years ago.
The automaker’s willingness to change the century-old system that made Ford a household name reflects the high-stakes juggling act of selling a line of affordable electric vehicles that could be made in the United States faster, more efficiently, and with fewer parts, all while preserving profit margins. And as Ford’s chief EV, digital, and design officer Doug Field noted Monday, it’s not just about driving down individual costs, but a change that will allow the automaker to compete with China.
Ford CEO Jim Farley described the new production system, line of EVs, and $2 billion investment as a bet.
“There are no guarantees with this project,” he said during an event livestreamed from the Kentucky plant. “We’re doing so many new things I can’t tell you with 100% uncertainty that this will all go just right, it is a bet. There is risk.”
It’s a bet Farley believes is worth making. The company’s EV division posted a loss of around $1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2025 and sales of its top two EVs, the F-150 Lightning and the Mustang Mach-E, are falling.
And it’s a bet that began several years ago with a skunkworks team of about 500 people in California — led by former Tesla executive Alan Clarke and filled with talent from companies like Tesla, Rivian, Apple, and Lucid Motors. The team, which is split between Palo Alto and a new office in Long Beach, developed the new production system and underlying vehicle platform that will be used in the Louisville factory.
The end result is what Ford calls the “universal production system,” which changes its single conveyor line into a three-branched assembly tree. Ford has also developed a universal EV platform that will use lithium iron phosphate batteries using tech licensed from China’s CATL and manufactured at its new $3 billion BlueOval Battery Park factory in Michigan. That factory, which is expected to come online in 2026, will employ 1,700 hourly workers.
The new EV platform will consist of large single-piece aluminum unicastings that use far fewer parts and will allow the front and rear of the vehicle to be assembled separately on two of the branches. The third branch is perhaps most notable; this is where the structural battery will be assembled with seats, consoles, and carpeting. The three components will come together at the end of the line to form the vehicle.
The end result is an EV that has 20% fewer parts, including 50% fewer cooling hoses and connections, and 25% fewer fasteners, according to Ford. The first EV off the line will be a mid-sized pickup that is about the same size as a Ford Maverick, but roomier on the inside.
Unlike a traditional assembly line, where the workers move along adding the wire harness and other parts to the frame, the EV platform will consist of three kits. Within that kit, all fasteners, scanners, and power tools required for the job are included — and in the correct orientation for use, according to Ford. The system also reduces the number of dock stations by 40%.
The EV platform will be produced 15% faster, the company said.
“I’ve certainly never seen anything in the public domain that looks anything like this,” Clarke told TechCrunch in an interview ahead of the launch. “And I think that a manufacturing expert would look at this, and especially if they’ve been in the automotive industry for a few decades, would sort of scoff at it and say, ‘why would you do it this way?'”
Clarke is convinced that once manufacturing experts see how quickly a vehicle can go from start to finish, others will attempt to emulate this.
The new format and accompanying EV platform will change how the Louisville factory operates and reduce the number of workers employed there. The transformation will likely ripple through the broader supply chain as well. Ultimately, Clarke says, this will preserve American jobs.
Ford employs about 2,808 hourly workers at its Louisville assembly plant, which makes the Ford Escape and Lincoln Cosair. Production of those two vehicles will continue at the plant through the end of this year, before Ford begins retooling the factory and switching to the new family of EVs. Eventually, the plant will support 2,200 hourly workers — 600 fewer than today.
A Ford spokesperson said the automaker has offered a special retirement incentive program for workers. If fewer than 600 workers take the early retirement offer, they will be offered roles at other facilities.
Fewer workers and a “significant” increase in automation might typically prompt protests from the United Auto Workers. But Clarke says Ford worked with the UAW closely from the beginning and that there is “buy in.”
“The teams are really excited about what’s coming because they know that we have to be competitive and we have to make money from this project for jobs to stay in America,” he said, later adding, “This isn’t really, you know, optional.”
Several UAW representatives spoke during the event and supported the change, which they said will reduce the twisting, turning, and bending required of assembly workers and improve safety.
“Ergonomics has been taken into it a whole lot more,” Brandon Reisinger, UAW chairperson of the Louisville assembly plant, said at the event. “We should have a healthier workforce. Should be able to go home to your families and not be sore at the end of the day, which is going to be great.”",eeb8fdb6a6e37ebe49f86515d151983a,trafilatura,5805,0
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/computer-driven-traders-bullish-stocks-130000805.html,ad80a34f4c8eaafddb3d7a154f51940d,Divergence Emerges Between Human Traders and Computer - Driven Investors,Divergence Emerges Between Human Traders and Computer - Driven Investors,2025-08-12 01:15:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"(Bloomberg) -- The thing about trading stocks is everyone has an opinion. And right now there’s an unusual divergence in the market that’s as stark as man versus machine.
Computer-guided traders haven’t been this bullish on stocks compared to their human counterparts since early 2020, before the depths of the Covid pandemic, according to Parag Thatte, a strategist at Deutsche Bank AG.
The two groups look at different cues to form their opinions, so it’s not a shock that they see the market differently. While computer-driven fast-money quants use systematic strategies based on momentum and volatility signals, discretionary money managers are individuals looking at economic and earnings trends to guide their moves.
Still, this degree of disagreement is rare — and historically, it doesn’t last long, Thatte said.
“Discretionary investors are waiting for something to give, whether that’s slowing growth or a spike in inflation in the second half of the year from tariffs,” he said. “As the data trickles in, their concerns will either be proven right if the market sells off on growth fears, or the economy will remain resilient, in which case discretionary managers would likely begin to lift their stock exposure on economic optimism.”
Wall Street offers a lot of confident predictions, but the reality is nobody knows what will happen with President Donald Trump’s trade agenda or the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate policy.
With the S&P 500 Index repeatedly hitting all-time highs, professional investors aren’t sticking around to find out. As of the week ended Aug. 1, they’d cut their equity exposure from neutral to modestly underweight on lingering uncertainty surrounding global trade, corporate earnings and economic growth, according to data compiled by Deutsche Bank.
“No one wants to buy pricier stocks already at records so some are praying for any selloff as an excuse to buy,” said Frank Monkam, head of macro trading at Buffalo Bayou Commodities.
Chasing Momentum
Trend-following algorithmic funds, however, are chasing that momentum. They’ve been lured into a buying spree after cut-to-the-bone positioning in the spring cleared the path to return in recent months as the S&P 500 rallied almost 30% from its April low. Through the week ended Aug. 1, long equity positions for systematic strategies were the highest since January 2020, Deutsche Bank’s data show.
This divergence underpins the tug-of-war between technical and fundamental forces, with the S&P 500 stuck in a tight range after posting its longest streak of tranquility in two years in July.
The Cboe Volatility Index — or VIX — which measures implied volatility of the benchmark US equity futures via out-of-the-money options, closed at 15.15 on Friday, near the lowest level since February. The VVIX, which measures the volatility of volatility, dropped for the third time in four weeks.
“The rubber band can only stretch so far before it snaps,” said Colton Loder, managing principal of the alternative investment firm Cohalo. “So the potential for a mean-reversion selloff is higher when there’s systematic crowding, like now.”
This kind of collective piling into a trade periodically happens with computer-driven strategies. In early 2023, for instance, quants loaded up on US stocks on the heels of the S&P 500’s 19% drop in 2022, until volatility spiked in March of that year during the regional banking tumult. And in late 2019, fast-money traders powered stocks to records after a breakthrough in trade talks between Washington and Beijing.
This time around, however, Thatte expects this split between man and machine to last weeks, not months. If discretionary traders start selling in response to weaker growth or softening corporate earnings trends, pushing volatility higher, computer-based strategies are likely to begin to unwind their positions as well, he said.
In addition, fast-money investors will likely reach full exposure to US equities by September, which could prompt them to sell stocks as they become vulnerable to downside market shocks, according to Scott Rubner of Citadel Securities.
CTA Risk
Given how systematic funds operate, selling may start with commodity trading advisors, or CTAs, unwinding extreme positioning, Loder said. That would increase the risk of sharp reversals in the stock market, although there would need to be a substantial selloff for a spike in volatility to last, he added.
CTAs, who have been persistent stock buyers, are long $50 billion of US stocks, putting them in the 92nd percentile of historical exposure, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. However, the S&P 500 would need to breach 6,100, a decline of roughly 4.5% from where the index closed on Friday, for CTAs to begin dumping stocks, said Maxwell Grinacoff, head of equity derivatives research at UBS Group AG.
So the question is, with quant positioning this stretched to the bullish side and pressure building in the stock market due to extreme levels of uncertainty, can any rally from here really last?
“Things are starting to feel toppy,” said Grinacoff, adding that the upside for stocks “is likely exhausted” in the short run given that CTA positioning is near max long. “This is a bit worrisome, but it’s not raising alarm bells yet.”
What’s more, any pullback from systematic selling would likely create an opportunity for discretionary asset managers who missed out on this year’s gains to re-enter the market as buyers, warding off a more severe plunge, according to Cohalo’s Loder.
“Whatever triggers the next drawdown is a mystery,” he said. “But when that eventually happens, asset-manager exposure and discretionary positioning is so light that it will add fuel to a ‘buy the dip’ mentality and prevent an even bigger selloff.”",d1d4a468c3dcc9b806e5830d820adca7,trafilatura,5753,0

The Spanish government recently renounced U.S. aircraft purchases and resisted intense pressure to commit to NATO's new 5% defense spending target, while seeking closer economic ties with China.
Taken together, analysts say Spain has become a rare example of a European country willing to draw the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump.
Notably, despite Trump threatening a tough trade deal for Spain, the southern European country has not yet faced any material consequences.
""Spain is an interesting case in Europe because it is really the only country that is openly antagonizing Trump whereas everybody is trying to keep their head down for the most part,"" Federico Santi, a senior analyst focused on southern Europe at Eurasia Group, told CNBC by video call.
What's particular to Spain, Santi said, was the ""distinct weakness"" of the country's minority leftist coalition government, which has been embroiled in a series of scandals and corruption investigations.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who has led the country since 2018, has rebuffed calls from opposition lawmakers to resign. The leader of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party has instead said he intends to run for re-election in 2027.
The opportunity to focus on big-ticket foreign policy issues such as defense, Eurasia Group's Santi said, could help Sanchez to distract the public from his own domestic woes.
""Spain has, by and large, gotten away with its fairly outspoken criticism of Trump for two main reasons. Number one, it is in the EU. So, unlike the South Africa's or Brazil's of the world that faced a very direct backlash from Trump in the form of higher tariffs, they are somewhat shielded from that,"" Santi said.
""And the other point I think that works to Sanchez's advantage is that Trump just doesn't seem to be that concerned or aware of Spain as a country. I mean, he's aware of it, but it is not really on his radar,"" he added.
A spokesperson for Spain's government did not respond to a CNBC request for comment.
Trump's NATO outburst
Spain's defense ministry said last week that it was no longer considering the option of buying U.S.-made F-35s, Reuters reported, preferring instead to replace its ageing fighter jet fleet with European military aircraft.
The decision to snub Lockheed Martin's fighter jets came after Trump said it was ""terrible"" that Madrid wouldn't commit to the NATO defense spending target of 5% of gross domestic product by 2035.
Speaking at a news conference at NATO's annual summit in the Netherlands in late June, Trump said the Spanish economy ""could be blown right out of the water with something bad happening.""
The U.S. president also threatened to make Spain pay ""twice as much"" on trade, criticizing Madrid for wanting to take ""a little bit of a free ride"" on defense.
The U.S. and EU, however, have since signed a framework trade agreement that means the 27-nation bloc will face tariffs of 15% on EU goods to the U.S. The EU negotiates trade deals collectively, which means Spain benefits from the collective bargain struck by Brussels.
In stark contrast, Switzerland, which is not a member of the EU, has been hit hard by a U.S. tariff rate of 39% on key export products.
Ignacio Molina, senior fellow at the Elcano Royal Institute, a think tank in Madrid, said Spain's geographic distance from Russia and the distinct features of its foreign policy stretching back to its last war in 1898, which was against the U.S., means that Madrid views its relationship with Washington as ""less vital"" than other EU countries.
""The dominant political culture in Spain is much more pro-European than Atlanticist. Even with regard to Ukraine (whom Spain strongly supports) Spain's main focus is on its EU accession bid and the reception of refugees, not on its NATO membership or arms deliveries,"" Molina told CNBC by email.
Molina highlighted that Spain-U.S. relations are further complicated by the fact that the Spanish government is the ""most ideologically left-leaning"" in all of Europe.
""This introduces a domestic political temptation to distance itself from Trump, who is extremely unpopular in Spain, including among center-right voters,"" Molina said.
China-friendly
A diplomatic rift between Spain and the U.S. has also been exacerbated by Madrid's pursuit of closer economic ties with Beijing.
The U.S. has two military bases in southern Spain, a country that has emerged as one of Europe's most China-friendly governments.
Both U.S. and EU officials have recently been critical of Sanchez's decision to award a multi-million-euro contract to Chinese tech giant Huawei for the use of its wiretapping technology.
Kristina Kausch, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the U.S., and the think tank's representative in Madrid, said Spain's deepening ties with China had raised eyebrows in the U.S. and parts of Europe.
""While this echoes a broader desire in Europe for strategic rebalancing, EU leaders have stressed that such a rebalancing must be based in reciprocity,"" Kausch said.
By resisting U.S. purchasing pressure on defense, Kausch told CNBC that Spain has demonstrated Europe's determination to independently develop military capabilities and industrial capacity.
Even with the cover of EU membership, however, Kausch said the approach is not likely to be risk-free.
""Spain is giving a voice to concerns that are also shared, to greater or lesser degree, by other EU or NATO allies. It shows leadership, but it is also a big gamble that could backfire on Sanchez personally, on Spain, and on Europe,"" she added.

Many leading cybersecurity companies are also deeply invested in artificial intelligence (AI), utilizing the latest models to identify, detect, and eliminate threats more quickly than ever.
However, with a plethora of cybersecurity stocks to choose from, it can be difficult to know which companies are true standouts. Here's why Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), and CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) could be great stocks to buy and hold for the next decade.
1. Palo Alto Networks
Unsurprisingly, Palo Alto Networks tops this list right now after the company just announced a monster $25-billion deal to acquire fellow cybersecurity company CyberArk. The acquisition puts Palo Alto in a better position to take on rivals in the identity access management space.
Palo Alto's stock dipped on the news, but there's good reason to believe it can successfully integrate CyberArk into its broadened suite of products, considering that the company has made nearly two dozen acquisitions over the past decade. CyberArk is a particularly expensive one, no doubt, but the company is also growing at a healthy clip, with sales rising 46% in Q2 to $328 million.
Palo Alto had 80,000 customers before the acquisition, and its third quarter was impressive, with revenue rising 15% to $2.3 billion and non-GAAP earnings jumping about 21% to $0.80 per share. The company's shares took a recent dip after the CyberArk acquisition announcement, so investors may have a good buying opportunity before the company reports its Q4 results on Aug. 18.
2. Microsoft
Microsoft spans so many different technology opportunities that it's almost hard to keep up with them. As one of the top cloud computing companies -- and certainly the fastest growing, with sales from Azure and other cloud services up 39% in Q4 -- it's no surprise that Microsoft would need its own cybersecurity services to offer its customers.
Azure is taking 21% of the cloud market, and Microsoft 365 is a mainstay of many offices, so the company benefits from upselling cybersecurity services to its millions of customers. The result is that it could generate an estimated $37 billion in cybersecurity sales this year.
Investors get the added benefit of Microsoft being a leading AI stock, as well. The company is on the cutting edge of integrating chatbots into its products and services and made early investments in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. That's already helped it expand AI-powered security, like its Microsoft Security Pilot and Azure AI Security services.
3. CrowdStrike
CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity pure play that's consistently on many tech investors' buy lists because it's so good at what it does. The company's Falcon security platform gives customers an all-in-one solution that's easy to set up and manage because it's 100% cloud-based.
If you're wondering whether or not it matters that Falcon is easy to use and offers a one-stop shop for cybersecurity, consider that CrowdStrike's customer-retention rate is currently hovering around 97%. The company's subscription gross margin is just as impressive and was at 77% in Q1 of fiscal 2026. CrowdStrike's annual recurring revenue (ARR) is $4.4 billion, and the company recently reiterated its goal of reaching $10 billion in ARR in the coming years.
If all of that's not impressive enough, consider that CrowdStrike is also a leader in cybersecurity AI, with the company launching its Charlotte AI tool two years ago. Charlotte can automatically detect and contain threats without managers having to lift a finger. The company estimates it saves customers about 40 hours per week.
Any of the above companies will likely be a good long-term investment over the next decade as AI-powered cybersecurity threats increase. If I had to pick one right now, I'd personally choose Microsoft, since it has additional opportunities for growth in AI and cloud computing. But each one has its own unique approach in the market and will likely be a good investment in the coming years.

That’s pushed valuations to the brink. According to Yardeni Research, the S&P 500’s forward P/E ratio as of July 31 was 22.5x, while the technology sector’s was 30.0x. Both are higher than they’ve been since 2004.
To further emphasize the state of valuations at present, I calculated the average P/E ratio (those with positive earnings) of the top 10 stocks in Barchart’s Top 100 Stocks to Buy. It is 193.3x, almost seven times the S&P 500’s forward P/E. Fifty-six of the top 100 aren’t profitable over the trailing 12 months.
One of the 44 profitable names is Argan (AGX), a Maryland-based holding company with a primary focus on building and construction. It generates revenue from three reportable segments: Power Industry Services (79% of 2024 revenue), Industrial Construction Services (19%), and Telecommunication Services (2%).
A growing piece of its business is construction-related services for data centers. That’s provided through its largest operating segment: Power Industry Services. With AI guzzling electricity at data centers across the country, the company has kept very busy, with a project backlog of $1.86 billion as of Q1 2026, or nearly three times its 2024 revenue.
This acceleration in growth explains why Argan shares trade at 33.1 times its projected 2026 EPS estimate of $6.97 and 28.3 times its 2027 estimate of $8.15. It competes in a very popular sandbox.
The data center play has been on a tear since breaking out of a six-year stall in early 2024. Up 66% year-to-date and 387% since the beginning of 2024, Argan stock looks ready to take a break.
Here’s my two cents on whether now is a good time to buy its stock.
Priced for Perfection?
Although the company's history dates to May 1961, the holding company’s present form came to be in December 2006 when it acquired Gemma Power Systems LLC (GPS) for $33.1 million, which included $12.9 million in cash and the issuance of $20.2 million (3.67 million shares of Argan stock).
In fiscal 2008 (January year-end), GPS generated 87% of Argan’s $206.8 million in annual revenue. It paid 5.5 times sales for Gemma. Argan stock currently trades at 3.73 times sales. By comparison, two peers that I’ve recommended in the past 24 months, Limbach Holdings (LMB)and Sterling Infrastructure (STRL), trade at 2.56x and 4.35x, respectively, so Argan’s right in the middle based on sales.
As for earnings, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data, its forward P/E has only been higher than it is today on four occasions: March 2019, March 2020, June 2020, and September 2020.
While its P/S multiple isn’t in nosebleed territory, its forward P/E is relatively high, if not excessive. It’s something to keep in mind as the tariffs begin to get their hooks into the economy.
One metric I focus on to get an idea of a stock’s valuation is free cash flow yield, which is defined as free cash flow divided by enterprise value. Based on Argan’s enterprise value of $2.57 billion and a trailing 12-month free cash flow of $178.5 million, its free cash flow yield is 6.9%. I consider anything 8% or higher to be in value territory.
On valuation, it remains a stock whose future potential suggests it still has room to run, but only if the economy cooperates. Those backlogs can disappear in a hurry once the economy hits the skids.
Profitability Continues to Improve
Over the past five years, Argan’s revenue and earnings have grown by 266% and 337%, respectively. That’s some growth. Of the top 100 stocks to buy, Argan is one of only seven stocks to generate a return on assets of 10% or higher. Sterling Infrastructure is another.
Further, Argan is one of only five top 100 stocks to buy with 5-year revenue and earnings growth exceeding 100%. Not even Sterling was able to do so. That’s another big positive for owning its stock.
On June 4, Argan reported its Q1 2026 results. They were excellent.
Revenues increased by 23% to $193.7 million, its gross margin was 19.0%, 760 basis points higher than Q1 2025, and its EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) was $30.3 million, 155% higher year-over-year, with an EBITDA margin of 15.6%, 810 basis points higher than a year ago.
And, as I mentioned earlier, it finished the quarter with a $1.86 billion backlog, 36% higher than Q1 2025.
“After several years of underinvestment, there is an immediate need for the development of new energy resources, and Argan’s energy-agnostic capabilities and proven track record of success position us well as we compete for the construction of large and complex power generating facilities,” stated CEO David Watson.
I must admit, I’m a tad biased about the construction industry. My wife owns a small construction firm here in Halifax. She’s never short of business. Given the combination of AI with a housing shortage in North America, capable construction firms should be busy for the next decade or more.
Sure, a recession will cause a temporary setback of 6-12 months, but the overall potential, especially for those businesses focused on infrastructure, as Argan is, should keep them very busy.
The bottom line: If you’re prepared for a long-term hold with Argan, I don’t think it’s too late to buy its stock. Your patience will be rewarded.

Dive Brief:
A federal judge denied BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street’s motion to dismiss an antitrust lawsuit, brought by Texas and nine other states, that alleges the nation’s three largest asset managers collectively conspired to constrict coal production through their public holdings and engagements, according to court documents.
U.S. District Court Judge Jeremy Kernodle, for the U.S. Eastern Texas District Court, denied the asset managers’ bids to toss the case and said in an Aug. 1 opinion and order, that “at this stage in the proceeding, the court must assume that Plaintiffs’ allegations are true.”
The asset managers had a high burden of proof to meet in order to have the case dismissed, Victor Flatt, Case Western Reserve University’s environmental law chair, told ESG Dive Thursday. “Simply because the court is allowing the case to go forward does not mean that there will ultimately be a finding of anti-competitive behavior.”
Dive Insight:
The lawsuit was filed in December by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and nine other Republican-led states, alleging BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street had “formed a cartel to rig the coal market” and conspired “to artificially constrict” the coal market. BlackRock and State Street called the initial filing “baseless” in separate statements to ESG Dive at the time, and all three of the asset managers initially filed the motion to dismiss the lawsuit in March. BlackRock also filed a separate motion to dismiss state claims of deceptive marketing levied against the institution.
Kenodle rejected the bulk of those motions, but dismissed three state-level consumer protection suits against BlackRock, two from Louisiana and one from Nebraska.
The case at this point relies heavily on the attorneys general’s accusations that the three asset managers — as part of their commitments under climate alliances like the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative and Climate Action 100+ — sought to decrease coal production and used their public holdings to do so.
“Taken as true, these allegations plausibly state that Defendants’ acquisition and use of stocks, by proxy voting or otherwise, is reasonably likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition by decreasing output of coal and creating supracompetitive prices,” Kernodle said.
“It is plausible that Defendants did what they publicly said they were going to do: use their stock to decrease the output of coal,” he added. “Plaintiffs may ultimately be unable to prove this claim.”
As far as the allegations of a conspiracy to artificially deflate coal production, Kernodle said the states “lack direct evidence of a conspiracy.”
“Plaintiffs do, however, plausibly allege the existence of a conspiracy among Defendants based on circumstantial evidence,” the judge wrote. “This is a close call.”
Kernodle said that while the asset managers’ choices to join NZAM and CA100+ “announces a commitment to the public, it is not necessarily a commitment by Defendants to each other — at least as alleged in the amended complaint.”
Following the ruling, Paxton again accused the asset managers of forming “an investment cartel to illegally control national energy markets” and said in an Aug. 1 press release that the court win “represents a major step in holding them accountable.”
Prior to the ruling, the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice issued a joint statement in support of the states’ arguments. The government’s official stance is that — while antitrust laws allow for passive investing, corporate governance-focused shareholder advocacy and active investing “that doesn’t harm competition” — BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street went beyond those bounds in this case.
“In failing to grant the case dismissal, the court gives plausibility to certain theories that the very concept of net-zero policies may implicate anti-competitive behavior rather than it being a response to the financial risks for companies that are large [greenhouse gas] producers in a climate changing world,” Flatt said in emailed comments. “That certainly has to give pause to companies seeking to work together to reduce GHGs in specific industries.""
In separate statements to ESG Dive last week, the asset managers said they remain resolute in fighting the charges.
Vanguard said in an emailed statement that it was “disappointed in the court’s decision,” but “looks forward to the opportunity to vigorously defend against plaintiffs' claims and will continue to give investors the best chance for investment success.
State Street told ESG Dive that it still believes the lawsuit to be “baseless and without merit” and said it “poses unnecessary risk to investors and energy markets.”
“There is no collusion here, and we remain confident that the facts and legal substance are on our side,” State Street said in an emailed statement.
BlackRock said it is pleased to have some of the state-level claims dismissed, but said that the states’ goal of forcing the companies to divest their coal holdings risks “undermining the Trump administration’s goal of American energy independence.”
“This case is based on an absurd theory that coal companies conspired with their shareholders to reduce coal production,” BlackRock said in an emailed statement. “This case is not supported by the facts, and we will demonstrate that.”",bfdb275b763e70a7175670a892ed5a9c,trafilatura,5475,0

They are earned through a process called mining, which involves using computers to solve complicated mathematical problems to help validate transactions on the blockchain.
But the XRP(CRYPTO: XRP) cryptocurrency is different because it's issued directly by Ripple, the company that created it. This arrangement caught the attention of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the agency sued Ripple in 2020 alleging it breached financial securities laws.
The legal battle was ongoing until last Thursday, when the SEC officially agreed to settle the case in line with President Donald Trump's pro-crypto agenda. Could this be a major upside catalyst for XRP?
The SEC finally backs off
Ripple developed a payment system called Ripple Payments, which allows banks to settle cross-border transactions with one another directly no matter what existing payment infrastructure they use. This eliminates the need for intermediaries (middlemen), so money can be sent around the world instantly.
XRP is designed to standardize transactions through Ripple Payments. For instance, an American bank might send XRP to a French bank instead of sending U.S. dollars, which cuts out expensive foreign exchange fees. Once the French bank receives XRP, it can simply convert it into its domestic currency (the euro). The transfer would cost just 0.00001 XRP tokens, or a fraction of one U.S. cent.
XRP has a total supply of 100 billion tokens, with 59.3 billion in circulation and the other 40.7 billion controlled by Ripple, which releases them as necessary to meet demand. In its lawsuit, the SEC argued that XRP should be treated like a stock, a bond, or any other financial security normally issued by a company. This would've placed Ripple under a strict regulatory framework, adding costs and restrictions that might have derailed its business model.
In August 2024, a judge ruled that XRP might only be a security when it's issued to institutions, but not when it's traded on public exchanges or used in transactions. Ripple was slapped with a $125 million penalty, but the crypto community viewed it as a win. The SEC appealed the decision, which threatened to tie the matter up in court for several more years, but then President Trump was elected.
Trump promised to assemble a pro-crypto administration, and he appointed industry advocate Paul Atkins to run the SEC. The agency has paused or withdrawn several of its active cases against crypto giants like Binance and Coinbase under his leadership, and on Aug. 7, it officially withdrew its appeal against Ripple, ending a five-year legal slugfest.
But don't count on further upside for XRP
XRP set a new record high in July for the first time since 2018, as an imminent resolution with the SEC was widely expected. The token also benefited from the approval of the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF last month, which is a leveraged exchange-traded fund (ETF) that invests in XRP futures contracts. Investors consider this a stepping stone to the approval of spot XRP ETFs, the same way futures-based Bitcoin ETFs preceded spot Bitcoin ETFs.
But I wouldn't bet on XRP moving higher over the long term. First of all, banks don't have to use it in order to benefit from instant cross-border transactions through Ripple Payments, because the network also supports fiat currencies. Therefore, the success of Ripple's platform won't necessarily translate into a higher price for XRP.
Second of all, Bitcoin is benefiting from ETFs because it's considered to be a legitimate store of value, thanks to its decentralized nature and capped supply. Investors want a safe, regulated way to buy it, and ETFs are the answer. XRP, on the other hand, doesn't have a great track record of creating value for investors -- after all, it just spent seven years trading below its previous all-time high.
Moreover, since XRP is controlled by Ripple, the token's value is vulnerable to downside when the company experiences issues. The five-year legal battle with the SEC is a prime example, and remember, it's entirely possible the agency adopts a strict approach to crypto again under new government administrations in the future.
Therefore, I don't think XRP has a path to sustainable upside over the long term.

This resilience is impressive, as they've weathered at least seven recessions in that time.
The list of current Dividend Kings is short, with only 55 companies. More companies should join this group as they reach the milestone in the coming years. Here are three likely future Dividend Kings.
1. ExxonMobil
ExxonMobil(NYSE: XOM) is steadily marching toward Dividend King status. The oil giant has now increased its dividend for 42 straight years, the longest current streak in the oil patch. Only 4% of companies in the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) have delivered dividend growth of 42 or more years.
The energy company has put itself in a strong position to continue increasing its dividend. ExxonMobil's plan to 2030 aims to deliver the growth potential of $20 billion in earnings and $30 billion in cash flow by the dawn of the next decade. That has it on track to deliver compound annual growth rates of 10% for earnings and 8% for its cash flow over the next five years.
Exxon aims to deliver this robust growth by investing $140 billion into higher-return major capital projects and its Permian Basin development program. It also expects to achieve another $7 billion in structural cost savings by 2030, compared to the third quarter of last year.
Exxon is also building the energy company of the future by investing in several lower-carbon energy technologies, including hydrogen, carbon capture and sequestration, and lithium. These and other new businesses have the potential to add $3 billion to its earnings by 2030 and $13 billion by 2040. Combine all this with Exxon's fortress financial profile, and the oil giant seems destined to eventually earn the crown of Dividend King.
2. NNN REIT
NNN REIT(NYSE: NNN) reached an important milestone last year when the real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered its 35th consecutive dividend increase. Only two other REITs and fewer than 80 publicly traded companies have reached that level. The REIT has since extended its streak to 36 straight years.
The landlord has a very simple business model: It invests in single-tenant net leased properties. It acquires properties secured by long-term net leases (initial terms of 10 to 20 years) in prime locations within strong markets. These properties produce very reliable rental income.
NNN REIT establishes relationships with expanding retailers, which steadily provide it with new investment opportunities. It typically acquires properties via sale-leaseback transactions. These relationship-based transactions provide clients with capital to continue expanding their retail footprints, which ultimately presents the REIT with new investment opportunities. NNN REIT maintains a conservative financial profile, which allows it to continue expanding its portfolio (and dividend) throughout the economic cycle.
3. Medtronic
Medtronic(NYSE: MDT) is close to earning Dividend King status, with 48 straight years of dividend growth. The medical device maker is well-positioned to continue raising its payout.
The healthcare company plans to separate its diabetes business over the next 18 months. It ideally plans to complete an initial public offering of the unit and a subsequent split-off of the business. This strategy will allow it to focus all its attention on its growing cardiovascular, neuroscience, and medical-surgical units.
Those three markets are large and growing at a mid-to-high single-digit annual rate. Medtronic aims to capture a larger share of these expanding markets by continuing to invest heavily in research and development to launch new and improved products. It also has the balance sheet strength to make acquisitions as the right opportunities arise. These growth investments should increase its cash flow, enabling Medtronic to ascend to the next level of dividend royalty.
Three likely future kings
ExxonMobil, NNN REIT, and Medtronic are all well on their way to eventually becoming Dividend Kings. They have the financial strength and visible earnings growth potential to continue increasing their dividends for years to come. All this means they're ideal stocks to buy for those seeking durable, steadily rising dividend income.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-predictions-stablecoins-2030-090400121.html,8b2cc5964dde8e35fefc859b5efbfaf1,3 Predictions for Stablecoins by 2030,3 Predictions for Stablecoins by 2030,2025-08-12 18:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"The original promise of stablecoins sounded almost boring. Peg a token's value to that of a fiat currency like the dollar, and the crypto market gets ""digital dollars"" that behave like dollars, just as advertised. In practice, they're a bit more interesting. Regulators eye them as systemic risks or threats to the integrity of their own currencies, criminals use them as easily disabled getaway cars, and investors treat them as the closest thing to cash that blockchains can offer.
Stablecoins will only become more important within the financial system over the next five years. Here are three of my predictions for developments that every long-term investor should expect with them before 2030.
1. Governments will lean on the freeze button more often
Governments like to control money, and stablecoins are no exception.
Stablecoins already include an off switch. Assets such as USDC(CRYPTO: USDC) and Tether(CRYPTO: USDT) can freeze any wallet address in seconds, and they do.
Circle, USDC's issuer, froze 75,000 USDC in addresses tied to Tornado Cash within hours of U.S. sanctions on that organization in 2022. A year later, Tether iced 32 wallets allegedly linked to terrorism financing, bowing to law enforcement pressure without fanfare.
Washington just made its power over stablecoins more explicit and expansive. The Genius Act, signed into law on July 18, 2025, requires that every foreign or domestic stablecoin issuer prove it can carry out lawful orders as compelled by the U.S. government, including asset freezes and seizures, as a condition of market access. Expect other jurisdictions to use that same language when they write their own rulebooks.
The trend is clear. By 2030, I predict that freezing and clawing back stablecoins will feel as routine as a bank's fraud alert today, and it'll be a routine form of asset seizure as part of criminal investigations. Investors who prize censorship resistance thus need to understand that stablecoins are, on average, edging closer to traditional banking controls.
And, unfortunately, it is practically guaranteed that governments will use their powers over stablecoins against dissidents so as to prevent them from accessing them as a form of money.
2. At least one major stablecoin will blow up and go to zero
Stablecoins maintain their value via financial engineering that remains under the hood relative to investors. Sometimes that engine breaks down catastrophically.
Recall TerraUSD. In 2022, it experienced a death spiral that vaporized $60 billion in wealth and showed how quickly confidence can evaporate when reserves are thin or poorly constructed. Even fully backed coins wobble sometimes. USDC slipped to $0.88 during the 2023 Silicon Valley Bank crisis before recovering.
Stablecoins now hold roughly $257 billion in circulation. As balances swell, incentives to cut corners or chase yield with reserve assets grow, too. All it takes is one audit gap, custody hack, or bad bond trade to spark a run.
Therefore, I predict that at least one major stablecoin will blow up and go to zero within the next five years.
Long-term investors should hold only the most transparent, fully audited options and avoid holding their life savings in any single coin.
3. Stablecoins will start eating SWIFT's lunch
Once you're set up on the blockchain, stablecoins are a very fast and very convenient way to transfer money across borders without incurring the usual delays and high fees involved with legacy money transfer systems.
Legacy payment systems rely on messaging networks like SWIFT. Those solutions cost tens of dollars, and take a few days for transactions to clear.
Stablecoins are smaller in raw volume at the moment, but are obviously sprinting forward. On-chain transfers now exceed $20 trillion per year, growing by an order of magnitude in just four years.
If the current pace of growth persists, or, more likely, accelerates, I predict that stablecoin corridors will surpass SWIFT for person-to-person transfers well before 2030. For investors, that shift favors blockchains and custodians positioned as low-cost bridges between digital dollars and traditional banks, so invest accordingly.

Chasing shares of the leading multiplex operator higher often ends in heartbreak. It didn't work out well for speculators who chased AMC higher in 2021, when it was one of the two leading meme stocks. AMC has plummeted by a split-adjusted 99.6% -- that's not a typo -- from its frenzied peak four summers ago.
You can't blame AMC for the crowdsourced bidding up of the stock in 2021, but every cruel timeline after that is largely the handiwork of AMC's own mismanagement. Rival Cinemark(NYSE: CNK) turned profitable two years ago and hasn't looked back. AMC is almost there on the bottom line, but the stock has fallen 94% over the past two years. Cinemark, on the other hand, has risen 45% in that same time. Screening experience supersizer Imax(NYSE: IMAX) has climbed 30% in those same two years.
It's not movie theater stocks that are failing now that the pandemic is fading in the rearview. This is just the case for AMC, as poor management decisions that diluted shareholders and a lack of cost controls have plagued investors. AMC's blowout second-quarter this week offers an opportunity to rally, even if Monday's results amounted to a modest 3% uptick. The gains haven't lasted before, but maybe this time AMC can flip the script.
Reel potential
AMC's financial update on Monday morning warranted more than a token bump higher. Analysts were targeting a loss of $0.08 a share on a 30% increase in revenue following a strong second quarter at the box office. The bar was high, but AMC rose higher. Its nearly $1.4 billion in revenue was a 36% increase, as a 26% jump in attendance was enhanced by folks paying up for premium-priced screening experiences and spending more at the concessions stand.
The bottom line is an even better story. I had predicted that AMC could surprise investors with an actual profit on Monday, and I didn't miss by much. AMC posted a net loss of $4.7 million. Its adjusted net loss was $0.5 million, technically $0.00 on a per-share basis, but technically not breakeven results. AMC's adjusted deficit a year earlier clocked in at $137.9 million. Turning to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), it was not only positive but also a nearly fivefold improvement.
AMC isn't just turning the corner. It can literally see beyond the bend now.
AMC finally has the opportunity to exhale. However, AMC may not look its post-pandemic best, considering it was profitable two summers ago and the current quarter could be a dud. Analysts also see a widening loss on a 2% year-over-year decline in revenue, and domestic box office receipts are currently 9% below where they were at this point in the third quarter of last year -- and 18% below where they were two years ago at this point.
This is not a pretty picture, but thankfully it's a moving picture. Analysts see revenue growth returning in the fourth quarter, fueled by a strong slate of blockbusters. There's a good chance AMC turns a profit in the fourth quarter, something it hasn't done since 2018.
AMC has upside here -- pent-up upside. Cinemark may be profitable and even shells out a quarterly dividend now. Imax and Cinemark are trading at compelling forward earnings multiples in the low to mid-teens. But AMC could still crank out the stronger return in the next year or two as it takes steps in the right direction.
AMC served up positive free cash flow in the second quarter, meaning there's no reason to bludgeon shareholders with dilution anymore. Audiences are smaller in number on this end of the COVID-19 crisis, but they're willing to pay more for a reserved seat at their local AMC. They're also splurging for widened menu offerings and clever release-specific merchandise. Entertainment stocks offer escapism, and that's not going out of style anytime soon. Momentum has arrived before the bulls got seated, and that's not a bad thing.
AMC is back. The stock chart just doesn't know it yet.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index increased by 2.7% year over year in July . That's slightly less than a Dow Jones estimate for a 2.8% advance. The report jolted stocks . Futures contracts tied to the major U.S. benchmarks surged following the release, as the new data gave investors hope the Federal Reserve will cut rates not once, not twice, but three times before year-end. Take a look at Fed rate cut expectations for the final three meetings of the year relative to where they were on Monday — based on interest rate futures data from the CME Group's FedWatch tool: September: 91.8% chance vs. 85.9% on Monday October: 66.3% chance vs. 55.1% December: 56.7% chance vs. 45% The latest inflation report, however, wasn't without blemishes. The core CPI, which strips out food and energy prices, expanded more than anticipated, growing 3.1% year over year versus a consensus for a 3% gain. Take a look at what strategists and investors around Wall Street are saying: Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, global co-CIO of multi-asset solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management: ""The Fed is getting the data support that the tariff effect on price level will mostly be transitory. Tariffs have yet to drive substantial price increases, as companies continue to offset cost pressures by drawing down inventories and adjusting prices cautiously due to perceived consumer price sensitivity. … In essence, this inflation print supports the narrative of an insurance rate cut in September, which will be a key driving force for the markets."" Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital: ""Tuesday's CPI data was tame enough that it gives the Federal Reserve the green light to cut rates by at least 25 basis points in September and opens the possibility of a larger 50 basis point cut in September. This data, coupled with the weak July employment report from earlier this month, puts the nail in the coffin for lower interest rates."" Josh Jamner, senior investment strategy analyst at ClearBridge Investments: ""CPI data that was in-line with expectations will not change the outlook for a September rate cut which was already largely priced into markets, but should provide a boost to risk assets with equities higher and interest rates lower as traders unwind hedges they had put in place to protect against the risk of an upside surprise in the data, which failed to materialize."" Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth: ""The CPI report is reminiscent of the philosophical question - 'If a tree falls in a forest…' The report is very much in line with expectations. Core goods are the real driver of the move up in the index, while being somewhat offset by energy and shelter cost. The report will likely not change the path forward for the Fed, as we expect to see rate cuts at the next three meetings. The market can now move on to shifting its focus to potential trade deals."" Peter C. Earle, director of economics and economic freedom at the American Institute for Economic Research, on CNBC's "" Squawk Box "": ""I'm not really a big fan of these numbers. … We knew that tariff-related cost pressures were going to be a key upside going to this release. Not as bad as we thought, but I mean, still, this is going to complicate the work of the Fed a bit."" Chris Zaccarelli, CIO at Northlight Asset Management: ""In this environment stocks can continue to move higher and it is going to take a much larger inflation number – or other shock to the market – for a correction to commence. With many strategists expecting volatility in the months ahead, yet recommending that dips should be bought, it's hard to envision a very large pullback absent an actual recession."" Daniel Siluk, head of global short duration and liquidity at Janus Henderson Investors: ""The July CPI report came in broadly in line with expectations, reinforcing the view that inflation is under control, even if not quite at target. The headline print was contained by falling energy and gasoline prices, while services remained the primary driver of the overall increase."" Peter Boockvar, CIO at One Point BFG Wealth Partners: ""Both Treasurys and the S & P futures are breathing a sigh of relief that it wasn't higher than expected but 3.1% y/o/y core CPI is still well above 2%. I know some on the Fed and one new member joining temporarily seem to be very confident on how the economic data will play out over the next 4 months but I'm much less confident as the tariff impact will continue to flow through the data and I must say, many service companies too are feeling the higher cost of goods prices, it's not just manufacturers."" — CNBC's Sarah Min and Alex Harring contributed reporting.",78ba9fc9db25f6c6925b9a7fbc9c0cb5,trafilatura,4784,0

The S&P 500 rose 1.1% to top its all-time high set two weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 483 points, or 1.1%, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 1.4% to set its own record.
Stocks got a lift from hopes that the better-than-expected inflation report will give the Federal Reserve leeway to cut interest rates at its next meeting in September.
But the Fed has been hesitant because of the possibility that Trump’s tariffs could make inflation much worse. Lowering rates would give inflation more fuel, potentially adding oxygen to a growing fire. That’s why Fed officials have said they wanted to see more data come in about inflation before moving.
Tuesday’s report said U.S. consumers paid prices for groceries, gasoline and other costs of living that were overall 2.7% higher in July than a year earlier. That’s the same inflation rate as June’s, and it was below the 2.8% that economists expected.
The report pushed traders on Wall Street to increase bets that the Fed will cut interest rates for the first time this year in September. They’re betting on a 94% chance of that, up from nearly 86% a day earlier, according to data from CME Group.
The Fed will receive one more report on inflation, as well as one more on the U.S. job market, before its next meeting, which ends Sept. 17. The most recent jobs report was a stunner, coming in much weaker than economists expected.
Some economists warn that more twists and turns in upcoming data could make the Fed’s upcoming decisions not so easy. Its twin goals are to get inflation to 2% while keeping the job market healthy. Helping one with interest rates, though, often means hurting the other.
Even Tuesday’s better-than-expected inflation report had some discouraging undertones. An underlying measure of inflation, which economists say does a better job of predicting where inflation may be heading, hit its highest point since early this year, noted Gary Schlossberg, market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. That helped cause some up-and-down swings for Treasury yields in the bond market.
“Eventually, tariffs can show up in varying degrees in consumer prices, but these one-off price increases don’t happen all at once,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “That will confound the Fed and economic commentators for months to come.”
Other central banks around the world have been lowering interest rates, and Australia’s on Tuesday cut for the third time this year.
Circle Internet Group, the company behind the popular USDC cryptocurrency that tracks the U.S. dollar, climbed 1.3% despite reporting a larger loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It said its total revenue and reserve income grew 53% in its first quarter as a publicly traded company, which topped forecasts.
On the losing side of Wall Street was Celanese, which sank 13.1% even though the chemical company delivered a better profit than expected. It said that customers in most of its markets continue to be challenged, and CEO Scott Richardson said that “the demand environment does not seem to be improving.”
Cardinal Health dropped 7.2% despite likewise reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell short of forecasts, and analysts said the market’s expectations were particularly high for the company after its stock had already soared 33.3% for the year coming into the day.
Critics say the broad U.S. stock market is looking expensive after its surge from a bottom in April. That’s putting pressure on companies to deliver continued growth in profit.
All told, the S&P 500 rose 72.31 points to 6,445.76. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 483.52 to 44,458.61, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 296.50 to 21,681.90.
In stock markets abroad, indexes edged up in China after Trump signed an executive order late Monday that delayed hefty tariffs on the world’s second-largest economy by 90 days. The move was widely expected, and the hope is that it will clear the way for a possible deal to avert a dangerous trade war between the United States and China.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 2.1%, and South Korea’s Kospi fell 0.5% for two of the world’s bigger moves.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.28% from 4.27% late Monday.
The yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, fell to 3.73% from 3.76%.

Since the April 8 stock market low fueled by fears about President Trump's trade war, the Renaissance IPO ETF has posted a return of nearly 50%, close to doubling the return of the S&P 500 Index.
Can that rise continue, or is the IPO market showing the signs of the type of investor euphoria that is setting it up for a big fall?
Kennedy, whose firm specializes in IPO research, says what he expects from IPO market in the near-term is a possible ""return to normalcy"" rather than a repeat of the Covid-era IPO boom of 2020 and 2021 — the ""crazy levels,"" as he put it on this week's CNBC ""ETF Edge,"" when there was a burst of deals which saw far too many pre-profit companies go public through not just IPOs but a wave of SPAC offerings.
Kennedy likens the current IPO resurgence to the post-financial crisis era, and specifically, a five-year stretch between 2014 and 2019 during which IPO offerings rebounded. But even that level of sustained pickup in deals, he said, ""is going to feel like a very busy market after the past few years.""
According to Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, the big gap between the IPO market returns since April and the stock market reflects the broader risk of sentiment, ""and what you see is when animal spirits are high, it's typically good for IPOs,"" he said on ""ETF Edge.""
He pointed to two of the most notable deals from the AI and crypto space: Coreweave and Circle.
""Circle is up big since it went public. Coreweave has had huge gains. And when you have companies in areas such as crypto and AI where there is already a lot of investor interest, that will help,"" he said.
It has helped the ETF industry too, according to Geraci, with a ""monster year"" for inflows into spot crypto ETFs — $26 billion in all, with bitcoin ETFs taking in $19 billion and ether ETFs taking in $7 billion. July alone saw investors add $6 billion to bitcoin funds and $5.5 billion to ether ETFs.
Circle had given back a good deal of its gains since going public, but was still up roughly 50% this year before it reported earnings on Tuesday morning, which led to a new surge in the company's stock price.
""Circle provided a lot of fuel for the fire,"" Kennedy said. ""There's a saying on Wall Street that when ducks are quacking, feed them, so Circle really accelerated the timeline of a lot of crypto companies waiting to go public,"" he added.
Peter Thiel-backed crypto exchange company Bullish is next in the pipeline, and raised the size of its IPO on Monday, suggesting a $5 billion valuation.
Kennedy said there are plenty of other crypto companies that could follow with offerings, including Grayscale and Gemini, which have both filed for offerings, as well as Kraken, which is rumored to be considering an IPO, and Ripple. ""There are several names we are watching out for,"" he said.
The fintech resurgence in IPOs extends beyond crypto, with ""buy now, pay later"" company Klarna expected to move ahead with its IPO in the fall after multiple delays. ""They seem pretty definitive about that timing,"" Kennedy said.
Other delayed IPOs are planning to test the market now, too, such as StubHub, which is now poised for a September deal.
Coreweave, which reports earnings later this week, has come down from its post-IPO peak, but is still sitting on a 250% gain since its deal. Kennedy said that as with crypto, there are plenty of pre-IPO AI companies waiting for their moment, and that could serve as further momentum for the IPO market activity. He said the current environment, in which AI companies just need to declare themselves open for business to get a billion-dollar valuation is ""just crazy,"" but he added that it will be a ""good thing in the long run"" for a sustained flow of IPOs in the years ahead.
While Kennedy said an OpenAI IPO might not arrive until 2028-2029, there are more than just the biggest-name companies going public that have an AI theme embedded in their business, such as design firm Figma and medtech company Heartflow. These are not AI companies building large language models, but companies where AI is integrated into everything they do, he said.

However, there were worrying signs under the surface, including evidence that Trump administration policies are stoking inflation for certain goods and services, economists said. Those effects will likely become more pronounced later this year, they said.
""Tariff and immigration policy fingerprints are all over the report,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's, said.
""The tariff and immigration effects aren't screaming at us, but they're certainly speaking very loudly and over the next couple months they'll start yelling,"" Zandi said.
The consumer price index rose 2.7% in July relative to a year earlier, unchanged from the prior month and less than expected, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday.
The CPI is a widely used measure of inflation that tracks how quickly prices rise or fall for a basket of goods and services, from haircuts to coffee, clothing and concert tickets.
In July, grocery and gasoline prices declined — or, deflated — by a respective 0.1% and 2.2% on a monthly basis from June, according to the CPI data.
Economists like to look at inflation data that strips out energy and food prices, which can be volatile from month to month.
This so-called core CPI figure has been rising in recent months: It climbed 3.1% in July 2025 from July 2024. That's up from a 2.9% annual pace in June and is the fastest annual rate for core CPI since February.
""[W]e expect it will rise further to a peak of 3.8% by the end of the year as tariffs bleed through more fully to consumer prices,"" Michael Pearce, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote Tuesday.
Inflation most evident for consumer goods
Tariffs are a tax placed on imports, paid by U.S. companies that import the good or service.
Businesses generally pass on those higher costs to consumers, at least in part, economists said. The Budget Lab at Yale University estimates the average household will lose $2,400 in the short run as a result of all tariffs the Trump administration put in place as of Aug. 6.
Tariff effects are most apparent for goods prices, like those for household furnishings and apparel, Zandi said.
Inflation for all core commodities — which strips out food and energy commodities — was up 0.2% in each of the last two months, according to the CPI data. In more typical times, goods prices are generally flat or declining, Zandi said.
""That they're on the rise is clear evidence of tariff impact,"" Zandi said.
Household furnishings prices were up 0.7% on a monthly basis in July, according to the CPI data. Apparel prices were up a more muted 0.1%, and toys 0.2%.
Not a 'one-month event'
On an annual basis, core commodities inflation was up 1.2% in July, the fastest pace in over two years.
""There are clear signs a range of goods prices are moving higher, pushing core goods inflation to a more than two-year high, but some major tariffed items, including autos and major appliances, have yet to show much impact,"" Pearce wrote.
Stephen Miran, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" that the CPI data shows ""no evidence whatsoever"" that tariffs have fueled higher consumer prices.
""It just hasn't panned out,"" Miran said.
The full effect of tariffs is unlikely to be felt for several months, as businesses delay passing on higher costs, economists said.
""This isn't a one-month event,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Economics. ""The impact will be dragged out over many months, as businesses are waiting to see where those tariffs settle.""
They may test consumers' price sensitivity slowly instead of all at once, she said. Companies may also still be selling old inventory that wasn't subject to import duties, economists said.
""It's been a very dynamic time for these trade negotiations ... but we're still, you know, a ways away from seeing where things settle down,"" Jerome Powell, Federal Reserve chair, said last month.
Additionally, there's evidence that Trump administration policy around immigration is limiting the supply of immigrant labor in certain sectors of the economy, putting upward pressure on inflation, Zandi said.

Americans with a credit score of 620 or below pay about $3,400 per year for essential financial products in what Bankrate, in a new report, calls a ""subprime tax.""
The ""subprime tax"" comes in the form of higher interest rates on products such as mortgages, credit cards, auto and personal loans, and pricier premiums on auto and home insurance.
Borrowers with a score of 620 pay, on average, $1,330 more annually in mortgage loan interest than those with credit scores of 700, Bankrate found. Compared with that group, subprime borrowers also pay $745 more annually in auto loan interest, $514 more in auto insurance premiums, $398 more in home insurance premiums, $328 more in personal loan interest, and $89 more in credit card interest.
If a borrower doesn't improve their score, the subprime tax can snowball over the long run, Bankrate found. Over five years, Bankrate's report said, the subprime tax can cost about $17,016, and over 30 years, the cost is roughly $102,094.

Bankrate said the insurance premium and debt calculations were based on national average data from Bankrate, Experian and FICO. Bankrate defined a score of 620 and lower as subprime, and a score of 700 and higher as prime.
The subprime tax affects roughly 21% of American adults, Bankrate estimated.
As of April, the average FICO credit score in the U.S. is 715. The score ranges from 300 to 850; the higher the credit score, the better.
The Bankrate report showcases the value of having a good credit score: A good score increases your likelihood of being approved for loans and of receiving better financing terms, experts say.
However, ""you don't need a perfect credit score to get the best loan terms,"" said Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst at Bankrate.
""Generally speaking, lenders stop distinguishing once you hit the mid-700s and above,"" he said.
Why a low credit score can cost you
Your credit score is a ""prediction of your credit behavior, such as how likely you are to pay a loan back on time, based on information from your credit reports,"" according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
""It's like a standardized test score,"" said Rossman.
If your credit score is low, lenders may think you are more likely to pay late, said John Ulzheimer, a consumer credit expert. To offset that risk, banks and lenders typically charge the borrower higher interest rates.
How to improve your credit
Lenders have different definitions of what makes a good credit score, Ulzheimer said.
Even so, experts say, once your score gets to a certain point, or somewhere in the mid-700s, you are generally in a good place in terms of risk.
""The odds of you going delinquent at some point are so low that the lender is happy with taking the risk with you,"" Ulzheimer said.
To improve your credit, first take a look at your credit reports, issued by the three credit reporting bureaus: Experian, TransUnion and Equifax. You can request them for free via annualcreditreport.com. Your credit scores are based on the information in those reports.
Make sure the information in each of the reports is correct, said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree. If there's a mistake, which can happen, correcting it can help improve your credit.
Otherwise, the ""most actionable way"" to improve your score is by working toward paying down any credit card debt, said Ulzheimer.
""If you can pay down or pay off credit card debt, your scores are going to improve,"" he said.
Reducing your debt can improve your credit utilization ratio, or how much you owe relative to how much credit you have available to you.
This factor makes up 30% of your score, according to FICO. Experts typically advise keeping your credit utilization under 30%, but a 2024 LendingTree study found that consumers with the best scores had utilization ratios of around 10%.
Another easy way to boost your score is by making on-time payments. Payment history makes up 35% of your score, according to FICO.
As you increase your credit score, look for ways to benefit. For example, ask your credit card issuers if you can qualify for a lower rate, and see if your insurers will reassess your policy premiums. Gauge whether it's worth refinancing any current loans.",5e815b524d21c116630903682215bc9e,trafilatura,4488,0

Last week, U.S. gold futures touched on an all-time high following reports that some gold bars could be hit with Trump's so-called reciprocal tariffs. There had been some confusion over whether gold would be exempt from the new import duties. On July 31, a Swiss gold refiner was told in a ruling from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency (CBP) that their one-kilogram and 100-ounce gold bars should be categorized under a customs code that would not exempt them from reciprocal tariffs. In a Monday post on his Truth Social platform, however, Trump confirmed that ""Gold will not be Tariffed!"" It came after the White House said it would issue a clarification on what it labeled ""misinformation"" on gold bar tariffs. Gold futures fell following the update. By 8:12 a.m. ET on Tuesday, contracts for December delivery fell another 0.35% to trade at $3,392.90. Spot gold , meanwhile, was little changed, trading at $3,339.60 an ounce. @GC.1 5D line Gold futures Philippe Gijsels, chief strategy officer at BNP Paribas Fortis, was already bullish on gold — whether or not it was subject to the Trump administration's tariffs regime. He told CNBC earlier this week that he believes gold prices could exceed his $4,000 target price, adding on Tuesday that the president's confirmation that the metal is exempt from so-called reciprocal tariffs frees up room for gold to soar to new heights. ""Donald Trump stepped back from the brink on the gold tariff,"" he said. ""Gold has been a currency and a safe haven for all of history. For it to play that role, it should have one clear and transparent price everywhere in the world and not different prices in different locations. Therefore, this news is gold market positive."" Gijsels noted that gold typically outperforms in times of turmoil, uncertainty and volatility. ""At times when people worry about unsustainably high deficits and debt levels, and inflation is running up, people look for a beacon of stability,"" he said. ""In short, the current environment is the perfect storm for gold. This means that the bull market in the yellow metal may only be in its very first inning."" Tariffs 'create havoc on the ground' UBS is also forecasting an increase in the price of spot gold. By the end of the year, the Swiss investment bank expects London spot gold will reach $3,500 an ounce, its strategists said in a Tuesday note. That's a premium of around 4.5% on current prices. ""The recent debacle over the US's gold import classifications signals how tariff pronouncements, interpretations, and subsequent practical application by different parts of the Trump administration can create havoc on the ground,"" they said. They added that ""dramatic events are hard to forget,"" arguing that even with clarification of a tariff exemption from the White House, the earlier confusion was likely to have some lasting impact on gold investors' mindsets. ""So, while we don't see this impacting demand for gold per se (in fact, it could enhance it), where and how investors hold gold is now even more important,"" UBS' strategists added. ""Our benchmark target for the London spot price is USD 3,500/oz by end-2025, with even greater upside if economic or geopolitical risks step higher."" Uncertainty persists The tariffs exemption for gold came at no surprise for markets, Michael Hsueh, a research analyst at Deutsche Bank, told CNBC on Tuesday. ""It's as expected by the market, seen by the narrowing of the matched EFP spread between London and New York already yesterday,"" he said in an email. The spread of the EFP, or exchange for physical trading strategy, to which Hsueh referred is a measure of the price difference between gold futures in New York and spot prices in London. After news broke that gold may be subject to Trump's country-specific tariffs, some analysts raised questions about how futures contracts would be settled if the cost of importing the metal rose. Hsueh added on Tuesday that, given the July ruling on import codes, some confusion still lingered. ""There is still some uncertainty over how the contradiction will be resolved, but this does not have any obvious market implications (as long as it is resolved),"" he said. — CNBC's Michael Bloom and Spencer Kimball contributed to this report.",7951fc6fee9bd81d69b7cad89e3de96f,trafilatura,4434,0

It's a miniature version of Sudoku, an old game with a rich history.
The new Mini Sudoku is LinkedIn's sixth game. It's scaled down from the traditional 9-by-9 grid and meant to be completed in two or three minutes.
""We don't want to have a puzzle on LinkedIn that takes 20 minutes to solve, right?"" said Lakshman Somasundaram, a senior director of product at the Microsoft subsidiary, in an interview with CNBC. ""We're not games for games' sake.""
The introduction has the potential to strike a nostalgic chord and spark competition with colleagues, friends and family members for how fast the puzzle can be solved.
As with other puzzles in the app, Mini Sudoku gets harder as the days progress through the week.
LinkedIn added games last year to increase the fun and give users something new to talk about with one another.
Millions of people play LinkedIn's games every day, a spokesperson said. The most popular time is 7 a.m. ET, and Gen Z is the top demographic. Of those who play today, 86% will return tomorrow, and 82% will be playing next week, the spokesperson said.
Launched in 2003 and acquired by Microsoft for $27 billion in 2016, LinkedIn remains in growth mode. Revenue increased about 9% to $4.6 billion in the latest quarter and membership reached 1.2 billion. Meta's social networks are more popular, with a combined 3.5 billion daily users and 22% revenue growth.
Unlike Meta, LinkedIn gives recruiters tools for finding candidates, and job seekers can apply for openings listed on the site. LinkedIn also now promotes a personalized feed of videos, similar to Google's YouTube, TikTok and Meta's own Facebook and Instagram.
Making the game
LinkedIn's development of the game resulted from an encounter with Japanese publisher Nikoli, which popularized Sudoku.
Somasundaram and a band of LinkedIn associate product managers visited Nikoli's Tokyo headquarters late last year and spoke through a translator about puzzles with the publisher's employees. That led to weeks of meetings involving LinkedIn, Nikoli and Thomas Snyder, a three-time World Sudoku Championship winner who has helped LinkedIn with its gaming strategy.
The group hoped to make Sudoku more accessible, building several prototypes before landing on the board with six rows and six columns of squares.
""It's very easy to just make a Sudoku grid,"" Snyder said. ""It's very hard to make art in the form of Sudoku. And that's what both Nikoli and we do.""
Snyder is founder and CEO of Grandmaster Puzzles, a publisher of Sudoku books. With a Ph.D. in chemistry, he goes by the nickname Dr. Sudoku and has contributed to the hint feature in LinkedIn's Mini Sudoku and constructed some of the puzzles. With each day's puzzle, there will be a video showing how Snyder solves it.
""I think it's got the potential to be the largest of the games, just because it's going to have a lot of brand awareness from moment one,"" he said.
Sudoku's history
Howard Garns, an architect from Indiana, came up with a game called ""Number Place"" that required people to fill in a grid with numbers from one to nine. No number can be repeated in a row or column, and all nine numbers must appear just once in each of the nine 3-by-3 grids that make up the puzzle.
Number Place debuted in the magazine Dell Pencil Puzzles & Word Games in 1979. It only took off after Nikoli included a spin on the puzzle in the October 1984 issue of Puzzle Communication Nikoli under the name ""Suji wa dokushin ni kagiru,"" which means ""The numbers must be single,"" a Nikoli spokesperson told CNBC in an email.
Readers abbreviated the puzzle's name, calling it Sudoku.
At first, the publisher employed both the long name and the shorter Sudoku title in Puzzle Communication Nikoli. In 1992 Nikoli started using only the Sudoku name, the spokesperson said.
U.S. and European newspapers began publishing Sudoku puzzles in the mid-2000s. Sudoku joined The New York Times' NYT Games app, which boasts 10 million daily users, in 2023. More than 100 media companies have licensed Nikoli's Sudoku puzzles, the spokesperson said.
""The daily puzzles will only be available on LinkedIn each day, but we are looking forward to republishing selected puzzles from those in our magazine,"" the spokesperson wrote.

Last month, new provisions in the Online Safety Act requiring large online platforms to implement age checks to prevent children from accessing pornographic and appropriate material came into force.
The measures have led Pornhub, Redtube and other porn sites to force U.K. visitors to sign up and verify their age to gain access to their services.
What is the Online Safety Act?
Broadly, the Online Safety Act is a law that imposes a duty of care on social media firms and other user-generated content sites to ensure they take responsibility for harmful content uploaded and spread on their platforms.
In particular, the legislation aims to prevent children from being exposed to pornographic content and material that promotes suicide, self-harm, eating disorders or abusive and hateful behaviour.
The regulation has been years in the making and faced numerous delays in its development — not least due to concerns that it may infringe internet users' right to privacy and result in censorship.
Why has it led to backlash?
The latest measures have been imposed with the aim of ensuring children aren't able to view harmful and inappropriate content.
However, they have led to complaints from internet users due to the requirement of having to share personal information such as their ID, credit card details and selfies — in some cases for platforms that don't even qualify as porn sites.
Spotify, Reddit, X and a number of other platforms have introduced their own respective age verification systems to stop users under the age of 18 from consuming explicit content.
These moves have subsequently led to providers of virtual private networks (VPNs) to report that their services, which allow users to mask their location, are surging in the U.K.
Meanwhile, on Monday, Wikipedia was dealt a legal blow in the U.K. as a High Court judge ruled the platform should be treated as a ""category one"" service, which would subject to certain user verification requirements.
The Online Safety Act requires category one platforms to offer users the ability to verify their identity and access tools that reduce their exposure to content from non-verified users.
Wikimedia, the parent company of Wikipedia, has said previously that it could limit visitor numbers from the U.K. in order to exempt it from category one status.
U.S. politicians weigh in
A number of U.S. politicians have blasted the new rules in recent days. Last week, Vice President JD Vance — who has previously criticized the U.K.'s internet safety rules — again raised concerns with the law, fearing it could unfairly restrict American tech companies.
""I just don't want other countries to follow us down what I think was a very dark path under the Biden administration,"" Vance told reporters during a trip to the country last week.
House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who also visited the U.K. recently, said in a statement after his return that sweeping online safety laws in Europe are having ""a serious chilling effect on free expression and threaten the First Amendment rights of American citizens and companies.""
There has been speculation over whether the U.S. may press Britain to relax the regulations during trade talks — however, U.K. officials say the issue is not open to debate.
""It is unlikely that the Online Safety Act will be vulnerable in the short term,"" Matthew Holman, partner at law firm Cripps, told CNBC. ""This is in part because its introduction shares much multi-party support and is closely allied to the EU Digital Services Act which does broadly similar things.""
Could other countries follow suit?
Other countries are already adopting their own respective internet age verification laws.
Australia and Ireland have both passed similar age verification measures, while Denmark, Greece, Spain, France and Italy have started testing a common age verification app to protect users online.
In the U.S., Louisiana passed a law in 2022 requiring age verification on websites where at least a third of the content is of an adult nature, while several other states are seeking to pass similar legislation.",d530cd7a796dc4e357b5d28ae47324da,trafilatura,4317,0

European officials and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have expressed concerns at being sidelined from the Putin-Trump meeting in Alaska on Friday. The Ukrainian leader warned that Russia is planning further offensives and cannot be trusted, while European leaders have been scrambling to secure Ukraine a seat at the table.
""In order to have any deal implemented, you need Europe and you need Ukraine. So it is clear that Putin is just pretending to negotiate,"" Kallas said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""
""Putin doesn't want Zelenskyy around that table, because that would reveal that he actually doesn't want to negotiate, and he just wants to have a picture with President Trump and also postpone sanctions,"" she said.
Responding to Kallas' comments, Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov told CNBC that the EU foreign policy chief ""often makes inappropriate statements. And this is one of them.""
""President Putin remains open to dialogue and conflict resolution through political and diplomatic means,"" he added.
European officials and Zelenskyy have been sidelined from the Putin-Trump meeting in Alaska on Friday, which has caused much irritation. Zelenskyy has warned that Russia is planning further offensives and cannot be trusted, while European leaders have been scrambling to try and influence Trump and get Ukraine a seat at the table.
European leaders, including Zelenskyy, are set to meet for a virtual summit later on Tuesday, which will reportedly focus on ways to pressure Russia, the fate of Ukrainian territories seized by Russia and possible security guarantees for Kyiv. Trump has also been invited.
U.S. has threatened, but not yet implemented sanctions on Russia. European officials have long been trying to pressure Washington D.C. to implement measures, which could put pressure on Putin.
Ahead of the talks between Trump and Putin, concerns have also grown that the U.S. president may pursue a solution that would be unfavourable for Ukraine.
Trump suggested on Monday that there could ""some swapping"" of territory as part of a peace deal though he insisted the U.S. ""would try to get some of that territory back for Ukraine.""
The EU's Kallas on Tuesday said no deal could be implemented behind Ukraine's back. When asked about how the EU could react should Trump agree to cede some Ukrainian territory to Russia, she said: ""How would that work in practice, like really, if Ukraine doesn't agree to this, then how would it really work?""
Putin clearly just wants concessions, she said, adding that before any talks about ceding territory, a ceasefire should be discussed.
""Just to recall that Ukraine agreed to unconditional ceasefire already five months ago, and since then, Putin and Kremlin, Russia has just been playing games,"" Kallas said.
""Russia could stop this war today. Just stop bombing the civilians and civilian infrastructure, and the war would be over,"" she added.
The EU diplomat also addressed tensions within the bloc regarding its approach to the war.
Hungary, which has previously created hurdles for the approval of EU sanctions against Russia, this week chose not to endorse a statement by the bloc that said Ukraine must be free to decide its own future.
""We definitely also need to discuss our working methods, because this is a crucial time for Europe, it is a crucial time for our security, and we need to be able to adopt decisions. We have been able to adopt decisions so far, but it's of course, increasingly more difficult,"" Kallas said.

The S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite jumped to record highs Tuesday following July's consumer price index report, which showed that headline inflation accelerated less than expected. ""I don't think the numbers are as reliable as they used to be,"" said Jim Cramer, referring to recent changes in the way that data for the CPI report is compiled, such as the increased reliance on less precise methods. We first covered some of those back in June after a report on staffing shortages at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nevertheless, the market was now pricing in roughly 94% odds of a quarter-point rate cut at the Federal Reserve's September policy, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. A day ago, the odds were at 86%. 2. Nvidia is in the headlines once again. After President Donald Trump on Monday hinted at another possible deal to let Nvidia sell a downgraded version of its Blackwell chips to China, on Tuesday we saw more stories about Beijing telling companies in the country to avoid using Nvidia's H20 chips due to national security concerns. Jim noted that Nvidia has pushed back against claims that its chips have ""backdoors"" that could allow remote access to control them. The update out of Beijing comes just a day after it was announced that, in exchange for U.S. export licenses, both Nvidia and rival Advanced Micro Devices would give the U.S. government a 15% cut of chip sales to China. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ""has been an amazing diplomat so maybe he could kind of cool tensions on both sides,"" said Jeff Marks, director of portfolio analysis for the Club. 3. Club name Palo Alto Networks was upgraded to a buy-equivalent rating at Piper Sandler. Analysts based their view on early success in the cybersecurity provider's ""platformization"" strategy that will help drive healthy topline growth in the future. Free cash flow headwinds for the company are also subsiding, according to the analysts, who raised their price target to $225 a share from $200. They also argued the CyberArk acquisition is a high-quality asset that will help fill a large gap in Palo Alto's portfolio. While the stock has been punished since its interest in CyberArk was first reported, we recommended buying the weakness on multiple occasions and finally were able to do so Monday. Jim said it's wrong to suggest that Palo Alto was buying CyberArk because its existing business was falling apart. 4.

An executive order from President Donald Trump last week might introduce some new dishes to the menu.
Trump’s move will open up alternative assets like private equity and cryptocurrency to retirement funds, a potential feast for the industries involved. But there’s no guarantee retirement fund administrators will rush to add those alternative assets to what they’re serving.

Freshmen Asset Class
Trump’s order instructs the Labor Department and other regulators to redefine what is considered a qualified asset in 401(k) retirement rules, allowing plans to invest in higher-risk alternative assets like PE, cryptocurrencies and real estate. Current federal rules deter most defined-contribution plans from investing in alternative assets, which is why they tend to prefer stocks and bonds. Any formal changes are probably still months away and, before assuming they usher in a sea change in investment strategy, it’s essential to look at one key piece of legislation.
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the law that governs pension plans, isn’t going anywhere. This is especially important because the law requires 401(k) plan administrators to act solely in the best interests of beneficiaries, which often translates to a sound investment strategy. The plans will no doubt think twice before rushing into private equity and crypto investments:
-
As a relatively new asset class, cryptocurrency has exhibited significant volatility. For example, while Bitcoin has risen over time, it has experienced over eight corrections of more than 50% in its 17-year existence. Other digital assets have proven even more volatile.
-
Private equity firms, meanwhile, typically charge relatively high management and performance fees and place restrictions on redemptions, which can eat into net returns. Longer investment horizons, which make private equity funds less liquid, may also conflict with some 401(k) administrators’ strategies. Finally, the sector has underperformed public markets for three of the past four years, reversing the common wisdom of the previous decade that they offered higher returns.
A Helping Hand: Crypto firms have been inundated with cash and interest from traditional Wall Street players this year. Access to 401(k)s, in whatever amount materializes, would be something of a cherry on top of the sundae at crypto’s coming-out party. The private equity sector, on the other hand, could really use the help. Private equity backers, which traditionally include pensions, university endowments, family offices, private foundations and sovereign wealth funds, have increasingly lowered or declined new commitments, with growing numbers opting to cash out from certain investments. Professionally managed 401(k) funds, which roughly 90 million Americans use, would open up a $9 trillion market to the sector, which could use financing beyond its traditional LPs, who have signaled they’re tapped out.

Circulation of USDC, the stablecoin Circle issues and manages, grew 90% from the previous year to $61.3 billion. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose values are pegged to that of another asset, usually the U.S. dollar.
Circle said it swung to a net loss of $482.1 million, or $4.48 a share, from earnings of $32.9 million, or breakeven per share, a year ago. The net loss included non-cash IPO-related charges of $424 million for stock-based compensation and $167 million to adjust the fair value of its convertible debt.
The company issued guidance projecting between $75 million and $85 million in other revenue for the rest of 2025, as well as adjusted operating expenses of $475 million to $490 million. It anticipates the amount of USDC in circulation will grow at a 40% compound annual growth rate through the cycle.
Circle also announced the forthcoming launch of a new proprietary blockchain called Arc, designed to be a network for stablecoin payments, FX, and capital markets applications. It will be integrated across Circle's platform and services and will begin testing among developers in the fall.
Circle, led by CEO Jeremy Allaire, is one of the earliest companies in the crypto industry and the issuer of USD Coin, commonly referred to by its ticker, USDC. It's the second largest stablecoin in the world, making up about 26% of the dollar-backed stablecoin market, behind Tether's USDT, which makes up about 67%, according to CryptoQuant.
Traditionally used as bridge currencies for crypto traders, stablecoins today are benefiting from increased interest by banks and payment firms as the Trump administration rolls back restrictive Biden-era crypto policies in favor of more supportive crypto legislation, like the stablecoin bill known as the GENIUS Act, which Trump signed into the first U.S. crypto law last month.
""Since our IPO and since the GENIUS Act passed, the number of major financial institutions that are engaging with us in banking, payments, capital markets [and] so many categories has surged,"" Allaire said. ""We're seeing this incredible interest in working with us, including from some of the names that people have thrown out there as maybe doing their own thing"" by perhaps launching their own stablecoins.",32efc485ac184dce8d943fc0bba2e282,trafilatura,3216,0

Most retirees must take required minimum distributions, or RMDs, from pretax retirement accounts starting at age 73 or face an IRS penalty. The first deadline is April 1 of the year after turning 73, and Dec. 31 is the due date for future years.
But some retirees have ""a lot of guaranteed income"" before RMDs, or spend less than they have coming in, according to Judy Brown, a certified financial planner who works at SC&H Group in the Washington, D.C., and Baltimore area.
In 2024, Social Security was the most common source of retirement income. But 81% of retirees had one or more types of private income, such as pensions, investments, rental income or employment, according to a Federal Reserve report published in May.
When retirees have more than they need, there could be decisions about how to spend or reinvest their RMDs, experts say.
""It can definitely impact a lot of people,"" and the right choice depends on your financial needs and goals, said Brown, who is also a certified public accountant.
Here are some options to consider.
Reinvest with exchange-traded funds
If you still want long-term growth, you can reinvest RMD proceeds into a brokerage account. But you need to choose assets carefully because the account incurs yearly taxes, experts say.
Typically, experts suggest exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, over mutual funds in a brokerage account because the assets are less likely to distribute capital gains or dividends throughout the year.
""It's also easier for tax-loss harvesting,"" which involves selling a losing brokerage account asset to offset other portfolio gains, Brown said.
Since ETFs trade throughout the day like a stock, you have more control when selling specific assets, she said.
'Skip the tax bill' with a transfer to charity
For charitable investors, you could also consider a so-called qualified charitable distribution, or QCD, experts say.
Open to retirees age 70½ or older, QCDs are a direct transfer from an individual retirement account to an eligible nonprofit organization. For 2025, the limit is $108,000 per investor.
Once you're 73 or older, you can use QCDs to satisfy yearly RMDs and the transfer won't increase your adjusted gross income.
""It's the IRS' best-kept secret for retirees,"" said CFP Ashton Lawrence at Mariner Wealth Advisors in Greenville, South Carolina. ""Skip the tax bill and help a cause you believe in.""
Legacy planning with a 529 contribution
If legacy planning is important, you can also consider using RMDs to contribute to a 529 college savings plan for your family, experts say.
As of May 2025, more than 30 states offer a state tax credit or deduction for 529 contributions, according to education website Saving for College. In most cases, this requires a deposit to your state's plan. There is not currently a federal income tax break for contributions.
""It's not going to be enough to offset all of their state [income] taxes,"" said Brown. But you can ""get a benefit going for the grandchildren"" while securing a state tax break for yourself, she said.",027b42f268799391ea883fa105d24e2c,trafilatura,3216,0

In November 2024, Singapore's gambling agency announced it was renewing the integrated resort's casino license for two years, instead of three, citing ""unsatisfactory"" tourism performance from 2021 to 2023.
The announcement came after Resorts World Sentosa had pledged to invest $6.8 billion Singapore dollars ($5.3 billion) to renew and expand the integrated resort.
The truncated license renewal has not changed Resorts World Sentosa's expansion or investment plans, Lee said.
The company opened two new attractions in 2025, Minion Land at the Universal Studios Singapore theme park, and the Singapore Oceanarium, which replaced the integrated resort's older S.E.A. Aquarium.
""This year is really a game-changing year for us,"" she said. ""Over the next few years... to 2030, we will be continuing to launch new attractions.""
In announcing the two-year license renewal, the Gambling Regulatory Authority considered Resorts World Sentosa's ability to ""develop, maintain and promote"" itself as a compelling tourist destination.
When asked which of these areas the resort is focused on, Lee said: ""The big push for us is really transforming Resorts World Sentosa into a premium lifestyle destination.""
Tapping into 'experiences'
Shopping, once a top priority for travelers in Asia, is not a priority in the resort's transformation, said Lee.
""Our focus is really into experiences,"" Lee said.
The decision to replace a ""Madagascar"" movie-themed area of Universal Studios Singapore with Minion Land was, in part, related to the universal appeal of the characters in the ""Despicable Me"" franchise, she added.
""Minions stood out because ... this yellow character is very resonant to all ages of visitors, and all around the world because of the language that they use. It resonates from Asia to Europe to America and everywhere else. So to us, there's a common language,"" she said.
Minions speak their own language, called Minionese, which incorporates elements of English, Spanish, Italian, Chinese and Tagalog, among others, according to the ""Despicable Me"" fandom website.
Resorts World Sentosa is also planning to open new hotels, including The Laurus, a luxury hotel designed like a ""collector's home"" in Singapore, that is set to open later in 2025, Lee said.
In coming years, the integrated resort is planning to launch Super Nintendo World inside Universal Studios Singapore, as well as an elevated waterfront lifestyle complex with 700 rooms, hiking trails and a 289-foot light sculpture, she said.
""The waterfront lifestyle complex is really going to enhance the appeal of the Greater Southern Waterfront,"" she said. The complex is a ""brownfield project,"" which will be visible from mainland Singapore.
Lee declined to comment on whether the planned lifestyle complex will have gaming facilities.

No one cares — show us to the poultry, please.
Last week delivered a bevvy of earnings reports from fast-food giants — including McDonald’s, Wendy’s, Yum! Brands, and Restaurant Brands International — with the results showing the industry’s biggest trend continues apace: Customers can’t get enough chicken, especially when offered at a discount.

Winner, Winner, Value Chicken Dinner
First things first: Amid a prolonged period of economic uncertainty, the value menu remains invaluable. But even a price war among the world’s biggest restaurant chains isn’t enough to keep low-income consumers coming through drive-throughs. Instead, they continue to flee fast food in favor of value grocery stores, R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai, told The Daily Upside. In what may be a macroeconomic bellwether, Hottovy also said low-income consumers are increasingly shifting down even from value grocery chains like Aldi to cheaper convenience stores and dollar stores.
Still, value remains a big driver. So much so that in its second-quarter earnings call on Friday, Wendy’s said a major driver of a sales decline (that still beat analysts’ expectations) was having too many promotions, which interim CEO Ken Cook said “sent too many different messages” to customers. “We learned that when we have too many priorities, we have none,” Cook added, before saying that Wendy’s will have one top priority through the rest of the year: chicken. (McDonald’s seemed to crack the code this past quarter, citing the return of its McCrispy Chicken Strips driving sales growth.)
For more evidence of chicken fever, look no further than Yum’s portfolio:
-
True, not even chicken could save the colonel: Same-store sales at US Kentucky Fried Chicken locations slid 5%, as the chain continues to suffer amid increased competition from the likes of Raising Cane’s and Wingstop.
-
But Taco Bell saw US same-store sales growth of 4%, with Yum citing a new line of Crispy Chicken menu items and the reintroduction of chicken nuggets. In fact, Yum CEO David Gibbs said Taco Bell’s chicken sales are up 50% in the past two years.
“Most people are reporting negative quarters. We haven’t even had a negative week for Taco Bell,” Gibbs said.
Extra Guac, Please: Pricier chains are facing the same pressures — and struggling. Shares of Sweetgreen plunged more than 25% on Friday after the chain lowered its profit guidance for the second consecutive quarter. Meanwhile, Chipotle experienced its second straight quarter of same-store sales declines, with CEO Scott Boatwright saying the chain needs to figure out how to “communicate value and showcase value.” Did you catch that, Chipotle employees? To our ears, it sounds like your CEO is practically begging you to give us a scoop of guacamole on the house.

The heaviest of U.S. President Donald Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs — a full 145% on imports of Chinese goods — was, once again, delayed for another 90 days.
The move should be a huge relief not just to investors, but perhaps most of the population on Earth. The U.S. and China are the two largest economies in the world, according to World Bank data, and a trade war in which imports of each other's goods double in price would probably stymie, if not cripple, the global economy.
But markets were mostly unmoved. Well, they did move — lower. The three big U.S. stock indexes retreated Monday as this outcome was more or less expected, since both sides had earlier telegraphed an extension of the tariff pause.
Investors could have also been conditioned to expect flip-flopping from Trump, such that threats, promises, criticisms and praises don't carry as much heft as they should anymore. On Monday, Trump said Intel's CEO Lip-Bu Tan's ""success and rise is an amazing story,"" after describing Tan as ""highly CONFLICTED"" the week before.
There's a Freudian idea in which an individual projects their thoughts and feelings to another person. Researchers are, well, conflicted, on the veracity of the phenomenon, but empirical observation suggests it's not uncommon.
What you need to know today
Trump extends pause on China tariffs. U.S. tariffs on China were delayed for 90 days, Trump said on Truth Social. It was the expected outcome from the latest round of talks between the two countries.
Elon Musk threatens legal action against Apple. Musk alleged that Apple is engaging in antitrust violations by making it ""impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store."" Musk is the founder of xAI, which is behind the Grok AI chatbot.
Intel CEO is a ""success,"" Trump says. The U.S. president's praise of Lip-Bu Tan is a reversal in tone from his previous week's message, in which Trump said Tan ""must resign, immediately.""
U.S. stocks end Monday lower. Major stock indexes fell as traders awaited inflation data. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 touched record highs Tuesday, with the latter boosted by the Reserve Bank of Australia's rate cut.
[PRO] Europe's defense sector could receive another leg up. According to Ben Heelan, Bank of America's head of EU industrials research, one corner of the investing world, previously reluctant to turn to defense stocks, might be changing its mind.

Spain treads a risky path by standing up to Trump on defense and China
The Spanish government recently renounced U.S. aircraft purchases and resisted intense pressure to commit to NATO's new 5% defense spending target, while seeking closer economic ties with China.
Taken together, analysts say Spain has become a rare example of a European country willing to draw the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump. Notably, despite Trump threatening a tough trade deal for Spain, the European country has not faced any material consequences.

Second quarter earnings season is coming to a close, and with nearly all of the reports in, the results have been mostly positive.
As of Aug. 29, 98% of S&P 500 index companies have reported results, according to FactSet data, and analysts now expect S&P 500 companies to report an 11.9% jump in earnings per share during the second quarter.
Companies had lower expectations to clear coming into the quarter — analysts expected S&P 500 earnings to rise 5% in Q2, the slowest pace of earnings growth since Q4 2023 — amid President Trump's tariffs, stocks' lofty valuations, and uncertainty about the health of the US economy.
This week, reports are rolling in from Zscaler (ZS), NIO (NIO), Salesforce (CRM), Figma (FIG), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE), Dollar Tree (DLTR), The Campbell's Company (CPB), Macy's (M), C3.ai (AI), American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), Broadcom (AVGO), Copart (CPRT), lululemon (LULU), DocuSign (DOCU), and ABM Industries (ABM).
Meanwhile, investors will continue to mull over recent reports, particularly Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings, which highlighted last week.
Other companies reported too, including PDD Holdings (PDD), Alibaba (BABA), Okta (OKTA), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Snowflake (SNOW), J.M.

Here are the latest updates from corporate America.
LIVE 325 updatesSalesforce stock falls in tepid reaction to earnings beat
Salesforce (CRM) stock fell as much as 5% after hours after the company reported results in line or slightly better than estimates that failed to wow investors looking for big AI gains.
For the quarter, Wall Street was looking for Salesforce's artificial intelligence efforts to show broader adoption — and monetization. Year to date, the stock has underperformed with a 23% loss.
Salesforce did beat Wall Street estimates and show steady growth: Revenue climbed 9.7% year over year to $10.24 billion, slightly above analyst expectations for $10.13 billion. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.91 were also above estimates for earnings of $2.78 per share.
For the 2026 fiscal year, Salesforce initiated revenue guidance of $10.24 billion to $10.29 billion and raised the low end of its full-year revenue guidance, which now stands in a range of $41.1 billion to $41.3 billion. Both of those outlooks represent single-digit growth, which lags in comparison to other large-cap tech and AI players.
“It’s not bad — no one is going to say these are bad numbers,” Jefferies senior analyst Brent Thill told Yahoo Finance in reaction to the results. “We’re just playing a relative game, where everyone else on a relative basis is way better.”
The cloud software provider also announced a $20 billion increase to its existing share buyback program, bringing the total to $50 billion.

1. Eye on inflation
Investors and economists will closely monitor July's consumer price index reading due Tuesday morning, and the stakes feel particularly high this time around. President Donald Trump shocked economics earlier this month when he fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, accusing her of manipulating jobs data. Trump said Monday that he will nominate E.J. Antoni — chief economist at the Heritage Foundation and a critic of the BLS — to the role. After the shakeup, as CNBC's Jeff Cox reports, economists are now questioning how much they can trust government data going forward. Follow live markets updates here.
2. Dropping bars
Trump set the record straight on Monday: Gold bars will not be tariffed. His announcement ended days of confusion around the metal's fate after Customs and Border Protection said gold bars wouldn't be excluded from Trump's broad and steep duties. The president on Monday also said he extended China's tariff deadline by another 90 days. Investors, however, didn't seem to give much weight to the policy updates as stocks closed lower on Monday.
3. Intel's Apple playbook
After Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan received a public scolding from Trump last week, the executive seems to be taking a page out of Apple's playbook. Trump said in a social media post on Thursday that Tan is ""HIGHLY conflicted"" and should immediately resign. But after Tan made a visit the White House on Monday, the president changed his tune, saying the executive had an ""amazing story."" Tan is the second high-profile technology CEO to stop by the White House in the past week: Apple CEO Tim Cook announced the iPhone maker's expanded domestic investment plan from the Oval Office last Wednesday. Tan's visit appeared to satisfy Intel investors, with shares of the company rising nearly 3% before the bell.
4. Performance review
C3 AI put out preliminary financial results on Monday — and, let's just say, the boss is not happy. CEO Thomas Siebel called the stats ""completely unacceptable,"" placing blame on the artificial intelligence company's reorganization efforts and his ongoing personal health challenges. Investors didn't take it well, either: Shares of the stock tumbled more than 25% in the session for their worst day in over two years.
5. Stirring the pot
Cannabis stocks have lost their buzz in recent years, but Monday was a strong day for investors in the sector. Shares of several companies and funds tracking the industry surged after Trump said he was considering reclassifying marijuana to a less-dangerous category. That's big news: Such a change would help ease tax regulations and open the flood-gates for research, to name just a few benefits. Tim Seymour, investing chief at Seymour Asset Management, told CNBC that a reclassification would be ""a game changer"" for the industry.

Investor appetite for it has returned from a post-Liberation Day lull, with thematic, high-volatility and leveraged funds seeing increased interest as investors adapt to uncertainty about the economic impact of varied US tariffs. One of the more popular risk-on ETFs is Cathie Wood’s ARK fund, which takes highly concentrated bets on individual stocks and saw a major drawdown in 2022 but has since rebounded, soaring 30% so far this year. As hedged strategies like buffer ETFs grow in popularity, risk-taking tactics will also continue to evolve. “Whatever was going on with the tariff situation, I think people have kind of accepted it,” said Dan Sotiroff, a senior research analyst at Morningstar. “The risk appetite right now is high.”

Risk-On, Risk-Off
Funds that tap specific segments of the market, like a large- or small-cap value index, are common among investing risk-takers. While those funds have exposure to high-volatility meme stocks, they’re also diversified enough to protect against the downsides of that volatility, Sotiroff said. Taking on specific sectors, such as tech (in funds like Invesco’s QQQ), materials and energy, can also be risky, with even more potential for losses associated with subsectors like semiconductors.
Charles Champagne, head of ETF strategy at AllianzIM, said he sees vehicles like inverse ETFs and leveraged ETFs as trading tools. Other higher-risk funds that may be worth a look offer concentrated exposure into particular markets, including:
-
Roundhill’s Daily 2X Long Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGX), which doubles the daily exposure of the Magnificent Seven, comprising Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla.
-
State Street’s Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE), which aims to represent the energy sector within the S&P 500.
-
Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), which invests primarily in AI-focused companies.
Still, overall investor risk tolerance may be lower than in decades past. “You see a lot more investors moving in towards these hedged vehicles,” Champagne said. “They still remember the bad years of 2022 and even the Great Financial Crisis. I think it’s still very top of mind.”
A Risk Too Far: To be sure, there’s a fine line between worthwhile bets and flying too close to the sun. The biggest mistake investors can make is chasing past performance, Sotiroff said. “You see a certain theme or sector ETF that does really well over the trailing year [and] the money piles in, but by that point, all the expectations are already baked in,” he said. “I suspect there’s some of that going on now.”

Diamond Hill Small-Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Insperity, Inc. (NYSE:NSP) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
""Among our bottom individual Q2 contributors to return were Insperity, Inc. (NYSE:NSP) and Civitas Resources. Insperity provides human resources (HR) and business solutions primarily to US-based small and mid-sized businesses. Shares were pressured in the quarter as higher-than-expected health care costs impacted the company’s insurance book, and the company’s worksite employee count grew at a tepid rate. Our confidence in the company’s execution across multiple fronts — including its Workday partnership, ability to grow worksite employees, manage its health insurance book of business and improve margins — has increasingly weakened. Further, the potential for AI disruption is a longer term risk to Insperity’s worksite employee base. With these factors pressuring the share price and limited visibility into a meaningful turnaround over the course of our investment horizon, we exited our position during the quarter, redeploying the proceeds to more attractive risk-reward opportunities.""

-
Seth Klarman says AI is used at his firm as a time-saving tool, not for stock picking.
-
AI has helped analyze corporate filings, for example, he said.
-
Firms like Morgan Stanley and Bank of America have also started to incorporate AI to boost productivity.
Artificial intelligence may one day upend whole industries, but among the hedge fund elite, it's not yet a threat, investing legend and Baupost Group CEO Seth Klarman said.
In an episode of Columbia Business School's Value Investing with Legends podcast this month, the hedge fund titan said he and his colleagues mostly use the nascent technology as a time-saver, assigning it tasks that lower-level staffers may have done in the past.
""We have ourselves started using it as essentially a capable assistant, a summer intern,"" Klarman said. ""Not somebody who knows which stocks to buy, but a way to tabulate data quicker.""
Klarman cited a couple of specific examples of how his colleagues have used it.
One way was to analyze corporate filings.
""He asked AI to take a look at 10 years of annual reports for a company and compare what changed in the annual report from year to year — the way they communicate, which may reveal something about the change in the business, or what the lawyer was worried about, or whatever it might be,"" Klarman said.
Another was to identify company logos that one of his employees had never seen that would help them know an industry landscape better.
""He would have run that to an intern, but AI did it in like five minutes and saved three days' worth of work,"" Klarman said.
Klarman also said he's been using AI himself, though he hasn't been particularly impressed. Before he was set to speak at an event with a well-known business executive, he asked a chatbot to generate some questions to ask the person.
""What came back was useless,"" he said. ""I like to ask things that they haven't thought about before.""
Baupost isn't the only firm using AI to increase efficiency. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America have started to train staff to use the technology to boost productivity. Consulting firm ThoughtLinks found in a recent study that by 2030, 44% of a bank's tasks, including 32% of sales and trading work, could be ""redefined"" by AI.
Despite using the technology, Klarman said he's concerned that AI could hurt people's ability to be creative. A recent MIT study backed this up, finding that using AI reduced memory and brain activity.
""I think that if we use AI the wrong way, we'll solve the problem without having applied our brains,"" Klarman said. ""It would be like reading the end of a novel and then not needing to really know as well how did the whole thing come about? So I like doing it in order. I think the right order is, 'Here's what I think,' and then I can improve my thinking.""

New-home prices dropped in 30% of large U.S. cities last quarter
-
Housing costs have surged more than 50% since the pandemic, but the traditional price gap where new-construction homes cost significantly more than existing homes has narrowed. There are notable price drops and incentives, especially in the South and West, making new homes more affordable. Furthermore, new homes often provide better value per square foot, and builders tend to offer incentives.
No matter the type of home you buy, housing has become more expensive over the years. Just since the pandemic, home prices are up by more than 50%, and mortgage rates continue to hover near 7%.
While new-construction homes have historically been more costly than buying an existing house, that trend is changing in some markets. Last quarter, year-over-year median listing prices for new builds dropped in 30 of the largest U.S. metros, according to an Aug. 7 Realtor.com report.
Historically, the price premium of new-construction homes has largely been driven by costly modern amenities and customization, rising materials and labor expenses, and strong demand for more housing. The median listing price for a new home in the second quarter of 2025 was about $450,000, while the median existing-home price was roughly $418,000, according to Realtor.com.
But price drops have been prominent in the South and West as builders try offering more affordable options through incentives. Meanwhile, increased competition on existing homes and weaker buyer demand has driven down new-construction prices, according to Realtor.com.
“In a market still grappling with a shortage of nearly 4 million homes, affordable new construction plays a critical role in restoring balance,” Realtor.com chief economist Danielle Hale said in a statement. “Even with recent slowdowns in starts and permits, builders continue to deliver new homes to the market at a healthy pace.”
Although the overall home price for a new build is higher than an existing home, buyers can get a better price per square foot, Realtor.com data shows. Nationally, new builds typically list for about $218 per square foot, compared with $226.56 for existing homes, according to Realtor.com.
The top five markets where new-construction home prices dropped year over year last quarter, according to Realtor.com:
-
Little Rock, Ark. (-15.6%)
-
Austin, Texas (-8.5%)
-
Wichita, Kans. (-7.9%)
-
Jacksonville, Fla. (-7.8%)
-
Cape Coral, Fla. (-7.4%)
Shrinkflation is also a factor at play making new homes more affordable in some markets. Builders are making homes smaller, and therefore more affordable, for new buyers. A July 2024 report from John Burns Research & Consulting showed about a quarter of new homes were downsized to cut costs. To make smaller homes more enticing and practical, builders have cut the number of hallways and increased flex space in the home.",2af24f0be12ddcf51b08bdf191edbe4e,trafilatura,2945,0

Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer confirmed to CNN the details of the offer, which The Wall Street Journal first reported.
The bid comes as Google awaits a court’s decision after a landmark ruling last year found that the internet giant had violated US antitrust law with its search business. The US Justice Department has proposed as a remedy that Google sell its Chrome browser.
Google has promised to appeal the ruling and called the idea of spinning off Chrome an “unprecedented proposal” that it says would harm consumers and security. Google declined to provide a comment to CNN regarding Perplexity’s bid.
Perplexity’s offer — while likely a long shot, given Google’s resistance to a forced sale of Chrome — marks the latest example of how new firms are taking on tech’s biggest players to reshape the internet in the AI era.
Perplexity is a nearly three-year-old startup whose search tool uses AI models to parse web content and curate answers. Answers are usually posted as a summary, although Perplexity does provide links to its sources. It launched an AI search engine that competes with Google’s dominant offering in December 2022.
Perplexity launched its own AI-powered web browser called Comet in July. The company is pitching it as a more personalized browser that connects the dots between a user’s calendars, browsing tabs, social channels and more. OpenAI is also said to be developing a web browser, according to Reuters, in yet another signal that AI companies are looking to play a bigger role in how people use the web.
Perplexity said it would maintain users’ current browsing preferences, including Google as the default search engine, if it were to buy Chrome, Dwyer told CNN.
It would also commit to “continued available and support” for Chrome for 100 months and investing $3 billion in Chromium over the next 24 months, according to Dwyer. Chromium is Google’s open-source underlying technology that other tech companies – including Microsoft and Perplexity – can use to build their own browsers.
Perplexity made the offer because it “believes in the open web,” Dwyer said.
Perplexity was most recently valued at $18 billion following a $100 million funding round, Bloomberg said in a report last month, citing a person familiar with the matter. The company did not comment on the report.
That makes Perplexity’s offer for Chrome worth nearly double its own valuation. Google, meanwhile, is worth nearly $2.5 trillion; shares of the company (GOOGL) rose around 1% on Tuesday. The Wall Street Journal reported that several investors have agreed to back the purchase, including large venture capital firms.",9a81f6bf25fb2c31b1b9bba970c14d2e,trafilatura,2873,0

The stock has surged 53% year-to-date, far outpacing the S&P 500 Index ($SPX), which is up 9% over the same stretch. The rally has been driven by strong business momentum, reflected through steady growth in trips and gross bookings with robust demand for both its ride-hailing and delivery services. Moreover, its unique positioning in the fast-evolving autonomous vehicle industry further pushed its share price higher.
Yet after months of momentum, Uber’s stock seems to have paused for breath. Over the past month, shares have slipped more than 3%, even as the company’s second-quarter results on Aug. 6 beat Wall Street’s expectations.

The lack of an immediate post-earnings bounce raises questions about whether Uber’s rally is running out of fuel or if it’s simply the calm before another big move. Let’s take a closer look.
Uber’s Core Growth Drivers Still Intact
Uber stock may have taken a breather after a strong run, but the company’s core growth drivers remain solid. Moreover, the company’s latest quarterly numbers show that Uber’s business is firing on multiple cylinders.
In the second quarter, both trips and gross bookings surged 18% year-over-year, reflecting resilient demand across Uber’s diversified platform. The company’s monthly active platform consumers (MAPCs) climbed to a record 180 million, up 15% from a year earlier. Notably, engagement on its platform has increased, and on the supply side, Uber reported 8.8 million active drivers and couriers worldwide, marking a 20% annual increase.
Uber’s ability to use its mobility and delivery platforms as a gateway to attract new customers, convert them into cross-platform users, and deepen engagement over time is paying off well. Notably, customers who use both services have retention rates more than 35% higher than single-service users and generate over three times the gross bookings. Yet, the opportunity is far from fully realized, with fewer than one in five eligible customers active on both platforms, leaving a vast runway for growth.
The company’s subscription program, Uber One, has also become a powerful driver of engagement. Membership hit over 36 million in June, up roughly 60% year-over-year, and now accounts for more than 40% of combined mobility and delivery gross bookings. Retention rates remain strong, with new members sticking around at levels similar to long-term subscribers. Uber also continued to expand Uber One’s reach, launching in Argentina and rolling out mobility benefits in seven additional countries during the quarter.",a096061ed795cfc7d535b0d5b5a79ab7,trafilatura,2872,0

A New Stage for the Theater That Gave America Shakespeare in the Park
The investment bank, with headquarters in Manhattan’s Trump Tower, reported total revenue of $34 million, up from $6.17 million a year earlier. Shares were up 1.7% to $5.42 at 10:11 a.m. in New York, after climbing as much as 5.4% earlier Tuesday.
Since enlisting President Donald Trump’s eldest sons, Dominari appeared in a series of deals involving the Trumps and their allies. One of the highest profile of these is American Bitcoin Corp., a company spun up with help from another publicly traded Bitcoin miner called Hut 8 Corp. At the end of June, Dominari held a stake in American Bitcoin valued at $32 million, the largest of its long term private holdings, according to its quarterly financial statement. Soon American Bitcoin will become public, in another transaction expected to close in the coming weeks.
Another major deal came in June: crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun’s father invested $100 million in SRM Entertainment Inc., with Dominari acting as placement agent. SRM, a money-losing toymaker, re-branded as Tron Inc. and pivoted to accumulating TRX, the virtual token that backs Sun’s Tron network.
Weeks earlier, a fund led by Dominari executive Soo Yu invested in the company, which spiked in value following the deal with Sun.
Other recent deals included equity offerings for Hong Kong brokerage Waton Financial Ltd., Taiwanese hotpot restaurant Masterbeef Group and Cambodian bagmaker Kandal M Venture Ltd., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
In March, Dominari partnered with the Trumps and cryptocurrency operation Hut 8 Corp. to create American Bitcoin, a crypto miner expected to go public as early as the third quarter. Dominari booked a gain of $32 million on its position in the company after it raised $220 million in June. It also acted as placement agent on the deal.
The stake in American Bitcoin represents almost 75% of its long-term equity holdings.
Compensation at Dominari, which has a market capitalization of about $84 million, also soared. Stock options that went to Chief Executive Officer Anthony Hayes and Kyle Wool, who heads its financial arm, cost $26.1 million. An additional $15 million was reserved for commissions. General and administrative expenses totaled $53.5 million in the quarter, a sixfold increase from a year earlier.",a3a82095fc1b761d0ff47d74fd1f267f,trafilatura,2847,0

What is a Roth 401(k), and how does it differ from a traditional 401(k)?
One of the many challenging aspects of retirement planning is picking the smartest vehicles in which to save and grow your funds. Most people are familiar with traditional 401(k) accounts, typically offered through an employer.

However, many people are skipping over the Roth 401(k) — if they even realize it’s an option. So what’s the difference, and why might you choose one over the other?
To explore the distinctions, GOBankingRates spoke with Jamie Hopkins, CEO of Bryn Mawr Trust Advisors and chief wealth officer for WSFS Bank. He is also a financial services industry advocate, a Wall Street Journal best-selling author, and founder of the FinServ Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to helping college students reach their full potential through coaching, mentorship and community.
Breaking Down the Differences: Traditional 401(k) vs. Roth 401(k)
Hopkins said it’s a little “misleading” to think of Roth and traditional 401(k) plans as entirely separate savings vehicles. They’re fundamentally the same type of account — employer-sponsored retirement plans — but they differ in how your contributions and withdrawals are taxed.
A traditional 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan that allows for salary-deferral contributions from employees and matching contributions from employers. That means you put money into this type of account before you pay taxes on it, which reduces your taxable income in the year you contribute. You then pay taxes on the money when you withdraw it in retirement.
A Roth 401(k), in contrast, is funded with after-tax dollars. Hopkins explained, “This means taxes are paid before the money is contributed to your retirement account.”
The major benefit of a Roth 401(k) is that the money grows tax-free, instead of tax-deferred. Withdrawals in retirement are also tax-free, as long as two conditions are met:
-
The account must be open for at least five years
-
The withdrawal must occur after a qualifying event, typically reaching age 59½
“While there are other slight differences, the core distinction between a Roth account and a tax-deferred traditional account is when you pay taxes,” Hopkins said.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Payments Dive newsletter.
Cross-border payments player Remitly is seeking more small and mid-sized business customers as the advance of stablecoins creates more international competition.
The company, which was founded in 2011, is attempting to draw SMBs and self-employed freelancers to its services by offering them a peer-to-peer tool that lets them pay vendors, contractors and employees internationally.
“We're evolving from a cross-border payments provider to a broad financial partner,” Remitly CEO Matt Oppenheimer said in an interview Thursday.
As of the end of the second quarter, Seattle-based Remitly had about 8.5 million quarterly active users, up from 6.9 million at the end of that quarter last year.
The company launched the service directed at SMBs during the second quarter and has attracted “thousands” of such customers since then who are sending transactions that are about twice the size of Remitly’s typical consumer customers, Oppenheimer told analysts on a quarterly earnings call Wednesday.
Those types of clients had tried to use the company’s basic services in the past, but it wasn’t tailored to them. Now they have a more tailored option, Oppenheimer explained.
The company is investing to draw and keep such SMB customers, Remitly Chief Financial Officer Vikas Mehta said on the call, referring to them as “high-amount senders.” He didn’t specify a dollar amount for that category, but said the number of customers sending more than $1,000 increased 45% for the quarter, compared to the year-ago period.
“Given that high-amount senders is a new category for us, we are also making deliberate strategic investments in competitive pricing to attract and retain this valuable cohort and to accelerate adoption,” Mehta told analysts on the call. “In 2H, we have launched a targeted marketing push tailored specifically to the needs and motivations of high amount vendors.”
The company’s marketing expense for the first half of the year increased about nine percent to $158.3 million, according to the second-quarter earnings report. That spending was equal to about a fifth of its $773.5 million in revenue through June. For just the second quarter, marketing expenses rose even more, climbing 10%.
The pitch to SMBs is one of the ways that Remitly is trying to tap new revenue streams. Other ways include the company packaging its digital wallet services and buy now, pay later financing into a new “membership” that will include a broader suite of financial services and offer cashback benefits, the executives said during the call. While the BNPL financing and wallet are available now, the company will have more details on the membership offering in September, Oppenheimer said.",e619e4888413c2baa4c28d743e0b29d9,trafilatura,2829,0

Three drivers are seen to fuel an even higher rally
The crypto market is now worth more than Microsoft or Apple.
A weekend rally carried over into Monday blasted the total market value past $4.1 trillion to a new all-time high.
While that figure spans thousands of digital assets rather than a single company, the milestone is still a clear example of just how far the sector has come.
Nearly every major token is in the green, but the spotlight is on Bitcoin and Ethereum.
Bitcoin jumped 4% over the weekend to $122,200 on Monday morning, UK time, leaving it less than 1% shy of eclipsing July’s all-time high of $123,200.
Ethereum climbed to $4,350, its highest price since the 2021 bull run that peaked at $4,850, putting it about 12% below its all-time high.
The rally comes as fresh policy shifts, renewed exchange-traded fund inflows, and growing bets on US rate cuts inject new momentum into the top cryptocurrencies.
Key drivers
Three big forces are driving major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum higher, analysts say.
First is Donald Trump’s executive order opening 401(k) retirement plans to crypto investments. With over $12 trillion in US retirement assets, even a modest allocation could translate into hundreds of billions in fresh buying.
“This may be one of the most pivotal moments in Bitcoin and crypto’s path to mainstream adoption,” Mena Theodorou, co-founder of Coinstash, said in comments shared with DL News.
Sustained pension fund inflows could “broaden adoption, help dampen volatility, and embed crypto more deeply into mainstream financial infrastructure,” Theodorou added.
Second is the return of ETF inflows. Bitcoin funds have seen eight weeks of net inflows in the past nine, adding roughly $10 billion over that period, nearly 20% of the $54 billion they’ve pulled in since launching in January 2024.
Ethereum funds are also moving fast, with $460 million flowing into spot Ether ETFs on Friday alone, the fourth-biggest day on record.
ETF Store president Nate Geraci noted on X that “eight of the top 10 Ether inflow days, including all of the top five, have happened in just the past month.”
Finally, a softer macro backdrop is fuelling rate-cut bets in the US.
“Weaker-than-expected economic data from the US has spurred investors’ beliefs that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting,” Simon Peters, crypto analyst at eToro, said in comments shared with DL News.
He added that this could “cause further tailwinds to cryptoasset prices and take the total market capitalisation higher.”
Futures markets now see an 88% chance of a Federal Reserve cut in September, a shift reminiscent of late 2024’s “rate cut rush” that doubled Bitcoin’s price in just four months.",f74ac842dfe69e913b28540a2beaaa73,trafilatura,2805,0

AthleteAgent.com launched on Tuesday as a rebrand of the former Online Sports Database. The site was created to improve access to athletes, offering a more streamlined way for organizations to connect with them.
The rebrand isn't just about a new name. AthleteAgent.com is also rolling out a subscription-based model, offering users full access to its growing database for $29.99 per month, or $199.99 per year.
Rodgers, currently quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers, is an original founder in the platform. He's joined by a high-profile group of investors that includes legendary sports agent Scott Boras and the Google for Startups Cloud Program: Scale AI Tier, as well as private equity firms Solyco Capital, Prota Ventures, Bullock Capital and Pressplay Capital.
AthleteAgent.com declined to comment on the exact size of Rodgers' investment in the company, but said it was in the seven figures.
CEO Sean O'Brien said AthleteAgent.com is on pace for six-figure revenue and positive cash flow this year.
The concept was first co-founded in 2021 by actor and producer Ryan Rottman, who said he noticed a glaring gap in how athletes are listed compared with how actors are made available on IMDb.
""I had a producer from a Hallmark Christmas film look at my IMDb Pro profile — they saw me on ""90210"" — to see who my agent was and reached out. Since then, I've been in eight Hallmark Christmas films. Had that info not been right, they could have moved on to the next person, and I would have missed out,"" Rottman told CNBC.
He pitched the idea to Rodgers, who immediately got on board.
""Aaron likes to say we're building this not for the 1% of athletes, but for the other 99% — to help generate revenue, get their stories out there, find endorsement deals, support their charities. That's how it came to fruition,"" Rottman said.
Today, AthleteAgent.com has more than 4,000 athletes and 2,000 agents in its database. Each profile offers everything from their representation to their endorsements and philanthropy. The company has a small team that works with the leagues and agents to compile and update the data.
It plans to scale the database by adding front office executives, team contacts and retired athletes in the future.
Rottman said agents have been embracing the platform.
""It saves them time, helps meet endorsement quotas, and we don't take a cut,"" he said.
The tool also helps avoid misfires in outreach, O'Brien said, citing NBA legend LeBron James as a hypothetical example.
""Before us, someone might email Rich Paul for a brand deal — but Maverick Carter is the guy you want for LeBron's business stuff. We eliminate that confusion,"" said O'Brien.",20a507073a6805beab37eb7b36480223,trafilatura,2799,0

The White House's letter directs eight Smithsonian museums to turn over materials within 30 days about any exhibits related to America's 250th anniversary, other exhibits, and educational materials.
Within 120 days of receiving the letter, the museums are ordered to ""begin implementing content corrections where necessary,"" the letter to Smithsonian Secretary Lonnie Bunch says.
The Smithsonian Institution has been a target of Trump's, who earlier this year signed an executive order targeting the group of museums, writing that they had ""come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology.""
The letter on Tuesday says, ""As we prepare to celebrate the 250th anniversary of our Nation's founding, it is more important than ever that our national museums reflect the unity, progress, and enduring values that define the American story.""
The review seeks to ""ensure alignment with the President's directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions,"" according to the letter, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.
The Smithsonian defended its work in a statement, saying that it ""is grounded in a deep commitment to scholarly excellence, rigorous research, and the accurate, factual presentation of history.""
""We are reviewing the letter with this commitment in mind and will continue to collaborate constructively with the White House, Congress, and our governing Board of Regents,"" the Smithsonian said.
The museums that are subject to the initial review are the National Museum of American History, National Museum of Natural History, National Museum of African American History and Culture, National Museum of the American Indian, National Air and Space Museum, Smithsonian American Art Museum, National Portrait Gallery, and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden.
""Additional museums will be reviewed in Phase II,"" the letter said.
The letter was signed by special assistant to the president Lindsey Halligan, director of the domestic policy council Vince Haley and Director of the Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought.
The letter comes weeks after the Smithsonian Institution scrubbed references to Trump's two impeachments from an exhibit at the National Museum of American History, prompting concern that the museum was changing its content to appease the administration, CNN reported.
The materials were reinstalled following the backlash, but with changes made to the original text.",742594eada5290864d7ba77188adb6dd,trafilatura,2784,0

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CFO.com newsletter.
Not so long removed from a time when cryptocurrency seemed like a fad and many were skeptical of its utility, CFOs have quickly warmed up to the idea of investing in it or using it for payments.
“Warm” may be an understatement. According to a recent Deloitte survey of 200 North American finance chiefs at companies with at least $1 billion in annual revenue, only 1% said they did not expect to use cryptocurrency for business purposes over the long term.
Many companies are looking more at the short-term or mid-term. Almost a quarter (23%) of the CFOs said in the June survey that their treasury functions will use crypto for investments or payments within the next two years.
As Deloitte’s study report noted, this year may be a tipping point for corporate adoption of cryptocurrency. Recent developments include a President Trump executive order in March creating a strategic bitcoin reserve and a U.S. digital assets stockpile. Also, the U.S. Senate in June passed legislation governing stablecoins, which are usually backed by reserve assets and tied to a traditional currency like the U.S. dollar.
“CFOs are thinking beyond any ‘crypto hype’ and focusing on the practical implications of digital assets,"" said Steve Gallucci, U.S. and global leader of Deloitte's CFO Program, in a press release. “They appear to be assessing where cryptocurrency can drive efficiency, reduce friction in global operations and future-proof financial infrastructure.""
Still, CFOs are hardly carefree about cryptocurrencies. Asked to select up to three of their biggest concerns about investing in them, 43% of those polled cited price volatility in non-stable cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether. Deloitte said the sentiment was hardly surprising, considering past price fluctuations.
Close behind on the list of concerns were complexities around accounting and controls and a lack of industry regulation. Both the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board have taken steps recently toward heightened scrutiny of cryptocurrencies.
At the same time, though, CFOs cited several potential benefits of accepting cryptocurrency as a method of payment. Again, asked to select up to three responses, they put enhanced protection of customer privacy at the top of the list with 45%, followed by improved facilitation of cross-border transactions.
“Transactions conducted in crypto do not require intermediaries like banks, thus reducing costs and speeding up settlement,” Deloitte noted. “What’s more, stablecoins tied to the U.S. dollar in some cases serve as a hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates.”",814ecd0a8fd434ed7b99f4e80efa1d70,trafilatura,2775,0

My Favorite Options Trade Lets You Say ‘YOLO’ with Bitcoin Without Betting the House
The sub-$5 billion market cap company has drawn a lot of investor attention due to its potential in a hot-as-heck market area, quantum computing. That, and a set of partnerships forged with big tech firms and research institutions led the stock out of the realm of the “pink sheets” and into mid-cap status.
RGTI Traders Have Made It, But Can They Keep It
But as they say about the Major Leagues in baseball, as tough as it is to get there, it is even tougher to stay there. And with earnings hitting later on Aug. 12, there is a sense that this is a particularly pivotal quarterly report for Rigetti Computing. That drama has only intensified in recent days, as other up-and-coming growth stocks imploded on earnings releases, 20% or more in some cases.
Because while future growth is the ultimate investor attraction, it can fade quickly, once expectations reach a breaking point. And for RGTI, numbers like those in this box below are not going to create lasting goodwill, unless they keep delivering.
Let’s chart RGTI, then see what type of options protection might allow traders to profit from upcoming good news, while defending against a fall from grace.
Here’s the same chart as above, but run back only 1 year instead of 3, to focus on the company’s stock price performance since it became a symbol of the future of quantum computing.
There’s nothing that looks imminent in terms of a big move, but earnings often change that. And lately, it is not even a matter of simply beating earnings. It is more about the market’s reaction and the forward-looking view from management. This is the double-edged sword investing in smaller growth companies.
Charting RGTI: Moment of Truth
However, if I shorten up to a 2-hour chart covering the last 2 months and draw a pair of trend lines, we see that RGTI is acting like a stock approaching quarterly earnings. Its volatility is shrinking, which might set up for a volatile move in either direction. The flat moving averages across 3 different time frames (20, 50, and 150-day periods) confirm that the stock appears to be waiting for something. That “something” is Tuesday night.",8d0f4280856ad1b2a1543393d4c57f8d,trafilatura,2760,0

Underlying inflation accelerated in July by the most since the start of the year, though goods inflation was more subdued, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Tuesday.

Swap traders still are betting the US central bank will lower borrowing costs at its September meeting, especially given a softening labor market. Gold, which pays no interest, typically benefits in a lower rate environment.
The precious metal earlier climbed as much as 0.5% as the dollar pushed lower after Fox Business reported President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggested suspending the monthly jobs report prior to his nomination.
Traders also are on the lookout for clarification on whether gold imports would be subject to tariffs. On Monday, Trump said without elaborating there would not be a levy. But on Friday, Customs and Border Protection stunned traders by saying gold bars would be subject to duties.
“President Trump’s statement is an encouraging signal for trade stability,” Christoph Wild, president of the Swiss Association of Manufacturers and Traders in Precious Metals, said in a written statement. “However, only a formal and binding decision will provide the certainty the gold sector and its partners require.”
Prices for gold futures in New York and spot gold in London continued to converge after Trump’s comments. December gold futures on New York’s Comex held near $3,400 an ounce Tuesday, while spot gold traded near $3,350 an ounce. Adjusting for the different delivery dates, the two markets are almost level.
Gold has climbed more than 27% this year, with the bulk of those gains occurring in the first four months. It has been supported by geopolitical and trade tensions that have spurred haven demand, along with strong central bank purchases.
Spot gold rose 0.2% to $3,348.85 an ounce as of 1:13 p.m. in New York. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.4%. Silver and platinum advanced, while palladium slipped.
Comex copper rose 1.9% to settle at $4.5255 a pound. The red metal traded on the London Metal Exchange gained 1.1% to settle at $9,840.50 a ton at 5:51 local time. Most other LME metals were higher.",d2fca604cc7afbd274e852bee68e73b3,trafilatura,2744,0

In a statement to Just Drinks, Berentzen's CEO Oliver Schwegmann said: ""After careful internal review and consideration, we have decided to appeal the first-instance ruling of the Munich Regional Court of August 5, which was decided against us, in the present case.""
Paulaner Brauerei took legal action against local drinks manufacturer Berenzten at the start of this year over the design of the latter’s Mio Mio Cola + Orange Mix drink.
Confirming the news to Just Drinks at the time, Berentzen said Paulauner had taken legal action “for an alleged infringement of its colour trademark” used on the label of its Spezi soft drinks range.
It added that Paulaner argued Berentzen’s Mio Mio Cola + Orange Mix drink uses “a colour wave that is claimed to correspond to the colour combination of Paulaner Spezi and is therefore confusingly similar”.
On 5 August, the Munich Regional Court ruled against Berentzen.
In a statement on LinkedIn yesterday (11 August), Berentzen's Schwegmann said that the court's decision did not convince the company.
In the separate statement to Just Drinks, Schwegmann added: ""The design of our Mio Mio Cola + Orange Mix is based on an original, creative idea. We remain convinced that both the colour scheme and the bottle design of our product clearly distinguish it from the product of the Paulaner Brauerei. We are therefore confident about the next legal instance and optimistic that it will share our view.”
Paulaner told Just Drinks it had acknowledged Schwegmann's LinkedIn post and was ""interested in reaching in an “amicable solution”.
The group declined to comment further on the ongoing court proceedings.
It is not the first trademark issue Paulaner has faced regarding Spezi.
Three years ago, Brauhaus Riegele challenged Paulaner over the use of the “Spezi” name, claiming it had invented the drink.
In October 2023, the District Court of Munich ruled in favour of Paulaner, allowing it to continue using the name due to a 1974 agreement with Riegele.

Intel (INTC) stock jumped more than 3% in premarket trading on Tuesday after CEO Lip-Bu Tan met with President Trump, who had called for Tan's resignation last week.
After the meeting, Trump posted to Truth Social that he had met with Tan along with Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. ""The meeting was a very interesting one,"" the president wrote, adding, ""His success and rise is an amazing story.""
Trump said Tan and his Cabinet will ""spend time together"" and ""bring suggestions"" to him in the next week, without specifying the topics to be discussed.
Intel also released a statement acknowledging the two met and saying they had ""a candid and constructive discussion on Intel’s commitment to strengthening U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership.""
Intel stock pared gains after the market open. Shares rose 3.5% on Monday during the day as reports circulated about the meeting.
Citing unnamed sources, the Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend that Tan was set to meet with Trump on Monday to explain his personal and professional background and to propose ways that Intel and the government can collaborate.
Last week, Trump called for Tan's resignation in a Truth Social post minutes after Fox Business covered Republican Sen. Tom Cotton's recent criticism of the CEO over his ties with China. In a letter to Intel, Cotton expressed ""concern about the security and integrity of Intel's operations,"" given Tan’s investments in Chinese businesses through his venture capital firm, Walden International.
Trump wrote in his post last Thursday, ""The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately.”
Tan responded by saying reports about his career contained ""misinformation.""
""There has been a lot of misinformation circulating about my past roles ... I want to be absolutely clear: Over 40+ years in the industry, I’ve built relationships around the world and across our diverse ecosystem — and I have always operated within the highest legal and ethical standards,"" Tan wrote in a memo to employees.
Intel also issued its own statement following Trump's comments, emphasizing its commitment to ""advancing US national and economic security interests"" and to making investments ""aligned with the President's America First agenda,"" including domestic semiconductor manufacturing.
Tan was named Intel's CEO in March, taking over after his predecessor Pat Gelsinger was ousted by the board last year. The company struggled to stem losses in its manufacturing business, regain market share in its legacy computer chip segment, and develop an AI strategy.",dbfbe78d793da85c1baf467c53257fe7,trafilatura,2730,0

Although both STG and ZRO jumped over 20% on the news, many STG holders condemned the offer, calling it “fundamentally flawed” and “inadequate.”
“It undervalues Stargate’s assets and potential while disproportionately benefiting LayerZero at the expense of existing stakeholders,” LLCgenerator, a pseudonymous STG token holder, said on the Stargate governance forum.
The proposal offers to convert Stargate’s STG token to LayerZero’s ZRO token, dissolving Stargate’s DAO in the process and costing the foundation about $138 million worth of ZRO, according to CEO Bryan Pellegrino.
It comes as investor interest in so-called altcoins, which includes tokens tied to DeFi projects, remains muted.
“The broader altcoin market still lacks the sustained capital rotation and structural demand necessary to break out of its historical range,” analysts at Bitfinex, a crypto exchange, previously told DL News.
The ZRO token is down 67% from its 2024 all-time high, while the STG token has lost 95% of its value since it launched in 2022. ZRO has a market cap of $258 million and STG has a total value of $179 million, according to CoinGecko.
Dilution
The problem is that those who have locked up their STG currently receive 50% of all fees the crypto bridge generates. Stargate is projected to bring in more than $1.4 million in annual revenue, per DefiLlama data.
After the acquisition, these fees will instead be used to buy back the ZRO token.
Detractors say the move dilutes STG holders and transfers value to LayerZero’s ecosystem without reciprocal benefits.
Crypto bridges like Stargate are important infrastructure. They let DeFi users send tokens between unconnected blockchains, linking billions of dollars worth of crypto.
LayerZero is a messaging protocol that lets users send information between blockchains. Stargate uses this technology to power its crypto bridge.
Confusing relationship
Both LayerZero and Stargate were developed by the same company, LayerZero Labs.
Despite the closeness between the two projects, Stargate was launched independently of LayerZero in 2022 along with its STG token.
Two years later, LayerZero also launched its ZRO token. At the time, many questioned why LayerZero needed a token when the main protocol that used its technology, Stargate, already had one.
The merger aims to simplify the relationship between the two projects, as well as giving Stargate more resources to pursue a broader mandate, the LayerZero Foundation said in the proposal.",e9f0063a10b8d8366b3bf56706a526ea,trafilatura,2698,0

Gathered from iwoca's SME Expert Index, the data shows that finance brokers are now more likely to submit loan applications to alternative finance providers, with 61% indicating that more than half of their loan submissions in the past month were to non-bank lenders.
The shift in preference is largely attributed to the need for expedited decision-making processes, as reported by 73% of brokers.
This marks an increase from 63% in the previous quarter.
The SME Lending Thermometer, a measure introduced in early 2025 to gauge the demand for SME finance, has registered a score of 5.6 for the second quarter of 2025.
This score is a slight uptick from the previous quarter's 5.23, suggesting an incremental rise in the demand for finance among SMEs.
The thermometer's score is calculated from broker feedback, which currently indicates that 41% of brokers perceive a high demand for finance, while only 26% view the demand as below average.
Furthermore, the research points to a growing perception among brokers that mainstream banks are retreating from the SME lending market, with 71% in agreement on this trend.
As a result, brokers are increasingly recommending alternative financing options to their clients, particularly for loan amounts greater than $100,000, with 65% of brokers guiding SMEs in this direction.
iwoca UK chief commercial officer Colin Goldstein said: ""We’re at a real turning point for SME finance. More than ever, small businesses need quick and flexible funding, and they’re increasingly turning to alternative lenders to get it.
“The pace of this shift shows just how much traditional banks are struggling to meet the changing needs of the UK’s small businesses.”
The findings of the SME Expert Index are based on a survey involving 83 brokers who submitted a collective total of 2,511 unsecured finance applications for their SME clients across the UK during December and January.
""UK SMEs increasingly opt for alternative financing over traditional banks: iwoca "" was originally created and published by Leasing Life, a GlobalData owned brand.

LONDON (Reuters) -The U.S. Postal Service has cracked down on distributors of unregulated vapes using its services for business shipments, letters reviewed by Reuters show, in a blow to a multi-billion dollar industry that has dented Big Tobacco's sales.
The letters, previously unreported, show that USPS wrote to major New York-based distributor Demand Vape, blocking it from using its services after New York City's Law Department, which represents the city's government and officials in legal matters, provided evidence that its shipments broke laws.
USPS' action stands to benefit tobacco giants including Altria and British American Tobacco, which have for years battled against unregulated vapes, mostly from China.
Unregulated vapes lack the authorisation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that is required for them to be legally sold in the United States, the world's largest market for smoking alternatives.
USPS revoked Demand Vape's mailing exception last month after it received evidence the company shipped vapes lacking FDA authorisation and that violated a local flavour ban, a letter from USPS to the company, dated July 15, showed.
""Your local Buffalo BME Office will not accept any packages from... Demand Vape that contain ENDS products,"" the letter read, referring to electronic nicotine delivery systems, another term for vapes.
Demand Vape said it complied with relevant laws and was contesting the revocation, adding the industry operates in a ""regulatory grey zone"" with only a small number of FDA-authorised products that do not meet consumer demand.
""We reject any characterisation that paints Demand Vape as anything other than a transparent, lawful and reputable business,"" it said in a statement.
USPS did not respond to a request for comment.
LIMITED EXCEPTIONS
So far, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorised only 39 e-cigarette products.
But unauthorised devices are widely available as authorities struggle to contain them.
Under a 2021 law, USPS is restricted from mailing vapes directly to consumers, internationally and in most other circumstances.
The limited exceptions include domestic shipments between businesses, which need a ""mailing exception"" and their shipments must comply with relevant laws.
Some other large carriers, including FedEx, refuse to ship vapes. DHL only offers carriage for business shipments with prior approval.
USPS has provided NYC's Law Department with a list of other vape firms it has granted mailing exceptions so it can assess whether they should be challenged, in line with legal requirements, Eric Proshansky, deputy chief of the city's division of affirmative litigation, told Reuters.",26d75696037542e58e9827652e407593,trafilatura,2696,0

""I've always been clear that the independence of the Fed is of paramount importance,"" Stephen Miran, who is currently chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers and who last year laid out a case for increasing presidential control of the Fed Board, told CNBC. ""But...I do have the nomination going in front of the Senate and I really can't speak about that and get ahead of the Senate process.""
Miran has called for a complete overhaul of the Fed's governance, making the case in a paper he co-authored last year for the Manhattan Institute for increasing presidential control of the Fed Board, including by shortening members' terms. He also wants to end the ""revolving door"" between the executive branch and the Fed, and nationalize the Fed's 12 regional banks.
If confirmed by the Senate, he would take over from former Fed Governor Adriana Kugler following her surprise resignation earlier this month, as she returns to her tenured professorship at Georgetown University.
He would become one of seven members on a Fed Board now helmed by Jerome Powell, against whom Trump repeatedly rails over the central bank's refusal to lower interest rates as Trump demands. Two other governors were appointed by Trump during his first term and the other three are Biden appointees.
But the vacancy Miran would fill extends only to January 31. Trump said Miran would hold the seat while he and his advisers search for a successor to Powell, whose term as Fed chair expires next May.
Miran, asked to respond to inflation data released earlier on Tuesday, said the president's tariff policies are not resulting in meaningful inflation. The Consumer Price Index advanced 2.7% year-on-year in July but an underlying measure was up 3.1% at the fastest since January.
""I do think that inflation has been well behaved, particularly since the president took office,"" he said.
The majority of Fed officials had until recently been concerned that tariffs would exacerbate inflation and that worry has been the main driver in their decision not to lower rates. But a weak jobs report for July has changed that narrative, and rate futures markets now expect rate cuts to start next month.
Asked if he believed he would be confirmed by the Senate in time for the next Fed meeting in mid-September, Miran said: ""That's up to the Senate, and...I can't speak for them.""

-
Like all funds and portfolios, Berkshire Hathaway has underperformed from time to time.
-
Warren Buffett's quality-oriented approach to buying and holding stocks has paid off of late.
Artificial-intelligence-related tech stocks like Nvidia and Palantir have dominated headlines and led the marketwide bullish charge over the past five years. But, not every market-beating stock has been an AI technology name -- or even a growth name -- during this stretch. Warren Buffett and his team have proven their mettle once again, leading value-oriented Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) to a market-beating performance of its own since the middle of 2020.
Back in fighting form
If you had you invested $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway shares in early August of 2020, as I write this on Aug. 10, you'd be sitting on $2,221. That's an annualized growth rate of 17.3%, outpacing the S&P 500 's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) average annual growth pace of 13.8%, or 15.5% when factoring in reinvested dividends.
Making this five-year run even more impressive is that Berkshire has performed relatively poorly since May. That's not only when Buffett announced his end-of-year retirement, but also when investors began shedding their defensive value stocks that Buffett's conglomerate holds so they could plow back into growth-oriented technology names. It's still well ahead despite the headwind.
There's also some vindication in this market-beating performance.
You may recall that Berkshire's persistent underperformance for several years prior to 2021's rekindled leadership was prompting criticisms and questions of his old-school stock-picking approach. The past three years have reminded everyone that patience pays off when you prioritize owning quality businesses rather than chasing growth.
Buying and holding quality is always a sound strategy
Don't misunderstand. Just as it did for several years prior to 2021, there will come another time when Berkshire Hathaway shares lag the market. That's just the nature of Warren Buffett's value-minded style -- it tends to underperform when investors are captivated by new, game-changing industries.
Just remember the past five years the next time that happens, and the past three years in particular. A truly great stock is worth buying and holding even through the rough patches.

For Anthropic’s API customers, the company’s Claude Sonnet 4 AI model now has a 1 million token context window — meaning the AI can handle requests as long as 750,000 words, more than the entire “Lord of the Rings” trilogy, or 75,000 lines of code. That’s roughly five times Claude’s previous limit (200,000 tokens), and more than double the 400,000 token context window offered by OpenAI’s GPT-5.
Long context will also be available for Claude Sonnet 4 through Anthropic’s cloud partners, including on Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI.
Anthropic has built one of the largest enterprise businesses among AI model developers, largely by selling Claude to AI coding platforms such as Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, and Anysphere’s Cursor. While Claude has become the model of choice among developers, GPT-5 may threaten Anthropic’s dominance with its competitive pricing and strong coding performance. Anysphere CEO Michael Truell even helped OpenAI announce the launch of GPT-5, which is now the default AI model for new users in Cursor.
Anthropic’s product lead for the Claude platform, Brad Abrams, told TechCrunch in an interview that he expects AI coding platforms to get a “lot of benefit” from this update. When asked if GPT-5 put a dent in Claude’s API usage, Abrams downplayed the concern, saying he’s “really happy with the API business and the way it’s been growing.”
Whereas OpenAI generates most of its revenue from consumer subscriptions to ChatGPT, Anthropic’s business centers around selling AI models to enterprises through an API. That’s made AI coding platforms a key customer for Anthropic and could be why the company is throwing in some new perks to attract users in the face of GPT-5.
Last week, Anthropic unveiled an updated version of its largest AI model, Claude Opus 4.1, which pushed the company’s AI coding capabilities a bit further.
Generally speaking, AI models tend to perform better on all tasks when they have more context, but especially for software engineering problems. For example, if you ask an AI model to spin up a new feature for your app, it’s likely to do a better job if it can see the entire project, rather than just a small section.
Abrams also told TechCrunch that Claude’s large context window helps it perform better at long agentic coding tasks, in which the AI model is autonomously working on a problem for minutes or hours. With a large context window, Claude can remember all its previous steps in long-horizon tasks.",acef4b39d6f8d49c8428efbddc51e615,trafilatura,2694,0

Paragon Bank has secured a further £27 million allocation under the scheme, while Aldermore has gained accreditation to offer its invoice finance and term loan products with GGS backing.
The GGS has allocated £27m to Paragon Bank, a specialist lender and savings bank providing a range of products and services in the UK.
Succeeding the Recovery Loan Scheme, the GGS provides accredited lenders with a government-backed guarantee while borrowers remain fully liable for the debt.
It aims to improve access to finance for UK small and medium enterprises (SMEs) seeking to invest and grow.
The additional £27m funding increases Paragon Bank’s total lending capacity under the scheme to £55m.
Of this, £10m is designated specifically to support UK businesses affected by changes in international trade tariffs.
A targeted £7m fund has been set aside for businesses impacted by shifting trade tariffs, particularly in sectors such as manufacturing, which have faced increased costs and supply chain complexities.
Paragon has so far provided over £40m in GGS-backed funding to more than 300 SMEs, supporting investment and growth in sectors including construction, transport, and agriculture.
The new allocation will allow Paragon to further expand its support, offering both unsecured loans and asset-based finance to businesses that may struggle to access capital.
Paragon Bank SME Lending deputy managing director Phil Hughes said: “The additional funding from the British Business Bank is a welcome boost and a clear vote of confidence in our ability to deliver meaningful support to UK SMEs.
“We’ve already seen the transformative impact of the Growth Guarantee Scheme, and with this new allocation, we’re ready to support even more businesses on their growth journeys.”
In a separate development, UK bank Aldermore has confirmed its accreditation as a lender under the invoice finance and term loan variants of the GGS, having previously participated in the Recovery Loan Scheme.
For its invoice finance offering, Aldermore provides a maximum facility of £2m per business group, with a fixed value up to the facility review limit, as determined by the bank.
Facility limit increases may be considered for extraordinary events, but cannot include inter-company debt, aged debtors, or disputed debt.
Aldermore’s Term Loan offering under the GGS operates alongside its invoice finance facility, providing loans ranging from £25,000 to £2m per business group, with term lengths available from three months to six years.",74316253beb0bd00dc82be9f032eccf9,trafilatura,2691,0

Looking closer, the specialty chemicals company stock has slightly outpaced the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund's (XLB) marginal increase over the past 52 weeks.
Despite Albemarle’s better-than-expected Q2 2025 adjusted EPS of $0.11 and revenue of $1.3 billion on Jul. 30, shares fell 1.5% the next day due to lingering concerns over the lithium market. Lithium prices have plunged more than 90% in the past two years, pressuring margins and driving Albemarle to cut jobs, cancel projects, including a key U.S. refinery and lower its annual capital expenditure guidance to $650 million - $750 million.
For the fiscal year ending in December 2025, analysts expect ALB's loss per share to improve 11.5% year-over-year to $2.07. The company's earnings surprise history is mixed. It beat the consensus estimates in two of the last four quarters while missing on two other occasions.
Among the 24 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a “Hold.” That’s based on six “Strong Buy” ratings, two “Moderate Buys,” 13 “Holds,” and three “Strong Sells.”
This configuration is slightly less bullish than three months ago, with seven “Strong Buy” ratings on the stock.
On Aug. 1, Scotiabank raised Albemarle’s price target to $70 with a “Sector Perform"" rating.
As of writing, the stock is trading below the mean price target of $79.39. The Street-high price target of $125 implies a potential upside of 58.8% from the current price levels.

Narrowing the focus, Campbell's has also underperformed the industry-focused First Trust Nasdaq Food & Beverage ETF’s (FTXG) 8.7% decline over the past year and 2.5% dip on a YTD basis.
CPB stock prices observed a marginal uptick in the trading session following the release of its better-than-expected Q3 results on Jun. 2. Driven by a slight uptick in organic growth and contribution from acquisitions, the company’s overall topline for the quarter increased 4.5% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, beating the Street expectations. However, due to pricing pressures, its margins observed a slight contraction, leading to a 2.7% drop in adjusted EPS to $0.73. Nevertheless, this figure surpassed the consensus estimates by 12.3%.
For the full fiscal 2025, ended in July, analysts expect Campbell’s to deliver an adjusted EPS of $2.93, down 4.9% year-over-year. On a positive note, the company has a solid earnings surprise history. It has surpassed the Street’s bottom-line projections in each of the past four quarters.
The stock has a consensus “Hold” rating overall. Of the 19 analysts covering the stock, opinions include two ""Strong Buys,” 12 “Holds,” one “Moderate Sell,” and four “Strong Sells.”
This configuration is slightly more pessimistic than two months ago, when the stock had four “Strong Buy” recommendations.
On Aug. 7, Piper Sandler analyst Michael Lavery downgraded CPB stock from “Overweight” to “Neutral” and lowered the price target from $35 to $34.
CPB’s mean price target of $34.95 represents a modest 8.8% premium to current price levels, while its Street-high target of $46 suggests a notable 43.3% upside potential.

Dive Brief:
-
Enterprise software company OneStream will continue to build and refine AI solutions that help CFOs solve “deterministic,” rather than “subjective” problems, as it looks to execute on the strong performance it logged for its second quarter — where it reported a 26% increase in revenue year-over-year and a 281% jump in free cash flow, CEO and President Tom Shea told CFO Dive.
-
The Birmingham, Mich.-based company’s Q2 results show “customers like that we have this platform that can deliver not only on the core financial capabilities that CFOs need, but also operational and AI [capabilities], and that journey is really resonating with CFOs,” Shea said in an interview. The business remains focused on developing AI solutions that will provide finance leaders with the transparent, trusted data they need from such technologies — rather than generating summaries or theories that require interpretation.
-
“We understand that in order for AI to be meaningful for CFOs, when CFOs are looking for deterministic solutions that have to be fact-based, we have to provide both the trust and the transparency, or there will be no adoption,” he said.
Dive Insight:
For the quarter ended June 30, OneStream reported total revenues of $147.6 million, while free cash flow hit $29.4 million compared to $7.7 million for the prior year period, according to its earnings results released Thursday. Net income reached $1.6 million, compared to an operating loss of $8.7 million for the prior year period.
OneStream’s bid to build out ‘deterministic” AI tools comes as the finance chief’s role has continued to evolve, Shea highlighted during the software provider’s Q2 earnings call Friday. As CFOs take on more strategic and operational responsibilities, they are also examining how AI and similar technologies can be best used in the finance function.
“Having utilized outdated legacy financial systems for decades, CFOs are recognizing the crucial need for a platform to provide a single view into financial and operational data across the enterprise to effectively steer the business,” Shea said Friday according to a transcript, pointing to key business drivers for OneStream.
The company is seeking to continue the growth shown in Q2 throughout the rest of the year, with an eye towards further strengthening profitability and cash flow, Shea told CFO Dive. For the fiscal year 2025, OneStream is targeting revenue between $586 million to $590 million, as well as net income per share of between $0.07 - $0.15, according to its earnings report.",8133783d0fd64ab112ffb3af43a0fe4a,trafilatura,2689,0

And then there are bonds, alternative investments and even cash.
Fortunately, an investing expert, Noah Hamman, has a solution. He’s the CEO of AdvisorShares, an investment firm with over $815 million in assets. AdvisorShares offers 15 actively managed exchange-traded funds, including stock, bond and thematic funds, as well as multi-asset offerings, according to Business Insider. Hamman came up with a short list of investments that will provide a diversified portfolio that anyone can use.

Exchange-Traded Funds
Hamman recommended exchange-traded funds or ETFs. According to Investor.gov, ETFs are similar to mutual funds in that they consist of a portfolio of investments. ETFs can be actively or passively managed, meaning that they may have a portfolio manager who buys and sells positions in the fund to maximize returns (active) or they may simply mimic or track, an index like the S&P 500 (passive).
ETFs trade on exchanges at market prices and can be less expensive and more tax-efficient than mutual funds.

Buy an S&P 500 Index Fund
The first fund that Hamman recommended is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). This ETF tracks the S&P 500, which is the index most analysts look at when determining the health of “the market.” There are 500 leading U.S. companies on the S&P 500 and it has returned about 100% over the past 5 years, per Yahoo.
Buy a Global Stock Fund
The S&P 500 includes only U.S. stocks and investors should have some international exposure as well, according to Hamman. He suggested purchasing the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF to broaden your investing horizons. This ETF is made up of 900+ companies, mostly large and midsize, which are based in Europe, Australia and the Far East (Asia).
Buy Bonds
A diversified portfolio should also include bonds, as they often move in the opposite direction from stocks. The bond ETF that Hamman recommended is BlackRock’s iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF. This fund tracks a U.S. investment-grade bond index.

(Reuters) -Stablecoin giant Circle surpassed expectations for second-quarter revenue in its maiden quarterly results since going public, sending its shares up 5% on Tuesday.
Higher circulation of its USDC stablecoin and stronger subscription services helped the New York-based company cement a rally that has pushed its stock to more than five times its initial public offering price.
Stablecoins, which are digital tokens backed by low-risk assets such as the U.S. dollar or Treasuries, have drawn increasing investor attention, especially since the Genius Act was passed last month.
The momentum has helped companies such as Circle, which issues USDC - the second-biggest stablecoin by market value after Tether.
After ""our IPO and the Genius Act, we're seeing an acceleration of interest, with major institutions all leaning in,"" Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Fox-Geen said in an interview.
USDC in circulation grew 90% as of June 30, compared to a year earlier. Circle expects it to grow at a compounded annual rate of 40% through the years.
The token was also being used for cross-border transactions, including remittances both between individuals and businesses, CEO Jeremy Allaire said.
The company's revenue and reserve income grew 53% year-over-year to $658 million, thanks to a jump in the interest it earns from the cash and short-term investments backing its USDC stablecoins. Revenue from subscription and services also rose, Circle said.
Analysts were expecting revenues of $644.7 million, according to estimates compiled by LSEG.
The company's net loss was $482 million, primarily due to two non-cash charges related to its IPO, including costs for employee stock awards that vested when the company went public and a higher valuation of its convertible debt following a rise in its share price.
'PILLAR OF STABLECOINS'
Circle on Tuesday also said it will roll out Arc, a public blockchain designed specifically for stablecoin transactions, this fall as it pushes to build the technological infrastructure for digital payments.
""They're really trying to become the pillar of stablecoins in the U.S.,"" said David Bartosiak, stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research.
""Circle can use what they have already done to establish themselves as a trusted mover.""
However, the company was currently not looking to strike many deals, even as the massive jump in its stock price has given it the ability to do so, CEO Allaire said.
""We're careful and deliberate. I don't think our strategy here is to go try and do big, complex acquisitions to throw additional business lines.""

Hackers have breached critical infrastructure organizations in the Netherlands using a vulnerability in Citrix’s NetScaler products, highlighting the serious risks facing the thousands of systems still running vulnerable NetScaler instances.
“Several critical organizations in the Netherlands have been successfully attacked” using the memory-overflow vulnerability in NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway, the Dutch National Cyber Security Centre said on Monday. The flaw is tracked as CVE-2025-6543 and rated as critical.
The unknown intruders first breached their targets’ networks in early May, more than a month before Citrix’s June 25 disclosure of the flaw, the NCSC said. They used “sophisticated methods” and erased evidence of their activities “to conceal the compromise at the affected organizations,” the agency added. “The investigation is ongoing, but it can now be concluded that perhaps not all questions about this digital attack can be answered.”
Citrix in June also disclosed a similar NetScaler flaw, an insufficient-input-validation vulnerability tracked as CVE-2025-5777 and also rated critical.
There are more than 3,300 internet-connected NetScaler instances vulnerable to CVE-2025-5777 worldwide and more than 4,100 instances vulnerable to CVE-2025-6543, according to data from the Shadowserver Foundation. “We see exploitation attempts for both vulnerabilities in our sensors,” the group said in a social media post.
The intrusions in the Netherlands raise questions about how widespread the NetScaler attacks may be, including whether hackers have used the Citrix flaws to breach any U.S. critical infrastructure providers. There are more than 1,300 NetScaler instances in the U.S. that are vulnerable to at least one of the flaws, according to Shadowserver Foundation data.
Researchers at Reliaquest previously warned of exploitation in late June, days after Citrix disclosed the second flaw.
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which has added both flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, is working with Citrix and other partners “to assess prevalence and reported incidents,” according to Chris Butera, the agency’s acting executive assistant director for cybersecurity.
“Given the widespread use of Citrix NetScaler ADC and Gateway systems,” Butera said in a statement, “CISA continues to urge all organizations to reduce their exposure to possible cyberattacks by immediately patching this vulnerability, if they haven’t done so already.”",d35e945e37d03fe7bc0e53d136fb7f32,trafilatura,2663,0
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asian-shares-advance-ahead-trumps-045335196.html,247e92b3926ebadbbb18e12cd64443d1,US stocks slip as Wall Street braces for an update on inflation,US stocks slip as Wall Street braces for an update on inflation,2025-08-12 04:15:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks edged back from their record heights on Monday in Wall Street’s final moves before an upcoming update on inflation.
The S&P 500 dipped 0.3% after flirting with its all-time high, which was set two weeks ago, earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 200 points, or 0.5%, while the Nasdaq composite shaved 0.3% off its own record.
The highlight of this week for Wall Street will likely arrive on Tuesday, when the government will report how bad inflation was across the country in July. Economists expect it to show U.S. consumers had to pay prices for groceries, gasoline and other costs of living that were 2.8% higher from a year earlier, a slight acceleration from June’s 2.7% inflation.
Inflation has remained above 2%, even if it has improved substantially from its peak above 9% three years ago. And the worry is that President Donald Trump’s tariffs could push inflation higher.
That in turn is raising fears about a potential, worst-case scenario called “stagflation” where the economy stagnates but inflation remains high. The Federal Reserve has no good tool to fix both at once, and it would need to concentrate on either the job market or inflation first. But helping one of those areas by moving interest rates would likely hurt the other.
A top Fed official, Michelle Bowman, said on Saturday that she believes the job market is the bigger concern. She is still backing three cuts to interest rates by the Fed this year following this month’s stunning, weaker-than-expected report on the U.S. job market. President Donald Trump has also been angrily calling for cuts to interest rates to support the economy.
Other Fed officials, led by Chair Jerome Powell, have been more hesitant. Powell has said he wants to wait for more data about how Trump’s tariffs are affecting inflation before the Fed makes its next move, and Tuesday’s update on the consumer price index may offer a big clue about that.
Strategists at Stifel are warning that stagflation may already be on the way, with spending by U.S. consumers slowing. That in turn could create a reckoning for investors after they sent stock prices soaring to records from their low point in April.
“Rate cuts cannot save an overvalued S&P 500,” according to the strategists, led by Thomas Carroll and Barry Bannister.
One way companies can make their stock prices appear less expensive is to deliver bigger profits.

Some $45 million of the sum is payable to Gemfields by SMG Capital on completion of the sale by the end of August, while the remaining $5 million will go to Gemfields by way of quarterly royalty payments at a rate of 8 percent of Fabergé’s revenue.
More from WWD
The colored gemstones supplier bought Fabergé from from Pallinghurst Resources, in 2013 in a deal at the time that valued the maker of lavish bejeweled Easter eggs at $142 million.
Gemfields said that by offloading Fabergé and other non-core holdings, it has become a more streamlined and focused company with a strengthened balance sheet.
The fresh capital injection from the sale will help Gemfields fund a new processing plant at Montepuez Ruby Mining in Mozambique, and expand emerald mining at Kagem in Zambia, which was suspended during the first quarter of 2025.
Sean Gilbertson, group chief executive officer of Gemfields, and son of Brian Gilbertson, co-founder and former chairperson of Pallinghurst, said the sale of Fabergé marks the end of a considerably challenging trading environment, which the company began facing in the fourth quarter of 2024.
Gemfields announced last December that it’s considering selling Fabergé to cut costs.
“Fabergé has played a key role in raising the profile of the colored gemstones mined by Gemfields, and we will certainly miss its marketing leverage and star power. I extend our admiration and sincere thanks to the Fabergé team for their fortitude and the progress they have delivered over the years,” he added.
SMG Capital is a U.S.-based investment company owned by the Russia-born, London-based tech investor Sergei Mosunov, whose interest spans from optics and photonics to AI, biotech and foundational models.
Meanwhile, SMG Capital is dedicated to strategic investments in luxury brands and innovative businesses with strong heritage and global growth potential, the firm said.
Mosunov is not entirely new to the world of fashion. In June, according to a LinkedIn post, he attended a panel talk hosted by networking platform Create What You Wish Existed between Stella McCartney and fellow Russian national Natalia Vodianova.
“It is a great honor for me to become the custodian of such an outstanding and globally recognized brand. Fabergé’s unique heritage, with ties to Russia, England, France and the U.S., opens significant opportunities for further strengthening its position in the global luxury market and expanding its international presence,” said Mosunov.",2676aef54b589423cabfbbac0a41b2fd,trafilatura,2655,0

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Global equity markets lost ground on Monday in a choppy session while yields of long-dated U.S. Treasuries fell, as investors weighed developments on trade and geopolitics in addition to key U.S. economic data.
U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order extending a tariff truce with China by another 90 days, hours before U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods were due to snap back to triple-digit rates. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are due to meet in Alaska on Friday to discuss ending Russia's war on Ukraine.
On Wall Street, all three main indexes finished lower. Energy, real estate, and technology stocks were the biggest losers while consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and healthcare stocks gained.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.45%, the S&P 500 slipped 0.25% and the Nasdaq Composite gave up 0.30%.
In Europe, the STOXX 600 index eased 0.06%. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe was down 0.25% to 938.16, trading near its record high reached in July.
""At the surface level, the market is flat and calm, and it looks like we are in wait-and-see mode to see the economic data we are going to get tomorrow,"" said Wasif Latif, chief investment officer at Sarmaya Partners in New Jersey.
""When you look underneath the covers and at the breakdown within the market, you're getting a little bit more of a selloff.""
The main economic release this week will be U.S. consumer prices on Tuesday, with analysts expecting the impact of tariffs to help nudge the core up 0.3% to an annual pace of 3%, away from the Federal Reserve target of 2%.
An upside surprise would challenge market wagers for a September rate cut, though analysts assume it would have to be a high number given that a downward turn in payrolls is now dominating the outlook.
Markets imply around a 90% probability of a September easing, and at least one more cut by year-end.
The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes dipped 0.2 basis points to 4.281%, while the 30-year bond yield fell 0.5 basis points to 4.8494%.
Trump has repeatedly criticised the Fed for not cutting rates at recent meetings, and markets are eyeing who will succeed current Chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May.
This means the dollar's reaction to the CPI data will not be straightforward, said Paul Mackel, global head of FX research at HSBC.
If the figure indicated higher U.S. tariff price pressures, ""that could support the stagflation narrative, and to the dollar's detriment"", he said, adding that this would also go against the view of some policymakers that tariffs were not causing prices to increase.",6f7647cfb6f5ccc5bb3811f8b61ee5e6,trafilatura,2652,0

The July Consumer Price Index is out, and it showed a slight acceleration in core inflation versus June as tariffs began to take greater hold. The CPI Index excluding food and energy rose 0.3% in July, which follows a 0.2% increase in June. Components that increased over the month include medical care, airline fees, recreation, household furnishings, and used cars and trucks.
On the upside, the core inflation rate came in line with estimates.
""I think that the market's going to have to come to grips with the Fed is going to cut rates, and is it going to be the right move for the Fed to make now? Last year they cut rates, and the market decided it wasn't the right move. And it shot yields on the 10 [year Treasury] and the 30-year up over 100 basis points,"" Jim Bianco of Bianco Research said on Opening Bid.
""I think that's the risk we face right now if the market decides this is not the right move.""
Here are some deeper stock dives beyond what we discussed on Opening Bid.
Stock analysis: CoreWeave
Momo AI trade CoreWeave (CRWV) will report earnings after market close today. The stock is now more than triple its March IPO price!
Here is what I think the Street is looking for from Coreweave. If it could hit these marks, the stock could renew its upward momentum that has been on delay since early June:
-
Revenue beats estimates by a double-digit percentage. Key CoreWeave customer Microsoft had a huge quarter on the AI use front, benefitting the company.
-
Backlog increases compared to the first quarter.
-
Earnings thump estimates — in spite of robust investments in capex.
-
Management tamps down concerns on insider selling after its IPO lock-up expires on Thursday. That frees up 83% of Class A shares beginning the morning of Aug. 15, points out Citi.
CoreWeave’s valuation leaves no margin for error. The stock trades at big-time premiums to the market on a price-to-sales and price-to-book ratio basis.
Zoom-in: Don't let Intel fool you
Intel (INTC) shares are in the green today as President Trump walked back his apparent dislike for the company's new CEO Lip-Bu Tan after meeting on Monday.
Don't be fooled by the upside price action, however. I would say this should apply for the rest of 2025!
This isn't a case like Apple (AAPL), where CEO Tim Cook kisses Trump's butt and the company is exempt from various tariffs. Intel is a fundamental disaster. People in the industry I talk to are unsure if the company will ever turn around, given 1) how fast AI chip development is occurring; 2) how far it's behind Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).",2a861aee9194f036108a68ecdd6f889d,trafilatura,2648,0

""Right now it stands with these two companies. Perhaps it could expand in the future to other companies,"" said Leavitt, the White House's spokesperson.
""The legality of it, the mechanics of it, is still being ironed out by the Department of Commerce, and I would defer you to them for any further details on how it will actually be implemented,"" she continued.
President Donald Trump confirmed on Monday that he had negotiated a deal with Nvidia in which the U.S. government approves export licenses for the China-specific H20 AI chip in exchange for a 15% cut of revenue. Advanced Micro Devices also got licenses approved in exchange for a proportion of its China sales, the White House confirmed.
""I said, 'If I'm going to do that, I want you to pay us as a country something, because I'm giving you a release,'"" Trump said Monday.
""We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets,"" Nvidia said in a statement this week.
Trump said the export licenses for AMD and Nvidia were a done deal. But lawyers and experts who follow trade have warned that Trump's deal may be complicated because of existing laws that regulate how the government can charge fees for export licenses.
The Commerce Department didn't immediately return a request for comment.
The H20 is Nvidia's Chinese-specific chip that is slowed down on purpose to comply with U.S. export relations. It's related to the H100 and H200 chips that are used in the U.S., and was introduced after the Biden administration implemented export controls on artificial intelligence chips in 2023.
Earlier this year, Nvidia said that it was on track to sell more than $8 billion worth of H20 chips in a single quarter before the Trump administration in April said that it would require a license to export the chip.
Trump signaled in July that he was likely to approve export licenses for the chip after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang visited the White House.
The U.S. regulates AI chips like those made by Nvidia for national security reasons, saying that they could be used by the Chinese government to leapfrog U.S. capabilities in AI, or they could be used by the Chinese military or linked groups.
The Chinese government has been encouraging local companies in recent weeks to avoid using Nvidia's H20 chips for any government or national security-related work, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.

After a recent high settlement of just over $2.50/g on July 21, the price has gradually drifted down, hitting a recent low settlement of $2.2502/g on August 5. Monday’s settlement was only slightly higher at $2.291/g.
Most commentary on the reason for the decline has been focused on the on-again, off-again nature of a possible agreement between Russia and Ukraine that would bring the war between the two countries to an end.
Other factors include a gradually strengthening dollar coming on the heels of almost six months of declines. Oil prices tend to move in inverse direction to the movement of the dollar. The recent increases are said to be a factor in the downward direction of oil in the last two weeks.
One thing that has not happened is a flood of oil coming out of the OPEC+ group, despite its monthly unwinding of production cuts that have been in effect since spring 2023.
In its latest monthly report, S&P Global Commodity Insights said OPEC+ production in July, after a huge increase in June, fell by 140,000 barrels/day in July, on the back of a drop of 190,000 b/d out of countries that are part of OPEC.
The increase in quotas that OPEC+ has been putting into effect for several months have been in the range of more than 400,000 b/d to 500,000 b/d. But lifting quotas and lifting production have been different processes, and as the SPGCI report shows, one does not necessarily follow the other.

APPARENT IPO: Shares of Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) moved higher after President Trump over the weekend posted a picture on social media of an alleged initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange of a company called “The Great American Mortgage Corporation.” The post followed reporting last week that the Trump administration is weighing an IPO of the government sponsored entries.
Keefe Bruyette keeps Underperform ratings on both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac after the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that the Trump administration is planning to do an initial public offering of both later this year. The firm finds “very unlikely” that an IPO can be done by the end of 2025. There are numerous factors to address before an IPO, including the current minimum capital, which is roughly 4.25% of assets for both companies and results in estimated run-rate returns on equity of 7%-9%, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Keefe believes investors won’t be willing to buy shares of companies with such low ROEs. In order for Fannie and Freddie to generate low-teens ROEs, the capital rules have to be changed to remove the buffers and take capital levels back closer to the statutory minimum of 2.5%, contends the firm.

Odds of Outperformance Are Slim,2025-08-12 18:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Time has not exactly been kind to active funds over the long haul.
Just a third of actively managed mutual funds and ETFs beat their passive counterparts over a year, according to a new Morningstar report. And believe it or not, that’s about as good as it gets, with the data finding that under 6% of active large blend funds beat index funds over 10 years, and under 3% of large growth funds outperformed passives. Stretch that out to 20 years, and the figures are 7% and less than 1%, respectively. However, short-term figures for active management were better for some categories of foreign stocks and intermediate core bonds. And investors’ odds of picking winners in fixed income were considerably better in the long term than for equities.
“There is value in investing a small portion of your portfolio in an actively managed ETF,” said Alvin Carlos, managing partner of District Capital Management, citing low fees and histories of outperformance. “It’s easier to find good active ETFs for bonds. You can find a good one with a 0.10% fee. It’s harder for stocks. The active stock ETF we may recommend to certain clients has a 0.59% expense ratio.” Morningstar’s data showed that over a year, nearly 52% of active intermediate core bond funds did better than passive ones on an asset-weighted basis. Corporate bond funds are an entirely different story, with a scant 4% of active ones beating passives.

The Price Is Right … Right?
As it turns out, costs do matter when it comes to active management, and having low fees is linked to higher odds of investors beating benchmarks over time, Morningstar found. That hasn’t been lost on investors, who on average “have chosen active funds wisely,” the report noted. Over 10 years, a dollar invested in active funds has, on average, beaten active funds as a whole, implying that “investors favor cheaper, higher-quality strategies,” the authors wrote.
Still, the odds are stacked against active:
-
In the past 10 years, through June, 27% of actively managed funds that were in the lowest quintile by cost beat peers, while that was the case for just 15% of funds in the most expensive quintile, according to Morningstar.

The S&P 500 is hovering at record highs this summer.
-
Despite mixed economic data, major indexes have proven resilient amid AI hype and solid earnings.

Morgan Stanley warns that a cooling job market rising stagflation risk could break the rally.
It's been a tumultuous summer for markets, but investors have mostly ploughed through the volatility and pushed stocks steadily higher — but one top bank is warning not to get comfortable.
The S&P 500 is up 8% year-to-date, and the benchmark index is cruising near record highs in the late summer stretch. Solid earnings, a still-strong economy, and more AI hype have pushed stocks ever upward.
However, Morgan Stanley thinks there are a few things that could snap the winning streak.
Here's what the bank is looking at:
A cooling labor market
Since the July jobs report, fears have swirled that the recent strength in the job market may have been a mirage.
Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the US economy added 73,000 nonfarm jobs, short of the estimated 105,000. The revisions for the prior two months were also sharply negative.
While the Trump administration has questioned the accuracy of the data, Morgan Stanley sees cause for concern. ""We believe that the trend, if not the exact level, is substantiated by the broad data mosaic,"" Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer of the bank's wealth management group, wrote on Monday.
""According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' JOLTs survey, job openings fell to 7.44 million at the end of June, equating to a weak openings-to-job-seeker ratio of roughly 1:1,"" Shalett added.
The report highlighted several other economic data points that point toward slower economic growth, including a survey from the Institute for Supply Management which showed new employment contracting at levels that may indicate a coming recession.
Skewed Q2 earnings
Shalett acknowledged that Q2 earnings season showed strong growth for many companies, particularly those in the tech sector. S&P 500 earnings beats have managed to remain at or above the 80% benchmark with a few weeks left to go.
However, despite positive sentiment from investors, Shalett said that the a peak under the hood of the latest quarterly results tells a slightly different story.
""Only three of the 11 major equity sectors—information technology, communication services and financials—posted double-digit gains,"" the report said.
It added that while the members of the Magnificent 7 are growing at a rate of 26% for the year, that still leaves 493 companies that are barely up, if at all, on a year-over-year (YOY) basis.",7294fe3d22b4a3b68d283078e5d1849a,trafilatura,2599,0

The investment banking giant forecasts that the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark index, will yield a ""high single-digit return over the next 12 months,"" driven by three key factors.
One of the main reasons for optimism is that markets don't care about signs of an economic slowdown. Instead, traders are focused on resilient corporate earnings and the subsequent economic recovery.
Since President Trump fired the first tariff salvo on April 2, economists have downgraded full-year U.S. growth forecasts from 2.3% to 1.5%. Still, the S&P 500 has gained over 28% in the four months. The index has held steady despite recent economic data revealing softness in the labour market and consumption, as well as stickiness in manufacturing and service sector inflation.
While the macro analysts' warning is concerning and likely playing out in the background, corporate earnings in the U.S. are ignoring the slowdown risks, at least in the short term, making it the second catalyst for JPMorgan's bullish thesis.
Over 80% of S&P 500 companies have recently reported their Q2 earnings, with 82% surpassing earnings expectations and 79% beating revenue forecasts—the strongest performance since the second quarter of 2021.
The winners and losers
According to JPMorgan, while Wall Street analysts initially projected earnings growth below 5%, the index is now on pace for an impressive 11% growth rate. This robust showing supports the ongoing bullish trend in the stock market.
""The full-year earnings expectations for both this year and next have already started to turn higher,"" analysts at JPMorgan's wealth management said in a market note on Friday, adding that the market is increasingly differentiating between the winners and losers of the Trump trade war.
Additionally, the market is now figuring out and pricing in which companies are getting hit most by U.S. tariffs. So far, it looks like mega corporations will be just fine. This could bolster the case for further positive sentiment in the markets.
JPMorgan analysts explained that consumer-facing and smaller companies with restrained bargaining power against their trading partners and rigid supply chains are facing a stagnant earnings outlook.
This ties to JPMorgan's last catalyst: Trump's tariff bark is proving worse than its bite for large firms, which are managing to secure exemptions and even turn the tariff policies, aimed at sparking a manufacturing boom, into a tailwind.",50691f075b2fb48a511baa3f9b42a123,trafilatura,2594,0

The better-for-you bakery business gained a listing in Canada this year following a reverse takeover of Hakken Capital Corp. and is now preparing to take its gluten-free pitta bread into the US market with an expected launch in September.
Eshbal has also signed letters of intent (LOI) this year to acquire two US bakery brands – Dare to be Different Foods and Gluten Free Nation. It plans to use those companies to market their existing product lines but also to serve as a conduit for the sale and distribution of its own brands.
More acquisitions are likely on the cards to foster Eshbal’s growth in North America, CEO Tomer Bar Meir told Just Food. However, there are no plans to enter other regions or markets right now with the focus on North America through local manufacturing and domestic production in Israel.
“Once we can complete both any of the M&As they will immediately give us local revenues. It's not only the acquired revenues from the company purchased but we will also be able to add the products that we want from Israel through these companies into the market,” he said.
“That's what we hope to do. Regardless of what M&A will close, and how fast, I can promise you, we'll have more LOIs in the future, hopefully the near future.”
Eshbal’s revenues are currently generated from the standalone business in Israel but will also soon reflect the contribution from Swonder Bread, a local company acquired in June.
Revenues last year were the equivalent of $11.5m and are expected to reach $12.5m to $14m in 2025. Targets have been set for $19-22m in 2026 and $31-35m the following year, according to a presentation.
The first results as a listed company in Canada – for the second quarter – are due to be submitted at the end of August, Meir said.
Eshbal has no plans as yet to establish its own manufacturing facility in North America and will instead use co-manufacturing partners.
“We are working not with one co-producer but with a few. There's one that we like the most at the moment that suits our needs, which is in Miami [for pitta bread],” he said.
“Our focus is in North America, although we had a small opportunity in Mexico but we decided that it takes us out of the focus.
“We had a lot of debate on what to do - US production, selling to the US and Canada, or maybe do Canadian production because of the currency ratio, and then exporting to the US. But then Trump and tariffs, so everything is very fluid.”",a27c60cc26579d3a6c4c6b0beeebab3c,trafilatura,2590,0

The automotive company recorded a net profit of Rs40.03bn ($456m) for the first quarter (Q1) of the FY2026 (quarter ended 30 June), which is a 62% decrease from the Rs105.87bn ($1.2bn) reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.
The company's consolidated revenue from operations also saw a dip, falling to Rs1.03tn in Q1 FY26, a 2.9% decline from Rs 1.06tn in the same quarter of the previous year.
In response to these challenges, Tata Motors is concentrating on reinforcing the core aspects of its business and lessening the impact of tariffs by capitalising on brand strength and improving margins through targeted measures.
Tata Motors Group chief financial officer PB Balaji said: “As tariff clarity emerges and festive demand picks up, we are aiming to accelerate performance and rebuild momentum across the portfolio.
“Against the backdrop of the upcoming demerger in October 2025, our focus remains firmly on delivering a strong second half performance.”
JLR reported a revenue of £6.6bn ($8.84bn) for Q1 FY26, a reduction of 9.2% year-on-year.
The decline was attributed to new US trade tariffs and the planned phase-out of legacy Jaguar ICE models ahead of a relaunch for Jaguar as an all-electric brand in 2026.
JLR's profit before tax plummeted by 49.4% to £351m, adversely affected by the US tariffs and foreign exchange headwinds.
The company is focusing on strengthening business fundamentals to mitigate the impact of tariffs and improve contribution margins.
JLR reported a 10.7% year-on-year decline in wholesale volumes for Q1 of FY26.
The announcement of these financial results comes shortly after JLR's CEO, Adrian Mardell, left the company.
Mardell said: “Looking ahead, we remain focused on delivering our transformational Reimagine Strategy, including investing £3.8 billion this financial year to support the development of our next-generation vehicles, including our stunning new electric Range Rover and Jaguar models.”
The commercial vehicle (CV) segment's revenue decreased by 4.7% to Rs170.09bn, while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) margins improved to 12.2%.
In the CVsegment, wholesale volumes decreased by 6%, with domestic volumes down by 9% year-on-year. However, exports saw a significant increase of 68%.
The passenger vehicle (PV) segment experienced an 8.2% revenue drop to Rs108.77bn, with EBITDA falling to 4%.",e33d8524eef2bed9eb272602188bddf7,trafilatura,2586,0

A 30% plunge in Monday.com Ltd. (MNDY) shares grabbed investor attention in Europe on Tuesday, with some analysts saying the drop reflected concerns over the long-term competitive threat of AI as much as results that failed to meet higher investor expectations.
Such worries fueled big losses across the sector. SAP SE — Europe’s biggest company by market value — dropped as much as 7.1% in Frankfurt, erasing almost €22 billion ($26 billion) at the session low. Smaller peers like Sage Group Plc and Dassault Systemes SE also slid in Tuesday trading.
Fears are growing that incumbent software makers may be at risk of heightened competition, if AI tools now allow applications to be made more quickly and at a much lower cost. Earlier this month, OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman warned that the sector could enter a “fast fashion era very soon” in terms of AI enabling cheaper, rapid production.
“Software valuations remain under pressure from the ‘death of software due to AI’ narrative, which likely drives continued volatility in the short term,” RBC Capital Markets analysts led by Matthew Hedberg wrote in a note on Tuesday.
Software is among the weakest performers within tech this year, with shares of Salesforce Inc (CRM). down more than 30% and Adobe down by about 25%. A basket of software stocks is trading near the lowest levels since January versus a group of semiconductor shares.
The worry has also spread to companies that offer research insights and IT consultancy services, such as Gartner Inc (IT), which reduced its full-year outlook last week. While the firm cited factors like tariffs and government budget cuts, analysts said the weak result exacerbated concerns over competition from AI research tools.
Still, some see buying opportunities following the rapid price drops. Morgan Stanley analyst Josh Baer raised his rating on Monday.com to overweight on Tuesday, saying the stock’s pullback “more than incorporates” risks of AI disrupting search advertising and performance marketing.
“Investors are fearing that AI is going to eat software and multiples are going to fall apart,” Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said in a CNBC interview on Monday. “I think the fear is overblown, but nevertheless we are living through a period right now where investors just really don’t care about the group.”

The Fronted Master Builders Risk (MBR) solution has already supported more than $80bn in insurable values, the company said.
The newly unveiled solution provides a unified policy framework that encompasses claims handling, risk engineering services and the integration of multinational coverage.
The structure will facilitate the management of insurance coverage across different regions and timelines, streamlining the process for both brokers and clients.
The solution is tailored for owners and contractors overseeing projects valued at more than $250m and is suitable for both domestic and international projects, the insurer added.
The solution offers multi-year terms and global coverage for project bidding and forecasting, with simplified claims administration through a single point of contact.
An important advancement within Zurich's offering is the automation of the formerly manual project enrollment process.
The company's team has developed a technology-driven workflow that improves the efficiency of integrating multinational coverage, calculating premiums and generating documents.
Zurich North America head of construction property Patrick McBride said: ""We began developing this at the request of an e-commerce company for one of the largest MBR programmes ever created.
""Since its initial introduction, we have rapidly scaled Zurich's Fronted MBR solution into a global offering, based on demand. Brokers and customers immediately grasped the benefits. The enthusiasm we are seeing tells us we are addressing a real need in the market.""
Zurich Insurance Group reported net income attributable to shareholders after tax of $3.06bn (SFr2.48bn) for the first half of 2025, a 1% increase from the previous year.
The company also witnessed 6% growth in its group business operating profit to $4.2bn for the period ending 30 June 2025.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -The owners of aland Health Holding, a China-based global nutritional supplement maker, are seeking to sell their combined controlling stake, targeting a valuation of more than $1.5 billion, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Founder and chairman Chang Liang holds around 60% of the company, with the remaining shares held by investment firms including Affinity Equity Partners, Goldman Sachs Growth Equity and Henderson Investment Corp, the sources said.
The company, which is on track to generate about $150 million in annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) this year, has attracted preliminary interest from strategic buyers and private equity firms, one of the sources said.
Aland's U.S. footprint, driven by its subsidiary International Vitamin Corporation (IVC), is a major draw for potential bidders seeking to expand domestic production and capitalise on surging global demand for wellness and nutritional products, the source added.
Plans to sell aland are still in the early stages without any fixed deadline yet for inviting non-binding bids from prospective bidders, both sources said. Both sources declined to be named as the matter is private.
Aland did not respond to requests seeking comment.
Affinity, Goldman and Henderson declined to comment.
The global nutritional supplements market, valued at $485.6 billion in 2024, is forecast to reach $704.3 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual rate of 6.4%, according to Grand View Research.
The potential deal, details of which have not been previously reported, comes amid a strategic reset of global supply chains, driven in part by U.S. efforts to bring manufacturing and employment back to the United States.
Founded in China in 1998, aland has grown into a multinational player with more than 5,000 employees, 11 manufacturing sites and four international research and development centers in Asia, North America and Europe, according to its website.
Through IVC, the company operates manufacturing facilities in the U.S., including major sites in South Carolina that it acquired from GNC in 2019, its website showed.
Chang has been instrumental in aland's international expansion, including its acquisition and integration of IVC, and growing aland into a major global nutraceutical company, according to multiple Chinese domestic news reports.
Aland produces and sells worldwide more than 30 billion tablets, 9 billion softgels, 6 billion capsules and 16,000 metric tons of powder annually, its website said.",415ab2f61079fcd2acc60088f617f66b,trafilatura,2575,0

Faced with pressure from stakeholders and competitors, many companies have pushed forward with slashing positions that they believe the tech is capable of handling. Last week, telecommunications firm Altice cut 1,000 employees, or 16% of its workforce, with AI creating redundancies among some jobs as the company cut costs.
READ ALSO: How the AI Talent War is Worsening an Ethical Dilemma and ‘SaaS Sprawl’ Heightens Data Security Risks for Enterprises
Altice’s decision is far from singular. Major firms like Klarna, UPS, Duolingo and Cisco have used AI to replace workers. Though the tech comes with its fair share of risks, companies are leveraging it to reduce labor costs, increase productivity and garner returns on their investments in the tech.
Some may be feeling the squeeze of stakeholder scrutiny and competitive pressure, said Lisa Highfield, principal director of research and advisory services at HR research firm McLean & Co.
“When we see headlines such as 100 jobs laid off because of AI capabilities, competitors are bound to pay attention to that, and they don’t want to fall behind that curve,” Highfield said.
Questions remain, however, about whether AI is ready to become a member of the team rather than simply a tool. Highfield says it depends on the job and its specific tasks:
-
Jobs involving “repetitive, low-complexity knowledge tasks,” such as answering frequently asked questions, summarizing, entering data and scheduling, will likely be the first to go. Assistant and clerk positions, for example, may have a “high exposure rate” to AI.
-
Additionally, anything with “clear rules and delineated answers,” such as writing templates or coding, is also ripe for automation.
-
Many positions may have bits and pieces of their jobs automated, but “not necessarily the entire job holistically,” said Highfield. “Job security around that is really dependent on how much of your tasks are correlated to AI.”
Enterprises seeking automation need to look within their specific industries and organizations to figure out where it’s a good fit, said Highfield. “We really need to understand how AI applies to our industry and the goals and tasks within an organization.”
Plus, many jobs themselves are in a period of change in the wake of AI. In the same way that lamplighters were replaced with electricians and mathematicians no longer need to do long division by hand, new opportunities will be revealed as others fade. “It’s not just cutting jobs, it’s what jobs are we creating,” said Highfield.",b2938e8c895cae6367cd03e607fbc02d,trafilatura,2570,0

-
Citigroup is one of the largest U.S. banks, with a diversified business.
-
The bank was hard hit during the Great Recession but is now in much better shape.
-
Wall Street isn't ignoring its success.
Citigroup (NYSE: C) did not distinguish itself during the Great Recession. It got caught up in the housing crisis, ending up cutting its dividend and taking a government bailout.
A lot has changed since that nadir, but is this iconic bank worth buying right now? That's not exactly clear.
Citigroup gets back on track
After the business struggled through the recessionary period between 2007 and 2009, management had to make some big changes. It wasn't a pretty period for the company or for its shareholders.
In fact, the stock remains down about 80% from its highs before the Great Recession. The dividend, which is growing again, is nowhere near where it was before the cut.
So it wouldn't be shocking for investors to think there's a long-term opportunity here for Citigroup to regain its former glory. Only it isn't the same bank it was before the Great Recession. In fact, it has been focused on simplification, with a core goal of reducing risk.
That's not to suggest that the business isn't large and diverse; it's still both. But the fall from grace left management with a more conservative bias.
Citigroup is more boring and more reliable today
Compared to 2007, Citigroup is kind of a boring bank right now. That's not bad, but it changes the perspective a little for investors. So, why did the stock rally more than 60% during the past 12 months? The dividend yield, while still attractive compared to the broader market, has fallen from 3.7% to a bit more than 2.6%.
Part of the answer is that the bank's financial performance has improved materially during the past year. For example, revenue rose 8% year over year in the second quarter of 2025, while net income jumped 25%. That's not bad, and it is reasonable for investors to be excited about that.
However, there's a caveat. Between the first and second quarters of 2025, the bank's performance was much less exciting. Revenue was little changed, and net income fell roughly 1%. That's not terrible, per se, but it certainly isn't as exciting as the year-over-year performance.
And now, consider some traditional valuation metrics. Citigroup's price-to-sales, price-to-earnings, and price-to-book-value (P/B) ratios are all above their five-year averages. In fact, they are materially above their long-term figures, highlighted by the P/B ratio of 0.85 versus a five-year average of 0.6.",9c945413a64dddf51b4d137c8c40631e,trafilatura,2568,0

After cutting its debt by converting $795 million to equity during restructuring, Spirit has tried to attract bookings by marketing more upscale products and looking for new ways to lower costs. Late last month, the airline announced plans to furlough 270 more pilots this fall.
""However, the Company has continued to be affected by adverse market conditions, including elevated domestic capacity and continued weak demand for domestic leisure travel in the second quarter of 2025, resulting in a challenging pricing environment,"" the company said in its quarterly report late Monday.
Bookings this year for domestic flights have come in lower than what airlines had hoped at the start of 2025.
As its financial results aren't improving at the same pace creditors agreements require, Spirit will need additional cash. Failing to do so could result in defaults. The carrier is looking at selling some aircraft, real estate or access to airport gates, it said.
""Because of the uncertainty of successfully completing the initiatives to comply with the minimum liquidity covenants and of the outcome of discussions with Company stakeholders, management has concluded there is substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months from the date these financial statements are issued,"" it said in the filing.
The carrier said its credit card processor is seeking more collateral to renew its processing agreement, which expires on Dec. 31.
CEO Dave Davis on Tuesday expressed confidence to the airline's staff about Spirit's changes, like rethinking unprofitable flying and growing in stronger markets.
In a memo to employees, which was seen bc CNBC, Davis said the going concern warning ""is a phrase required by our outside auditors to convey that there is risk if we do not make changes. But, we are.""
Spirit's bankruptcy last November was the first for a major U.S. airline since 2011.
Known for its bright yellow planes, Spirit was a budget airline pioneer in the U.S., but struggled in the wake of a failed acquisition by JetBlue Airways last year, shifting consumer tastes to more upmarket products and an engine recall that grounded many of its airplanes. Post-pandemic travel trends, including a surge in international trips and more upscale seats, have been particularly punishing for budget airlines that are largely focused on U.S. travel.",e670cdd9a4059a1279d7e84b920208cb,trafilatura,2566,0

The proceeds are intended for the financing of a new liquefaction plant at NextDecade’s Rio Grande LNG export project in Texas.
This funding marks a significant step towards the final investment decision (FID) for the export facility’s Train 4, which will have a capacity of 5.4 million tonnes per annum (mtpa).
The company is currently awaiting a final order from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which has completed the environmental impact statement (EIS) and recommended the project's advancement.
NextDecade expects to receive the final order by 20 November.
TotalEnergies is set to invest around $300m for a 10% stake in the Train 4 joint venture, while a GIP affiliate will contribute up to $1.5bn for a 50% interest, which will be reduced to 30% once certain returns are achieved.
NextDecade, through its subsidiaries, will invest up to $1.2bn for a 40% interest, potentially increasing to 60% following GIP's receipt of agreed returns.
Despite TotalEnergies' commitment to purchase 1.5 million tonnes of LNG from Train 4, the company has opted not to invest in or sign a long-term contract for NextDecade's proposed Train 5 facility.
NextDecade has also secured a fixed-price construction contract with Bechtel for Train 4, totalling $4.77bn, with the price guaranteed until 15 September.
The Rio Grande LNG project, with an initial capacity of 17.6mtpa, will be expanded by developing Trains 4 and 5, adding a combined capacity of 10.8mtpa.
These developments aim to maintain the US' position as the world's largest LNG exporter.
Additionally, NextDecade’s subsidiaries have updated the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract with Bechtel Energy for Train 4 and signed a new EPC agreement for Train 5, both at the site in Brownsville, Texas.

-
EPR Properties has rebounded nicely since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, outperforming the S&P 500.
-
The experiential property REIT trades at a low valuation of less than 11 times FFO.
-
If interest rates start to fall, it could create an exponentially better growth environment.
EPR Properties (NYSE: EPR) is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, that focuses exclusively on experiential properties. In its portfolio of more than 300 properties are movie theaters, ""eat and play"" properties, waterparks, ski resorts, and much more.
As you might expect, EPR got crushed when the COVID-19 pandemic started. After all, this is a REIT full of properties that require people to physically go to places, and for a while, that simply wasn't a thing in the United States. And when it comes to the largest property type -- movie theaters -- it took years for a return to normality.
However, EPR rebounded nicely once its tenants were gradually allowed to reopen and an end to the era of social distancing was in sight. One of its largest tenants filed for bankruptcy protection in the wake of the shutdowns, but the matter was resolved in a favorable way. In a nutshell, EPR's business is performing quite well. Over the past five years, EPR has outperformed the total return of the S&P 500 by about 50 percentage points.
1 big reason to buy EPR Properties now
After a recent pullback, EPR trades for a low valuation of 10.8 times its full-year FFO (funds from operations) guidance, which is the real estate equivalent of earnings. The company has a 6.4% dividend yield that is paid to investors in monthly installments.
To be fair, there are some good reasons for the cheap valuation, such as ongoing movie theater uncertainty. But the main reason is the persistently high-interest rate environment. Elevated interest rates put downward pressure on commercial property valuations and also make borrowing money to acquire properties more expensive.
However, this could also mean that EPR Properties is a bit of a coiled spring. Management sees a $100 billion investable market opportunity, and as cost of capital improves, it could create a dramatically stronger growth environment for this REIT.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Shares in Orsted plunged to a record low on Monday as the wind farm developer asked shareholders for $9.4 billion to help fund a U.S. project, after potential partners were put off by U.S. President Donald Trump's hostility to wind power.
The 60 billion crowns ($9.4 billion) rights issue is worth around half of the Danish company's market value as of Friday's close.
Struggling in recent years with soaring inflation and logistical problems that sent costs soaring, the offshore wind industry faced a further setback when Trump suspended licensing on his first day back in office in January.
""Orsted and our industry are in an extraordinary situation with the adverse market development in the U.S. on top of the past years’ macroeconomic and supply chain challenges,"" said CEO Rasmus Errboe.
Trump campaigned on a promise to end the offshore wind industry, saying it is too expensive and hurts whales and birds.
Orsted said two-thirds of the new capital would be used to fund the construction of Sunrise Wind - one of its two remaining projects under development off the U.S. East Coast.
Potential co-investors for the project pulled out after Trump's administration in April ordered Equinor to halt the development of a neighbouring fully-permitted wind farm. The order, which sent shockwaves through the industry, was reversed the following month, however.
""Following the stop work order on Equinor's Empire Wind project, the perceived risks of the U.S. offshore wind market among investors and banks increased significantly,"" Errboe said.
Orsted depends on selling full or partial stakes in its offshore wind farms to finance new projects. Errboe, who replaced former CEO Mads Nipper earlier this year, has sought to cut costs and cancelled projects in the U.S. and Britain.
The rest of the expected proceeds from the rights issue would strengthen Orsted's finances and help it develop the 8.1 gigawatts of offshore wind projects currently under construction by 2027, the company said.
Orsted shares lost nearly one-third of their value to hit a record low. At 1327 GMT, they were down 31.2% at 212 crowns.
""The U.S. offshore wind market was crippled after Trump took office. But things started going badly for Orsted before Trump,"" said Sydbank analyst Jakob Pedersen.
'THE ONLY OPTION'
Orsted has, in recent years, scrapped some U.S. projects and booked hefty impairments due to supply chain delays, inflation and shifting subsidy policies in the nascent U.S. offshore wind market.",8ba5034672159fcb9af6c967bccd8eb7,trafilatura,2557,0

Tesla Is Axing Its Dojo Supercomputer Plans. What Does That Mean for TSLA Stock Here?
BitMine Immersion first announced its crypto strategy in late June. At the time of writing, BMNR shares are trading at about 13x their price in the final week of June.
Why Ether Strategy Is Working Out for BMNR Stock
BitMine Immersion has increased its ETH holdings by roughly $2 billion within a week because Ethereum “is having its Bitcoin 2017 moment” according to Tom Lee, the company’s chairman.
Note that Bitcoin (BTCUSD) has experienced a 120x rally since 2017. In a recent CNBC interview, Lee argued Ether even has a path to $30,000 now that the “GENIUS Act” has been signed into law.
That’s because the aforementioned legislation essentially greenlights stablecoins, but they need a blockchain capable of facilitating smart contract, i.e., Ethereum, to function.
Note that globally renowned names like JPMorgan (JPM) and Robinhood (HOOD) are already using the Ethereum blockchain to realize their stablecoin and tokenization commitments in 2025.
Together, these developments suggest owning BMNR shares could indeed prove a lucrative bet in the long run.
Why Bitmine Immersion Shares Are an Attractive Buy
BMNR shares are an attractive pick also because the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is now embracing the blockchain under its so-called Project Crypto.
“Ethereum is the preferred choice because it’s had zero downtime since inception – it’s the most legally compliant and secure blockchain,” Lee told CNBC in a recent interview.
The aforementioned narrative has made influential investor Cathie Wood load up on BMNR stock in recent weeks. The Ark Innovation ETF (ARKW) alone currently holds nearly $50 million worth of BitMine Immersion stock.

""I think that the market's going to have to come to grips with the Fed is going to cut rates, and is it going to be the right move for the Fed to make now?"" Jim Bianco of Bianco Research said on Opening Bid.
July's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed core inflation rose 0.3%, the largest increase in six months.
""Last year they cut rates, and the market decided it wasn't the right move,"" Bianco added. ""And it shot yields on the 10 [year Treasury] and the 30-year up over 100 basis points.""
Bianco said the real inflationary pressure is building due to Trump's tariffs, and the impact could be significant. While some of the costs may be eaten by exporters or corporations, others will be passed on via price hikes.
""There's about an extra $250 to $300 billion of tariffs that are going to be collected over the next year ... tariffs were running around $8 billion a month. Now they're running nearly $30 billion a month,"" he noted.
Bianco expects Fed Chair Jerome Powell to provide some clarity at the Fed's annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium later this month. And if Powell signals a September cut isn't coming, the backlash could be intense — including renewed political pressure from President Trump, who has previously floated the idea of firing the Fed chair.
""If he says he's not going to cut rates, I would then put Trump firing him back into the play,"" Bianco said.
The Fed's decision could also have an outsized impact on megacap tech stocks. The largest 10% of US companies now account for 76% of total market capitalization, the highest concentration on record, according to market data platform Barchart.
The concentration makes the entire market vulnerable to shifts in interest rates. As yields go higher, money could move out of stocks and into bonds. Bianco warned that if 10-year Treasury yields hit 5%, it could trigger profit-taking in Big Tech stocks.
Bianco advised investors to stay cautious when chasing the market's most popular names. ""If you want to play some of these Mag 7s, you have to be prepared for big gains and big losses,"" he said. ""Some think it's all a one-way street ... until it isn't.""

Dive Brief:
-
SetPoint Medical said Monday that it raised $140 million to fund commercialization of its neuromodulation system to treat rheumatoid arthritis in a financing that included contributions from Abbott and Boston Scientific.
-
SetPoint’s implantable device received Food and Drug Administration approval in July as a treatment option for people who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, biologic or targeted drug therapies.
-
CEO Murthy Simhambhatla said SetPoint plans to introduce the system in some U.S. cities this year, with an expanded rollout across the country to follow beginning in early 2026.
Dive Insight:
SetPoint’s device, which is implanted in the neck, delivers once-a-day electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve to activate the body’s anti-inflammatory pathways.
Development of the system was built on research by Kevin Tracey at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Northwell Health’s research arm, demonstrating the role of the vagus nerve in controlling inflammation. Tracey founded SetPoint in 2007.
The FDA approved SetPoint’s device with support from the 242-patient REST-RA clinical trial, which showed safety and effectiveness.
Simhambhatla has said SetPoint will work with providers and payers to make the treatment accessible to their patients. To prepare for commercialization, SetPoint said it named Erik Styacich, former vice president of sales for neuromodulation company Valencia Technologies, as vice president of sales and Spencer Bailey as vice president of market access and reimbursement. Bailey held similar roles at other neuromodulation companies, including MicroTransponder.
SetPoint said the $140 million in private funding included $25 million in a second tranche of its Series C round and $115 million in its Series D financing led by Elevage Medical Technologies and Ally Bridge Group. The company said Josh Makower joined its board of directors as a representative of Elevage, and Kevin Reilly, managing director and head of medtech investments at Ally Bridge, also joined the board.
New investors Northwell Health, SPRIG Equity and an undisclosed strategic investor also participated in the Series D financing. Returning investors included Abbott, Boston Scientific and several others.
SetPoint plans to evaluate the technology for other autoimmune conditions, including multiple sclerosis and Crohn’s disease.

The lawsuit, filed last month in Ohio, alleges that Owens Corning's subsidiary Paroc sold products that were misrepresented and posed a safety risk, affecting several ships.
Fincantieri was compelled to suspend ship deliveries following the recall of faulty panels by Owens Corning and Paroc ""to prevent potentially serious injury or death resulting from the sale and use of a defective and unsafe line of stone wool insulation products.""
The issue came to light when the launch of MSC's Explora I was delayed due to a safety hazard. The delivery, initially scheduled for 29 June 2023, was postponed by 21 days, with subsequent ships also facing postponements.
The faulty panels, which were supposed to provide 60 minutes of fire resistance as per EU law, were found to be non-compliant following a retest.
Fincantieri's complaint details that Paroc, supported by Owens Corning, obtained initial safety certifications through fraudulent means.
The Danish maritime authorities' tests in 2023 revealed that the panels could only withstand flames for 45 minutes, leading to the loss of certifications.
The ramifications for Fincantieri extended to another ten ships, including military vessels, some of which were already operational.
The shipbuilder also noted that Owens Corning failed to provide guidance on rectifying the issue for ships already in service, despite an independent risk assessment indicating a “high risk for safety on board the ships.”
The necessary replacements have resulted in penalties and further financial losses, according to the complaint.
Fincantieri's complaint also highlights the extensive economic damages and the severe impact on its industry reputation due to the product recall.
Fincantieri was quoted as saying in the complaint: “In addition to causing over $100m in economic damages, the product safety recall has caused Fincantieri to bear the brunt of considerable harm to its reputation and goodwill in the industry making headlines in the Financial Times and elsewhere after launches of new cruise ships that had already been booked [by customers] had to be delayed.”
While Fincantieri has declined to comment on the ongoing case, Owens Corning acknowledged the legal proceedings involving Paroc but refrained from commenting on the pending litigation.",4b1b2e28f871f3642b1099362b213bb3,trafilatura,2532,0

In a recent Market on Close discussion, hosts John Rowland and “Twitter Tom” debated whether we’re on the verge of a pullback, or if the rally still has legs.
Here’s what they’re seeing in the data:
More News from Barchart
1. Sector Momentum is Flashing Divergence
The S&P 500 Tech Sector ETF (XLK) Relative Strength Index (RSI) is above 60, signaling strong momentum.
On the other hand, the S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) RSI is moving lower, beneath 50, suggesting broader market participation is more subdued.
Historically, this setup has appeared six times since 2006. In five of those cases, the market saw a 10% or greater correction shortly after.
2. A Contrarian Take
Tom sees the widespread expectation of an August pullback as a reason to be cautious about betting against the market. If “everyone” is bracing for a drop, markets sometimes do the opposite.
John, however, leans on the historical data — which currently tilts toward a downside move — and says this divergence between tech leadership and equal-weight performance shouldn’t be ignored.
3. Options Traders Are Getting Bearish
The put/call ratio on the SPY ETF is climbing, meaning more traders are buying puts (bearish bets) than calls.
For this week’s monthly August options expiration, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) put/call ratio is above 4.0 — meaning there are four times as many puts in open interest as calls. That’s a rare level of bearish positioning and can sometimes precede sharp moves.
What’s at Stake?
Some analysts point to valuation extremes that now surpass the late-90s tech boom. Others note macro risks — tariffs, stagflation concerns, and global uncertainty — that could act as catalysts for a correction.
But for now, the market is balancing two narratives:
-
The Bear Case: Overbought tech, narrowing breadth, and rising bearish options positioning could trigger a correction.
-
The Bull Case: Strong large-cap leadership, resilient earnings, and contrarian sentiment might keep the rally alive.

The announcement came on the heels of the company's first-ever earnings report since its blockbuster public debut, which showed better-than-expected revenue during the quarter.
In an SEC filing, the stablecoin issuer said it is offering 2 million shares of Class A common stock and 8 million shares by existing stockholders.
In day trading, Circle shares closed north of $163 per share, or more than 1% higher, after the company's second quarter total revenue came in at $658 million, versus the $647 million analysts expected.
CEO Jeremy Allaire said the company's stablecoin, USDC (USDC-USD), was the ""fastest-growing major stablecoin over the past year.""
USDC in circulation grew 90% year over year to $61.3 billion at quarter end and has grown an additional 6.4% to $65.2 billion as of Aug. 10.
""Overall activity globally in the digital asset economy has been growing,"" Allaire told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday morning.
""We're continuing to see growth in the use of dollar digital currencies like USDC as a store of value around the world in cross-border settlements,"" he added. ""Use cases continue to expand, and I think people are finding that this is an incredibly high utility, new form of money.""
The company also announced ARC, a new blockchain network for stablecoin finance that will launch in the second half of the year.
""We wanted to create a way for institutions to pay fees on blockchains in a fast, predictable manner that would be simple from an accounting perspective and could deliver very low-cost and stable fees,"" Allaire said during the company's earnings call on Tuesday morning.
Circle, which went public on June 5, has been at the center of optimism over the stablecoin market following the passage of the GENIUS Act, legislation that creates guardrails and a framework for digital tokens backed by assets such as the US dollar.

Circle makes much of its money from interest income, specifically from short-term Treasury bills backing its stablecoin, USDC.
The company's reserve income increased 50% year over year to $634 million, primarily from an 86% growth in USDC stablecoin circulation.
Allaire indicated that if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates and yields on short-term Treasurys decline, the growth of stablecoins will offset the decline in rates.",e0b18442df64ba044ff06937d669a333,trafilatura,2517,0

The patented technology comprises an imaging device and a processing unit that collaborate to capture, analyse, and prioritise visual information from a forward-facing camera attached to a train or locomotive.
The imaging device gathers multiple datasets from image frames over several handling cycles, while the processing unit determines a specific region of interest based on the data collected.
This system can obtain partial datasets from the SROI during the remaining time within those cycles, thus facilitating higher sampling rates in critical areas.
Mounted on the locomotive, the processing unit features a tracking module that identifies the rails, establishes margins on either side, computes a safe braking line according to the train's braking distance, and defines a safe zone.
The SROI is located at the far end of this safe zone within the image frames, allowing for early detection and response to potential hazards.
Rail Vision CEO David BenDavid said: “Securing this European patent is another strong validation of Rail Vision’s innovation.
“By boosting the sampling rate, we’re enabling train operators to detect hazards sooner, react faster, and improve functional efficiency to operate more safely.
“This technology is another step toward our vision of making railway transportation safer, smarter, and more efficient worldwide.”
In January this year, Rail Vision entered the Indian market by signing a binding memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Sujan Ventures, a part of the Sujan Group.
This agreement is intended for the installation of Rail Vision's advanced safety systems across India's locomotive fleet, comprising around 15,000 units.

Bed Bath & Beyond has returned to brick-and-mortar retail. The company has launched Bed Bath & Beyond Home in Nashville, Tenn. If the store proves successful, four more locations could open by end of year.
Bed Bath & Beyond is proving to be a company that just won’t go away.
The retailer, which filed for bankruptcy in 2023 and shut down all of its stores, is now celebrating its return to the brick-and-mortar world with a tweak to the name. Bed Bath & Beyond Home opened its doors in Nashville, Tenn. last Friday.
That store will serve as a test location, according to the owner of the Bed Bath & Beyond brand. If it’s successful, another four locations could be open before the end of the year.
“We’re proud to reintroduce one of retail’s most iconic names with the launch of Bed Bath & Beyond Home,” said Amy Sullivan, CEO of The Brand House Collective, which owns the brand now. “This isn’t just a store, it’s a fresh start for a brand that means something special to so many families. With Bed Bath & Beyond Home we’re delivering on our mission to offer great brands, for any budget, in every room. It’s a powerful addition to our portfolio and a meaningful step forward in our transformation.”
While all 360 of the store’s original locations closed with the bankruptcy filing, Bed Bath & Beyond didn’t stay dead for long. Overstock (which is part of The Brand House Collective) bought the brand’s intellectual property from the bankruptcy courts and rebranded its flagship site as Bed Bath & Beyond (and revived the company’s website).
Bed Bath & Beyond was, for a while, a favorite of meme stock traders. In July 2022, shares soared 365% after a filing revealed activist investor Ryan Cohen’s RC Ventures fund was maintaining its holding in the company, with a prediction shares would hit $80 per share. Cohen, founder of Chewy and chairman of other meme stock favorite GameStop, suddenly reversed course in August, though, dumping his entire holdings, more than 9.4 million shares. That caused the stock to plunge—and led to calls for an SEC investigation into Cohen, which never materialized.
The company’s real problems, though, came during the pandemic. Bed Bath & Beyond missed out on the wave of shoppers its competitors saw during those times as it was in the midst of a failed overhaul, where it planned to rely more on private brands than products like KitchenAid. Consumers bypassed its offerings, opting for convenience and familiar names.

The U.S. inflation picture delivered a split verdict in July, giving both crypto bulls and bears something to chew on.
Headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.7% year-over-year, coming in slightly cooler than the 2.8% economists had expected.
But Core CPI — which strips out volatile food and energy prices and is closely watched by the Federal Reserve — climbed 3.1%, edging above the 3.0% forecast and suggesting that underlying inflation pressures remain sticky.
CPI data gives mixed signals
The print landed at a sensitive moment for markets, with traders looking for clarity on whether the Fed will move ahead with a long-awaited rate cut in September. Lower interest rates tend to benefit risk assets like Bitcoin, which thrive in a looser monetary environment. Instead, the data muddies the waters, making the Fed’s next step harder to call.
Crypto analysts suggested earlier in the day that a reading at or below 2.8% would provide upwards acceleration, and anything above 3% could lead to a selling reaction.
""If CPI comes in cooler, a rate cut is confirmed for September,"" said crypto Key Opinion Leader Fefe Demeny.
Another leading crypto analyst, Benjamin Cowen, called 2.9% ""somewhat neutral,"" but warns that anything higher would provoke a negative reaction within the markets.
Should CPI be hotter than expected, analysts of crypto derivative exchange Bitunix say they can envision a scenario where Bitcoin can fall below $117,000, which would present a strong case for deeper correction territory.
Join the discussion with Fefe Demeny on Roundtable here.
Whereas, analysts of the cryptocurrency trading platform Bitfinex say that Bitcoin has bounced back from its August low of $112,000 to the $115,800 range floor, thanks to $769 million in ETF inflows over three sessions.
The market is still ""warm but not overheated"" since 70% of short-term holders are still making money, and taking profits is slowing down.
Before the data was released, Bitcoin was trading at $118,468.96, down 1.76% in the past 24 hours, with trading volume slipping 11.97% over the same period.
Soon after CPI data was released, Bitcoin saw a 1% uptick in price, now trading at $119,110.83, as per Kraken.

Romania is now the latest European country to make a big move in the wind energy space, thanks to Danish wind company Vestas.
Eurowind Energy has just recently placed a 143-megawatt order with Vestas for three major wind power projects in Romania, Frumusita, Vector, and Pecineaga Northeast. These installations will feature 23 of Vestas' advanced V162-6.2-megawatt turbines from its EnVentus platform and are expected to be delivered in the second half of 2026.
This move shows Romania's new shift toward renewable energy, driven by grid modernization, regulatory reforms, and upcoming CfD auctions. The country is aiming to boost its energy independence, improve grid stability, and reduce reliance on dirty fuels. This partnership is a major contribution to those goals.
""Frumusita, Vector, and Pecineaga Northeast are very important projects for us,"" said Morten Gaarde, director for EPC at Eurowind Energy, per a new release on Vestas' website. ""We look forward to building on our long-standing relationship with Vestas by realising the projects together.""
With over 1.5 gigawatts of wind power installed or under construction and more than 1.2 gigawatts under service, Vestas is the top wind energy provider in Romania. The company's five service hubs and regional training center support over 550 jobs locally.
Wind farms like these help reduce air pollution, slow the damage of planet-warming gases, and stabilize energy prices for everyday people while strengthening the national grid.
One common criticism of wind energy is its inconsistency. Since wind doesn't blow consistently, it can lead to fluctuations in power supply without adequate storage or backup systems. However, advancements in energy storage technology and smart grid systems are helping to mitigate these fluctuations, making wind energy an increasingly reliable and scalable source of clean power.
""We are proud to partner with Eurowind Energy on this project, and we are grateful for their trust in us,"" said Srdan Cenic, Vestas Mediterranean East general manager, per the release. ""This order demonstrates the strength of our local execution and service expertise, and our ability to deliver the latest wind technology in support of Romania's energy transition.""

Fundamentally, a surprisingly weak U.S. jobs report for July has the majority of the marketplace presently factoring in two Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this year, including one coming in September. That’s bond-market bullish.
A move in December T-Bond futures above chart resistance at the August high of 115 27/32 would give the bulls more power and it would also become a buying opportunity. The upside price objective would be 120 even, or above. Technical support, for which to place a protective sell stop just below, is located at 114 even.
IMPORTANT NOTE: I am not a futures broker and do not manage any trading accounts other than my own personal account. It is my goal to point out to you potential trading opportunities. However, it is up to you to: (1) decide when and if you want to initiate any trades and (2) determine the size of any trades you may initiate. Any trades I discuss are hypothetical in nature.
Here is what the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has said about futures trading (and I agree 100%):
Trading commodity futures and options is not for everyone. IT IS A VOLATILE, COMPLEX AND RISKY BUSINESS. Before you invest any money in futures or options contracts, you should consider your financial experience, goals and financial resources, and know how much you can afford to lose above and beyond your initial payment to a broker. You should understand commodity futures and options contracts and your obligations in entering into those contracts. You should understand your exposure to risk and other aspects of trading by thoroughly reviewing the risk disclosure documents your broker is required to give you.

In a press release on Monday, ALT5 Sigma announced that it would sell a combination of 200 million new and existing shares and use the proceeds to buy the Trump family token.
The move represents an effort by the Trump family to capitalize on a recent trend of using either small publicly traded or blank-check companies to let a broader swath of traders gain exposure to cryptocurrencies.
The strategy was first popularized by Michael Saylor, who renamed his decades-old software company MicroStrategy to Strategy as he transformed it into a Bitcoin behemoth. He and company executives began adding billions of dollars in Bitcoin to the balance sheet for the firm, which prompted traders to see the company’s stock as a proxy for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Strategy’s market capitalization soon soared along with Bitcoin’s rise.
Now, a flood of other copycats have entered the market. In addition to Bitcoin, there are treasury companies for cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Sui, Ethena, and now WLFI. All pitch their companies’ stock as a proxy for the cryptocurrencies they hold and a way for traditional investors to gain exposure to crypto.
“One small step for mankind, one giant leap for WLFI,” said the X account for World Liberty Financial, announcing the raise.
Zach Witkoff, CEO of World Liberty and son of President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, will become chairman of the board of directors at ALT5 Sigma. Eric Trump, son of the president and cofounder of World Liberty, will also join the board, and Zak Folkman, the crypto company’s COO, will become a board observer.
World Liberty was the lead investor in the raise. Other investors weren’t disclosed. A spokesperson for World Liberty Financial declined to comment.
World Liberty Financial’s move into the public markets is the Trump family’s latest expansion of its crypto empire. President Trump and first lady Melania Trump have their own memecoins. Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. have not only backed World Liberty but also spun up their own Bitcoin mining firm.
And Trump Media & Technology Group, the publicly traded company that encompasses Trump’s social media site, Truth Social, has also recently pivoted to crypto and added $2 billion in Bitcoin to its balance sheet.

(Reuters) -Exxon Mobil could invest as much as $21.7 billion in Trinidad and Tobago if the U.S. energy major finds reserves in a large deepwater area it was awarded on Tuesday to explore for oil and gas in the Caribbean country, Energy Minister Roodal Moonilal said.
Moonilal was speaking at an event in Port of Spain where a production-sharing contract was signed with Exxon, marking its return to the country after 20 years.
Reuters reported last week that government had agreed to grant Exxon access to an area equivalent to seven blocks and located northwest of its prolific Stabroek block offshore Guyana.
""What we are awarding today is larger than the surface area of the country,"" Moonilal said.
Exxon and Trinidad's government negotiated the deal in ""record time,"" Exxon's Vice President of global exploration John Ardill said at the signing ceremony, adding that the company wants to use its knowledge about the Caribbean geology and replicate its success in Guyana.
Exxon's initial exploration plan will need a $42 million investment for 3D seismic and up to two exploration wells, Trinidad's officials said. The first well could be drilled after completing seismic, to begin in six months, Ardill added.
An Exxon spokesperson said the company is the operator of the block and holds 100% interest.
An Exxon-led consortium has confirmed more than 11 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas at the neighboring waters of Guyana.
""While this is still frontier exploration, it has great potential in this ultra deepwater area,"" Ardill said, referring to Trinidad.
Trinidad has had some success in deepwater exploration by consortia including companies BHP, Woodside, BP and Shell. Some of the discoveries are advancing to commercial developments, the minister said.
If reserves are confirmed by Exxon, it could move even faster than it did in Guyana to begin output because Trinidad has oil and gas infrastructure in place.
Exxon plans to use its equipment and resources between Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago to expedite exploration, according to Ardill.
Trinidad's Prime Minister Kamla Persad has promised that her country will review fiscal terms to further attract investment for its energy sector.
""Trinidad will not wait for the end of any energy era,"" she said. ""Our principle is simple: investment goes where it is welcomed and stays where it is well treated.""

Although many millennials and Generation Z workers use artificial intelligence tools at work, about half are hesitant to admit how much of their work is created by AI, according to an Aug. 5 report from Cox Business.
Workers said they use AI agents to enhance their workplace productivity by summarizing documents or meeting notes, brainstorming ideas or creative content, analyzing data, creating reports and coding or debugging.
“Our survey highlights valuable insights into how organizations can better align with the expectations of their younger employees,” Jeff Breaux, executive vice president and chief commercial officer for Cox Communications, said in a news release.
“This presents a tremendous opportunity for companies and their IT teams to enhance their strategies around tech investment, rollouts, training and policies; ensuring they meet the evolving needs of a workforce that is rapidly becoming the majority,” Breaux said.
In a survey of more than 1,000 Gen Z and millennial workers in the U.S., 47% said they feared that AI could replace their jobs — a top reason they don’t want to disclose their AI use. In addition, 30% said they’re unfamiliar with their company’s AI policy or their company doesn’t have a defined policy.
More than 60% reported using personal apps or software at work rather than their workplace’s tools, creating a growing “shadow IT” issue that could lead to security risks, the report found.
Nearly 70% of younger workers said they feel overwhelmed by the number of tech tools provided by their workplace. However, only 16% feel they have real influence over tech decisions at work.
In the next three years, Gen Z and millennial workers predict AI tools will replace some job roles but create new opportunities, increase productivity and efficiency, enhance creativity and innovation and improve decision-making and strategic planning. Looking ahead to 2026, Gen Z workers said employers should focus on improving cybersecurity, and millennials said workplaces should focus on workflow optimization.
In another survey, nearly half of Gen Z workers said their bosses don’t appreciate the benefits of AI tools at work, according to a report from UKG. In addition, 90% said AI will save them time at work, and 70% said they’ve taught themselves most of the AI skills they use for their jobs.

The association attributed the market’s strong performance in the last few months to improved availability of new models, following inventory shortages earlier in the year.
In the first seven months of 2025, imported vehicle sales increased by 12% to 165,210 units, from 147,629 units a year earlier, driven by new models – particularly battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and hybrids. Overall demand for new vehicles in South Korea remains sluggish, however, reflecting weak domestic economic growth and high consumer debt. Domestic sales of vehicles produced by the five main local manufacturers increased by just 2.5% to 799,353 units in the seven-month period, underpinned mainly by new models from Hyundai and Kia.
German-owned brands accounted for 62% of total import sales year-to-date, with almost 103,000 units combined, led by BMW with an 8% rise to 44,770 units, while its Mini subsidiary saw its sales decline by 16% to 4,142 units. Together, the two brands accounted for almost 30% of total import sales. Mercedes-Benz saw its sales rise by 8% to 37,047 units, while Volkswagen Group reported a 26% jump to 16,635 units, thanks mainly to strong rebounds by Porsche and Audi.
US EV maker Tesla saw its sales rise by 32% to 26,569 units year-to-date, while Volvo’s sales declined by over 9% to 7,782 units. Toyota’s deliveries fell by less than 2% to 5,279 units, while its Lexus division enjoyed an 19% rise to 8,963 units.
Chinese automaker BYD, which officially entered the market earlier this year, has delivered 1,578 vehicles so far. The company said it aims to have 30 sales outlets operational by the end of the year.

The Reserve Bank of Australia reduced its economic growth forecast for the year to 1.7% from 2.1%, saying that a weaker-than-expected rise in public demand in early 2025 was unlikely to be offset through the rest of the year.
The country's benchmark rates are now at 3.6%, the lowest since April 2023, and in line with expectations of economists polled by Reuters.
The RBA said that inflation had dropped ""substantially"" since the peak in 2022, with steeper interest rates bringing aggregate demand and potential supply ""closer towards balance.""
Australia's S&P/ASX 200 equity index was up about 0.3% after the decision, while the Australian dollar weakened 0.15% to trade at 0.6501 against the greenback.
Inflation in Australia came in at 2.1% in the second quarter, its lowest since March 2021 and near the lower end of the RBA's 2%-3% range.
Tuesday's rate cut comes amid a drastically reshaped trade environment as U.S. tariffs have come into effect, as well as a less-than-expected economic growth in the first quarter.
Australia was hit with the baseline 10% tariff by U.S. President Donald Trump, which the country's trade minister reportedly hailed as a ""vindication"" for the government's negotiations.
The RBA said that the risk of a ""very damaging"" trade war has diminished, and ""recent international trade policy developments have had little discernible impact on the Australian economy to date."" However, it warned that a more material disruption to global trade cannot be ruled out.
The lower GDP growth forecast is owed more to a lower outlook for productivity growth, instead of trade disruptions, the central bank said.
The country's economy grew 1.3% year on year in the first quarter, lower than the estimated 1.5% growth in a Reuters poll. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the economy expanded 0.2%, undershooting expectations for a 0.4% growth.
Katherine Keenan, ABS head of national accounts, attributed the soft growth to shrinking public spending and weakened consumer demand and exports.
Analysts at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia forecast another rate cut in November, and see the possibility of one more in ""early 2026.""
Marcel Thieliant, head of Asia-Pacific at Capital Economics, expects rates to decline to 2.85% by the middle of 2026, based on the RBA's reduced inflation forecast.",e2a6cbfbfe884c6908b003cbd1d7baa0,trafilatura,2464,0

Narrowing the focus, Accenture has also underperformed the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLK) 28.4% gains over the past year and 13.6% surge in 2025.
Accenture stock has remained under pressure in recent months. Its stock prices dropped 6.9% in a single trading session following the release of its Q3 results on Jun. 20. The company’s topline for the quarter increased by a notable 7.7% year-over-year to $17.7 billion, beating Street estimates by 2.6%. Further, growth in earnings and a drop in outstanding shares due to share buybacks led to an impressive 14.8% growth in EPS to $3.49, surpassing the consensus estimates by 5.8%. Moreover, the company also raised its lower band of full-year revenue growth guidance from the prior range of 5% - 6% to 6% - 7% (in local currency).
However, Accenture’s new bookings at the end of Q3 stood at $19.7 billion, down 6% year-over-year in USD terms and down 7% in local currency. This dented investor confidence and led to a selloff.
For the full fiscal 2025, ending in August, analysts expect ACN to deliver an EPS of $12.88, up 7.8% year-over-year. The company has a mixed earnings surprise history. While it surpassed the Street’s bottom-line estimates thrice over the past four quarters, it missed the projections on one other occasion.
The stock has a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating overall. Of the 23 analysts covering the stock, opinions include 15 “Strong Buys,” one “Moderate Buy,” and seven “Holds.”

Arista Networks’ stock prices shot up 17.5% in a single trading session following the release of its impressive Q2 results on Aug. 5.

Musk alleged that the App Store refused to feature both X and Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, in its prominently promoted list of apps. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Musk's claims.
""Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation,"" the billionaire Tesla (TSLA) CEO and owner of Grok creator xAI wrote on X. ""xAI will take immediate legal action.""
""Hey @Apple – App Store, why do you refuse to put either 𝕏 or Grok in your 'Must Have' section when 𝕏 is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps?"" Musk asked in another post, inquiring if Apple's ranking system was used for ""playing politics.""
He added, ""And why is ChatGPT literally in every list where you have editorial control?"" ChatGPT, xAI's rival chatbot, is operated by OpenAI (OPAI.PVT).
Apple entered a collaboration with OpenAI in 2024 that uses OpenAI's technology to fuel Apple's branded Apple Intelligence. The feature allows Apple devices that use its voice command service, Siri, to generate written content and perform device tasks.
Apple's website describes its App Store as ""a highly curated"" store where ""every app is reviewed by experts and an editorial team."" In addition to human oversight, Apple also uses automated tools to affect app discovery and rankings and to moderate user reviews.
Musk has been embroiled in litigation against OpenAI, which he co-founded in 2015 with OpenAI's current CEO, Sam Altman. Originally co-founded as a nonprofit, Musk separated himself from the AI firm over disagreements regarding how to move forward with the venture.
Musk later started his competing AI company, xAI. His lawsuit, which is scheduled for trial in March, seeks to prevent OpenAI's conversion to a for-profit enterprise and centers around a $45 million donation that Musk contributed to fund the startup. He claims that the donation was contingent on OpenAI remaining a nonprofit organization.
Altman contends Musk wanted to merge OpenAI into his for-profit electric vehicle company, Tesla, so that Tesla could provide it with additional funding.",cbf8b7997e56f10dbf59f9b0ed975626,trafilatura,2441,0

Narrowing the focus, Adobe has also lagged behind the industry-focused iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF’s (IGV) 31.4% surge over the past year and 8.2% uptick in 2025.
Adobe’s stock prices dropped 5.3% in the trading session after the release of its mixed Q2 results on Jun. 12. Driven by solid ARR and momentum, the company’s overall topline for the quarter grew 10.6% year-over-year to $5.9 billion, setting a record for Q2 and surpassing Street projections. Meanwhile, its non-GAAP net income increased 7.3% year-over-year to $2.2 billion, and benefiting from share repurchases, its non-GAAP EPS surged by 12.9% to $5.06, beating the consensus estimates.
Despite these impressive figures, investors have been concerned about Adobe’s future growth potential as its remaining performance obligation (RPO), a key indicator of its growth, has remained under pressure. In Q1, its RPO came in at $19.7 billion, which fell short of expectations. Further, its RPO remained steady at $19.7 billion at the end of Q2, making investors jittery. Moreover, investors have also been concerned about the intense competition that Adobe’s products are facing from Gen AI tools.
For the full fiscal 2025, ending in November, analysts expect Adobe to report a non-GAAP EPS of $16.92, up 13.6% year-over-year. The company has a solid earnings surprise history. It has surpassed the Street’s bottom-line estimates in each of the past four quarters.
Among the 34 analysts covering the ADBE stock, the consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on 23 “Strong Buy,” two “Moderate Buy,” eight “Hold,” and one “Strong Sell” rating.",37e994c32f813c285a036e412c02d468,trafilatura,2431,0

What started as a tit-for-tat trade jab has turned into a prolonged gut punch as the tariff developments over the past 129 days, give or take, have injected fresh instability across the textile supply chain, Lenzing’s latest financial report reflected.
More from Sourcing Journal
More specifically, the reciprocal tariffs and retaliations that saw the China-and-U.S. trade collapse also necessitated a reconfiguration of textile and nonwovens value chains, the wood-based cellulosic fiber producer shared in its investor presentation for the first half of 2025. And as far as the group’s textile business is concerned, the first half was “characterized by high volatility.” Despite subdued demand, the first quarter performed largely in line with expectations.
Revenue rose 2.3 percent to 1.34 billion euros ($1.56 billion). Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) jumped 63.3 percent to $313 million, reaching a 20 percent margin. The increase included one-off gains—about $35.6 million from selling surplus EU emission allowances and around $14.6 million from revaluing biological assets.
That said, April’s introduction of these additional U.S. tariffs led to the market environment’s “significant deterioration,” with China hit particularly hard by the measures.
“Due to the extraordinarily high tariffs on Chinese textile imports, several large U.S. retailers canceled their orders with Chinese clothing manufacturers at short notice,” Lenzing’s half year 2025 report reads, though noting that any of the textile sector’s value chains “rapidly shifting” to other procurement markets—such as India or Southeast Asia—was unclear for the reporting period.
“Given the unclear political situation and the hope of an imminent agreement between the USA and China, many U.S. brands adopted a wait-and-see approach,” the report reads.
The Vienna-based supplier’s recovery slowed amid international tariff pressures and ongoing trade uncertainty. Market prices remained at a low level; viscose prices continued to decline in Q2. Prices for dissolving wood pulp—a key input in cellulosic fiber production—fell 18 percent to $800 per ton for the first half of 2025. International cotton prices proved less volatile than the previous year, while prices for polyester staple fibers were 2 percent lower than the previous year.",d6d69c97a98b74a367aaadb5b684b6d3,trafilatura,2411,0

The headline inflation rate fell on the back of declining growth in food prices, to its lowest level since June 2017. Economists polled by Reuters had estimated July inflation at 1.76%.
Food inflation, which is a key component of the consumer price index, came in at -1.76%, lower than the -1.06% print in June.
The inflation reading comes after the Reserve Bank of India held rates at 5.5% in its policy meeting last week. The RBI said that the inflation outlook for the fiscal year ending March 2026 ""has become more benign than expected,"" adding that this was due to healthy sowing of autumn crops, as well as a comfortable buffer stocks of food grains.
The central bank forecast inflation at 3.1% for the fiscal year.
Tuesday's CPI reading offer room for a looser monetary policy to shore up India's economy as it grapples with trade tensions stirred by U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policy.
""Combined with the potential hit to GDP from the punitive US tariffs on India, July's very soft inflation print has certainly increased the chances of further policy easing this year. That said, the 50% tariff rate may not prove permanent,"" said Joe Maher, assistant economist at Capital Economics.
""The MPC also broadly shares our view that inflation will rebound in the coming months and its relatively hawkish communications following last week's policy meeting suggest the barrier to further easing remains high,"" he added.
India faces tariffs totaling 50% toward the end of this month. Besides ""reciprocal"" duties of 25% already in effect, the White House has levied another 25% in tariffs, set to come into force on Aug. 28, on India for buying oil from Russia.
The two countries had been locked in a war of words in the lead up to Trump's Aug. 7 deadline, with the U.S. President accusing New Delhi of funding Russia's war in Ukraine and India calling out both the U.S. and the European Union on their trade with Russia.
India's economic growth came in better than expected for the quarter ended March, expanding 7.4% year on year and sharply higher than the 6.7% growth forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.

At the same time, the company is also expanding overseas, deploying 200 kiosks in Australia this year, which “continues to emerge as a global hot spot for Bitcoin adoption, Mintz said.

This financial support will be distributed in 12 tranches and aims to ensure the OMCs can continue to provide LPG at regulated prices despite high international rates, according to a report by ETEnergyworld.com.
The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas is tasked with the allocation of funds among the OMCs.
International prices of LPG have remained high and the government has chosen not to transfer the increased costs to consumers, leading to significant under-recoveries by the OMCs.
Despite these losses, Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum have maintained a steady supply of LPG cylinders throughout the nation.
The compensation is seen as a crucial step in enabling the OMCs to manage essential expenditures including crude oil and LPG procurement, debt servicing and capital investments.
This move is also aligned with the government's commitment to providing clean cooking fuel to all households, including those under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana scheme, and to uphold the financial health of public sector oil companies amidst global energy market fluctuations.
India has recently reiterated its plan to continue oil imports from Russia, despite potential repercussions suggested by US President Donald Trump.
The US has threatened a 25% tariff on Indian exports and additional sanctions should India persist in acquiring Russian arms and oil.
However, Indian Government sources have indicated that there are no immediate plans to alter the standing long-term contracts with Russia.

Otherwise, he said, they might miss out on winning sessions.
""People just can't seem to process the most important three words in the investing lexicon: 'stay the course.' Nobody wants to stand pat when they think they can get out and then jump right back in. That's incredibly difficult.""
Tuesday 's session saw the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite close at record highs as investors celebrated a weaker-than-expected inflation report that could allow the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.
According to Cramer, some investors didn't profit from Tuesday's market moves because they were too pessimistic about certain problems. He said issues that cause investors to sell usually aren't remedied until after stocks have already rallied, so it's hard to re-enter the market.
Cramer looked back at recent events that concerned some on Wall Street, including the promise of sweeping tariffs and President Donald Trump's firing of the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics hours after the agency shared a weak employment report.
Cramer said he doesn't necessarily agree with the White House's decisions. However, he suggested that a move by Trump that seems ""outrageous"" to some is not a reason to sell stocks — especially after the gains banked on Tuesday. He said he thinks most of Trump's actions can be undone if they become problematic, adding that the CEOs of Nvidia and Apple have managed to make make deals with president.
""More important, I just can't relate most of this stuff to the companies themselves and the profits they make. They're making tons of money, more than ever,"" he said. ""They're giving you a tremendous return. They've figured out how to change their supply chains, how to deal with a mercurial president — thank you, Jensen Huang and Tim Cook — and they do what's necessary to help you make money.""

Beauty reported a 30% decline in net income, causing its shares to fall nearly 11% the day after its earnings report. E.l.f. is sourcing 75% of its products from China.
Yet the company's CEO, Tarang Amin, said he's focused on E.l.f.'s 26 consecutive quarters of net sales growth, the company's international and retail expansions, and the new $1 billion acquisition of Hailey Bieber's popular skincare brand, Rhode.
""We've been able to prove people wrong for 26 straight quarters,"" said Amin. ""So we're not worried about any short-term stock reaction,"" he said.
""We feel that this consistency of our delivery in the end of the day is the most important thing. And people always come around,"" Amin added.
E.l.f.'s affordable yet premium products have gone viral on social media thanks to the rise of ""dupe culture,"" and a focus on marketing on TikTok, Roblox and even during the Super Bowl.
E.l.f. Cosmetics was the No. 1 color cosmetics brand in the U.S. by units sold — and No. 2 by dollar share — in 2024, according to the company. It's also the most purchased brand by Gen Z, Gen Alpha and millennial consumers, the company says.
""We do think that over time, they will eventually be the No. 1 mass cosmetics company globally,"" said Anna Lizzul, a Bank of America Securities analyst covering household, personal care and beauty.
E.l.f. is also challenging legacy players like Estée Lauder and L'Oréal, and it celebrated its first billion-dollar fiscal year in May 2024 after sales spiked 77%, though its net sales have slowed in the following quarters.
The Rhode deal will also bring E.l.f. into Sephora stores in the U.S. this fall. Though the company is financing the deal with $600 million of debt, experts are cautiously optimistic. Rhode grew to $212 million in net sales in just three years, according to E.l.f.
""I think there's a very good chance that this turns out to be pretty heavily accretive. So, through that lens, I like them getting scrappy and figuring it out,"" said Baird Managing Director Jon Tenan.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is one of the top most profitable NYSE stocks to buy now. On August 5, Reuters reported that Taiwanese authorities detained three people for the alleged theft of technology trade secrets from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), according to statements by Taiwanese prosecutors released on Tuesday.

The Taiwan High Prosecutors Office said in a statement that this occurred after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) reported that an internal investigation caught former and current employees illegally obtaining information from the company. According to the prosecutor office, two other people had been released on bail, while one more had been released.
Earlier on Tuesday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) announced the launch of legal proceedings and disciplinary action against employees who were potentially involved in the leak of trade secrets after it detected unauthorized activities during routine monitoring.
The company stated that its “comprehensive and robust monitoring mechanisms” allowed it to catch the issue early, resulting in internal investigations and measures against the personnel involved.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the largest contract semiconductor manufacturer in the world.

Shares of the photography company slid more than 13% in early trading Tuesday.
""Kodak has debt coming due within 12 months and does not have committed financing or available liquidity to meet such debt obligations if they were to become due in accordance with their current terms,"" the company wrote in a regulatory filing. ""These conditions raise substantial doubt about Kodak's ability to continue as a going concern.""
The Rochester, New York-based company said that it had $155 million of cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, with $70 million held within the U.S.
Last year Kodak said that it would end its retirement income plan in order to pay down debt, according to The Wall Street Journal. Kodak Chief Financial Officer David Bullwinkle said in a statement on Monday that the company expects to know by Friday how it will satisfy its obligations to pay all pension plan participants and foresees completing the reversion by December.
Founded by George Eastman in 1880, Eastman Kodak Co. is credited with popularizing photography at the start of the 20th century and was known all over the world for its Brownie and Instamatic cameras and its yellow-and-red film boxes. It was first brought down by Japanese competition and then an inability to keep pace with the shift from film to digital technology.
Kodak filed for bankruptcy protection in 2012 after struggling with increasing competition, continuing growth in digital photography and growing debt. The company wound up selling off many of its businesses and patents, while shutting down the camera manufacturing unit that first made it famous. It received approval for its plan to emerge from court oversight a year later. At the time, Kodak was looking to recreate itself as a new, much smaller company focused on commercial and packaging printing.
Kodak is now nearing completion on a manufacturing plant to create regulated pharmaceutical products. The company already makes unregulated key starting materials for pharmaceuticals.

Brook + Whittle, a North American sustainable packaging solutions provider, has completed a refinancing transaction to fuel growth and sustainability initiatives.
This strategic financial move has secured the company $130m in new capital, alongside establishing a new revolving credit facility and extending its debt maturity.

The network's native token ether (ETH) has rallied 80% since June 5, the report noted, catalyzed by Circle’s (CRCL) listing and the market’s realization that most stablecoins are minted on the Ethereum network.
Coinbase operates one of the largest Layer 2 chains on Ethereum, Base, which processes more than 9 million transactions daily, encompassing stablecoins, trading, financial applications, and consumer-facing services, analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.
While Base has no native token, transaction gas fees are settled in ether, positioning Coinbase to earn sequencer fees in ETH. This contributes to an annualized revenue run rate of $75 million, the analysts wrote.
Beyond transaction fees, Base has also emerged as the dominant chain for token deployments, Bernstein said. Coinbase’s decision to integrate all Base tokens into its primary exchange platform has significantly increased trading activity, further boosting ETH-denominated brokerage fees.
The launch of the Base App, a consumer wallet for buying, selling, holding, and transferring crypto (including stablecoin payments), further strengthens Coinbase’s exposure to Ethereum and its ecosystem.
In addition to its operational activities, Coinbase holds a sizable ether treasury valued at $590 million (136,782 ETH), making the company a direct beneficiary of the token's price appreciation, the broker said.
As Coinbase highlighted in its second quarter earnings report, July trading fees surged approximately 40% compared to the Q2 average, driven by increased ether trading activity.
This surge reflects the broader market excitement surrounding ether, and with over 250 tokens listed on Coinbase, the exchange is poised to benefit from the broader Ethereum ecosystem growth, the report added.
Bernstein has an outperform rating on Coinbase stock with a $510 price target. The shares were 4% higher, trading around $323 at publication time.

The court has ordered Fluor to pay approximately A$692m to Santos and its co-venturers, with additional amounts to be determined.
The dispute stemmed from a 2011 engineering and construction contract for the Gladstone LNG project's production facilities.
Santos contended that Fluor unjustly claimed and received payments under the contract and sought to recoup these amounts, including liquidated damages for project delays.
Furthermore, Santos aimed to enforce a parent company guarantee from Fluor Corporation.
On 14 July 2023, three referees, appointed by the court to review the case, submitted their final report, supporting Santos' position on cost recovery.
The court has now largely upheld the referees' conclusions, confirming Fluor's obligation to pay the substantial sum to Santos and its partners.
The final amount, which will include interest and legal costs, is expected to be confirmed in the upcoming weeks.
In related news, Santos recently extended its exclusivity period with the XRG Consortium amid ongoing discussions regarding a proposed $18.7bn acquisition.
The consortium, led by XRG, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, along with Abu Dhabi Development Holding Company and Carlyle, is nearing the completion of its due diligence, as per the process and exclusivity deed signed on 27 June 2025.
According to Santos, the XRG Consortium has not encountered any issues that would lead it to retract its non-binding indicative proposal.

The S&P 500 closed above 6,400 for the first time ever amid a broad stock market rally on Tuesday as Wall Street digested fresh inflation data.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose about 1.1% or nearly 500 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped nearly 1.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) also added around 1.4%. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite closed at record levels.
The small-cap Russell 200 Index (^RUT) also soared amid rate-cut optimism, rising nearly 3% on the day.
The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that ""core"" inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose 3.1% over the past year in July, ahead of June's 2.9% increase. The reading indicated that rising goods inflation is no longer being offset by easing services inflation.

(NASDAQ:VFS) is one of the best EV penny stocks to buy according to hedge funds. On July 14, Cantor Fitzgerald reiterated its “Overweight” rating on VinFast shares and maintained a $6.00 price target on the stock.
The firm cited VinFast’s stable vehicle deliveries in Vietnam for June 2025, which included 3,667 VF3, 3,060 VF5, 1,245 VF6, and 725 VF7 models, as well as 1,415 Nerio Green and 916 Herio Green commercial vehicles delivered domestically that month. For the first half of 2025, the compact models VF3 and VF5 dominated sales, with 23,083 and 21,812 units delivered, respectively. VinFast reaffirmed guidance to at least double its 2025 vehicle deliveries compared with the previous year’s 97,339 units.
Despite a concerning cash burn rate, Cantor Fitzgerald’s analysts expressed confidence in VinFast’s business model, particularly its vertical integration and focus on Vietnamese and Asian markets. These factors, the analysts stated, mitigate against external risks such as tariffs and the removal of the $7,500 US EV tax credit.
VinFast Auto Ltd. (NASDAQ:VFS) is a Vietnamese EV manufacturer that designs, develops, and sells EVs, e-scooters, and electric buses across Vietnam and the United States. The company operates through multiple segments, including Automobiles, E-scooter, Spare Parts, and Aftermarket Services. VinFast has recently expanded its US footprint by opening its first authorized dealership in California and launching locally produced EVs.
While we acknowledge the potential of VFS as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

SoftBank has been gradually cashing in on some of its Vision Fund bets in recent years. SoftBank’s stock also received a boost after Reuters reported that the Japanese company has picked investment banks for a possible initial public offering for Japanese payments app operator PayPay. PayPay was originally set up through a venture with former Vision Fund portfolio company Paytm.
Last week, Foxconn’s flagship unit Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. said it had agreed to sell the EV plant to Crescent Dune LLC for $375 million without identifying the company behind the entity.

SoundHound AI Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) is one of the best-performing stocks on Monday.
SoundHound AI soared by 17.34 percent on Monday to end at $15.9 apiece as investors took path from an investment firm’s upgraded rating for its stock.
In a market note, Ladenburg Thalmann raised SoundHound AI Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) to “buy” from “neutral” previously, alongside a higher price target of $16, as compared with the $9 prior.
According to Ladenburg, the upgrade was based on SoundHound AI Inc.’s (NASDAQ:SOUN) increasing deals in the automotive sector that “can give potential upside opportunity.”
“The penetration in Autos is growing as the company recently announced three major automotive brands in the US have rolled out with SOUN Chat AI embedded. This product drives user engagement and helps establish tech leadership in an increasingly competitive space … Management has pegged in-car commerce opportunity for OEMs at $35 billion annually,” it said.
In an updated report, SoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) said it narrowed its non-GAAP net loss in the second quarter of the year by 20 percent to $11.86 million from $14.89 million in the same period last year, but widened its GAAP net loss by 100 percent to $78 million from $37 million year-on-year.
Revenues, on the other hand, soared by 217 percent to $42.68 million from only $13.46 million in the same period last year.
SoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) raised its full-year revenue growth outlook to a range of $160 million to $178 million, from the previous forecast of $156 million to $177 million.

The token initially moved to a peak of $827 as the rally started, with more than 146,000 tokens traded in a single hour before sellers stepped in to reserve these gains.
Trading remained choppy since, with short-lived recoveries failing to break resistance levels near $800 decisively. Despite the volatility, BNB treasury purchases haven’t wavered, with CEA Industries becoming the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency after a $160 million purchase.
The move pushed BNB’s market capitalization to nearly $112 billion, cementing its position as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.
While the price swings rattled traders, the underlying demand suggests continued long-term interest.
Technical Analysis Overview
BNB’s $33.34 trading range over the 24-hour period represents a 4% volatility band between its $793.99 low and $827.33 high. The rally stalled at the $827.33 resistance level, where high-volume selling pressure capped gains. Support formed near $794, reinforced by heavy buying during the morning correction.
Short-term resistance sits near $800.50, where multiple recovery attempts failed despite intraday volume spikes.
A breakout above this level could re-test $811.22 and open the path back to $827.33. A breakdown below $794 risks further downside toward the $780 area.
Volume profile shows two key liquidity zones: a morning surge of 146,403 units traded at resistance and a 114,685-unit flush at support, both indicating strong institutional participation. These zones may guide short-term price reactions if volatility persists.

Net income in the quarter was up 52% year over year to ¥104.6 billion or $706 million. It marked the sixth straight quarter of growth that exceeded the ¥76.4 billion average of three analyst estimates.
The significant earnings growth comes from the Japanese firm capitalizing on the equity trading boom. Revenue from stock trading was up 20% year over year, marking the ninth consecutive quarter of growth. Revenue from investment banking increased 2%, led by fees from bond underwriting.
Nevertheless, fees on mergers and acquisitions dropped even as Nomura took the top spot among financial advisers. Likewise, the company incurred a loss in its European operations due to a higher-than-expected effective tax rate of 33%. On the other hand, the wealth management division reported a quarterly profit increase of ¥2.8 billion, attributed to an increase in trading in bonds and equities.
Nomura Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:NMR) is a global financial services group that offers a wide range of services through its four business divisions: Wealth Management, Investment Management, Wholesale (comprising Global Markets and Investment Banking), and Banking.

On August 5, Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to a ‘Buy’ from a ‘Neutral’ and increased its price target from GBP 0.87 to GBP 0.99. The upgrade comes amid confidence that headwinds are slowly subsiding and that the market will focus on the core equity story on the motor finance compensation scheme.
Lloyds has already reiterated that any changes related to motor finance issues will not have a material impact on the group. Therefore, it is encouraging investors to focus on the company’s fundamentals. Goldman Sachs has echoed these sentiments, affirming the company’s strengthening revenue diversification and sector-leading earnings per share growth.
In addition, Goldman Sachs is confident that Lloyds will increase its profitability and attractive capital returns through dividend payments and share buybacks. The investment bank expects the company’s core revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 8% through 2027. The growth rate should outpace the sector average of 3%.
Lloyds Banking Group (NYSE:LYG) is a UK-based financial services group that provides a wide range of banking and financial services. It offers current accounts, credit cards, savings, home insurance, mortgages, loans, car finance, and travel services. It focuses primarily on retail and commercial customers.

SharpLink Gaming snapped a five-day winning streak on Monday, shedding 6.63 percent to finish at $22.33 apiece as investors soured on news that it raised $400 million from a series of share purchase agreements.
In a statement, SharpLink Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:SBET) said it entered into share purchase agreements with five global institutional investors for the sale of securities at a price of $21.76 apiece. With some $400 million total proceeds expected to be raised, this means that the company is set to issue more than 18.3 million shares. The offer is expected to be completed on Tuesday, August 12.
The offering was said to be part of a shelf registration statement approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 30, 2025.
SharpLink Gaming, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:SBET) share sale was in line with expectations of growing its Ethereum holdings to $3 billion.
At present, SharpLink Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:SBET) holds 598,800 units of ETH, while approximately $200 million worth of proceeds from its recent at-the-market offering have yet to be deployed.
“Raising nearly $900 million in capital over the past week underscores the market’s confidence in SharpLink’s ETH treasury strategy. The speed and scale of these investments reflect not only investor trust in SharpLink, but also the growing recognition of Ethereum’s transformative potential,” said SharpLink Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:SBET) co-CEO Joseph Chalom.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 463.66 points, or 1.04%, at 44,922.27. The S&P 500 added 0.32% to finish at 6,466.58, while the Nasdaq Composite settled up 0.14% at 21,713.14. Both indexes closed at record highs for the second straight day.
AMD popped 5.4% to lead gains in tech. Apple also advanced 1.6%. Shares of Paramount Skydance soared 36.7%.
Those moves followed a record-setting session Tuesday sparked by a tamer-than-expected inflation report that gave investors hope of a Fed rate cut in September. Traders are pricing in a near 100% chance of a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting, per trading data from the CME's FedWatch Tool.
Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird, also pointed to a strong second-quarter earnings season so far as another market catalyst. While the pace of earnings reports has lulled these last few days, it ramps back up next week with a slew of big retail names on the docket.
""This has been a really impressive earning season, which showcases kind of a corporate resilience from all the headwinds that we saw across the summer,"" he said to CNBC. ""You also had just a really nice kind of breadth.""

(Reuters) -Cash allocations by U.S. corporations have halved since 2021 as elevated interest rates prompt a shift to higher-yielding treasury bills, data from Clearwater Analytics showed on Tuesday.
Median allocations to cash - which includes hard currency, money market funds and 90-day treasury bills - dropped to 20% at the end of July from 40% in 2021, according to a report encompassing around 800 of the investment management software maker's U.S. corporate clients with a combined $1.3 trillion in assets.
This marks the lowest level in Clearwater's system in at least eight years.
Excluding very short-term treasury bills, median allocations to U.S. treasuries surged from 3% to 20% over the same period.
Chief financial officers are trying to secure higher yields before the U.S. Federal Reserve resumes interest rate cuts, a prospect bolstered by the July jobs report, while also balancing the need for liquidity.
A lot of the companies are holding these bonds to maturity, Matthew Vegari, Clearwater's head of research, told Reuters.
Short-dated T-bills are quickest to adjust to rate changes, pushing companies toward longer durations for higher yields.
""Corporations are still adding duration because they know the duration risk is minimal, because the likelihood that the Fed hikes is much lower than the likelihood that the Fed cuts,"" Vegari said.
Weighted by time to maturity, median portfolio durations rose to 0.61 years at the end of July, from 0.45 years at the start of 2021.
The higher-for-longer interest rate environment is ""a headwind for those who need to borrow, and it's a tailwind for those who have the cash on their balance sheets and just want to get passive income that is completely risk-free,"" Vegari added.

(Reuters) -Citigroup and UBS Global Research became the latest Wall Street brokerages to raise their year-end targets for the S&P 500 index, pointing to receding policy risks and resilient corporate earnings.Citi bumped the benchmark index's target to 6,600 from 6,300 and UBS to 6,100 from 5,500, implying an upside of 3.2% and a downside of 4.7% respectively to the index's last close.
This marks Citigroup’s second upward revision in just two months. UBS, however, had trimmed its target in April after President Donald Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs.
The moves follow similar upgrades from major brokerages including HSBC, Goldman Sachs and BofA Global Research.
Oppenheimer Asset Management sees the index climbing as high as 7,100, the highest on Wall Street. Jefferies is the only brokerage to set a target lower than 6,000 at 5,600.
UBS expects a short-term dip in the market, it said in a note on Monday, with the index correcting to 5,900 around late third quarter before recovering to 6,100 by the end of 2025 and 6,800 by the end of 2026.
Citi analysts said in a note late on Friday that the expected fundamental drag from U.S. tariffs has been mostly modeled at this point and that tax benefits from Trump's spending bill should improve corporate earnings.
The bill, signed into law on July 4, 2025, delivers sweeping corporate tax relief.
Since bottoming on April 8 after Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs, the benchmark index has rebounded 32.2%, reaching new highs in July as robust Big Tech earnings revived investor confidence in the AI-driven rally.
Citi said impressive earnings from the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech companies have anchored the rise of the index. The rest of the index is starting to strengthen more broadly, it said.

There were no injuries and sales of the metal used to make lithium-ion batteries are not expected to be affected, Albemarle said, without providing additional details.
It was not immediately clear if operations had temporarily shut down last week. Albemarle gave no more details of the incident.
Jaime Araya, who represents the Antofagasta region where the plant is located in the Chilean Congress' lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, last week sent a letter to Chile's mining regulator and labor office requesting an inspection of the site after receiving a complaint that a pipe containing acid had burst.
Araya on Tuesday told Reuters he was informed that the labor inspector’s office had opened an investigation.
A source familiar with Albemarle's operations said such probes are standard procedure and that the plant is operating normally. A second source added that the problem affected only one tank.
A union leader for plant workers, Elias Torres, said he could not comment because an investigation was underway.
The labor inspector's office said it could not provide information because the matter was under review.
Albemarle's shares were down slightly in Tuesday midday trading to $80.14.
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Albemarle on Monday said its Chief Operating Officer Netha Johnson will leave the company as part of a management reorganization. Johnson's exit is not connected to the Chilean incident, a source told Reuters.

Albemarle Corp. (NYSE:ALB) extended its winning streak to a third straight day on Monday, jumping 7 percent to close at $80.76, as investors turned optimistic about a surge in lithium prices following a huge player’s suspension of one of its mining operations in China.
According to a report by Bloomberg, Chinese firm Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) suspended its mining operations at the Jianxiawo lithium mine in Jiangxi province amid an expired mining permit that it does not expect to get renewed soon.
While CATL has begun negotiations with the Chinese government for the renewal, it was expecting a prolonged halt amid China’s intensified regulatory oversight of mining companies to curb overcapacity.
Based on data from the Australian government, CATL’s suspended site alone can produce over 46,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent a year, or roughly 3 percent of the global supply forecast for 2025.

The company said it will issue and sell 200 million shares, split between a direct offering and a private placement, to fund the purchase. The move will leave ALT5 holding 7.5% of the total WLFI supply, it said.
World Liberty CEO Zach Witkoff will become chairman of ALT5's board, Eric Trump will become a director of the company, co-founder Zak Folkman will become a board observer and crypto investor Matt Morgan will take over as chief investment officer.
ALT5 Sigma will sell 100 million shares to institutional investors for $7.50 each, and another 100 million in a private placement in exchange for WLFI tokens. WLFI was recently priced at $0.3659, according to CoinGecko data. The financing is expected to close Aug. 12.
Proceeds from the cash portion of the deal will fund crypto treasury operations, buy additional WLFI tokens, pay down debt, settle litigation and bolster working capital.
Founded in 2018, ALT5 operates crypto payment platform ALT5 Pay and over-the-counter trading desk ALT5 Prime, claiming over $5 billion in processed digital asset transactions.

""We expect the Fed to begin cutting rates in September, and it could be justified cutting the Funds rate by 50 basis points, to get it more aligned with longer-term inflationary expectations and some of the productivity enhancement we are seeing across multiple industries,"" Rieder said Tuesday in a note to clients. (1 basis point equals 0.01%.) A half-point cut in September would mirror the Fed's move in September 2024 when it began the easing cycle with a big rate reduction. His comments came after data showed the consumer price index increased a seasonally adjusted 0.2% for the month and 2.7% on a 12-month basis.

""Today's inflation report was a bit stronger than we have seen over the prior few months, but lower than many have feared,"" Rieder said.

Authorities have recently told companies to avoid using the Nvidia chips, or those from Advanced Micro Devices, for government and national security use cases, according to the news outlet.
The report comes after the White House confirmed on Monday that both Nvidia and AMD have agreed to give 15% of all China revenues to the U.S. government.
Last month, both companies said they would soon resume China shipments after the administration started requiring export licenses earlier this year. Both Nvidia's H20 chip and AMD's MI380 were created to work around previous AI chip restrictions to China due to national security fears.
Shares of both stocks teetered on Tuesday before closing slightly higher.
During a press conference Monday, Trump called Nvidia's H20 chip ""obsolete"" and said he wouldn't allow the higher-end Blackwell shipments there without a 30% to 50% decrease in performance.
China is a key market for AI chipmakers such as Nvidia and AMD.
Earlier this year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said getting pushed out of the China market would be a ""tremendous loss"" for the company. He estimated the country's AI market will hit $50 billion over the next two to three years.
Over the weekend, a social media account connected to Chinese state media said the H20 chips were not ""safe.""

HOUSTON (Reuters) -A Chevron-chartered tanker docked at Venezuelan state company PDVSA's Jose terminal on Tuesday, positioning it to be the first to export crude to the United States under a new license Chevron received in July, LSEG tracking data showed.
The U.S. Treasury Department late last month authorized Chevron to operate in the sanctioned OPEC nation again, export its oil and do swaps with PDVSA through a restricted license banning any payments to Venezuela's government.
Chevron suspended loading of Venezuelan crude in April ahead of its prior license's expiration on May 27.
The Bahamas-flagged tanker Canopus Voyager arrived in Venezuelan waters last week and will load Hamaca heavy crude, which is produced by a joint venture between Chevron and PDVSA.
At least five other vessels that Chevron had used to transport Venezuelan crude to the U.S. were near or navigating toward the South American country's waters on Tuesday, the LSEG data showed.
Vessel MediterraneanVoyager was near the Bajo Grande port in Venezuela's western region waiting for authorization to load Boscan heavy crude, while Nave Cosmos, Sea Jaguar, Ionic Anax and Nave Neutrino signaled Aruba, a popular location for ship-to-ship transfers of Venezuelan crude, the LSEG data showed.
Chevron did not reply to questions about the tankers, instead saying that it conducts business in compliance with laws, and sanctions frameworks.
PDVSA did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

This followed the acquisition of another 317,126 units, from the 833,137 previously, boosting its total ownership to more than 1.15 million, making Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc. (NYSEAmerican:BMNR) the largest ETH treasury in the world. The treasury carries an average price of $4,311 apiece.
“In just a week, BitMine increased its ETH holdings by $2.0 billion to $4.96 billion… lightning speed in the company’s pursuit of the ‘alchemy of 5 percent’ of ETH,” said Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc. (NYSEAmerican:BMNR) Chairman Thomas Lee. “We are leading crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV (net asset value) per share and by the high trading liquidity of our stock.”

The new round of acquisition followed the company’s $2.9 billion purchase of ETH earlier this month, as part of an ETH Treasury strategy announced on June 30.

Reign, a zero-sugar performance energy drink, has tapped two professional football standouts to represent its brand: former Carolina linebacker Luke Kuechly and current All-Pro running back Nick Chubb.

Remington Hospitality appointed Cory Chambers as chief commercial officer to oversee the hotel management company’s commercial strategy, including revenue management, sales, marketing, distribution and customer experience, according to a Monday release.

ColdSnap, a Massachusetts-based food technology company known for its on-demand frozen treat machines, has secured a national distribution deal with Foodbuy, the procurement division of Compass Group USA.

ColdSnap’s countertop unit freezes single-serve pods of ice cream, smoothies, protein shakes, frozen coffee drinks and seasonal specialties in about two minutes.

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) will phase out its 6-inch wafer manufacturing business over the next two years and continue consolidating its 8-inch wafer production capacity to improve efficiency, the company said on Tuesday.
The decision, which TSMC told Reuters in a statement was made after a thorough evaluation, was based on market conditions and aligned with the company’s long-term business strategy.
TSMC said it was working closely with customers to ensure a smooth transition and remained committed to meeting their needs during the period.
The company said the move would not affect its previously announced financial targets.
TSMC has only one 6-inch wafer fab and four 8-inch wafer fabs in Taiwan for mature-node chip manufacturing, while its advanced-node manufacturing for customers such as Apple and Nvidia is carried out in 12-inch fabs.
TSMC in July forecast its revenue in U.S. dollar terms would increase by about 30% this year.
