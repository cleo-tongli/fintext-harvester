The meeting was held in Alaska, which was once Russian territory.\n\"There were many, many points that we agreed on … I would say a couple of big ones that we haven't quite got there, but we've made some headway,\" Trump said at a joint press conference with Putin. The leaders did not take any questions from the press.\nPutin called the talks a \"starting point,\" both for the resolution of the conflict with Kyiv as well as for improving relations with Washington, which he said had \"fallen to the lowest point since the Cold War.\"\nTrump said Putin's observations were \"profound,\" and added that he would talk to NATO and Zelenskyy to update them about the discussions with Russia. \"It's ultimately up to them,\" he said.\n\"Many points were agreed to. There are just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant. One is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there,\" Trump said, without elaborating.\nSince Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, multiple rounds of peace negotiations have taken place, but there has not been a breakthrough on ending hostilities.\nIn an interview with Fox News following the Friday summit, Trump asked Zelenskyy to make a deal to end the war in Ukraine. \"Gotta make a deal. Yeah. Look, Russia is a very big power, and they're not. They're great soldiers,\" he said.\nRussian media outlets were upbeat Friday ahead of Putin's meeting with Trump, with the summit being seen as a win for Moscow. Commentary across Russian state news sites characterized the talks as a positive for Russia. The mood in Ukraine was somber amid apprehensions of the country losing some territory as part of a Trump-brokered deal.", "content_hash": "0c6e757af539eb0cac9b049a03a0b1e2", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The company's segments include laboratory solutions and bioscience production. Within its segments, it sells materials and consumables, equipment and instrumentation and services and specialty procurement to customers in the biopharma and health care, education and government and advanced technologies and applied materials industries. Materials and consumables include ultra-high purity chemicals and reagents, lab products and supplies, highly specialized formulated silicone materials, customized excipients and others. Equipment and instrumentation include filtration systems, virus inactivation systems, incubators, analytical instruments and others. Services and specialty procurement include onsite lab and production, equipment, procurement and sourcing and biopharmaceutical material scale-up and development services.\nStock market value: $8.85 billion ($12.98 per share)\nActivist: Engine Capital\nOwnership: ~3%\nAverage Cost: n/a\nActivist Commentary: Engine Capital is an experienced activist investor led by Managing Partner Arnaud Ajdler. He is a former partner and senior managing director at Crescendo Partners. Engine's history is to send letters and/or nominate directors but settle rather quickly.\nWhat's happening\nOn Aug. 11, Engine sent a letter calling on Avantor's board to focus on commercial and operational excellence, demonstrate organic growth, reduce costs, optimize the portfolio, refresh the board and use free cash flow to repurchase stock. Engine noted that the company can alternatively consider a sale.\nBehind the scenes\nAvantor is a market leading distributor of life science tools and products for the life sciences and advanced technology industries. The company is comprised of two segments: laboratory solutions (LSS) (67% of revenue) and bioscience production (BPS) (33% of revenue). LSS is one of the three top life sciences distributors in the world (Thermo Fisher and Merck KGaA being the other two).\nBPS is a supplier of high-purity materials and is the leading supplier of medical-grade silicones. Despite being one of the few scaled global life science tool distribution platforms, the company has vastly underperformed. At its 2021 investor day, management projected earnings per share above $2 for 2025; and at its 2023 investor day, management targeted an EBITDA margin exceeding 20%. Now in 2025, these currently stand at 96 cents per share and 11.8%, respectively. Consequently, Avantor's share price has declined 53.96%, 59.69%, and 43.41% over the past 1-, 3- and 5-year periods, as of Engine's announcement Monday.\nEngine believes that Avantor's significant underperformance is a consequence of self-inflicted mistakes rooted in a flawed leadership team and framework. A complex matrix organizational structure and resultant lack of accountability have led to mass leadership turnover, including Avantor's CEO, CFO and both segment leaders within the past three years, contributing to a dysfunctional decision-making process and inefficient employee structure.\nThe biggest casualty of this rocky management team is LSS, which has lost significant profitability and market share to its peers. Specifically, poor capital allocation decisions have destroyed significant value. In 2020 and 2021, Avantor spent a total of $3.8 billion to acquire Ritter, Masterflex and RIM Bio – companies that were notably purchased during the peak of the pandemic when life sciences businesses were trading at exceptionally high multiples. Applying Avantor's next 12 months 10x multiple to the 28x average acquisition price implies over $2.4 billion in lost value on these acquisitions, contributing to the company's high leverage.\nOn top of that, despite LSS's ongoing underperformance and the need for strong leadership, from June 2024 to April 2025, LSS was left without a leader due to a non-compete lawsuit involving the hiring of its new segment leader, underscoring the operational dysfunction that has been taking place at the company.\nBut perhaps the nail in the coffin for this management team and board is that despite this cascading set of errors and the internal knowledge of these forecasted losses, they were still given a way out. In 2023, the company was approached by Ingersoll Rand to be acquired at an estimated $25-$28 per share, a 20%-35% premium of the share price at the time, yet the board inexplicably rebuffed this approach. Today, Avantor trades at just under $13 per share.\nEnter Engine, who has announced an approximately 3% position in Avantor and is urging the board to focus the organization on commercial and operational excellence, demonstrate organic growth, reduce costs, optimize the portfolio, refresh the board and use free cash flow to repurchase its own stock.\nEngine points out that Avantor's reported $6.8 billion in revenue was stretched across 6 million stock keeping units, while Thermo's peer segment achieves similar revenue with less than half the SKUs, indicating a large opportunity, specifically within LSS, to optimize the portfolio by concentrating purchases to improve inventory turns, rebates and margins.\nDivesting non-core assets is another way to optimize the portfolio. For BPS, certain facilities operate in periods of extended downtime, limiting growth. For LSS, subscale facilities in smaller geographies may be more valuable to a competitor, and the same goes for some of the assets purchased under Avantor's aforementioned acquisition spree.\nOn the cost discipline side, Avantor's history of poor M&A and its low valuation should limit its accretive M&A opportunities, and while the company is on the path to reduce leverage below 3x, the market remains concerned that once this is achieved, they will simply resume this costly M&A strategy. Engine argues that free cash flow should instead be allocated evenly to share repurchases and debt reduction.\nAdditionally, executive compensation is also a concern. In 2024, despite organic revenue declining by 2% and a 7% share price decline, the board awarded CEO Michael Stubblefield 110% of his target annual bonus, underscoring the need to align these management incentives with shareholder value creation.\nEngine believes that all of these changes would be best implemented with a comprehensive board refreshment. Adding directors with executive leadership, capital allocation, and distribution expertise to replace board members that have overseen years of value destruction, likely targeting chairman Jonathan Peacock specifically, should signal to the market the start of a new chapter. Engine believes that if these changes are properly implemented that Avantor shares would be worth between $22 and $26 per share by the end of 2027.\nAs a secondary option, Engine suggests that if a standalone path does not appear viable then the board should consider selling the entire company or splitting LSS and BPS into separate entities.\nWhen Avantor acquired VWR, which is now the core of the LSS business, it was valued at about 12x EBITDA, or $6.5 billion, and BPS peers trade at a median of 17x EBITDA. Neither of these businesses' valuations correspond to what Avantor trades at, roughly 8x EBITDA, and it's possible that a strategic path could become the best way to unlock this value on a risk-adjusted basis. If this were to become the case, there is likely to be both private and strategic interest. New Mountain Capital previously owned Avantor prior to its IPO and still maintains an approximately 2% position. Strategics, like Ingersoll, would likely be interested as well, especially at a significant discount to what they once offered. Engine believes that Avantor could sell between $17 to $19 per share.\nOverall, Engine makes not only a compelling case that major change is needed at Avantor, but also a clear multipath plan forward. While some of these changes are already underway: a new CEO is set to start next week and management announced a $400 million cost-cutting initiative, the sheer volume of change required here is unlikely to occur by Engine's 2027 estimate.\nEngine's plan includes strengthening execution, instilling a culture of cost discipline, improving capital allocation, evaluating the company's portfolio, aligning executive compensation to shareholder value creation and refreshing the board. Engine's plan is the right one, but this is a company whose top line and operating margins have been in decline since 2022 and refreshing a board, instilling a new culture, reversing declining revenue and operating margins and evaluating and executing asset sales, many of which cannot be done simultaneously, is something that will likely take much longer than two years, particularly with the director nomination window not opening until Jan. 8. Moreover, the kind of change that Engine calls for here is generally not the kind of change that comes from an amicable settlement.\nKen Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments.", "content_hash": "9f1467b03d758103e812bc5885280737", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Wall Street economists are fixated on identifying tariff effects, yet stocks either celebrated or shrugged off three warm and sticky inflation readings this week, laboring to hold near record highs. The S & P 500 immediately processed a moderately elevated consumer price index report Tuesday as solidifying the chances for a September cut by the Fed into a still-steady economy, logging on that day slightly more than what would become a 0.9% gain for the week. Notably, over the next three days — through a hot but noisy producer price index reading and a messy University of Michigan consumer-sentiment survey — the benchmark treated Tuesday's closing level just under 6,450 as a floor, testing it repeatedly and finishing the week right on it. The index has now logged a total return of 10% year to date, having more than recovered the near-20% tariff-panic collapse in April. .SPX 3M bar SPX 3-month chart The divide between optimists and pessimists on the market entering the second half of August is whether this action seems judicious or oblivious. The starting point for determining such things should be in assuming the market has it roughly right and isn't overlooking much of the important stuff. Whether the Fed \"should\" look through potential tariff-driven inflation, the market is trying its best to do so. As Bespoke Investment Group summed things up at week's end: \"Price has trended steadily higher in a tight range over the last few months, representing rather sanguine action even though much of the news flow has been negative. While politics plays a big role in the going narrative about the market and the economy, price ultimately tells the real story. Whatever negativity there is out there hasn't been nearly enough to interrupt the uptrend that's been in place since we made new highs in early summer.\" The latest push higher has not been terribly emphatic, or broadly inclusive, allowing skeptics to withhold style points from the rally. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the equal-weight S & P 500 tagged new highs this week before faltering a bit, a sign either of fatigue or late-summer indifference. Big rotations This week also saw some forced-seeming rotations, with the weakest laggards in the S & P 500 performing best and the Russell 2000 small-cap index making yet another lunge for its late-2021highs on all the anticipated-rate-cut energy. Neglected groups such as health care showed some life, the likes of Johnson & Johnson breaking higher from a long slumber, even before news of Berkshire Hathaway's second-quarter purchase of UnitedHealth shares jolted that name higher on Friday. These reinforcements allowed the overtaxed mega-cap AI glamour names to take a rest. Such rotations tend to support and refresh a rally while suppressing volatility, though eventually they can imply an exhaustion of leadership that may make the tape less stable than when the largest index weights are in firm control. From a certain angle, it could appear odd that the bond market is simultaneously assigning more than an 80% chance of a Fed rate cut in six weeks when equities are at records, valuations are full, crypto is melting higher, credit spreads are drum-tight and buzzy IPOs are rocketing out of the gate. Registering nominal appreciation for these flush conditions while still asking for monetary-policy help, Wall Street, in the words of the old Elvis Costello song, has \"a mouthful of 'Much obliged' and a handful of 'Gimme.'\" This is less a contradiction than it is nuance. The jarring monthly payrolls miss of two weeks ago came after the Fed had last called the risks \"balanced\" between labor weakness and revived inflation, and the latest inflation upticks weren't enough to offset the job-market softness. Not to mention the relentless White House campaign to browbeat Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower rates while auditioning dovish successors. And confidence on multiple rate cuts, after one in late September, is not as evident in market pricing. Perhaps the market is conveying comfort with its own ability to hang tough even in the absence of a Fed move next month, casting a 25 basis-point reduction in short-term rates as a \"Nice to have\" rather than a \"Need to get.\" More tangibly, earnings forecasts for the remainder of the year are on the rise again, albeit with the AI-propelled tech players the largest contributors. When profits are growing, credit markets are calm and the next Fed move is a cut, stocks tend to have little trouble holding their valuations. Historically, when the Fed resumes an easing campaign after a pause of at least six months (December was the last cut), stocks have responded well over subsequent months, based on this study by Ned Davis Research. There's no doubt the market sometimes takes credit in advance for a hoped-for future that might never arrive. It could turn out this is one of those moments. Economists at Morgan Stanley argued Friday that Powell in the upcoming week's Jackson Hole symposium address is his last best chance to push against market pricing of a September cut, believing that \"the Fed would prefer to retain optionality and, if anything, we look for Powell's remarks at Jackson Hole to be similar to the message from July.\" In other words, noncommittal and data dependent. One possible \"tell\" would come from the bond market's reaction to any data or rhetoric that makes a cut less likely. If the 10-year Treasury yield were to rush lower in the face of reduced perceived chances of a rate cut next week, it could be taken as bonds declaring a high risk of a policy mistake, with the Fed behind the curve. If not, equity markets should take heart. One answer to those confused by the strength of the equity indexes in the face of still-elevated policy flux and potential stagflationary forces: Maybe markets are still burning off the last of the relief that burst forth after a worst-case scenario was priced in during the spring sell-off. Similarities to 1998 and 2018? Around the time that downturn was underway, I repeatedly noted the rich history of sharp, severe corrections that result from a sudden shock, stop just short of a 20% decline and are not associated with a recession. Precedents include the 1998 hedge-fund blowup, the 2011 U.S. debt-downgrade scare and the late-2018 tariff/Fed-mistake tumble. Fidelity's head of global macro Jurrien Timmer tracks such patterns, and the current recovery is in synch with those of 1998 and 2018 so far. Clearly this is a small sample and these are close to best-case paths from here, but the echoes are pretty distinct. It's no longer possible to argue that most investors are still outright bearish or are fighting the market's four-month advance. Systematic and quantitative funds are back to very full equity exposures. But there remains a lack of aggressive participation by the broader group of professional investors, by some measures. Deutsche Bank's composite investor positioning gauge is up to the 71 st percentile over the past 15 years, not a very high reading when indexes are at a record. Saying that not all investors have pushed every chip they have into the market is not the same as arguing the market enjoys a wide margin of safety, of course. Seasonal factors remain challenging and the tape is probably due for a routine wobble of a few percent before long. But there's not much reason to argue if one arrived it would be the start of the \"Big One.\"", "content_hash": "211d28e62d51595fec2842c21e412b7c", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Samsung's stock, meanwhile, is up about 35% in 2025.\nApple reported a 13% increase in year-over-year iPhone sales in its July earnings.\nIn July, Samsung introduced a pair of innovative new phones that feature foldable screens. One model, the Z Fold 7, can effectively turn into a tablet, while the Z Flip resembles an old-school flip phone with modern smartphone features. They were added to Samsung's catalog of phones released this spring under its Galaxy brand, including a thin-and-light phone called the Galaxy S25 Edge.\nThe devices are also getting a lot of traction on social media, particularly around durability tests.\nOne user posted a livestream that showed him bending the Z Fold 7 over 200,000 times in a row. The video has been clipped and shared widely on social media, with one version of the clip accumulating more than 15 million views on YouTube.\nIn the past month, Samsung's premium devices, including the Z Fold 7, were mentioned over 50,000 times on social media, and 83% of those mentions were positive or neutral, according to data from Sprout Social, a social media analytics company.\nThe market share numbers aren't just the result of user preferences. Much of the shift in shipment figures in the June quarter, analysts said, can be attributed to tariffs, which are causing \"disruption\" in the industry as smartphone makers use different strategies to minimize the impact on their business.\nBut Samsung's gains also reflect the company's ability to offer a much wider range of products at different prices compared to Apple. That includes low-end phones, which accounted for much of Samsung's second-quarter U.S. improvement, as well as high-end devices that cost more than any individual iPhone.\nSamsung's Galaxy and Z phone lineup \"stretches from $650 up to $2,400. That is a massive span of devices,\" said Canalys analyst Runar Bjorhovde. \"There is an idea that you can target people at every single price point, and you can meet them at every spot.\"\nThe iPhone has pretty much looked the same since 2017 — a rectangular piece of glass with a touchscreen on the front, and a few cameras on the back. These days, the company offers a series of four slates ranging from $829 to $1,599. Samsung and others are starting to go beyond the so-called candy bar shape and experimenting with new form factors.\nApple is expected to start doing the same — beginning with a potential launch next month of a slimmer iPhone that will compete with Samsung's Galaxy Edge.\n\"Apple is clearly betting that its 5.5mm Air model is going to lift its fortunes as testing suggests a strong desire for the new form factor,\" wrote Loop Capital managing director John Donovan in May.\nJPMorgan Chase analyst Samik Chatterjee wrote in a report last month that Apple may release a folding phone next year to compete with Samsung's Z Fold.\n\"Investor focus has already turned to the 2026 fall launches with Apple expected to launch its first foldable iPhone as part of the iPhone 18 lineup in September 2026,\" Chatterjee wrote.\nTrying new form factors offers Apple the opportunity to sell devices at higher prices, according to Bjorhovde.\nApple's most expensive phone, the iPhone 16 Pro Max, currently starts at $1,199 for 256GB of storage and can go up to $1,599 for a version with 1TB of storage. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, which was announced last week, starts at $1,999 for the 256GB version and tops out at $2,419 for the 1TB version.\nChatterjee said he thinks Apple's version of a folding phone could start at $1,999.\nFolding phones finally mature\nSamsung's first folding phone was released in 2019, but got off to a rocky start. The initial launch was delayed after reviewers — including CNBC — discovered that the early devices would break along their folding crease.\nBut Samsung says this time is different, and that folding phones are finally ready to go mainstream, especially with respect to durability.\n\"There really are no longer trade-offs towards owning a foldable device,\" said Drew Blackard, vice president of mobile product management at Samsung Electronics America.\nThe South Korean company doesn't provide sales numbers, but Blackard said the Galaxy Z Fold 7, the latest version, had 25% more preorders than any previous Samsung folding phone and that sales are outpacing the device's predecessor by nearly 50%.\n\"Samsung with the foldable is able to actually optimize for innovation,\" said Bjorhovde. \"Try to be ahead, show that something is different, and there's a certain halo effect from that.\"\nAccording to Counterpoint Research, a firm that estimates smartphone sales to customers, Samsung's sell-through increased 16% during the June quarter, thanks to demand for high-end devices, including a \"slight boost\" from the slim S25 Edge.\nThe rise of artificial intelligence is also heralding new form factors for consumer electronics that could one day replace the iPhone.\nOpenAI in May acquired the startup of former Apple design guru Jony Ive for $6.5 billion. The AI startup plans to develop the next generation of hardware, and other AI startups have released pins, pendants and glasses that rely on users' voice to control the devices.\nSamsung devices, as well as other Android phones, get access to Google's Gemini, which is widely considered to be one of the best AI models alongside OpenAI's ChatGPT. Gemini has several features that users can't get with Siri and Apple Intelligence.\nBlackard said folding phones, with their larger displays, are well suited for AI. Google's circle-to-search feature, which allows a user to simply circle something on the screen that they'd like to learn more about, is an example, Blackard said.\nOn a Samsung folding phone, he said, users can still see the original screen with the content they circled, as well as another screen with supplementary information.\n\"It's much more productive being able to go back and forth,\" Blackard said.\nInvestors have worried that Apple's AI delays, including its next-generation Siri that's now scheduled to come out next year, could start hurting sales. But many analysts say that Apple's brand loyalty and lock-in will give it a period of years before iPhone customers start defecting for competitors.\nChatterjee told CNBC that Apple's strategy with devices is to wait until a technology is ready for the mainstream before embracing it. That time may be now for foldable devices.\nApple has \"never been about trying to be the first to market,\" Chatterjee said. \"It's about being watchful, seeing a technology mature, knowing that there are no big roadblocks to that technology adoption, and then moving ahead.\"", "content_hash": "0ff6aebcf834836ffa10f07c26b33ccd", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The S & P 500 is back at all-time highs as the bull case on Wall Street plays out. The artificial intelligence buildout is ramping up. Corporate earnings are topping expectations. Interest rate cuts seem inevitable, likely coming next month. On top of all that, the One Big Beautiful Bill will be stimulative for an economy where consumers are still spending. But the market's ascent at a time of seasonal weakness and ongoing inflation concerns has many investors worried. They fear that a stock market priced for perfection, with the S & P 500 currently trading at a 12-month forward multiple of 22, is vulnerable to some sort of setback. And that could come from anywhere. \"What's going to happen, I think, is some shock will occur. I don't know what shock, but some shock will occur, which undercuts the thesis of continued economic growth,\" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. \"And when that happens, I think you'll see a selloff in markets, and that'll probably be concentrated in those areas that look most overvalued right now.\" \"So, I think investors ought to be pretty cautious here, because what's going on is the market slowly getting more and more overvalued,\" Kelly said. Top-heavy market More than anything, it's the top-heavy nature of the market raises concern. Goldman Sachs pointed out this week that the top 20% of quality companies in the S & P 500 — those with massive cash piles and fortress balance sheets — are trading at a 57% price-to-earnings premium to the lowest quality stocks — a gap in the 94th percentile going back to 1995. In practice, that means that the megacaps — which already benefit from AI tailwinds — get a further boost from investors seeking safety from economic uncertainty. Yet, the influence the tech giants wield on the market is troubling in the event of a pullback. AI superstar Nvidia alone now accounts for roughly 8% of the S & P 500, the biggest weighting of any individual stock in the cap weighted benchmark going back to 1981, according to Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. The stock is easily a key reason for the bull market, after rallying more than 36% this year, surging more than 170% in 2024, and soaring more than 200% in 2023. But, if the bull case for the beloved stock falters, that could spell trouble for the broader benchmark. China, for example, is a key weak point for the stock, as any curbs on Nvidia's sales of its graphics processing units to Beijing will likely hurt the stock — and also the market. An incoming reversal? The top stocks look especially bloated when you consider this: While the S & P 500 has gained more than 10% in 2025, the median stock has only risen 3%, and remains 12% off its recent high, according to a note from Goldman Sachs this week. To be sure, that could set up the market for big rotations. Small-cap stocks outperformed their large-cap counterparts this week. Value-factor stocks also outpaced growth, while Nvidia slid and Apple advanced. Health care, a recent laggard, led the S & P 500. If the dovish outlook for Fed policy holds, or the macroeconomic picture improves, then the rotation trade could continue to work for investors. And yet, even optimistic investors continue to remain cautious, and are diversifying their holdings. JPMorgan's Kelly said he prefers assets with limited downside in the event of a pullback. The strategist prefers U.S. value stocks over growth, and said he's looking abroad to Europe, which he expects has further to run even after its gains this year. Some alternatives such as real estate could also add value to a portfolio, he said. Eventually, Kelly expects some \"violent\" reaction — a sustained bear market of 20% or more — is overdue for the stock market, whether it comes within a week or in the next three years. \"It's just imperative that investors diversify some of that risk into other industries and other regions in particular,\" said Nanette Abuhoff Jacobson, global investment strategist at Hartford Funds. Reversal beneficiaries This past week, Goldman Sachs identified some lower quality stocks with weak balance sheets that could benefit from a reversal trade, if macroeconomic conditions improve or if the Fed turns dovish. Here are five of them. Estee Lauder was one lower quality stock identified. The stock is higher by more than 21% in 2025 but is in the midst of a multiyear turnaround plan that could cost between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion. Paramount Skydance surged 33% this week alone, after it became a \"play for momentum goons\" after Paramount Global's merger with Skydance Media finalized. — CNBC's Sean Conlon and Gabriel Cortes contributed to this story.", "content_hash": "c155b8c1fb64fa53a827f9513a95856a", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Each of the three major U.S. indexes hit all-time highs this week. The records followed improved investor sentiment after fresh consumer inflation data supported hopes for an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve's September meeting. The S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9% and 0.8% week to date, respectively, while the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.7%. After this week's rally, we used the CNBC Pro stock screener tool to identify the most overbought stocks on the Street as measured by their 14-day relative strength index, or RSI. Stocks with a 14-day RSI above 70 are generally considered overbought, meaning they could see shares decline in the future. The table below shows stocks with an RSI above 70 that have also risen at least 5% week to date, as of Friday morning. Biopharmaceutical company Incyte and e-commerce platform eBay topped the oversold list with RSIs of about 80 and 77, respectively. Incyte shares gained 11% this week. The stock is up nearly 26% year to date. Wells Fargo recently upgraded shares to overweight and set a $89 price target, saying the stock's setup appears favorable ahead of Incyte's expected update on its myelofibrosis therapy in the fourth quarter. The firm expects the news \"will be positive.\" Myelofibrosis is rare bone marrow disorder. Shares of eBay jumped 8% this week, meanwhile, bringing its year-to-date gains to more than 62%. EBay on July 30 reported an earnings and sales beat for its second quarter, and also provided an upbeat forecast for the current period. EBAY 1Y mountain EBay stock performance over the past year. Intel, with an RSI of 71.3, logged a week-to-date gain of 23% — its best week in more than 25 years. It's a sharp swing for the struggling stock, which saw its worst annual performance on record last year after it lost 60% of its value. The chipmaker's steep climb followed a Bloomberg report on Thursday that said the Trump administration is weighing whether the U.S. government should take a stake in Intel to support its efforts to expand U.S. manufacturing. Following the report, D.A. Davidson head of technology research Gil Luria told CNBC that government intervention in Intel is \"essential\" to protect U.S. national security. Sentiment remains shaky on Intel. Of the 46 analysts covering the company, 39 rate it a hold, per LSEG.

The Wall Street investment bank says stocks like Sunrun are compelling. Other overweight-rated companies the bank is bullish on include: RealReal, Spotify , Williams Companies and Nextracker. Spotify Technology Analyst Steven Cahall says he's standing by the streaming music stock following its late July earnings report. Wells Fargo admitted the quarterly results weren't overly exciting, but said Spotify remains a top pick with too many attractive catalysts to ignore. \"[Estimates] are coming down and there is nothing particularly incremental to get excited about,\" Cahall wrote. Nonetheless, the analyst said investors should remain calm. Cahall is particularly bullish on Spotify's latest subscription tier, Super Fan. \"We think the next several years will see product and feature innovations, such as Super Fan, increase in videos, education, etc,\" he said. Shares of Spotify are up 64% this year with more room to run, Cahall went on to say. Williams Companies The natural gas and oil pipeline company is firing on all cylinders, according to Wells Fargo. Analyst Praneeth Satish raised his price target to $70 per share from $67 after Williams' mixed earnings report earlier this month. \"WMB underperformed post-Q2, likely due to high expectations around new project FIDs,\" he wrote. FID's are final investment decision projects that involve moving from the project planning to execution. Despite the quarterly report, Wells Fargo says it's sticking with the stock thanks to several looming tailwinds. Satish called Williams' growth \"sector leading,\" and said the company is likely to see a lower cash burden under President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill. Williams shares are up 6.2% this year, excluding its 3.5% dividend yield, and the stock remains a top idea at Wells Fargo. RealReal \"We continue to like what we see from REAL,\" analyst Ike Boruchow said following the resale clothing company's latest earnings report. RealReal's earnings and revenue both topped Wall Street estimates, and Boruchow says it remains a top pick. \"At a high level, the model has course corrected, margin structure has shifted and top line is back to [plus double digit] growth,\" he said. And that growth still has room to run, he added. \"Resale is a clear winner in today's macro, and we remain bullish,\" he went on. Shares are up 47% in August alone. Spotify \"[Estimates] are coming down and there is nothing particularly incremental to get excited about. But, we'd argue this is the pullback for those that believe in SPOT's pricing power + bigger margin expansion setup into '26. ...

WMB underperformed post-Q2, likely due to high expectations around new project FIDs. ...

Weathering the tough moments that build resilience is less glamorous.\nDeveloping emotional endurance, or the ability to withstand stress or discomfort without letting negative emotions overtake you, can help that process feel less grueling and more like an opportunity to learn and grow, Columbia University-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy tells CNBC Make It.\n\"The more we understand that the frustration and struggle is actually a sign we're [learning], not a sign we're doing something wrong, it becomes a lot easier to tolerate,\" says Kennedy, a New York-based clinical psychologist and host of the \"Good Inside\" podcast.\nYou can get to this state of understanding by following these three steps, she says:\nKeep a visual handy\nIn a February Instagram Reel, Kennedy explained that learning happens between the space of knowing and not knowing something.\nYou don't always instantly gain knowledge where you previously had none, and the process of getting from Point A to Point B can feel frustrating, says Kennedy. When you start a new job, for example, you'll likely have to learn some new skills, make some mistakes and foster some new connections before you start to feel comfortable in the role.\nThe path between knowing and not knowing something is much more like a winding line than a straight and narrow one, Kennedy says — so when you feel frustrated, remind yourself that learning takes time. You can do this by drawing or looking at a simple diagram of the scenario, like this one:\n\"Having some type of visual for yourself is very, very helpful,\" says Kennedy. \"Every time you're trying to do something new, when your voice starts to say, 'Oh, this is too hard. I can't figure it out,' the visual gives you a different story. 'I'm in the learning space. I'm kind of exactly where I'm supposed to be. It just happens to be tricky.'\"\nEngage in positive self-talk\nIf you constantly tell yourself \"this is too hard\" or \"I'm never going to get there,\" you start to believe it. Shift your internal dialogue to something more positive, supportive and understanding, advises Kennedy.\nTry telling yourself something like this, she says: \"This feels hard because it is hard. I haven't figured it out yet, and I can keep trying. I can take a breath and take a break and come back when I'm ready.\"\nEven if you don't believe what you're telling yourself, going through the motions — essentially, faking it until you make it — will help, because the practice will help you feel more confident over time, she says.\n\"Self-talk is very powerful. How we end up feeling about something is a combination of the feeling and how we talk to ourselves about the feeling, and we can't change our feelings, but we can change how we talk to ourselves about our feelings,\" says Kennedy.\nPositive self-talk can improve your coping skills and build your mental strength, allowing you to put in more effort than you think you're capable of, according to a 2020 study published in the Journal of Sports Science and Management. It can increase your internal motivation and even help you enjoy learning more, the study found.\nTake on a small experiment\nStart with small goals instead of expecting yourself to quickly reach your long-term vision, says Kennedy.\nIf you set a huge goal and fall short of it, you're unlikely to try again anytime soon, she says. If you want to be more active, commit to taking a 20 minute walk three times per week instead of trying to hit the gym for an hour every day, for example.\n\"Take on a small experiment that feels uncomfortable for you: I am going to talk to my boss about those things that's upsetting. I am going to have that conversation with my friend,\" Kennedy says. \"Those are small experiments that tell your body, 'I am someone who can be in the learning space and tolerate discomfort.' The more our body learns that we can tolerate that space, the more we're able to tolerate it in other areas as well.\"\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

The company's segments include laboratory solutions and bioscience production. Within its segments, it sells materials and consumables, equipment and instrumentation and services and specialty procurement to customers in the biopharma and health care, education and government and advanced technologies and applied materials industries. Materials and consumables include ultra-high purity chemicals and reagents, lab products and supplies, highly specialized formulated silicone materials, customized excipients and others. Equipment and instrumentation include filtration systems, virus inactivation systems, incubators, analytical instruments and others. Services and specialty procurement include onsite lab and production, equipment, procurement and sourcing and biopharmaceutical material scale-up and development services.\nStock market value: $8.85 billion ($12.98 per share)\nActivist: Engine Capital\nOwnership: ~3%\nAverage Cost: n/a\nActivist Commentary: Engine Capital is an experienced activist investor led by Managing Partner Arnaud Ajdler. He is a former partner and senior managing director at Crescendo Partners. Engine's history is to send letters and/or nominate directors but settle rather quickly.\nWhat's happening\nOn Aug. 11, Engine sent a letter calling on Avantor's board to focus on commercial and operational excellence, demonstrate organic growth, reduce costs, optimize the portfolio, refresh the board and use free cash flow to repurchase stock. Engine noted that the company can alternatively consider a sale.\nBehind the scenes\nAvantor is a market leading distributor of life science tools and products for the life sciences and advanced technology industries. The company is comprised of two segments: laboratory solutions (LSS) (67% of revenue) and bioscience production (BPS) (33% of revenue). LSS is one of the three top life sciences distributors in the world (Thermo Fisher and Merck KGaA being the other two).\nBPS is a supplier of high-purity materials and is the leading supplier of medical-grade silicones. Despite being one of the few scaled global life science tool distribution platforms, the company has vastly underperformed. At its 2021 investor day, management projected earnings per share above $2 for 2025; and at its 2023 investor day, management targeted an EBITDA margin exceeding 20%. Now in 2025, these currently stand at 96 cents per share and 11.8%, respectively. Consequently, Avantor's share price has declined 53.96%, 59.69%, and 43.41% over the past 1-, 3- and 5-year periods, as of Engine's announcement Monday.\nEngine believes that Avantor's significant underperformance is a consequence of self-inflicted mistakes rooted in a flawed leadership team and framework. A complex matrix organizational structure and resultant lack of accountability have led to mass leadership turnover, including Avantor's CEO, CFO and both segment leaders within the past three years, contributing to a dysfunctional decision-making process and inefficient employee structure.\nThe biggest casualty of this rocky management team is LSS, which has lost significant profitability and market share to its peers. Specifically, poor capital allocation decisions have destroyed significant value. In 2020 and 2021, Avantor spent a total of $3.8 billion to acquire Ritter, Masterflex and RIM Bio – companies that were notably purchased during the peak of the pandemic when life sciences businesses were trading at exceptionally high multiples. Applying Avantor's next 12 months 10x multiple to the 28x average acquisition price implies over $2.4 billion in lost value on these acquisitions, contributing to the company's high leverage.\nOn top of that, despite LSS's ongoing underperformance and the need for strong leadership, from June 2024 to April 2025, LSS was left without a leader due to a non-compete lawsuit involving the hiring of its new segment leader, underscoring the operational dysfunction that has been taking place at the company.\nBut perhaps the nail in the coffin for this management team and board is that despite this cascading set of errors and the internal knowledge of these forecasted losses, they were still given a way out. In 2023, the company was approached by Ingersoll Rand to be acquired at an estimated $25-$28 per share, a 20%-35% premium of the share price at the time, yet the board inexplicably rebuffed this approach. Today, Avantor trades at just under $13 per share.\nEnter Engine, who has announced an approximately 3% position in Avantor and is urging the board to focus the organization on commercial and operational excellence, demonstrate organic growth, reduce costs, optimize the portfolio, refresh the board and use free cash flow to repurchase its own stock.\nEngine points out that Avantor's reported $6.8 billion in revenue was stretched across 6 million stock keeping units, while Thermo's peer segment achieves similar revenue with less than half the SKUs, indicating a large opportunity, specifically within LSS, to optimize the portfolio by concentrating purchases to improve inventory turns, rebates and margins.\nDivesting non-core assets is another way to optimize the portfolio. For BPS, certain facilities operate in periods of extended downtime, limiting growth. For LSS, subscale facilities in smaller geographies may be more valuable to a competitor, and the same goes for some of the assets purchased under Avantor's aforementioned acquisition spree.\nOn the cost discipline side, Avantor's history of poor M&A and its low valuation should limit its accretive M&A opportunities, and while the company is on the path to reduce leverage below 3x, the market remains concerned that once this is achieved, they will simply resume this costly M&A strategy. Engine argues that free cash flow should instead be allocated evenly to share repurchases and debt reduction.\nAdditionally, executive compensation is also a concern. In 2024, despite organic revenue declining by 2% and a 7% share price decline, the board awarded CEO Michael Stubblefield 110% of his target annual bonus, underscoring the need to align these management incentives with shareholder value creation.\nEngine believes that all of these changes would be best implemented with a comprehensive board refreshment. Adding directors with executive leadership, capital allocation, and distribution expertise to replace board members that have overseen years of value destruction, likely targeting chairman Jonathan Peacock specifically, should signal to the market the start of a new chapter. Engine believes that if these changes are properly implemented that Avantor shares would be worth between $22 and $26 per share by the end of 2027.\nAs a secondary option, Engine suggests that if a standalone path does not appear viable then the board should consider selling the entire company or splitting LSS and BPS into separate entities.\nWhen Avantor acquired VWR, which is now the core of the LSS business, it was valued at about 12x EBITDA, or $6.5 billion, and BPS peers trade at a median of 17x EBITDA. Neither of these businesses' valuations correspond to what Avantor trades at, roughly 8x EBITDA, and it's possible that a strategic path could become the best way to unlock this value on a risk-adjusted basis. If this were to become the case, there is likely to be both private and strategic interest. New Mountain Capital previously owned Avantor prior to its IPO and still maintains an approximately 2% position. Strategics, like Ingersoll, would likely be interested as well, especially at a significant discount to what they once offered. Engine believes that Avantor could sell between $17 to $19 per share.\nOverall, Engine makes not only a compelling case that major change is needed at Avantor, but also a clear multipath plan forward. While some of these changes are already underway: a new CEO is set to start next week and management announced a $400 million cost-cutting initiative, the sheer volume of change required here is unlikely to occur by Engine's 2027 estimate.\nEngine's plan includes strengthening execution, instilling a culture of cost discipline, improving capital allocation, evaluating the company's portfolio, aligning executive compensation to shareholder value creation and refreshing the board. Engine's plan is the right one, but this is a company whose top line and operating margins have been in decline since 2022 and refreshing a board, instilling a new culture, reversing declining revenue and operating margins and evaluating and executing asset sales, many of which cannot be done simultaneously, is something that will likely take much longer than two years, particularly with the director nomination window not opening until Jan. 8. Moreover, the kind of change that Engine calls for here is generally not the kind of change that comes from an amicable settlement.\nKen Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments.", "content_hash": "9f1467b03d758103e812bc5885280737", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Wall Street economists are fixated on identifying tariff effects, yet stocks either celebrated or shrugged off three warm and sticky inflation readings this week, laboring to hold near record highs. The S & P 500 immediately processed a moderately elevated consumer price index report Tuesday as solidifying the chances for a September cut by the Fed into a still-steady economy, logging on that day slightly more than what would become a 0.9% gain for the week. Notably, over the next three days — through a hot but noisy producer price index reading and a messy University of Michigan consumer-sentiment survey — the benchmark treated Tuesday's closing level just under 6,450 as a floor, testing it repeatedly and finishing the week right on it. The index has now logged a total return of 10% year to date, having more than recovered the near-20% tariff-panic collapse in April. .SPX 3M bar SPX 3-month chart The divide between optimists and pessimists on the market entering the second half of August is whether this action seems judicious or oblivious. The starting point for determining such things should be in assuming the market has it roughly right and isn't overlooking much of the important stuff. Whether the Fed \"should\" look through potential tariff-driven inflation, the market is trying its best to do so. As Bespoke Investment Group summed things up at week's end: \"Price has trended steadily higher in a tight range over the last few months, representing rather sanguine action even though much of the news flow has been negative. While politics plays a big role in the going narrative about the market and the economy, price ultimately tells the real story. Whatever negativity there is out there hasn't been nearly enough to interrupt the uptrend that's been in place since we made new highs in early summer.\" The latest push higher has not been terribly emphatic, or broadly inclusive, allowing skeptics to withhold style points from the rally. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the equal-weight S & P 500 tagged new highs this week before faltering a bit, a sign either of fatigue or late-summer indifference. Big rotations This week also saw some forced-seeming rotations, with the weakest laggards in the S & P 500 performing best and the Russell 2000 small-cap index making yet another lunge for its late-2021highs on all the anticipated-rate-cut energy. Neglected groups such as health care showed some life, the likes of Johnson & Johnson breaking higher from a long slumber, even before news of Berkshire Hathaway's second-quarter purchase of UnitedHealth shares jolted that name higher on Friday. These reinforcements allowed the overtaxed mega-cap AI glamour names to take a rest. Such rotations tend to support and refresh a rally while suppressing volatility, though eventually they can imply an exhaustion of leadership that may make the tape less stable than when the largest index weights are in firm control. From a certain angle, it could appear odd that the bond market is simultaneously assigning more than an 80% chance of a Fed rate cut in six weeks when equities are at records, valuations are full, crypto is melting higher, credit spreads are drum-tight and buzzy IPOs are rocketing out of the gate. Registering nominal appreciation for these flush conditions while still asking for monetary-policy help, Wall Street, in the words of the old Elvis Costello song, has \"a mouthful of 'Much obliged' and a handful of 'Gimme.'\" This is less a contradiction than it is nuance. The jarring monthly payrolls miss of two weeks ago came after the Fed had last called the risks \"balanced\" between labor weakness and revived inflation, and the latest inflation upticks weren't enough to offset the job-market softness. Not to mention the relentless White House campaign to browbeat Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower rates while auditioning dovish successors. And confidence on multiple rate cuts, after one in late September, is not as evident in market pricing. Perhaps the market is conveying comfort with its own ability to hang tough even in the absence of a Fed move next month, casting a 25 basis-point reduction in short-term rates as a \"Nice to have\" rather than a \"Need to get.\" More tangibly, earnings forecasts for the remainder of the year are on the rise again, albeit with the AI-propelled tech players the largest contributors. When profits are growing, credit markets are calm and the next Fed move is a cut, stocks tend to have little trouble holding their valuations. Historically, when the Fed resumes an easing campaign after a pause of at least six months (December was the last cut), stocks have responded well over subsequent months, based on this study by Ned Davis Research. There's no doubt the market sometimes takes credit in advance for a hoped-for future that might never arrive. It could turn out this is one of those moments. Economists at Morgan Stanley argued Friday that Powell in the upcoming week's Jackson Hole symposium address is his last best chance to push against market pricing of a September cut, believing that \"the Fed would prefer to retain optionality and, if anything, we look for Powell's remarks at Jackson Hole to be similar to the message from July.\" In other words, noncommittal and data dependent. One possible \"tell\" would come from the bond market's reaction to any data or rhetoric that makes a cut less likely. If the 10-year Treasury yield were to rush lower in the face of reduced perceived chances of a rate cut next week, it could be taken as bonds declaring a high risk of a policy mistake, with the Fed behind the curve. If not, equity markets should take heart. One answer to those confused by the strength of the equity indexes in the face of still-elevated policy flux and potential stagflationary forces: Maybe markets are still burning off the last of the relief that burst forth after a worst-case scenario was priced in during the spring sell-off. Similarities to 1998 and 2018? Around the time that downturn was underway, I repeatedly noted the rich history of sharp, severe corrections that result from a sudden shock, stop just short of a 20% decline and are not associated with a recession. Precedents include the 1998 hedge-fund blowup, the 2011 U.S. debt-downgrade scare and the late-2018 tariff/Fed-mistake tumble. Fidelity's head of global macro Jurrien Timmer tracks such patterns, and the current recovery is in synch with those of 1998 and 2018 so far. Clearly this is a small sample and these are close to best-case paths from here, but the echoes are pretty distinct. It's no longer possible to argue that most investors are still outright bearish or are fighting the market's four-month advance. Systematic and quantitative funds are back to very full equity exposures. But there remains a lack of aggressive participation by the broader group of professional investors, by some measures. Deutsche Bank's composite investor positioning gauge is up to the 71 st percentile over the past 15 years, not a very high reading when indexes are at a record. Saying that not all investors have pushed every chip they have into the market is not the same as arguing the market enjoys a wide margin of safety, of course. Seasonal factors remain challenging and the tape is probably due for a routine wobble of a few percent before long. But there's not much reason to argue if one arrived it would be the start of the \"Big One.\"", "content_hash": "211d28e62d51595fec2842c21e412b7c", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Samsung was selling devices with large screens, and iPhone fans were demanding a response.\nIt took Apple some time, but the company finally released the iPhone 6, breaking with previous iterations and giving consumers a large-screen option. The iPhone won.\nBut more than a decade later, recent smartphone sales and shipment figures signal that the Apple-Samsung fight has returned. And once again, it's all about the screen.\nIn the second quarter, shipments from Samsung surged in the U.S., with its market share rising from 23% to 31% from the prior period, according to data from Canalys. Apple's market share during the quarter declined to 49% from 56%.\nApple remains on top of the U.S. smartphone market, taking the majority of new smartphone sales in the U.S. It's often in second place around the world, but the recent slips points to turbulence for Apple for the first time in well over a decade.\nThat's one reason investors have sent Apple shares down 7.5% this year, underperforming all of the U.S. megacap tech companies other than Tesla. Samsung's stock, meanwhile, is up about 35% in 2025.\nApple reported a 13% increase in year-over-year iPhone sales in its July earnings.\nIn July, Samsung introduced a pair of innovative new phones that feature foldable screens. One model, the Z Fold 7, can effectively turn into a tablet, while the Z Flip resembles an old-school flip phone with modern smartphone features. They were added to Samsung's catalog of phones released this spring under its Galaxy brand, including a thin-and-light phone called the Galaxy S25 Edge.\nThe devices are also getting a lot of traction on social media, particularly around durability tests.\nOne user posted a livestream that showed him bending the Z Fold 7 over 200,000 times in a row. The video has been clipped and shared widely on social media, with one version of the clip accumulating more than 15 million views on YouTube.\nIn the past month, Samsung's premium devices, including the Z Fold 7, were mentioned over 50,000 times on social media, and 83% of those mentions were positive or neutral, according to data from Sprout Social, a social media analytics company.\nThe market share numbers aren't just the result of user preferences. Much of the shift in shipment figures in the June quarter, analysts said, can be attributed to tariffs, which are causing \"disruption\" in the industry as smartphone makers use different strategies to minimize the impact on their business.\nBut Samsung's gains also reflect the company's ability to offer a much wider range of products at different prices compared to Apple. That includes low-end phones, which accounted for much of Samsung's second-quarter U.S. improvement, as well as high-end devices that cost more than any individual iPhone.\nSamsung's Galaxy and Z phone lineup \"stretches from $650 up to $2,400. That is a massive span of devices,\" said Canalys analyst Runar Bjorhovde. \"There is an idea that you can target people at every single price point, and you can meet them at every spot.\"\nThe iPhone has pretty much looked the same since 2017 — a rectangular piece of glass with a touchscreen on the front, and a few cameras on the back. These days, the company offers a series of four slates ranging from $829 to $1,599. Samsung and others are starting to go beyond the so-called candy bar shape and experimenting with new form factors.\nApple is expected to start doing the same — beginning with a potential launch next month of a slimmer iPhone that will compete with Samsung's Galaxy Edge.\n\"Apple is clearly betting that its 5.5mm Air model is going to lift its fortunes as testing suggests a strong desire for the new form factor,\" wrote Loop Capital managing director John Donovan in May.\nJPMorgan Chase analyst Samik Chatterjee wrote in a report last month that Apple may release a folding phone next year to compete with Samsung's Z Fold.\n\"Investor focus has already turned to the 2026 fall launches with Apple expected to launch its first foldable iPhone as part of the iPhone 18 lineup in September 2026,\" Chatterjee wrote.\nTrying new form factors offers Apple the opportunity to sell devices at higher prices, according to Bjorhovde.\nApple's most expensive phone, the iPhone 16 Pro Max, currently starts at $1,199 for 256GB of storage and can go up to $1,599 for a version with 1TB of storage. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, which was announced last week, starts at $1,999 for the 256GB version and tops out at $2,419 for the 1TB version.\nChatterjee said he thinks Apple's version of a folding phone could start at $1,999.\nFolding phones finally mature\nSamsung's first folding phone was released in 2019, but got off to a rocky start. The initial launch was delayed after reviewers — including CNBC — discovered that the early devices would break along their folding crease.\nBut Samsung says this time is different, and that folding phones are finally ready to go mainstream, especially with respect to durability.\n\"There really are no longer trade-offs towards owning a foldable device,\" said Drew Blackard, vice president of mobile product management at Samsung Electronics America.\nThe South Korean company doesn't provide sales numbers, but Blackard said the Galaxy Z Fold 7, the latest version, had 25% more preorders than any previous Samsung folding phone and that sales are outpacing the device's predecessor by nearly 50%.\n\"Samsung with the foldable is able to actually optimize for innovation,\" said Bjorhovde. \"Try to be ahead, show that something is different, and there's a certain halo effect from that.\"\nAccording to Counterpoint Research, a firm that estimates smartphone sales to customers, Samsung's sell-through increased 16% during the June quarter, thanks to demand for high-end devices, including a \"slight boost\" from the slim S25 Edge.\nThe rise of artificial intelligence is also heralding new form factors for consumer electronics that could one day replace the iPhone.\nOpenAI in May acquired the startup of former Apple design guru Jony Ive for $6.5 billion. The AI startup plans to develop the next generation of hardware, and other AI startups have released pins, pendants and glasses that rely on users' voice to control the devices.\nSamsung devices, as well as other Android phones, get access to Google's Gemini, which is widely considered to be one of the best AI models alongside OpenAI's ChatGPT. Gemini has several features that users can't get with Siri and Apple Intelligence.\nBlackard said folding phones, with their larger displays, are well suited for AI. Google's circle-to-search feature, which allows a user to simply circle something on the screen that they'd like to learn more about, is an example, Blackard said.\nOn a Samsung folding phone, he said, users can still see the original screen with the content they circled, as well as another screen with supplementary information.\n\"It's much more productive being able to go back and forth,\" Blackard said.\nInvestors have worried that Apple's AI delays, including its next-generation Siri that's now scheduled to come out next year, could start hurting sales. But many analysts say that Apple's brand loyalty and lock-in will give it a period of years before iPhone customers start defecting for competitors.\nChatterjee told CNBC that Apple's strategy with devices is to wait until a technology is ready for the mainstream before embracing it. That time may be now for foldable devices.\nApple has \"never been about trying to be the first to market,\" Chatterjee said. \"It's about being watchful, seeing a technology mature, knowing that there are no big roadblocks to that technology adoption, and then moving ahead.\"", "content_hash": "0ff6aebcf834836ffa10f07c26b33ccd", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The S & P 500 is back at all-time highs as the bull case on Wall Street plays out. The artificial intelligence buildout is ramping up. Corporate earnings are topping expectations. Interest rate cuts seem inevitable, likely coming next month. On top of all that, the One Big Beautiful Bill will be stimulative for an economy where consumers are still spending. But the market's ascent at a time of seasonal weakness and ongoing inflation concerns has many investors worried. They fear that a stock market priced for perfection, with the S & P 500 currently trading at a 12-month forward multiple of 22, is vulnerable to some sort of setback. And that could come from anywhere. \"What's going to happen, I think, is some shock will occur. I don't know what shock, but some shock will occur, which undercuts the thesis of continued economic growth,\" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. \"And when that happens, I think you'll see a selloff in markets, and that'll probably be concentrated in those areas that look most overvalued right now.\" \"So, I think investors ought to be pretty cautious here, because what's going on is the market slowly getting more and more overvalued,\" Kelly said. Top-heavy market More than anything, it's the top-heavy nature of the market raises concern. Goldman Sachs pointed out this week that the top 20% of quality companies in the S & P 500 — those with massive cash piles and fortress balance sheets — are trading at a 57% price-to-earnings premium to the lowest quality stocks — a gap in the 94th percentile going back to 1995. In practice, that means that the megacaps — which already benefit from AI tailwinds — get a further boost from investors seeking safety from economic uncertainty. Yet, the influence the tech giants wield on the market is troubling in the event of a pullback. AI superstar Nvidia alone now accounts for roughly 8% of the S & P 500, the biggest weighting of any individual stock in the cap weighted benchmark going back to 1981, according to Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. The stock is easily a key reason for the bull market, after rallying more than 36% this year, surging more than 170% in 2024, and soaring more than 200% in 2023. But, if the bull case for the beloved stock falters, that could spell trouble for the broader benchmark. China, for example, is a key weak point for the stock, as any curbs on Nvidia's sales of its graphics processing units to Beijing will likely hurt the stock — and also the market. An incoming reversal? The top stocks look especially bloated when you consider this: While the S & P 500 has gained more than 10% in 2025, the median stock has only risen 3%, and remains 12% off its recent high, according to a note from Goldman Sachs this week. To be sure, that could set up the market for big rotations. Small-cap stocks outperformed their large-cap counterparts this week. Value-factor stocks also outpaced growth, while Nvidia slid and Apple advanced. Health care, a recent laggard, led the S & P 500. If the dovish outlook for Fed policy holds, or the macroeconomic picture improves, then the rotation trade could continue to work for investors. And yet, even optimistic investors continue to remain cautious, and are diversifying their holdings. JPMorgan's Kelly said he prefers assets with limited downside in the event of a pullback. The strategist prefers U.S. value stocks over growth, and said he's looking abroad to Europe, which he expects has further to run even after its gains this year. Some alternatives such as real estate could also add value to a portfolio, he said. Eventually, Kelly expects some \"violent\" reaction — a sustained bear market of 20% or more — is overdue for the stock market, whether it comes within a week or in the next three years. \"It's just imperative that investors diversify some of that risk into other industries and other regions in particular,\" said Nanette Abuhoff Jacobson, global investment strategist at Hartford Funds. Reversal beneficiaries This past week, Goldman Sachs identified some lower quality stocks with weak balance sheets that could benefit from a reversal trade, if macroeconomic conditions improve or if the Fed turns dovish. Here are five of them. Estee Lauder was one lower quality stock identified. The stock is higher by more than 21% in 2025 but is in the midst of a multiyear turnaround plan that could cost between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion.

Each of the three major U.S. indexes hit all-time highs this week. The records followed improved investor sentiment after fresh consumer inflation data supported hopes for an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve's September meeting. The S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9% and 0.8% week to date, respectively, while the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.7%. After this week's rally, we used the CNBC Pro stock screener tool to identify the most overbought stocks on the Street as measured by their 14-day relative strength index, or RSI. Stocks with a 14-day RSI above 70 are generally considered overbought, meaning they could see shares decline in the future. The table below shows stocks with an RSI above 70 that have also risen at least 5% week to date, as of Friday morning. Biopharmaceutical company Incyte and e-commerce platform eBay topped the oversold list with RSIs of about 80 and 77, respectively. Incyte shares gained 11% this week. The stock is up nearly 26% year to date. Wells Fargo recently upgraded shares to overweight and set a $89 price target, saying the stock's setup appears favorable ahead of Incyte's expected update on its myelofibrosis therapy in the fourth quarter. The firm expects the news \"will be positive.\" Myelofibrosis is rare bone marrow disorder. Shares of eBay jumped 8% this week, meanwhile, bringing its year-to-date gains to more than 62%.

Intel, with an RSI of 71.3, logged a week-to-date gain of 23% — its best week in more than 25 years. It's a sharp swing for the struggling stock, which saw its worst annual performance on record last year after it lost 60% of its value. The chipmaker's steep climb followed a Bloomberg report on Thursday that said the Trump administration is weighing whether the U.S. government should take a stake in Intel to support its efforts to expand U.S. manufacturing. Following the report, D.A. Davidson head of technology research Gil Luria told CNBC that government intervention in Intel is \"essential\" to protect U.S. national security.

The Wall Street investment bank says stocks like Sunrun are compelling. Other overweight-rated companies the bank is bullish on include: RealReal, Spotify , Williams Companies and Nextracker. Spotify Technology Analyst Steven Cahall says he's standing by the streaming music stock following its late July earnings report. Wells Fargo admitted the quarterly results weren't overly exciting, but said Spotify remains a top pick with too many attractive catalysts to ignore. \"[Estimates] are coming down and there is nothing particularly incremental to get excited about,\" Cahall wrote. Nonetheless, the analyst said investors should remain calm. Cahall is particularly bullish on Spotify's latest subscription tier, Super Fan. \"We think the next several years will see product and feature innovations, such as Super Fan, increase in videos, education, etc,\" he said. Shares of Spotify are up 64% this year with more room to run, Cahall went on to say. Williams Companies The natural gas and oil pipeline company is firing on all cylinders, according to Wells Fargo. Analyst Praneeth Satish raised his price target to $70 per share from $67 after Williams' mixed earnings report earlier this month. \"WMB underperformed post-Q2, likely due to high expectations around new project FIDs,\" he wrote. FID's are final investment decision projects that involve moving from the project planning to execution. Despite the quarterly report, Wells Fargo says it's sticking with the stock thanks to several looming tailwinds. Satish called Williams' growth \"sector leading,\" and said the company is likely to see a lower cash burden under President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill. Williams shares are up 6.2% this year, excluding its 3.5% dividend yield, and the stock remains a top idea at Wells Fargo. RealReal \"We continue to like what we see from REAL,\" analyst Ike Boruchow said following the resale clothing company's latest earnings report. RealReal's earnings and revenue both topped Wall Street estimates, and Boruchow says it remains a top pick. \"At a high level, the model has course corrected, margin structure has shifted and top line is back to [plus double digit] growth,\" he said. And that growth still has room to run, he added. \"Resale is a clear winner in today's macro, and we remain bullish,\" he went on. Shares are up 47% in August alone. Spotify \"[Estimates] are coming down and there is nothing particularly incremental to get excited about. But, we'd argue this is the pullback for those that believe in SPOT's pricing power + bigger margin expansion setup into '26. ...

Weathering the tough moments that build resilience is less glamorous.\nDeveloping emotional endurance, or the ability to withstand stress or discomfort without letting negative emotions overtake you, can help that process feel less grueling and more like an opportunity to learn and grow, Columbia University-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy tells CNBC Make It.\n\"The more we understand that the frustration and struggle is actually a sign we're [learning], not a sign we're doing something wrong, it becomes a lot easier to tolerate,\" says Kennedy, a New York-based clinical psychologist and host of the \"Good Inside\" podcast.\nYou can get to this state of understanding by following these three steps, she says:\nKeep a visual handy\nIn a February Instagram Reel, Kennedy explained that learning happens between the space of knowing and not knowing something.\nYou don't always instantly gain knowledge where you previously had none, and the process of getting from Point A to Point B can feel frustrating, says Kennedy. When you start a new job, for example, you'll likely have to learn some new skills, make some mistakes and foster some new connections before you start to feel comfortable in the role.\nThe path between knowing and not knowing something is much more like a winding line than a straight and narrow one, Kennedy says — so when you feel frustrated, remind yourself that learning takes time. You can do this by drawing or looking at a simple diagram of the scenario, like this one:\n\"Having some type of visual for yourself is very, very helpful,\" says Kennedy. \"Every time you're trying to do something new, when your voice starts to say, 'Oh, this is too hard. I can't figure it out,' the visual gives you a different story. 'I'm in the learning space. I'm kind of exactly where I'm supposed to be. It just happens to be tricky.'\"\nEngage in positive self-talk\nIf you constantly tell yourself \"this is too hard\" or \"I'm never going to get there,\" you start to believe it. Shift your internal dialogue to something more positive, supportive and understanding, advises Kennedy.\nTry telling yourself something like this, she says: \"This feels hard because it is hard. I haven't figured it out yet, and I can keep trying. I can take a breath and take a break and come back when I'm ready.\"\nEven if you don't believe what you're telling yourself, going through the motions — essentially, faking it until you make it — will help, because the practice will help you feel more confident over time, she says.\n\"Self-talk is very powerful. How we end up feeling about something is a combination of the feeling and how we talk to ourselves about the feeling, and we can't change our feelings, but we can change how we talk to ourselves about our feelings,\" says Kennedy.\nPositive self-talk can improve your coping skills and build your mental strength, allowing you to put in more effort than you think you're capable of, according to a 2020 study published in the Journal of Sports Science and Management. It can increase your internal motivation and even help you enjoy learning more, the study found.\nTake on a small experiment\nStart with small goals instead of expecting yourself to quickly reach your long-term vision, says Kennedy.\nIf you set a huge goal and fall short of it, you're unlikely to try again anytime soon, she says. If you want to be more active, commit to taking a 20 minute walk three times per week instead of trying to hit the gym for an hour every day, for example.\n\"Take on a small experiment that feels uncomfortable for you: I am going to talk to my boss about those things that's upsetting. I am going to have that conversation with my friend,\" Kennedy says. \"Those are small experiments that tell your body, 'I am someone who can be in the learning space and tolerate discomfort.' The more our body learns that we can tolerate that space, the more we're able to tolerate it in other areas as well.\"\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

While the couple is determined to maintain the theater's vintage charm, they're running it with modern sensibilities.\n\"Shankweiler's was a quiet backyard theater,\" McClanahan, 35, says. \"It existed to play the movies for its neighborhood, and that was really it. We're trying to elevate that and bring it to another level.\"\nToday, 91 years after it opened, Shankweiler's is still drawing crowds with new releases, community events and \"the best popcorn in the Lehigh Valley,\" as McClanahan says in his preshow announcement.\nTickets cost approximately $9 for children and $13 for adults, and in classic drive-in style, Shankweiler's plays a double feature every night.\n'If not us, who else?'\nShankweiler's has always had a special place in McClanahan's heart: \"It was a very personal connection, because I grew up coming here, so I had that drive to preserve a piece of my own childhood,\" he says.\nA lifelong film buff, McClanahan previously co-managed another drive-in theater, and started a mobile movie exhibition company during the pandemic.\nHe met McChesney, 41, at the drive-in he used to manage.\n\"He took my ticket, and we started dating maybe a year after that,\" McChesney recalls. The couple is now engaged.\nWhen a local newspaper reported that Shankweiler's could be sold, McClanahan knew it was time to make a move.\n\"It was kind of an 'if not us, who else?' situation,\" he says. \"I had the qualifications. We had the background, we had the blueprints to redefine the business. So who else was going to do it but us?\"\nAt the time, Shankweiler's was listed for $1.2 million, but after talking to the couple, the former owners settled on a purchase price of $1.05 million.\nMcClanahan and McChesney took out a $1,000,000 SBA 7 (a) small business loan, which required a down payment of around $112,000.\nThe owners agreed to finance part of the down payment, and McClanahan and McChesney \"scrounged up\" the rest of the money from their personal savings, retirement accounts, and contributions from family and friends.\n\"Because it's historic, because it's so special, there is that added pressure that we have to be successful with this.\"Lauren McChesney\nAfter the purchase, McChesney quit her job in health care to focus on reviving the theater.\n\"I thought it was going to feel a lot scarier to give up my previous career,\" she says. \"But as soon as I made that shift, it all just fell into place and made sense to me.\"\nJust seven days after finalizing the purchase, McClanahan and McChesney re-opened Shankweiler's in November 2022.\nFor the couple, failure wasn't an option: \"Because it's historic, because it's so special, there is that added pressure that we have to be successful with this,\" McChesney says.\nMaking \"just enough\" to keep going\nWhile most drive-ins operate seasonally, Shankweiler's is open 7 days a week between Memorial Day and Labor Day, and Thursday through Sunday the rest of the year.\n\"Since we had all these payments and we had to start paying our loan and we have bills, we had to be open year-round,\" McChesney says.\nMaking ends meet the first year was \"rough,\" McClanahan says.\nShankweiler's brought in around $300,000 in total revenue in 2023, and after covering all the theater's expenses, the couple paid themselves \"just enough to put groceries on the table.\"\nFor most of the year, Shankweiler's operates at a loss. The theater is typically only profitable during the summer months, McClanahan says, and their summer revenue \"carries the theater for the entire rest of the year.\"\nJuly is usually their most successful month, with a total income of $122,602 last year.\nSometimes, a major hit will boost revenue during the off-season. Shankweiler's ordinarily loses money in the winter, but the success of \"Wicked\" in November 2024 netted the theater $36,264 in total income for the month.\nAccording to McClanahan, the theater's main expense is film licensing: it comprises about a third of Shankweiler's entire operating expenses. Other major expenses include loan payments; utilities and power; food and supplies for the snack bar; and payroll.\n\"You have a ton of money going in, and then a ton of money going right back out,\" McClanahan says.\nDuring the summer high season, McClanahan and McChesney hire part-time workers to operate the snack bar and ticket booth, but they still do most of the work themselves.\nShankweiler's became profitable for the first time in 2024, with a total revenue of nearly $550,000 and a net operating income of just over $50,000 after expenses.\nMcClanahan and McChesney were able to pay themselves a combined salary of around $36,000 for the year.\nPutting the property to work\nTo boost attendance during the off-season, McClanahan and McChesney have had to get creative.\nFor Valentine's Day this year, Shankweiler's offered a special \"Date Night at the Drive-In\" event with a screening of \"The Notebook,\" charcuterie boards and cocktails.\nThe theater's annual Halloween trunk-or-treat event is a popular family outing with games, costume contests and sweet treats from local vendors.\n\"There's a lot of things in addition to the movies that customers have to look forward to when they come to our theater,\" McClanahan says. \"It's more than the movies. It's a whole night.\"\nThe couple is working on expanding the theater's reach by hosting daytime events like craft fairs, local markets and even car shows on the four-acre property.\nRunning Shankweiler's is a \"high-risk, high-reward operation,\" according to McClanahan, but it's worth it to preserve the magic of the drive-in experience.\n\"When the movies are playing and you're watching hundreds of people share this amazing experience, and they're having a great time and everyone's happy, it's like that weight is just lifted and you realize this is why we're doing it,\" he says. \"The community is coming together in this space, and we're facilitating something really special.\"\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

I was like, 'This is your home. This is where you're supposed to be in the world and this is where you will always be. I knew I had to move to Paris,\" Sanders tells CNBC Make It.\nSanders returned to Paris several times while continuing to work as a general counsel for a publicly traded company in Washington, D.C. At the time, she was earning $286,656 a year and lived in a studio apartment where she paid approximately $3,000 a month in rent, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.\n\"I didn't enjoy the work and the expectation to work all the time and I will probably be one of the only attorneys who says it, but I don't think it's that intellectually stimulating,\" Sanders says. \"I was deeply and truly miserable at the very depths of my little heart and little soul. I knew that it was not sustainable.\"\nThree years after that initial trip to Paris, Sanders quit her job, broke her lease and started the process of obtaining a French visa. She landed in the city the day before France closed its borders due to the covid-19 pandemic.\n\"The slowness of the world meant that France sped up. We were all operating from the same level of confusion, so the good thing is that I was confused by what was happening, but so was everyone else,\" Sanders says. \"I arrived the day before the lockdown, so there was no one and it was a complete dystopia.\"\nWhen Sanders first moved, she lived in a few short-term rentals before signing a lease for a one-bedroom apartment. She paid 1,550 euros or $1,815 USD and lived in it for two years. Since moving out of that apartment, Sanders has been living in a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment where she pays $2,540 USD a month in rent.\nSince Sanders signed a lease for what is called an \"unfurnished apartment,\" it meant that she had to spend money buying her own kitchen cabinets, stove and washing machine. She estimates that she spent about $5,000 on the kitchen and close to another $10,000 to make the place really feel like home.\nIn addition to rent, Sanders spends, on average, about 933 euros or $1,093 USD on expenses, which include household bills like cable, internet, renter's insurance, dry cleaning, electricity and gas, private health insurance, groceries, and a Navigo transportation card.\nShe also has an annual subscription to the Louvre, which costs 95 euros a year and a second museum card that can add an extra 50-100 euros a year to her expenses. Sanders also pays 1,069.20 euros, or approximately $1,252, annually to a guarantor service, which allows her to continue renting in France.\nNow that Sanders has been living in her apartment for over three years, she plans to revisit her search for a home to buy. She started looking two years ago, but stopped after touring many places that she felt were overpriced.\n\"With the advice of friends who have recently purchased in Paris, I am determined again. Finding the right place will be a grind, but I am tired of renting in Paris,\" Sanders says. I desperately need more space and I want to get a dog.\"\nWhile Sanders wants to set down roots in Paris, she also hopes to eventually buy a home in the countryside too.\n\"I don't think it would be nice to put a dog like a golden retriever in central Paris, where he doesn't have a backyard, so that is my dream,\" she says.\nLiving in France has also inspired Sanders to finally pursue her real dreams of starting her own fashion brand, Adriel Felise. Sanders says she's taking $200,000 from her business account and $70,000 from her personal savings and putting that towards her new business venture. That money and her income from content creation is helping fund her dreams.\n\"I love fashion and I'm so happy that I can now just say that and be upfront about it because for so long it was treated as something that made me less serious,\" she says.\nSanders is self-funding the production of her initial samples and prototypes, but hopes to raise at least $2 million and have her 10-piece collection ready for launch in 2026.\nWhen Sanders was working as a lawyer, she used to take walks around her office building and dream about starting a fashion line, and now seeing it come to life still doesn't feel real.\n\"There's still a part of me that strives and pushes for more so I don't know if I'm fully ready to say I'm proud but I feel like I'm actually happy, which I wasn't for so long and that's huge for me,\" she says.\n\"My goal and desire is to inspire women — particularly black and brown women — to just pursue their dreams and goals. When they do it does not matter. The most important thing is that they be bold, move wisely, and just go for it.\"\nSince Sanders has been in France for about five years now, she says she doesn't think she'll ever go back to living in the United States.\n\"I can't live there. I can't function like that. I can't go back to corporate America and holding my tongue every five seconds every day,\" she says. \"I wish I had had the courage to move sooner. I wish I had the courage to do it after my first semester of law school to either drop out or enroll in business school and do something different that would have given me more options.\"\nConversions from euros to USD were done using the OANDA conversion rate of 1 euro to 1.17 USD on July 23, 2025.

Do not acquire or be acquired. Software must work.\nThese are the first three of the 10 commandments splashed across bathrooms and breakrooms at Epic Systems' sprawling 1,670-acre campus in Verona, Wisconsin, just southwest of Madison.\nIt's not the wackiest part of working at the health-care software giant. Once a month, most of the company's 14,000 employees pack into an underground auditorium called Deep Space for a mandatory staff meeting, which some jokingly refer to as \"work church.\" Executives go over company news and objectives. They also lead a grammar lesson, such as whether it's OK to end sentences with a preposition and when to use \"who\" or \"whom.\"\nEpic's CEO is 82-year-old Judy Faulkner, who started the company in a Wisconsin basement in 1979 and has helmed the enterprise ever since. En route to building a business with $5.7 billion in annual revenue, Faulkner has kept significant distance from her tech peers, both physically and otherwise. Epic is about 2,000 miles east of both Seattle and Silicon Valley, and the company has never taken money from venture capitalists.\n\"I've described her as a female cross between Bill Gates and Willy Wonka,\" Dr. Eric Dickson, CEO of UMass Memorial Health, said in an interview. The hospital system is an Epic customer, Dickson said, adding that he's known Faulkner for around 20 years.\nWhile Wonka is, of course, a fictional character, Gates for many years was the world's wealthiest person, thanks to his enormous stake in Microsoft, before donating his way to 14th on the Forbes billionaires list. At the top of the leaderboard is Tesla's Elon Musk, followed by Oracle's Larry Ellison, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos.\nFaulkner ranks 430th, with an estimated net worth of $7.8 billion, based on what Forbes says is her 43% ownership of Epic. The publication lists Epic as among the five largest private U.S. tech software and services companies by revenue.\nEpic is best known for its dominance in electronic health record, or EHR, software. An EHR is a digital version of a patient's medical history that's updated by doctors and nurses. About 42% of acute care hospitals in the U.S. use Epic, putting it way ahead of Oracle Health, which is in second place at 23%, according to an April report from Klas Research. Oracle acquired its way into the market with the $28 billion purchase of Cerner, a deal that closed in 2022.\nEpic says its technology is used in 3,300 hospitals and 71,000 clinics and by 325 million patients worldwide. Starting Monday, thousands of health-care executives will descend on Epic's corporate headquarters for the company's Users Group Meeting, one of its largest annual on-campus events.\nAs ubiquitous as Epic's technology is across much of the health-care sector, doctors, hospital administrators, startups and patients have their share of complaints about the software's user experience and its interoperability, or ability to work with other tools.\n\"With half a million or so clinicians using Epic, there will be some who find it easy and some who find it difficult,\" an Epic spokesperson said in a statement.\nSome folks might question Epic's commitment to its third commandment, but there's no doubting the company's allegiance to the first one.\nFrom Epic's early days, Faulkner has been averse to the idea of running a public company and what she's called the \"tyranny of the quarter.\" She said she came to that view after researching public companies and reading shareholder comments.\n\"They were vitriolic, in many cases, because the only thing they were looking at was return on their investment,\" Faulkner told CNBC. \"Sometimes, there's a lot more than that.\"\nWithout the benefit of public stock, Faulkner's wealth doesn't multiply at the same rate as that of her fellow tech founders and CEOs. She's fine with that.\nFaulkner, who rarely grants interviews, agreed to sit down for a half-hour chat with CNBC at Epic's headquarters, where office buildings are themed, with many inspired by fiction, including \"The Wizard of Oz,\" \"Alice in Wonderland\" and the Harry Potter stories.\nThe interview took place in the Andromeda building in a conference room called The Cottage, which is connected to her office. Two of the walls are plastered with quotes such as \"The geek shall inherit the Earth\" and \"All lasting business is built on friendship.\" Faulkner's dog Tundra, a fluffy Samoyed, also made an appearance.\n'The Trust Protector Committee'\nFaulkner celebrated her 82nd birthday Monday. While she has yet to publicly disclose when she plans to step down from her role, Faulkner confirmed that she has a succession plan in place that ensures Epic will remain privately held and constructed firmly as she envisioned long after she's gone.\nFaulkner has never sold any of her voting shares, and that stock will be transferred into a trust after her death, according to Faulkner and Epic. The plan for now is that the trust will be governed by a voting committee made up of Faulkner's husband, Dr. Gordon Faulkner, a retired pediatrician; her three children, and five longtime Epic employees, though Faulkner said she might include some additional staffers to make sure enough voices are represented.\nMembers of the committee can't vote for the company to go public or be acquired, among other rules, as she has previously disclosed. Some of the provisions are less consequential, such as a recommendation that the trust's telephone hold music should be classical.\n\"I like classical music,\" she said. \"I think when I was a child that it was played in our house a lot, just on the radio, just on the record player.\"\nFor further safekeeping, Faulkner established an oversight board called \"The Trust Protector Committee,\" Epic said, consisting of three health-care leaders — all Epic users. Its job is to sue members of the trust's voting committee if they don't follow the rules.\nThe names of members of the voting committee and oversight board won't be released, Faulkner told CNBC, but she said she's identified who she would like to participate.\nAfter running Epic for the past 46 years, Faulkner has amassed her fair share of admirers and critics, with some in the latter camp even taking Epic to court.\nBut Faulkner continues to flout conventional business practices and has built Epic, despite its flaws and complexities, into the most powerful technology company in U.S. health care.\nReflecting on her approach to leadership and decision-making, Faulkner said, \"Just have the guts to do what you know is the right thing to do.\"\nCNBC spoke with two dozen Epic customers, former Epic employees, industry experts and people close to Faulkner for this article, some of whom asked not to be named in order to speak freely. Details about Faulkner's personal, educational and professional history were obtained from Faulkner directly, her Epic website testimonials, Epic, obituaries, news reports and publicly available records.\nSometimes when I do something that's tough, I think of my mother, who went to jail in her 80s for protesting at a nuclear arms site, and I think, 'I'm my mother's daughter.'Judy FaulknerCEO of Epic\nFaulkner and her two siblings grew up in Erlton, New Jersey, now a part of Cherry Hill. Her father, Louis Greenfield, was an independent pharmacist who ran his own store, complete with a soda fountain. Her mother, Del Greenfield, was a peace activist who was involved with the South Jersey Peace Center and the Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility, which shared in the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize for its work in preventing nuclear war.\n\"Sometimes when I do something that's tough, I think of my mother, who went to jail in her 80s for protesting at a nuclear arms site, and I think, 'I'm my mother's daughter,'\" Faulkner said.\nFaulkner's parents, who both died in 2007, are honored at Epic's campus. Employees can get ice cream at Lou's Soda Fountain, while Del's Nobel Prize certificate hangs in the hallway across from The Cottage.\nFaulkner discovered a love of math as a seventh grader, when her teacher would leave puzzles on the blackboard each day, she said in one of her testimonials, the short stories and anecdotes she shares once a month on Epic's website. She earned her undergraduate degree in math from Dickinson College in 1965.\nAfter learning how to program during a summer job, Faulkner then enrolled in the University of Wisconsin–Madison's nascent computer science program and was in graduate school there until 1970.\nAt UW–Madison, Faulkner took a course about computing in medicine that was taught by a pioneering physician, Dr. Warner Slack, one of the first people to recognize the promise of the technology within health care.\nFaulkner began working with Slack and his team, and she was tasked with developing a system that could keep track of patient information over time. She eventually built what would become the kernel for Epic, though it took years of urging from potential users before she would actually launch the company in 1979. In the interim, she taught college-level computer science.\nWhen Faulkner finally opened Epic for business, she did so with a small amount of cash from some colleagues at an initial valuation of $70,000. Now the company is worth many billions of dollars, though estimates of its valuation differ.\nSome of the original shareholders eventually sold their stock back to the company.\n\"They got very good returns,\" Faulkner wrote in a testimonial.\nAn accidental entrepreneur\nFaulkner has publicly described herself as \"the accidental CEO.\"\nShe told CNBC she read books and took daylong or multiday courses to learn more about management, business and leadership. But she didn't always follow their advice.\n\"I never got an MBA, which I think is a really good thing,\" Faulkner said. \"They would have taught me, 'Here's how you do venture capital.' We didn't do it. 'Here's how you go public.' We didn't do it. 'Here's how you do budgets.' We don't have budgets. We say, if you need it, buy it. If you don't need it, don't buy it.\"\nAt the company's Users Group Meeting last year, Faulkner took the stage dressed as a swan, with a plume of feathers in her hair. Every UGM meeting has a theme — this one was \"storytime.\" In costume, Faulkner told the thousands of health-care executives in attendance about her aversion to the public market.\n\"Why be owned by people whose interest is primarily return of equity?\" she said.\nShe's equally opposed to selling the business, which she makes clear in the company's second commandment.\nThat hasn't stopped other executives from trying to change her mind.\nIn 2017, at the Digital Healthcare Innovation Summit in Boston, former General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt revealed that he'd spoken with Faulkner about acquiring Epic.\nFaulkner shut him down immediately.\n\"It was a five-minute meeting — perhaps the shortest in history,\" Immelt said, according to a report from Healthcare IT News. The report said he'd also considered buying Cerner.\nFaulkner confirmed the encounter with CNBC.\n\"Others have asked to come and persuade us, and I've heard our staff say to them, 'Just leave your car running,'\" she said.\nFaulkner has said in testimonials that she's avoided buyers in order to remain independent and preserve Epic's unique culture, and she doesn't make acquisitions, calling them a distraction.\nBut no matter how much she loves her company and her job, at some point, somebody else is going to have to run Epic.\nFaulkner has remained mum about who will be her eventual successor, other than to say that the person will have to be a software developer and a longtime Epic employee.\nThe obvious choice, according to 10 former Epic employees who spoke with CNBC, is Sumit Rana, who was named president of the company last August. The 49-year-old joined Epic right out of college in 1998 and helped build the company's patient portal called MyChart.\nRana, who was a toddler when Faulkner founded Epic, has been participating in more high-profile speaking engagements of late, including representing the company during the opening panel at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Quality Conference in July.\nFaulkner declined to say whether Rana is the top contender for the job.\n\"That's the company's business,\" she said. \"Sumit is a wonderful employee, and he would make a good CEO, but we're not publicly announcing anything.\"\nWhile Faulkner doesn't say much about the company's succession plans, she hasn't been shy about her plans for her personal wealth.\nIn 2015, she signed The Giving Pledge and agreed to donate 99% of her assets to charity, a decision that was inspired in part by a dinner she had with Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett that year.\nBuffett created The Giving Pledge with Bill Gates and Gates' then wife, Melinda French Gates, in 2010, encouraging the world's richest people to give away the majority of their wealth.\nFollowing Faulkner's pledge, she launched a family foundation called Roots & Wings with her husband in 2020. Roots & Wings provides grants to nonprofits that support low-income children and families. Faulkner's daughter, Shana Dall'Osto, serves as executive director of the organization.\nFaulkner has been selling her nonvoting shares back to the company, giving the proceeds directly to Roots & Wings.\n\"I've never cashed a single share for myself,\" Faulkner told CNBC.\n'Bet the ranch'\nInstalling an EHR is an extremely complicated and costly project for health systems. If it doesn't go well, it could \"blow up\" the whole business, Dr. Robert Grossman, CEO of NYU Langone Health, told CNBC in an interview.\n\"We bet the ranch on Epic, let's be very honest,\" he said.\nFans of Epic say the company is fully tuned in to its customers' needs.\n\"They don't just operate and dial in,\" said Michael Mayo, CEO of Baptist Health in northeast Florida. \"They visit our campus. They're immersed here. They know our teams across our IT [information technology] component and our caregivers. They are in our facilities. And when we went live, which is a pretty scary time, they were in full force here.\"\nEach health system that uses Epic has a point person called a \"BFF,\" or \"best friend forever,\" who is available to answer questions and help solve problems. Epic doesn't outsource any incoming calls to third parties, the company says, so staff members are responsible for picking up the phone 24/7.\nFaulkner also makes herself easily accessible to customers, executives said.\nMike Slubowski, CEO of Trinity Health, which operates 93 hospitals across 26 states, said Faulkner always answers his emails within the day, if not the hour.\nShe holds recurring meetings with senior health-care executives by phone or video call to answer questions and talk through an organization's specific needs and ideas. Executives told CNBC that Faulkner takes copious notes and is receptive to feedback. If she doesn't have an answer, she promptly calls someone who does.\n\"She'll stop right there and say, 'Get so-and-so on the phone,'\" said Dickson, of UMass Memorial Health. \"I don't know what so-and-so was doing prior to getting the call, but it's clear that when Judy calls, you drop what you're doing.\"\nPete Durlach, corporate vice president for health and life sciences at Microsoft, said he's been in meetings with Epic staffers who have gotten these impromptu calls. Microsoft and Epic have been close partners for around two decades, a relationship that's gotten tighter as cloud and artificial intelligence technologies have advanced, he said.\n\"People definitely answer the phone when Judy calls,\" Durlach said.\nEpic doesn't advertise or have a traditional marketing department; the company has relied heavily on word of mouth. Faulkner has also proven to be an effective salesperson.\nArdent Health CEO Marty Bonick said that when he was debating whether to convert some of his hospitals to using Epic products, Faulkner ultimately helped sway him.\nArdent Health owns 30 hospitals and 280 outpatient care sites across six states. When Bonick joined Ardent in 2020, he said, roughly two-thirds of Ardent's hospitals were using Epic. Bonick said he'd never worked with Epic and wanted to make sure that switching over the remainder of Ardent's hospitals would be worthwhile.\nBonick said he told Faulkner that he'd heard Epic's product was expensive and difficult to implement.\n\"She came back with a presentation that she delivered personally, and spent probably over 90 minutes,\" said Bonick, who was ultimately sold on the conversion. \"I had to say, 'OK, time out. I've got another meeting to go to,' but she really was not watching the clock.\"\nGraveyard of competitors\nEpic is used by all 20 of the top hospitals from the U.S. News & World Report rankings, and by the country's seven largest health plans, according to the company.\nIts dominance has come with plenty of controversy.\nEpic faces accusations of anticompetitive practices in two lawsuits from the past year. One was filed in September by data startup Particle Health, which alleges that Epic has used its EHR market power to \"snuff out\" competition in other emerging health-care markets.\nEpic said in response it would \"vigorously defend itself against Particle's meritless claims.\"\nThe second lawsuit was filed in May by CureIS Healthcare, a managed care services company that claims Epic has engaged in a \"multi-prong scheme to destroy\" CureIS' business. CureIS alleges Epic has interfered with its customer relationships, blocked access to necessary data and raised unfounded security concerns, according to a complaint.\nAn Epic spokesperson told CNBC at the time of the filing that the company \"believes in free and fair competition, and we also believe our customers are in the best position to choose the right solutions to meet their needs — whether with Epic or by adopting other products and services.\"\nEpic's competitors have also long accused the company of being territorial over its data and impeding efforts to share patient information between vendors.\nIn a blog post last year, Oracle Executive Vice President Ken Glueck wrote that \"everyone in the industry understands that Epic's CEO Judy Faulkner is the single biggest obstacle to EHR interoperability.\"\nInteroperability, in this case, refers to the exchange of electronic health data from one health-care organization to another. Since health data is siloed, stored across dozens of formats and protected by federal laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, it's a complex undertaking.\nOver the years, startups such as Practice Fusion and DrChrono have tried to crack the EHR market with promises of greater openness and more user-friendly products, but they have never become more than niche offerings. Some failed completely.\nEpic promotes its own interoperability tools such as Care Everywhere and EpicCare Link, which allows customers and their affiliates to exchange data with one another. Epic also participates in larger data exchange networks.\nAttention to detail\nOne of Epic's biggest feats in its 46 years is managing to attract high-level tech talent far away from the nation's engineering and business hubs, especially given the harsh Midwestern winters in Wisconsin.\nThat's where Epic's headquarters comes into play. It's a campus that industry executives and former employees likened to a techie's Disney World.\nAll 28 office buildings are themed. They're clustered into mini-campuses, with names such as Prairie Campus, Wizards Academy Campus and Storybook Campus.\nThe offices are designed by architecture firm Cuningham, which has also worked on projects at Disney theme parks all over the world. John Cuningham, the founder of the firm, said he's worked with Faulkner for 30 years, and that she's always been very involved in the process.\nEpic's first campus, for instance, has more than 80 bathrooms, and Faulkner wanted to know the details of all of them.\n\"Each one,\" he said. \"Light fixtures, faucets, mirrors, wallpaper, tile, sinks. I mean, I was thinking, 'Oh, she'll last for 10.' She did all 85, and she still does that,\" he said.\nI went down the slide, like everybody.Warner ThomasCEO of Sutter Health\nOn Epic's grounds, a metal wizard stands in the courtyard of a castle, giant chocolate chips mark the entryway to a faux chocolate factory, and a hanging bridge leads to the company's very own treehouse.\nInside a building inspired by \"Alice in Wonderland,\" there's a slide that takes employees into a small room where everything is upside down. It's popular with visitors.\n\"I was kind of blown away,\" Warner Thomas, CEO of Sutter Health, a nonprofit health system in Northern California, told CNBC about his first trip to Epic's campus. \"I went down the slide, like everybody.\"\nThe buildings are brimming with trinkets, ceramics, mosaics and paintings that Epic employees get to help source. Faulkner recruits a small group of volunteers to go with her to local art fairs and buy decorations for the campus. Some pieces cost thousands of dollars, according to former employees.\nFaulkner said she had just returned from an art fair ahead of her interview with CNBC.\n'Everybody knows Judy'\nDespite the fantastical themes on-site, employees are tasked with very real responsibilities. Since Faulkner places such a strong emphasis on supporting her customers, she holds her staff to high standards.\nMost employees work in person five days a week. Hours can be long and burnout is common, former employees say. In June, The Economist analyzed 900 companies across 19 industries, and found that Epic had the worst work-life balance in the software and IT services category. Several former employees told CNBC their work at Epic was all-consuming.\nEpic said the average employee works between 44 and 45 hours a week, based on monthly time sheet submissions between June 2024 and June 2025. The company said its turnover rate last year was 7%.\n\"People at Epic are dedicated and work hard,\" an Epic spokesperson said in a statement.\nEpic workers are entrusted with big projects, expected to interact directly with customers and generally take on a lot of responsibility. For some employees, that includes working alongside hospitals as they implement Epic's technology.\n\"Some of these implementations really sucked,\" said Brendan Keeler, a former Epic employee who frequently blogs about the company online. \"So much of the success of an implementation was just a function of the politics of the hospital.\"\nEpic recruits the vast majority of its employees straight out of college, so its staff is relatively young. All new staffers go through extensive training, including a five-hour corporate philosophy class where they're taught how to be a successful employee.\nFaulkner said she used to teach the class by herself but that she now has help from one or two other people.\nFaulkner's influence is present in every corner of Epic's campus, in its product and across much of the health-care industry.\n\"Everybody knows Judy Faulkner,\" said Thomas, of Sutter Health.\nShe's still got a lot to do. The health-care industry is reckoning with rising costs, staffing shortages, the impact of AI and the Trump administration's hefty cuts in the areas of medical science and research.\nAnd Faulkner isn't ready to quit.\n\"It's interesting and it's challenging and it's worthwhile,\" Faulkner said.", "content_hash": "23a3801612cd3dade2afa9aa9e5b4e7c", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Others have started using publicly released information on their trading to influence their own investing decisions.\nNancy Pelosi is perhaps the most followed active investor in Washington, but she's far from the only person buying and selling individual stocks. The list crisscrosses political parties.\nThis week Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent delivered a strong message on members of Congress owning individual stocks, explicitly calling out Representative and former Speaker of the House Pelosi and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon).\nCongress has a big stock trading problem\nThis is far from the first time that owning stocks or other investments has raised eyebrows among voters.\nConcern over Congress members trading stocks was so high that it passed the STOCK Act in 2012, which explicitly prohibits insider trading and forces members to report transactions publicly within 45 days.\nThe STOCK Act is an improvement, but it hasn't stopped Representatives and Senators from investing in stocks.\nA study of the 117th Congress in 2021 found that 53% of Congress members owned individual stocks and only 7% didn't own any stocks or widely held investment funds, such as mutual funds, according to the Campaign Legal Center.\nOnly 2% used a qualified blind trust, which creates a firewall between investments and members of Congress, preventing them from knowing their investments.\nStock ownership is widespread across both political parties, with 54% of Republicans and 46% of Democrats owning stocks as of 2021.\nThose findings include trades by Congress members, spouses, and dependent children, including buys and sells made by Pelosi's husband, who she says handles their investing.\nWhile Pelosi's trading disclosures are closely watched, partly because of her husband's prescient options investments in high-tech stocks, her portfolio was far from the best-performing in Congress last year.\nCongress members generated juicy returns in 2024\nUnusual Whales tracks buys and sells by members of Congress via periodic transaction reports filed within 45 days of any investment exceeding $1,000.\nIn 2024, the S&P 500 returned nearly 25%, including dividends. However, according to Unusual Whales estimates, Democrats returned 31% on average, due mainly to tech stocks, while Republicans gained 26% on average, thanks largely to financials and commodities.\nSince periodic transaction report filings aren't provided in real time, Unusual Whales has to make assumptions, which could mean their estimates are off the mark.\nStill, according to its calculations, its estimated returns for the top 10 members of Congress in 2024 are pretty eye-popping and likely to make many investors jealous:\nRep. David Rouzer, Republican, North Carolina: 149%.\nSecretary Bessent supports banning Congress from trading stocks\nOn Aug. 13, the Office of Government Ethics reported that Treasury Secretary Bessent, a Wall Street veteran trained under the legendary hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller, had yet to fully divest holdings as promised in an ethics agreement signed in January.\nBessent responded by saying that he's liquidated more than 90% of the $1 billion holdings and that the remaining holdings are illiquid farmland that will be liquidated by year's end.\nThe disclosure renewed debate about what politicians and executive-branch members should be allowed to own as investments.\nBessent delivered a blunt take on the matter.\n\"I am pushing for a ban on single-stock trading in Congress,\" wrote Bessent in a post on X.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, given his role in the Trump administration, he specifically called out Democrats Pelosi and Wyden.\n\"The American people deserve better than politicians like @RonWyden and @SpeakerPelosi with hedge-fund level returns,\" wrote Bessent. \"Public service should be about serving the people, not getting rich.\"\n\"If any private citizen traded this way, the SEC would be knocking on their door,\" said Bessent.\nWhether Bessent's support for a ban results in actionable legislation remains to be seen, given that proposals have won mixed support in Congress over the past few years. None of them have become law.", "content_hash": "fa87a2dd3ea7bc77a531ae50b6eaab0e", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Analysts are optimistic about the traffic-driving initiatives put into place when Dave Pace was named chief executive officer in April, as well as the company’s profit increase and investment targets.\nIn the second quarter, total revenues were $283.7 million versus $300.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Same-store sales declined 3.2%, including a 5.5% decline in guest traffic.\nThat said, Red Robin’s sharpened focus on operational efficiencies, including labor improvements, drove a 280-basis-point improvement in restaurant-level profit margin during the second quarter.\n“Our operators have become much more disciplined in managing through a labor matrix,” Pace said. “That involves being confident and more accurate in their forecasting and then scheduling against their forecasting, which they've done effectively.”\nThe $9.99 Yummm value deal, launched in July, has shown early signs of progress toward Pace’s goal of driving positive traffic. The company had previously been reluctant to join the value conversation, but Pace said it is important to respond to the dynamics of the marketplace, including consumers looking for such deals.\n“The first step in building these layers was to address our weak competitive positioning and price point value offers. As we surveyed the competitive landscape, it was abundantly clear that price pointed value offerings under $10 are essential to help break through the noise to drive trial and consideration in today's environment,” he said. “The Big Yummm Deal has been thoughtfully structured to offer trade-up opportunities like extra burger patties, bacon, avocado, or upgraded sides and beverages designed to help mitigate check pressure while still delivering strong value to guests.”\nChief financial officer Todd Wilson said about 9% of guests are ordering the Big Yummm deal.\n“Which, from our lens, is a great thing,” he said. “It means people see the promotion, they see the value in it, and they're choosing that option.”\nTo further drive traffic, Red Robin is rolling out proprietary, microtargeting tools in the third quarter to engage guests “more personally, precisely, and efficiently” than traditional broad-based messaging. Pace said this strategy is critical for Red Robin to compete with larger, more resourced brands.", "content_hash": "fa14249cf7eb78ef6a9a77b6ed639b19", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The company joins the ranks of other organizations working to bring agentic AI, which is meant to take care of specific tasks autonomously or with little human intervention, to their customers.\nAgentic applications have become increasingly popular points of discussion in 2025, both for consumer-facing functions like agentic shopping and for backend business tasks like supply chain visibility and sourcing.\nMore from Sourcing Journal\n-\nRecyclers Rejoice: AI Learns to See What's Beneath the Seams\n-\nByte-Sized AI: Debenhams Launches Employee Upskilling Program; Aetrex's New AI-Enabled Foot Scanner\nAlibaba noted in the announcement that Accio has particular potential for small-to-medium enterprises, which often have limited human capital to devote to sourcing activities. Still, these businesses work to maintain complex supply chains with multiple suppliers, which is both time consuming and highly manual. Alibaba developed Accio Agent in an effort to streamline some of the most time-consuming pieces of the sourcing equation for its clients.\nAlibaba said it trained Accio Agent on 1 billion product listings and 50 million suppliers’ offerings and information. That, in turn, provides users with a wide breadth of options when sourcing products via the automated system. The company said its agent has the power to axe weeks’ worth of work from the sourcing process, consolidating the same tasks into minutes.\nUsers start by giving Accio Agent a task to research. While the query can be pointed at a specific product or category, the agent can also handle multi-faceted requests, researching various categories and suppliers simultaneously.\nSo, for instance, while one user might tell Accio, “Find me a supplier based in Vietnam who can make small batches of high-quality T-shirts with a six-week turnaround,” another user might tell Accio, “Find suppliers that can support a pop-up brand event in New York City. I need a supplier that can provide 150 staff T-shirts, a supplier that can quickly ship tents and coffee cups, a supplier that can produce tote bags for swag bags and items to put in the swag bags. The event will be ‘70s themed, and I need all products by October 1.”\nBased on the unique task it has been given, Accio Agent pores over available suppliers, then provides a list of qualified suppliers for each subset of the task it has been given.\n“Each supplier is carefully evaluated based on crucial factors, like operational history, international experience, production capacity, local market, track record and certifications,” a promotional video for Accio stated.", "content_hash": "68ee52323b1a8f2e23e113ee3d42b1eb", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Home sales fell to an annual rate of 3.89 million units while the median home price climbed to a record $426,000, tightening affordability and cooling buyer demand.\nThis convergence of rising inflation, resilient but watchful shoppers, and a strained real estate sector puts next week’s earnings from Home Depot (HD), Lowe’s (LOW), Target (TGT), BJ’s Wholesale Club (BJ), and Walmart (WMT), firmly in the spotlight. These reports are worth watching. Let’s find out more about these stocks.\nHome Depot (HD)\nHome Depot (HD) is one of the biggest home improvement stores in the world, worth about $405 billion. The company’s next earnings update comes out on Aug. 19, 2025, and most experts think it will show profits of $4.71 per share for the quarter and $15.03 for the year.\nIn April, Home Depot shared it made $39.86 billion in sales and ended up with $3.43 billion in net income. The results were just under what analysts guessed, off by $0.03 a share. Shares are up about 3% for the year to date and 12.7% over the past 52 weeks.\nAmong 35 analysts, the consensus for Home Depot is a “Strong Buy,” with an average target price of $423.67, suggesting a possible 6% gain from where shares are now.\nLowe’s Companies (LOW)\nLowe’s Companies (LOW) is a big name in home improvement, and has a market capitalization of $143 billion. Its next earnings update comes out on Aug. 20, 2025, and most experts expect profits of $4.24 per share for the quarter and $12.29 for the year, each up 2%-3% year over year.\nIn April, Lowe’s brought in $20.93 billion in sales and made $1.64 billion in net income, with earnings per share of $2.92, slightly better than what the experts expected. Shares are up 2% so far in the year to date and are up 6.1% over the past 52 weeks.\nThe average analyst rating is “Moderate Buy” and the average target price is $267.55, also implying about 6% upside potential from here.\nTarget (TGT)\nTarget (TGT) is one of the largest big-box retailers in the U.S. Its next earnings update is set for Aug. 20, 2025, and experts think Target will earn $2.05 a share this quarter and $7.54 for the year, down 20% and 15% year over year.\nIn its last earnings update for April 2025, Target recorded $23.85 billion in sales and made $1.04 billion in net income, or $1.30 per share, coming in about 20% below what analysts predicted. Shares are down 23% in the year to date and over the past 52 weeks.\nEarlier this year, Target announced its plans to add $5 billion in gross merchandise volume by 2030, expand its advertising business, and significantly increase the size of its Target Plus marketplace by five times. These initiatives aim to revitalize the company’s performance and steer the business in the right direction.\nEach year, Target pays a dividend of $4.56 per share, which is a 4.4% yield. Target has a market capitalization of about $47.9 billion.\nMost analysts rate Target as a “Hold,” with an average target price of $107.90, meaning they see a 4% gain from here.\nBJ’s Wholesale Club (BJ)\nBJ’s Wholesale Club (BJ) is a membership warehouse chain worth about $13.7 billion. The company’s next earnings report comes out Aug. 22, 2025, and analysts think BJ’s will make $1.10 per share this quarter and $4.29 for the year.\nIn its last earnings report for the first quarter, released in May, BJ’s said it made $5.15 billion in sales and brought in nearly $150 million in net income, or $1.14 per share, which beat what experts were expecting by a wide margin of 25%. Shares are up about 15% in the year to date and up 25% over the past 52 weeks.\nMost analysts are upbeat about BJ’s, with 18 calling it a consensus “Moderate Buy” and giving it an average price target of $125.44, a possible 21% climb from current prices.\nWalmart (WMT)\nWalmart (WMT) is one of the biggest retailers in the world, worth about $805 billion, with stores and online shopping everywhere. The company pays a yearly dividend of $0.94 per share, giving investors a 0.93% yield.\nIts next earnings update is coming up on Aug. 21, 2025, and most experts think Walmart will show profits of $0.72 a share for the quarter and $2.60 for the whole year. That would be a healthy jump of over 7% and 3% compared to last year.\nFor its April earnings report, Walmart reported $165.61 billion in sales and $4.49 billion in net income, or $0.61 a share, beating what analysts predicted by more than 7%. Shares are up 11.9% in the year to date and up 47% over the past year.\nThe consensus is very optimistic, with 35 analysts saying Walmart is a consensus “Strong Buy.” Their average price target is $111.85, suggesting the stock could go up another 10%.\nConclusion\nEarnings season for these five giants is packed with signals about where Main Street and Wall Street head next. With inflation still pressing wallets and the housing market tight, retailers showing growth and defensive strength look well-positioned to keep leading, while others may have to fight just to hold ground.\nChances are, we could see more positive surprises from value-focused names, while those relying on discretionary spending may face extra pressure. Either way, next week’s results are set to shake things up.\nOn the date of publication, Ebube Jones did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

What Amazon was doing, the executive claimed, was creating a one-stop shop that all customers crave. The obvious implication was that Walmart, the historical one-stop retail option, was not delivering on the promise.\nOn Wednesday, Amazon announced progress on what it believes is one important leg in that mission: the rollout to 1,000 U.S. cities of a same-day shopping capability where customers can buy fresh, perishable groceries, alongside regular non-grocery merchandise in a single order. The company says the service should be available in 2,300 U.S. cities by the end of 2025, making it possible for Amazon customers to order milk and fruit alongside, say, batteries or a camera—in a single delivery that arrives that very same day. Such an order wouldn’t carry a delivery fee for Prime members as long as it totaled at least $25 in “most cities,” the company said. Orders below that threshold will carry a $2.99 delivery fee. Amazon customers who aren’t Prime members will pay a $12.99 delivery fee regardless of the order size.\nWalmart’s stock dropped more than 2% on the news, and shed more than $15 billion from its market cap. The stock price of grocery delivery firm Instacart plummeted 11%.\n“The reason this announcement is so significant,” Wedbush Securities’ Scott Devitt wrote in a research note on Wednesday, “is that Amazon has yet to displace incumbents in the grocery category, at least for perishables. Grocery is the biggest retail category and still relatively untouched by the internet.”\nIndeed.\nIn an interview for my book, Winner Sells All, about the Amazon/Walmart rivalry, the current CEO of Amazon’s core consumer business, Doug Herrington, explained the appeal of the grocery category. “Selling a book or a TV is great and super helpful, [but] how many times do I buy a book or TV each week versus how many times do I buy a packaged goods item, or some toilet paper or some food?”\nIn short, if Amazon can start making a real dent in the grocery delivery market, customers will likely shop even more frequently at the internet giant. In fact, the company previously said that was the behavior it witnessed among customers in test markets last year.\n“This deepens AMZN’s customer engagement by strengthening a high-frequency purchase category into the Prime ecosystem, increasing stickiness and customer lifetime value,” Evercore’s Mark Mahaney wrote of the same-day grocery rollout in a research note to clients on Wednesday. He said the service could pose a threat to Instacart as well as Walmart’s same-day delivery membership program, Walmart+.\nA history of launches, pivots, and setbacks\nThe path to the grocery aisle has been a long and sometimes bumpy one for Amazon, with this week’s announcement marking the latest in a string of grocery-related launches, failures, and pivots over the past two decades. For those who’ve closely followed the company’s efforts in this area, Wednesday’s announcement might even feel like déjà vu. Amazon once ran a service called Prime Now that offered two-hour delivery on a limited selection of general merchandise, along with fresh and frozen groceries in around 100 U.S. metro areas. It was discontinued in 2021, with the company saying at the time that it was being folded into the main Amazon shopping platform.\nAmazon also offers the Amazon Fresh grocery delivery service, geared toward larger grocery orders, which it actually began testing all the way back in 2007. The service has gone through countless business model tweaks over the years as leadership has attempted to strike a balance between a price that’s attractive to enough customers while still supporting a cost structure that is economically sustainable. Amazon also runs a chain of dozens of Amazon Fresh grocery stores, which has a gone through phases of retrenchment and expansion itself.\nAnd of course, Amazon made its biggest grocery splash in 2017 when it spent nearly $14 billion to acquire the brick-and-mortar grocer Whole Foods, which now counts more than 500 locations.\nAmazon offers unlimited grocery delivery from both Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods grocery chains at a cost of $9.99 a month on top of the core Prime membership fee.\nAlong the way, Amazon has seemed intent in recent years on dispelling the notion that it has failed in the grocery space. At the press event in the fall, an Amazon executive said, “What most people don’t realize is we already have a huge established grocery business online … Most of the selection today are things like pantry items and household goods or what we call everyday essentials.”\nAnd on recent earnings calls, Amazon executives including CEO Andy Jassy have hammered home the messaging that this “everyday essentials” business is already a major player in the nonperishable grocery space. Company leaders recently disclosed that Amazon sold more than $100 billion in groceries and household, or everyday, essentials in 2024, not counting what sold through its Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods divisions.\nNow, with this latest initiative, Amazon is moving on to the type of fresh, perishable foods that customers really think of when they hear the word “grocery.” And it’s doing it in a way, thanks to years of cost-cutting under Jassy, that it believes is finally sustainable.", "content_hash": "f6fbd75e375013be428e91619f1a4c23", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The secondary share investment is on top of SoftBank’s commitment to lead OpenAI’s $40 billion funding round, which values the company at $300 billion, according to another person familiar with the deal. That round remains ongoing, with OpenAI recently securing $8.3 billion from a syndicate of investors.\nRepresentatives for Dragoneer and Thrive didn’t respond to requests for comment. Spokespeople for OpenAI and SoftBank declined to comment. All three firms are existing OpenAI backers.\nThe secondary share sale, which was first reported by Bloomberg, will give OpenAI employees a chance to get cash-rich amid a high-stakes talent war in the artificial intelligence industry. Companies like Meta Platforms Inc. are offering massive salaries to recruit AI talent from OpenAI and other startups. This year, several OpenAI employees have exited for Meta, including Shengjia Zhao, a co-creator of ChatGPT.\nAllowing employees to sell shares is an important tool for startups trying to retain top talent, without requiring the company to go public or be acquired. In some cases, early investors also use these deals to sell down their stakes, though OpenAI investors are not eligible to do so in this round, according to a person familiar with the matter. Current and former employees who spent at least two years at the company are able to participate.\nWith its participation in the share sale, as well as its previous commitments, SoftBank is making a pivotal bet on the success of OpenAI. In addition to those deals, the Japanese conglomerate headed by Masayoshi Son recently closed a separate $1 billion purchase of OpenAI employee shares at a $300 billion valuation, according to a person familiar with the matter. Negotiations for that deal started before talks around the $500 billion secondary valuation began, they said.", "content_hash": "d37ec8a3e4d3898c60e1ca5db7ffefca", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Insurers were up 0.9pc, after trading near record highs touched last Thursday earlier in the session.\nBritain’s Admiral hit a record high, rising 6.6pc after a strong first-half profit, while Aviva jumped 2.6pc to its highest since December 2007, after raising its interim dividend and reporting stronger half-year operating profit.\n05:50 PM BST\nInflation data ‘a strong validation’ of Fed\nHigher wholesale inflation in the US is a “strong validation” of the Fed’s repeated decisions to wait and see before cutting interest rates, an economist has said.\n“This [the latest producer prices index report] is a kick in the teeth for anyone who thought that tariffs would not impact domestic prices in the United States economy,” said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. “This report is a strong validation of the Fed’s wait-and-see stance on policy changes.”\nPeter Andersen, founder of Andersen Capital Management in Boston, said: “We have been too anxious to draw a conclusion that the economy is fine; it’s not overheated.\n“But this wholesale data does show that perhaps there is some inflation working and we shouldn’t be so quick to conclude, we need to cut interest rates.”\n05:40 PM BST\nFTSE 100 hits record closing high\nThe FTSE 100 hit a record closing high today, despite struggling for direction in trading\nThe blue-chip index closed up 0.1pc, at 9,177.24, with investors weighing better-than-expected UK growth figures and a surprise pick-up in producer price inflation across the pond.\nThe FTSE 250 ended down 0.2pc, at 21,801.67, and the AIM All-Share finished 0.3pc higher, at 759.71.\nIn Europe, the Cac 40 in Paris rose 0.7pc, while the Dax in Frankfurt advanced 0.8pc.\nThe Office for National Statistics said UK gross domestic product (GDP) rose 0.3pc in the second quarter from the first, slowing from a 0.7pc expansion in the first three months of the year.\nAccording to the market consensus, cited by FXStreet, growth of 0.1pc on-quarter had been expected for the three months to June.\n05:13 PM BST\nBessent’s ‘neutral’ interest rate is unknowable, economist suggests\nScott Bessent’s call for a “neutral rate” of interest has come under fire from an economist at Liverpool.\nProf Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool Management School, said: “I have some difficulty with Bessent and his argument regarding the neutral rate.\n“This is the rate expected to prevail when an economy is at ‘equilibrium’ [maximum sustainable output and employment] and inflation is ‘stable’.\n“Nevertheless, ‘equilibrium’ output cannot be measured accurately.\n“At the same time, a 2pc inflation rate prevailing over (say) four years is mathematically as ‘stable’ as (say) a 4pc inflation rate prevailing over four years.”\n04:34 PM BST\nBessent denies pressuring the Fed to cut rates\nScott Bessent has denied pressuring the Fed to make rate cuts, hours after wholesale inflation data was unexpectedly high.\nThe US Treasury secretary told Fox Business: “I didn’t tell the Fed what to do.\n“What I said was that to get to a neutral rate on interest, that would be an approximately 150 basis point [1.5 percentage point] cut. I did not call for them to get there.”\nEconomists define a neutral rate of interest as one that allows full employment and stable inflation.\nMr Bessent added: “The other thing that I said was that perhaps because they had bad BLS [Bureau of Labor Statistics] data in June and July [on employment] that perhaps, perhaps, a 50 basis point [half a percentage point] cut in September was warranted.”\nJulia Coronado, of the research firm MacroPolicy Perspectives, told Bloomberg: “It’s not really the role of the Treasury secretary to opine [on interest rates].\n“The fact that the most senior economic official in the administration is saying these things publicly is direct, public pressure on what he wants the Fed to do.”\n04:22 PM BST\nInterest rates ‘not to blame for slowing economy’\nWorries about rising costs, not high interest rates, are to blame for the US economy slowing down, a leading market commentator has claimed.\nMichael Hewson said: “All this chatter from the likes of President Trump, as well as many armchair critics comes across as a little reckless when inflation risks in the US are becoming increasingly two-sided due to the effects of tariffs.\n“You will hear no end of commentary from people insisting that the Fed is being too slow, and that may well be the case, however there is also the risk that they could cut too quickly, and be forced to raise rates again if inflation ramps up above 3pc in the coming months.\n“This is why talk of a [half a percentage point] rate cut in September [by the Trump administration] comes across as reckless at a time when tariff effects remain a huge unknown, and in a lot of cases have yet to be felt.\n“You only have to look at today’s [producer price index] numbers to understand that inflation pressures are far from benign.\n“The US economy may well be slowing however it’s not due to interest rates being too high, but due to concerns about rising prices.”\n04:06 PM BST\nUS companies poised to raise prices further\nCompanies are poised to raise prices for US consumers in the coming months as the effects of Donald Trump’s trade policies flow into the domestic economy.\nBen Ayers, a senior economist at US insurer Nationwide, said: “While businesses have assumed the majority of tariff costs increases so far, margins are being increasingly squeezed by higher costs for imported goods.”\nHe said that tariff price hikes were most obvious within metal and food categories, with readings for steel and aluminium – both targeted with 50pc levies – jumping in recent months and adding to cost concerns for manufacturers.\nMr Ayers expects more of the tariff burden borne by companies so far to pass through to consumer prices in the coming months.\nMatthew Martin, at Oxford Economics, said: “Tariff-exposed goods are rising at a rapid clip, indicating that the willingness and ability of businesses to absorb tariff costs may be beginning to wane.”\n03:51 PM BST\nWall Street recovers following inflation setback\nStocks have been recovering on Wall Street after being hit earlier this afternoon by today’s inflation data.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 index is flat, having fallen as much as 0.4pc.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 01.pc, having fallen 0.5pc, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 0.2pc, having been down 0.4pc earlier this afternoon.\nThe inflation data forced traders to second guess their widespread consensus that the Federal Reserve will deliver some relief next month by cutting interest rates. Lower rates can boost investment prices and the economy by making it cheaper for US households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment, but they also risk worsening inflation.\n“This doesn’t slam the door on a September rate cut,” but it may raise some doubt, according to Chris Larkin, of E-Trade.\nMeanwhile, the FTSE 100 is now flat, having dropped by 0.3pc earlier. The FTSE 250 is down 0.3pc.\n03:40 PM BST\nDollar rises after US producer prices surge\nThe US dollar has risen as much as 0.4pc against a group of key rivals today as a result of higher-than-expected US inflation.\nThe hot measure of inflation at the wholesale level follows the release on Tuesday of a better-than-feared rise in consumer prices in July.\nThe latest data has raised worries that tariffs could still stir up inflation in coming months and change the course of interest rate cuts for the rest of the year.\nYesterday, US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent urged the Fed to make a half a percentage point rate cut next month.\n“I think that [a half point cut] was never particularly likely, but presumably this [producer prices index] report quashes that,” said Matt Weller, global head of market research at StoneX.\nThe dollar is currently up 0.2pc against the pound.\n03:12 PM BST\nBond markets hit by inflation fears\nUS stagflation fears have seeped into global markets after the surprisingly strong inflation data applied heavy pressure to US bonds.\nGovernment bonds everywhere from Britain to Germany and Japan were sold after the unexpectedly large jump in producer prices.\nTwo-year Treasury yields, which track monetary policy expectations, leapt four basis points immediately after the data to 3.73pc as expectations for jumbo Fed rate cuts faded.\nMoney markets showed traders still almost unanimously expect the Federal Reserve to lower borrowing costs next month after keeping its main funds rate at 4.25pc-4.5pc since December.\nBut bets on a bigger half a point rate cut, encouraged by comments from US treasury secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday, quickly faded out of the market.\nRussell Investments analyst Paul Eitelman said: “Inflation is starting to come through. It’s not massive yet but that could certainly continue in coming months.”\n02:53 PM BST\nCongrats, you’re paying for tariffs, Americans warned\nThe latest jump in US wholesale inflation is proof that American consumers will soon begin “paying for tariffs”, according to Ritholtz Wealth Management analyst Callie Cox:\n02:40 PM BST\nWall Street falls back from record highs after inflation data\nThe S&P 500 and the Nasdaq retreated from record highs after stronger-than-expected wholesale inflation raised concerns about whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 31.4 points, or 0.1pc, at the open to 44,890.84.\nThe S&P 500 fell 13.1 points, or 0.2pc, at the open to 6,453.46​, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 63.9 points, or 0.3pc, to 21,649.211 at the opening bell.\n02:06 PM BST\nBorrowing costs rise as data indicates tariffs hitting US economy\nThe cost of government borrowing rose after US wholesale inflation was stronger than expected last month, raising doubts about the Federal Reserve’s ability to cut interest rates.\nUS producer prices – a measure of wholesale costs – rose 3.3pc annually in July, which was much higher than forecasts of 2.5pc.\nShortly afterwards, bond yields began to rise in debt markets in a sign that traders have doubts about the Fed’s ability to cut interest rates in September.\nThe yield on 10-year US treasury bonds rose one basis point to 4.25pc. UK 10-year gilt yields led rose by two basis points to 4.61pc following stronger-than-expected growth figures.\nThe rise in US wholesale inflation signals that tariffs may be beginning to push up prices in the American economy, which would make it harder for the Fed to reduce interest rates.\n01:53 PM BST\nUS wholesale inflation jumps as tariffs take hold\nWholesale inflation in the US lurched higher in a sign Donald Trump’s tariff campaign is impacting the American economy.\nUS stocks fell in premarket trading after wholesale inflation was stronger than expected last month, dampening hopes for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in September.\nUS producer prices bounced by 0.9pc in July compared to June, government data showed, which was the highest in three years and well above the 0.2pc expected by analysts.\nData from the Labor Department showed the producer price index rose 3.3pc compared to the same month last year, compared to forecasts of 2.5pc.\nProducer prices measure wholesale inflation and are often a precursor to rises in consumer prices. The data also serves as an early indicator of the impact of Donald Trump’s tariffs on the US economy.\nIn premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.4pc while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 declined 0.6pc.\n01:44 PM BST\nBritain’s economy poised to weaken further, says Morgan Stanley\nBritain’s economy likely faces a further weakening in growth, a Wall Street bank has said, raising the chances of an interest rate cut by the Bank of England.\nMorgan Stanley said it would stick with its forecast for 0.1pc quarterly growth in the second half of the year.\nChief UK economist Bruna Skarica said the Bank of England’s “reluctance to cut further and the Budget uncertainty, paired with the global growth slowdown” would hit the economy.\nShe said there was “a lot to like” from the Government’s efforts to reform planning and boost investment.\nShe said: “Cyclically, however, our message is simple – interest rates are too high for a sustained and broad-based growth uptick.”\nShe said “softer underlying details and the likely softening of the growth momentum from here” would keep in play the possibility of a November rate cut by the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).\nShe added: “If the Government ensures that the autumn Budget does not repeat the 2024 slew of inflation-boosting policies, and measured inflation falls through 2026, we think the MPC will acknowledge the need to cut rates amid the ongoing build-up of slack.\n“If that is not the case, we will see more of the same stagflationary dynamics, we think.”\n01:14 PM BST\nGrowth slowdown because of Reeves’s choices, say Tories\nThe shadow chancellor said the slowdown in Britain’s economic growth was “not by accident”.\nMel Stride said: “That’s because of the choices the chancellor has taken, whacking taxes on businesses, stoking inflation through borrowing and spending lots of money, keeping interest rates higher than they would otherwise have been.”\n12:50 PM BST\nUS stocks muted ahead of wholesale inflation data\nUK investors are not the only people examining economic data closely today.\nWall Street was muted in premarket trading ahead of wholesale inflation figures which could indicate whether tariffs are beginning to put pressure on prices in the US.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq have hit record highs in the previous two sessions, and blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average is within striking distance of an all-time high amid hopes the Federal Reserve will cut rates in September.\nTraders are fully pricing in a quarter-point rate cut by the central bank next month, with reductions also expected to follow in October and December.\nThe producer price index for July, measuring inflation on wholesale prices, could upend those expectations.\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were little changed in premarket trading, while the Dow was down 0.1pc.\n12:05 PM BST\nFTSE 100 falls amid slump in economic growth\nThe FTSE 100 edged lower after the latest decline in economic growth.\nThe blue-chip index was down 0.1pc, after three consecutive sessions of gains, while the domestically focused FTSE 250 dropped also 0.1pc.\nBritain’s economy slowed less than expected despite US trade tariffs and a weaker jobs market, prompting traders to reduce bets on cuts to interest rates this year.\nGeorge Brown, senior economist at Schroders, said much of the slowdown was due to manufacturers front-loading goods in the previous quarter to avoid tariffs.\nHe said: “This drag should ease in the third quarter, even against a tougher global trade backdrop.\n“We expect the Bank of England to keep rates on hold for the remainder of the year.”\nThe energy sector was the main drag on the FTSE 100, which Harbour Energy falling 4.6pc and oil majors Shell and BP each dropping more than 1pc.\nAmong individual stocks, British Gas owner Centrica rose 2.9pc after announcing it will jointly buy Britain’s biggest gas import terminal from National Grid on the Isle of Grain in Kent for £1.5bn.\nInsurer Aviva jumped 3.5pc to a 17-year high after raising its interim dividend and reporting a 22pc rise in half-year operating profit.\n11:46 AM BST\nBritain’s growth per head lags behind Italy\nWhether Sir Keir Starmer has met his pledge to have the fastest growing economy in the G7 depends on how you cut the numbers.\nAfter the 0.3pc expansion in the second quarter, Britain’s overall GDP growth during the first half of the year was the fastest in the group of advanced economies, rising by 1.1pc, ahead of the US and Canada at 0.6pc and France on 0.4pc.\nHowever, when measuring on GDP per capita, Britain lags behind Japan, the US and even Italy.\nA higher GDP per capita generally suggests a higher average income and a greater capacity for a country to provide for its citizens.\nOne accusation made against governments in recent years has been that GDP growth has been propped up by rising migration.\nPranesh Narayanan of the IPPR think tank said GDP per capita was a better way of measuring economic benefit but said it was hard to “project what is going to happen”, pointing to uncertainty in the US and Europe.\nHe said: “Population projections are set to go down and there will be a slowing down of migration flows in the data.\n“That is also going to mean that those per capita growth figure does improve. If you have got higher growth rates also now through some of the policy initiatives that Labour have done, you can see how it is possible for GDP per capita to increase.\n“But it is all uncertain how it plays out.”\n11:15 AM BST\nBrexit benefit as UK growth outstrips EU\nBritain’s growth more than halved in the second quarter but it remained ahead of the eurozone, latest figures show.\nGDP in the single currency bloc rose by 0.1pc in the second quarter of the year.\nEconomist Julian Jessop said was an example of a “Brexit benefit” as the UK was less exposed to the impact of Donald Trump’s tariff war.\n10:51 AM BST\nThe dangerous driver behind Britain’s growth\nBritain has become dangerously reliant on public spending to fuel the economy.\nGrowth slowed in the three months to June, with the economy expanding by 0.3pc compared with 0.7pc in the first quarter of 2025.\nHowever, it is still better than the 0.1pc expected by analysts and a figure that will be welcomed by Rachel Reeves, with GDP per person – a proxy for living standards – also seeing growth in the first half of this year.\nHowever, scratch below the surface and it’s clear that the factors behind this growth are unsustainable.\n10:34 AM BST\nConsumers reluctant to open their wallets, warn economists\nConsumers are showing signs of “reluctance”, economists have warned after the latest slowdown in UK growth.\nThe ONS said household spending growth was weak in the three months to June, up just 0.1pc. Meanwhile, business investment fell by 4pc from the first quarter.\nThomas Pugh, economist at accountants RSM UK, said: “The continued reluctance of consumers to open their wallets is concerning.\n“We don’t expect growth to pick up much from here as continued consumer caution, weaker global demand and tax increases all continue to drag.”\n10:10 AM BST\nStarmer’s pre-election growth pledge under threat\nSir Keir Starmer’s pledge to make Britain the fastest-growing economy in the G7 has been put at risk by the latest slowdown in GDP.\nThe Prime Minister made the promise before the election last year but has since watered down the target to an “aim”.\nBritain’s economy grew by 0.3pc in the second quarter of the year, according to the ONS, which was sharply lower than 0.7pc recorded in the first three months of 2025.\nSimon French, chief economist at Panmure Liberum, said Britain was “middle of the pack” a year into the Labour government, with 0.7pc growth per capita.\nHe said the trend “has been on an improving profile in the first half of the year as population growth slows and aggregate GDP growth picked up”.\nSanjay Raja, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said Britain was “on course to become the second fastest growing economy in the G7 (after claiming the top prize in the first quarter of 2025)”, missing Sir Keir’s target.\n09:45 AM BST\nDebt-laden Italy now better for living standards than Britain\nBritain’s living standards fell behind those in Italy for the first time since 2001 in a fresh blow to Rachel Reeves’s efforts to boost economic growth and renew the nation’s competitiveness.\nSlow growth, rising worklessness and high inflation are all damaging Britain, raising fears that the UK is losing its status as a rich nation at the same as Italy shakes off its image as an economic basket case.\nOnce adjusted for the cost of living, GDP per capita – a critical measure of wellbeing, and a favoured target of Sir Keir Starmer’s Government – is now higher in Italy than Britain.\n09:24 AM BST\nEconomic growth beat expectations, insists Reeves\nRachel Reeves has said that today’s GDP figures “show that the economy beat expectations in the second quarter of this year”.\nSpeaking at a construction site in Doncaster, the chancellor said “there’s still more to do to make sure that people in all parts of the country benefit” from growth.\nShe said: “We are the fastest-growing economy in the G7 for the first half of this year, with a GDP growth of 0.3pc this quarter, and that’s after GDP growth of 0.7pc the quarter before that.\n“I recognise there’s still more to do to make sure that people in all parts of the country benefit from that growth, but since the general election, when I became chancellor, the economy has grown by 1.2pc and GDP per capita – so for every person in the country – GDP per capita is up by 0.7pc.\n“So, encouraging numbers today but, of course, we need to build on that to make sure people in all parts of the country are better-off.”\n09:09 AM BST\n‘Stuttering’ economy has lost momentum, say analysts\nBritain’s economy has “anaemic growth with little sign of improvement”, according to analysts.\nMichael Brown of Pepperstone said the ONS figures “pointed to the economy having lost momentum once again in the three months to June”.\nSamuel Edwards of payments firm Ebury said: “Today’s figures show an economy stuttering in the face of considerable uncertainty.”\nLindsay James, an analyst at Quilter, said the “encouraging growth seen in the first quarter was somewhat of a mirage and unlikely to be repeated anytime soon”.\nHe said: “GDP growth in the second quarter has dropped to 0.3pc, and the UK appears to be stuck back where it was – anaemic growth with little sign of improvement. Although today’s GDP data is slightly better than expected and June’s growth came in at 0.4pc, figures released earlier this week highlight where a lot of the issues lie.\n“The labour market is weakening, the Government appears to be planning for additional tax hikes in the autumn and global factors make business planning difficult.\n“None of these issues carry easy fixes and there are very few short-term solutions. With global growth set to slow at the same time as this slowdown in the UK, the picture is only becoming more challenging.\n“Investors too continue to be fairly pessimistic on UK growth despite that stellar first quarter. In our own survey of global fund managers, expectations for real GDP growth in the UK for 2025 sit at 0.9pc, suggesting that very little growth will be eked out in the second half of this year.”\n08:44 AM BST\nWatch: Reeves admits economy ‘trapped in a cycle of low growth’\nRachel Reeves admitted Britain’s economy has “got stuck” in a video released after data showing growth more than halved in the second quarter of the year.\nThe chancellor said the economy had been “trapped in a cycle of low growth, repressed investment and stagnant incomes”.\nShe said there is “more to do” and nodded to her upcoming Budget in the autumn, insisting she does not “accept that decline is inevitable”.\nShe is expected to raise taxes at the fiscal event to steady the public finances.\n08:33 AM BST\nBritain faces tax rises as growth halves\nBritain will face tax rises in the autumn following the latest growth figures, economists have warned.\nGDP expanded by 0.3pc in the second quarter, which was better than than analysts had forecast, although less than half the growth of 0.7pc in the first three months of the year.\nRuth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the “new-found momentum will soon fade”.\nShe said: “We doubt the economy will maintain this pace of growth in the third quarter.\n“The weak global economy will remain a drag on UK GDP growth for a while yet.\n“The full drag on business investment from April’s tax rises has yet to be felt. And the ongoing speculation about further tax rises in the Autumn Budget will probably keep consumers in a cautious mood.”\nShe added: “With policy choices and higher market rates eroding the Chancellor’s already-slim fiscal headroom, we doubt this will be enough to prevent tax rises in the Autumn Budget.”\n08:18 AM BST\nGovernment spending is main driver of economic growth\nGovernment spending was the biggest contributor to Britain’s economic growth in the second quarter of the year\nThe Office for National Statistics said government spending rose by 1.2pc compared to the previous three months.\nDeutsche Bank’s chief UK economist Sanjay Raja said “there’s much to be desired” from the underlying growth data.\nHe said: “Public consumption and investment shot up 2pc on the quarter and was the largest contributor to GDP (adding 0.5pp to quarterly GDP).\n“We also saw a further build up of inventories in spring as President Trump’s trade war began – stocks added 0.2 percentage points to GDP growth.\n“And most surprisingly, net trade was also a positive contributor to growth, outpacing almost all expectations.”\nHe added: “To be sure, the economy is growing. Positive momentum is brewing. But animal spirits remain tepid.\n“While the chancellor is poised to focus her Budget on improving productivity – a very welcome focus for the UK – Number 11 should also prioritise lifting household and business confidence to sustain the UK’s outperformance.”\n08:05 AM BST\nUK stocks slump as growth halved\nThe FTSE 100 slipped at the open after Britain’s economic growth was cut in half in the second quarter of the year.\nThe UK’s flagship stock index dropped 0.3pc to 9,134.72 after the latest GDP figures, which were better than analysts had forecast.\nThe better-than-expected growth meant traders reduced bets on the Bank of England cutting interest rates.\nThe mid-cap FTSE 250 declined by 0.2pc to 21,816.44.\n07:58 AM BST\nTraders scale back bets on interest rate cuts\nMoney markets indicate there is less chance that the Bank of England will cut interest rates again before the end of the year after the latest UK growth figures.\nTraders are betting that there is a 66pc chance that policymakers will lower borrowing costs again over the next three meetings, compared to odds of 79pc at the start of the week.\n07:48 AM BST\nGrowth figures ‘not good enough’\nEconomists appeared divided on how to read the latest growth data from the ONS.\nSimon French of Panmure Liberum said Britain had enjoyed “decent” growth in June, which deliver growth of 0.3pc for the second quarter.\nMohamed El-Erian of Allianz said the data was “relatively upbeat” but Julian Jessop of the Institute of Economic Affairs warned it was “good news, but not good enough”.\nHe said Britain’s economy remained “too weak to fix the public finances, and there are already signs that momentum is fading again as a tight Autumn Budget looms”.\n07:38 AM BST\nPound rises as growth better than expected\nThe value of the pound rose after Britain’s economy performed better than expected in the second quarter of the year.\nAlthough economic growth more than halved from the previous quarter to 0.3pc, this was better than the miserly 0.1pc that had been forecast by analysts.\nSterling rose 0.2pc against the dollar to $1.359 and gained 0.1pc versus the euro to €1.161 as the stronger growth made interest rate cuts by the Bank of England less likely.\nICAEW economics director Suren Thiru said: “While these stronger than expected figures may not ease concerns among rate-setters over the health of the UK economy, a September interest rate cut remains implausible given mounting concerns over rising inflation.”\nHe added: “The economy lost some momentum in the second quarter as several sectors weakened under pressure from ‘awful April’s’ surge in costs and the explosion of global trade turbulence, despite a robust return to growth in June.\n“Following the bumper first three months of 2025, this second quarter slowdown offers a more authentic insight into the UK’s underlying growth path given persistent problems with anaemic productivity and poor public finances.\n“The UK’s economic performance in the third quarter may be similarly modest with higher inflation and anxiety over more tax hikes in this Autumn’s Budget likely to mean more caution on spending, despite lower interest rates.”\n07:29 AM BST\nBritain avoids contraction after strong June\nA strong June saved the chancellor was saved from an overall downturn in economic growth during the second quarter of the year.\nUK GDP expanded by 0.4pc during the month, which was better than the 0.2pc projected by economists.\nIt came after the economy contracted by 0.1pc in May and by 0.1pc in April.\nThe April figure was revised higher from a previous estimate of a 0.3pc decline.\n07:23 AM BST\nReeves says ‘more to do’ on economy\nRachel Reeves said there is “more to do” to boost the economy after growth more than halved in the second quarter of the year.\nThe chancellor said: “Today’s economic figures are positive with a strong start to the year and continued growth in the second quarter. But there is more to do to deliver an economy that works for working people.\n“I know that the British economy has the key ingredients for success but has felt stuck for too long.\n“That is why we’re investing to rebuild our national infrastructure, cutting back on red tape to get Britain building again and boosting the national minimum wage to make work pay. There’s more to do and today’s figures only fuel my ambition to deliver on our Plan for Change.”\n07:21 AM BST\nTrump tariffs distorted prior growth figures, says ONS\nDonald Trump’s tariff campaign artificially boosted growth in the first quarter of the year, the Office for National Statistics said, as the economy slowed down in the three months to June.\nONS director of economic statistics Liz McKeown said: “Growth slowed in the second quarter after a strong start to the year.\n“The economy was weak across April and May, with some activity having been brought forward to February and March ahead of stamp duty and tariff changes, but then recovered strongly in June.\n“Across the second quarter as a whole growth was led by services, with computer programming, health and vehicle leasing growing.\n“Construction also increased while production fell back slightly.\n“Growth for the quarter was also boosted by updated source data for April, which while still showing a contraction, was better than initially estimated.\n“Services also drove growth in June with scientific R&D, engineering and car sales all having a strong month.\n“Within production, which recovered, manufacture of electronics performed especially well.”\n07:04 AM BST\nGood morning\nThanks for joining me. Britain’s economic growth was cut in half in the second quarter of the year, official figures show, as businesses grappled with the effects of Rachel Reeves’s tax raid.\nGross domestic product (GDP) – the closely watched measure of economic growth – weakened from 0.7pc in the first quarter to just 0.3pc in the three months to June, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nThe performance was better than analyst projections of a decline to 0.1pc.\nThe slowdown in Britain’s economy comes after the chancellor imposed increases in national insurance contributions on employers in April, as well as rises in the national minimum wage.\nMs Reeves will use her upcoming Budget to try to raise Britain’s dire productivity growth, which has fallen sharply since the financial crisis and threatens to blow an even bigger hole in the public finances.\nThe decline in growth was also partially due to the unwinding of an economic surge in the three months to March as companies stockpiled goods and completed deals rapidly ahead of Donald Trump’s tariff tirade.\nThe US president promised to unleash a wave of “reciprocal” tariffs on trading partners from April, causing turmoil in financial markets before the levies were suspended.

Chipotle and Cava are hurting too\nChipotle, Cava, and Sweetgreen are all confronting a marked consumer spending slowdown in 2025, evident in disappointing sales, flat or declining customer traffic, and lowered forecasts.\nThis reflects a broader malaise in the fast-casual sector, where value-driven diners are pulling back, and macroeconomic headwinds are pressuring even the strongest brands.\nChipotle\n-\nQ2 same-store sales dropped 4%, steered by a 4.9% fall in transactions despite modest check averages ticking up.\n-\nCEO Scott Boatwright directly linked the decline to consumer caution.\n“I think the underlying trend … is really tied to the consumer sitting on the sideline,” he said, citing increased price sensitivity, an uncertain economic climate, and the challenge of lapping last year’s promotional successes. “Many are preserving cash because of the unknown, or potential consequences, downstream consequences, intended or unintended from the current administration. And so you’re seeing a pullback, a market pullback, at present.”\nEconomic trends prompted Chipotle to lower its full-year projections.\nLeadership is focusing on new marketing initiatives and menu innovation to recapture traffic, but remains cautious about the economic environment.\nCava\n-\nQ2 same-restaurant sales rose just 2.1%, a steep fall from prior years, with traffic essentially flat and growth driven mainly by pricing and menu mix.\n-\nCFO Tricia Tolivar said macro volatility and consumer reticence weighed on traffic.\nIn interviews around their earnings call, company leaders emphasized the “fog and uncertainty” facing customers and cited weakened confidence and comparisons to a very strong prior year as primary factors behind the guidance cuts.\nSweetgreen\n-\nQ2 same-store sales sank 7.6%; traffic was down 10.1%.

Price sensitivity is widespread, including among higher-income diners, while economists cite recession risks and tariff concerns as pressuring discretionary spending.\n-\nPersistent inflation and elevated costs: Many customers “feel the pinch” of inflation, resisting frequent dining out and gravitating toward deals or groceries.\n-\nWorkplace shift: Chains heavily reliant on urban office lunches (notably Sweetgreen) struggle as hybrid work persists, shrinking prime business for those locations.\n-\nTough comparisons: Last year’s popular menu launches created unusually difficult sales benchmarks for Chipotle and Cava this year.\n-\nTariffs & consumer headwinds: New tariffs and related cost pass-throughs have intensified price pressures, with several company execs noting it as a material macro threat.", "content_hash": "3cce48dee971a666216c5cfaf9ef749c", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Watch the full interview here.\nMichelle Rook: Welcome to Markets Now. I'm Michelle Rook with Darin Newsom, Senior Market Analyst with Barchart. Seeing a lot of red on the board in grain and livestock futures trade this morning. Darin, I want to start off talking about soybeans. We had a big three-day rally, 60, 65 cents of gains. Are we just seeing some profit-taking, you think here? Did we run up into some chart resistance?\nDarin Newsom: Number one, I don't know the technicals really have anything to do with markets these days. My blink reaction to this is, maybe the reality of real fundamentals are sinking back in. We've seen soybeans spiked by, I'll be nice and just say a social media post on Monday or early Monday morning. Then that was followed up by this past Wednesday's USDA imaginary numbers with some very interesting figures for the soybean that really test the limits of someone's imagination. It is what it is. The design was-- the intention for both of those events was to trigger algorithm buying, and that's what happened.\nNow here we are on Thursday morning, the buy orders have been filled, market was pushed higher, didn't really change anything on the charts, didn't really change anything. It certainly didn't change anything fundamentally. Thursday morning, a little bit of a vacuum underneath these things starting to sink lower again as we head towards the next weekend. The focus will be back on whether crop still looks good. What future spreads have been telling us all along, that the US is going to produce more soybeans than what it has demand for. That's the bottom line.\nMichelle: Yes, especially if we don't get China back in the market and it looks like we've kicked the can down the road again here, huh?\nDarin: Again, this gets so much attention, but China's not going to be back in the market. There were two stories out Monday from the same media company. The first one that came out around midnight just basically reiterated what we've known since 2018, that Chinese buyers have done the math to basically deal the US out of the global soybean game. That hasn't changed. The only thing is, the situation continues to go down that same path. China has a long-term view of anything that is called war. They take a long-term approach. The US has an attention span of 15 minutes.\nFour hours later, the story came out of same media group, of what the US president posted to social media. Now, I understand that in the last decade, social media has become official policy. It doesn't have to go through Congress, doesn't have to go through the channels that we used to think were in place, the checks and balances, and so on. It's what is posted to social media. The reality is, again, and we can see in the futures, we can see-- excuse me, we can see in the spreads, we can see in the market in general, supply and demand situation hasn't changed.\nChina's not going to buy unless there is some sort of weather problem in Brazil. Then maybe that increases the attractiveness of US markets. Until then, I just don't see it changing.\nMichelle: We also had cancellations of old crop soybean exports. We had cancellations of old crop corn exports. Corn right now, new crop looks pretty good. Overall, do you think that-- is demand even good enough to chew through as big a crop as we have on corn?\nDarin: Let's look at what's happened in calculated full commercial carry. Both corn and soybean new crop spreads, new crop forward curves saw the percent of calculated full commercial carry increase during July and through the early part of August. That tells us right there that demand is not expected demand by the commercial side, not necessarily by the fund side. They just simply follow with the fundamentals. They will eventually follow the fundamentals. On the commercial side, those that actually matter, those who are, say, exporters or end users or large terminals or so on, the opinion is that expected supplies continue to gain on projected demand. That's what we see in both markets.\nIt doesn't matter if USDA comes out and says, US is going to produce 18 billion bushels or whatever it was of corn and 5 billion or 3 billion bushels of soybeans, whatever the numbers were. I don't even know. The bottom line is there's going to be more supplies in relation to demand. That hasn't changed. No, demand is not keeping up. The fact that we got some cancellations through the first part of August isn't overly surprising. We're into the last month of the marketing year for corn and soybeans. If it hasn't been shipped by now, it's probably not going to be, which makes USDA's move to, in its latest guesses, increase old crop export demand for both corn and soybeans that much more humorous.\nMichelle: Weather, obviously, has been bearish for this market, and I can't remember an August where we've had better weather, at least to start off with.\nDarin: Yes, this has been incredible across the Plains, across the Midwest. Love them or hate them, for what they're worth, US Drought Monitor comes out every week, every Thursday morning. This time around, again, similar to last week, you just don't see any hotspots really across all of the plains, from the northern border of North Dakota all the way down to the southwest border of Texas. There's a little bit in the far southwest edge of Texas, but you take it all the way across the Midwest over into Indiana, Ohio, and so on, and there just aren't any problem areas. Weather has been as close to ideal this time around, at a time when the US probably needed some weather problems.\nAgain, we can see in the market that, again, the commercial side just isn't overly concerned about what people still make up, still try to get people to trade these make-believe weather issues or growing issues that the crops just simply haven't had this year.\nMichelle: The funds haven't had any weather threats to buy on either, but let's also talk a little bit about, we had CPI numbers out earlier last week. Actually, they looked fairly favorable, but PPI was out this morning, 0.9%, that was well above expectations. Does this take a rate cut in September off the table for the Fed?\nDarin: I think it's an interesting discussion. I know there's dictates out there that says the Fed is going to have to cut rates, but the market isn't showing us that. As we watched the Fed fund futures forward curve, we saw that it was about a 50-50 chance that we would see a rate cut at the September meeting. This continues to get pushed back each month, almost as we approach the next meeting. Really, the meeting that's been in the spotlight for the last number of months has been the October get-together by the Federal Open Market Committee.\nDo I think that the CPI and PPI numbers-- I know the economists watch this closely, but markets certainly didn't believe that we were going to see a cut, and I would still argue that there's a better chance for a rate hike before we get the next cut. Now, I'm going on a limb, I always talk about how I watch the market and let the market dictate my actions and these sorts of things, and the market certainly isn't indicating right now that we're going to see a rate hike, except for the fact that the US dollar technically turned bullish at the end of July. Again, can we believe what we see on charts anymore? I don't think so.\nFor now, I'm just going to stay on the sidelines and say we're not going to see a rate cut, at least from what I'm seeing in the markets at the September meeting.\nMichelle: We're still not seeing the inflation show up in all of the data yet. There's a little bit of a lag effect from these tariffs. When does that show up here, Darin?\nDarin: Again, these are government numbers and similar to the way USDA can change planted acres by two, three, four million, whatever it was, government inflation numbers don't necessarily have to be grounded in reality. Everyone that I hear from who goes to the store, and it doesn't matter if we're talking about a grocery store, retail store, implement dealer, tractor supply, whatever, prices are high. Inflation is real. We have seen increased inflation. The constant threat of tariffs and the ongoing trade wars have had an effect. They've continued to have an effect.\nThis is what sparked the initial flames of inflation between 2016 and 2018, and they've only gotten worse. Inflation is here. This is one of the reasons why I believe the Fed's still going to have to possibly raise rates before they cut rates, because that's the defense against inflation. That is to raise rates to hopefully strengthen the underlying currency, something that the US needs to see at this point.\nMichelle: With what you just said and the fact that the stock market has continued to crack out new highs, does that keep the funds away from the grain market? Stock market still looks more attractive investment-wise, doesn't it?\nDarin: It does for now. Yes. Markets that go to new highs have a hard time being considered bearish. We've seen new all-time highs posted in the S&P 500 and NASDAQ here through the midpoint of August. The Dow Jones, not yet. As you and I were talking about beforehand, the Dow Jones is our grandparents, I should say, stock index, more attention is now being paid to the S&P and NASDAQ as it should be. This comes down to the discussion of funds need a fundamental reason to get interested in the commodity sector. Again, this is where they can look for supply and demand. They could trade the weather. They can trade global crises and these sorts of things.\nOutside of gold being a safe haven market and crude oil just fluctuating down near its lows in the low 60s, there's no fundamental reason for funds to get interested in the grains sector in general, particularly in the big three markets of corn, soybeans, and wheat. Until that changes, why go into grains when you've got the livestock sector sitting over there, a red-hot cattle market? Cash continues to go higher, continuing to tell us that supply and demand is way out of line in favor of demand over supply. If funds are going to move anywhere into commodities at this point, it's going to be into the livestock sector.\nThere's no fundamental reason for them to be interested in grains. Stock markets are doing well, livestock are hot. There are so many other markets that provide a better opportunity.\nMichelle: No, not a good outlook for sure. All right. Thanks so much.

(NYSE:CPRI) to “overweight” from “neutral” on expectations of a sequential growth in revenues, as well as gross and operating margins, amid ongoing strategies and efforts for the Michael Kors brand by rolling out new designs, selling items at a full price, and cutting back on discounts.\nAdditionally, JPMorgan turned optimistic about the company’s 25-percent decline in the number of Michael Kors stores, saying that it would help make the brand more exclusive and profitable.\nGrowth is also expected to come from higher prices to offset tariffs and its deal to sell the underperforming brand Versace.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 ending June, Capri Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:CPRI) said it swung to an attributable net income of $53 million from a $14 million net loss in the same period last year. Total revenues, however, were lower by 6 percent to $797 million from $848 million year-on-year.\nFor the full fiscal period, the company is targeting revenues of $3.375 billion to $3.45 billion, with the Michael Kors brand accounting for the bulk, or $2.8 billion to $2.875 billion.\nIn the second quarter alone, total revenues were pegged at $815 million to $835 million.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of CPRI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Last year, Tinder’s payer count dropped by 7% annually.\nThe company recently reported robust results for the second quarter, which led to MTCH stock rising more than 10% intraday. Should you consider investing in Match Group stock now?\nBased in Dallas, Texas, Match Group is a leading provider of digital technologies that help people make connections online. The company owns and operates some of the most popular dating apps and websites worldwide, including Tinder, Match.com, OkCupid, Hinge, Plenty of Fish, and BLK. Match Group has grown over the years through organic innovation as well as through acquisitions.\nMoreover, the company’s suite of apps operates in over 40 languages, offering users a range of platforms across different geographies, demographics, and dating preferences. Match Group’s revenue model primarily revolves around subscription plans, in-app purchases, and advertising, with additional efficiency provided through product development and artificial intelligence (AI) driven matchmaking.\nIts flagship dating app, Tinder, is the most downloaded dating app worldwide. Match Group has a market capitalization of $9.7 billion.\nMTCH stock has posted modest gains as its payer growth has been under pressure for quite some time now. Over the past 52 weeks, MTCH stock has gained 12%, while the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has gained 18% over the same period.\nOn the other hand, the company is currently undergoing a turnaround. Last year, activist investors Starboard Value and Elliott Management acquired stakes in the company, prompting it to reduce costs and enhance profitability. The stock is up 17% year-to-date (YTD), and popped more than 10% on Aug. 6 after the company reported robust Q2 results. MTCH stock also recently reached a 52-week high of $38.85 on Aug. 13.\nMatch Group’s valuation is currently at an attractive level. Its price sits at 14 times forward earnings, which is lower than the current industry average.\nMatch Group Reported Solid Q2 Earnings\nOn Aug. 5, Match Group reported its second-quarter results for fiscal 2025, which showed that the company is on a recovery path. While total revenues remained flat year-over-year (YOY), the revenue figure of $864 million was higher than the $854 million that analysts were expecting.\nWhile payer count declined by 5% from the prior-year period, revenue per payer (RPP) increased by 5% annually to $20. EPS stood at $0.49, up 2% YOY and aligning with analyst estimates.\nThe company highlighted its three-phase turnaround strategy. Match Group reported that the “Reset” phase — which included installing a new management team, downsizing, and improving the product roadmap — has been completed. It has now entered the “Revitalize” phase, focusing on product acceleration at Tinder and maintaining strong momentum at Hinge.\nMatch Group expects to enter the “Resurgence” phase in 2026 and 2027, creating a conducive environment in Tinder to attract more Gen Z customers and Hinge to become a dating industry leader with AI-based capabilities.\nThe company expects Q3 revenue to be in the range of $910 million to $920 million, indicating 2% to 3% YOY growth and higher than the $890 million that analysts expect.\nWall Street analysts are optimistic about Match Group’s future earnings. They expect EPS to climb by 45% YOY to $0.74 for the third quarter. For the current fiscal year, EPS is projected to surge 16.5% annually to $2.60, followed by another 16.5% bump to $3.03 in the next fiscal year.\nWhat Do Analysts Think About Match Group Stock?\nFollowing Match Group's robust Q2 results, the company received multiple notable price target upgrades.\nJPMorgan raised its price target from $28 to $33, while maintaining a “Neutral” rating. Analysts at the firm showed optimism about the company’s initial progress in its turnaround strategy. Citing the improvement in metrics and solid financial health, analysts at Evercore ISI also raised their price target from $32 to $38, while maintaining an “In Line” rating on MTCH stock.\nMatch Group remains soundly favored by Wall Street analysts with a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating overall. Of the 21 analysts rating the stock, seven rate it a “Strong Buy,\" one analyst suggests a “Moderate Buy,” and a majority of 13 analysts play it safe with a “Hold” rating. The consensus price target of $38.31 matches current levels. However, the Street-high price target of $49 indicates 28% potential upside from here.\nKey Takeaways\nMatch Group’s turnaround is well underway, positioning the company for accelerated growth in the future. Moreover, the company remains robustly profitable. Therefore, while some analysts recommend caution, it may be prudent to keep the stock under consideration.\nOn the date of publication, Anushka Dutta did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The main reason for the move is because OKX plans to eliminate tens of millions of OKB tokens.\nA key part of one of the largest crypto exchanges\nThe San Jose-based OKX crypto exchange is the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world based on daily trading volume. In 2018, the exchange launched a native token called OKB with a fixed supply of 300 million that is regularly reduced through burning and repurchases. OKB started as an ERC-20 token, meaning it was built on Ethereum's blockchain. However, the token eventually left Ethereum and started trading on OKX's own blockchain.\nOKB is used by OKX for different programs on the exchange, and has been integrated by financial service providers, payment processors, and even some merchants, among other businesses.\nHowever, the big reason for OKB's move this week is linked to OKX's decision to eliminate over 65 million OKB tokens through a one-time burn from previous repurchases and Treasury reserves. Following this, OKB will have a total supply of 21 million. This likely created a strong move based on completely new supply-and-demand dynamics.\nScarcity is a powerful tool\nI find it interesting that the new fixed supply of OKB is similar to that of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency.\nAs of this writing, OKB trades for $93, which is much cheaper than Bitcoin. Could investors who believe in Bitcoin as a form of digital gold latch on to OKB as a cheaper crypto hedge against inflation? It's possible, but I still can't say with any certainty that any cryptocurrency including Bitcoin can actually hedge inflation.\nWhile I do see some attractive characteristics associated with OKB, I am still advising caution after such a big move. It's still too early to invest anything more than a smaller, more speculative position that you are prepared to lose.\nShould you buy stock in OKB right now?\nBefore you buy stock in OKB, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and OKB wasn’t one of them.

Covrig Analytics said last Friday that reports of reduced cane yields from Brazil's sugar farmers may knock Brazil's 2025/26 sugarcane production below 600 MMT, much lower than Brazilian government crop forecasting agency Conab's forecast of 663.4 MMT.\nAn excessive short position by funds could exacerbate any short-covering rally in sugar futures. Last Friday's weekly Commitment of Traders (COT) report showed funds increased their net-short positions in NY sugar futures by +25,923 positions to 151,004 short positions in the week ending August 5, the most in almost 6 years.\nLast Tuesday, sugar prices fell to 5-week lows on signs of stronger sugar production in Brazil. On July 31, Unica reported Brazil's Center-South sugar output in the first half of July rose +15% y/y to 3.4 MMT. Also, the amount of sugarcane being crushed for sugar by Brazil's sugar mills has increased to 54% from 50% the same time last year.\nThe outlook for higher sugar exports from India is negative for sugar prices after Bloomberg reported that India may permit local sugar mills to export sugar in the next season, which starts in October, as abundant monsoon rains may produce a bumper sugar crop. India's Meteorological Department reported Tuesday that cumulative monsoon rain in India was 500.8 mm as of August 4, or 4% above normal. Also, the Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association said last Thursday that it will seek permission to export 2 MMT of sugar in 2025/26.\nThe outlook for higher sugar production in India, the world's second-largest producer, is bearish for prices. On June 2, India's National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories projected that India's 2025/26 sugar production would climb +19% y/y to 35 MMT, citing larger planted cane acreage. That would follow a -17.5% y/y decline in India's sugar production in 2024/25 to a 5-year low of 26.2 MMT, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).\nSugar prices retreated through early July, with NY sugar falling to a 4.25-year low and London sugar sliding to a 4-year low, driven by expectations of a sugar surplus in the 2025/26 season. On June 30, commodities trader Czarnikow projected a 7.5 MMT global sugar surplus for the 2025/26 season, the largest surplus in 8 years. On May 22, the USDA, in its biannual report, projected that global 2025/26 sugar production would increase by +4.7% y/y to a record 189.318 MMT, with global sugar ending stocks at 41.188 MMT, up 7.5% y/y.\nSugar prices also have support from reduced sugar production in Brazil. Unica reported last Thursday that the cumulative 2025/26 Brazil Center-South sugar output through mid-July fell by -9.2% y/y to 15.655 MMT. Last month, Conab, Brazil's government crop forecasting agency, said 2024/25 Brazil sugar production fell by -3.4% y/y to 44.118 MMT, citing lower sugarcane yields due to drought and excessive heat.\nThe outlook for higher sugar production in Thailand is bearish for sugar prices. On May 2, Thailand's Office of the Cane and Sugar Board reported that Thailand's 2024/25 sugar production rose +14% y/y to 10.00 MMT. Thailand is the world's third-largest sugar producer and the second-largest exporter of sugar.\nThe International Sugar Organization (ISO) raised its 2024/25 global sugar deficit forecast to a 9-year high of -5.47 MMT on May 15, up from a February forecast of -4.88 MMT. This indicates a tightening market following the 2023/24 global sugar surplus of 1.31 MMT. ISO also cut its 2024/25 global sugar production forecast to 174.8 MMT from a February forecast of 175.5 MMT.\nThe USDA, in its bi-annual report released May 22, projected that global 2025/26 sugar production would climb +4.7% y/y to a record 189.318 MMT and that global 2025/26 human sugar consumption would increase +1.4% y/y to a record 177.921 MMT. The USDA also forecasted that 2025/26 global sugar ending stocks would climb +7.5% y/y to 41.188 MMT. The USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) predicted that Brazil's 2025/26 sugar production would rise +2.3% y/y to a record 44.7 MMT FAS predicted that India's 2025/26 sugar production would rise +25% y/y to 35.3 MMT due to favorable monsoon rains and increased sugar acreage. FAS predicted that Thailand's 2025/26 sugar production will climb +2% y/y to 10.3 MMT.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The project is managed by the joint venture formed in 2017 after Shandong Gold acquired a 50% stake in the mine from Barrick Gold.\nThe RIGI framework, which went into effect last year, is a key part of libertarian President Javier Milei's economic reforms aimed at boosting investment. It provides companies with tax, customs and foreign-exchange benefits, as well as guaranteeing legal stability for 30 years.\nGold was Argentina's primary mining export last year, accounting for 68% of the sector's total shipments with a value of $3.14 billion, according to data from the country's mining secretariat. High metals prices drove the performance, with silver and lithium ranking as the next largest exports.\nBY THE NUMBERS\nThe Veladero mine produced 504,000 ounces of gold last year and forecasts output of 380,000 to 440,000 ounces for 2025. The mine, located at an altitude of about 4,000 meters (13,123 feet) in the Andes, has been in operation since 2005.\nThe proposed investment aims to fund the construction of new mining phases, which will add 89.2 million tons of capacity for stockpiling and processing new ore.\nWHAT'S NEXT\nThe project is projected to add $3.8 billion in export revenue over its lifespan through 2033, the sources said. The Veladero mine currently employs 3,800 people, with 91% of the workforce hired from the local San Juan province.\n(Reporting by Lucila Sigal; Writing by Benjamín Mejías Valencia; Editing by Hugh Lawson)", "content_hash": "960563d4e3ab93e01138088cefd53467", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

This follows JPMorganChase's launch of its deposit token, an alternative to stablecoins that also uses distributed ledger technology to speed transaction processing.\nThe banks' moves position them to leverage their giant payment businesses to offer a range of digital asset services, including stablecoins, placing pressure on other banks to prepare for a range of new products.\n\"Banks, regardless of size, need a stablecoin strategy now,\" said James Wester, director of crypto for Javelin Strategy & Research. \"That doesn't mean they need every technical answer, but they do need a clear vision of where they fit and how they will connect their customers, partners, and developers into the next generation of money movement.\"\nCiti's Payoneer collaboration\nPayoneer, a New York-based company that processes B2B and consumer-to-business transfers, will use Citi's blockchain to move money across Payoneer-owned accounts, reducing the need for traditional payment methods.\n\"Money movements in legacy systems have cut-off times,\" Derek Green, treasurer at Payoneer, told American Banker. \"Addressing that is a powerful first step in the value of blockchain.\"\nBy using Citi Token Services, Payoneer avoids restricted bank hours and closures on weekends and holidays. Payoneer hopes the collaboration will ensure \"instant liquidity\" through 24/7 transfers between Payoneer users in the U.S., U.K. and Singapore. Using a blockchain reduces cash management and foreign exchange risk; and an application programming interface enables integration with a business's existing treasury and payment systems, avoiding infrastructure updates, according to Payoneer. The Citi deal helps Payoneer accelerate its ongoing geographic and product expansion. Payoneer's 2020 acquisition of German payment firm Optile allowed it to integrate payments orchestration with cloud-based technology to power international business payments while adding more countries to its network.\n\"Given our geographic reach [Citi] is a way to make transfers less complex,\" Green said.\nWhile Payoneer's partnership with Citi uses tokenized deposits, the use of stablecoins for transactions is a possibility, according to Green.\n\"The blockchain is really the fundamental technology here,\" Green said. \"The stablecoins would be the mechanism that would facilitate the outcome.\"\nLike most banks and payment companies, Payoneer is still examining how stablecoins would best suit its business. Getting on board with blockchain-powered payment processing is a way to lay a foundation for greater uses in the future, according to Green. \"Citi is a partner of ours and it makes sense to lean in and get this technology live,\" Green said.\nBig bank plans\nCiti referred questions to recent statements the bank has made on digital assets. In an early interview with American Banker, Debopama Sen, head of payments for Citi's Services business, said the bank has focused on supporting 24/7/365 clearing for Citi's clients. \"Something we've learned over the last few years, we didn't sort of imagine or dream this up — is that co-creating with some of the largest category leaders has helped us create products that actually work for everyone as long as we simplify the access of the channel, depending on the client,\" Sen said.\nCiti's Token Services uses a distributed ledger, database and embedded business logic to power services such as intraday lending, cross-border payments and funds transfers, designed for supply chain financing, trade settlement and other functions. Stablecoins are also part of the bank's strategy, with Citi CEO Jane Fraser saying the bank is planning a stablecoin and will support conversions from traditional currency to crypto. These services are value-adds for the bank's large payments business. Citi's payments business processes $5 trillion across more than 90 countries and jurisdictions on a daily basis, including 11 million daily instant transactions. Among other large banks, JPMorgan also plans to issue a stablecoin and in June said it plans to issue a USD deposit token, JPMD.\nA deposit token is a digital asset that is a claim on a deposit at a licensed depository institution, such as a bank. Deposit tokens are issued on a distributed ledger. That makes deposit tokens easier to transfer between consumers or businesses, particularly in different countries.\nJPMorgan's payments business manages $18 billion in yearly revenue, and is the world's largest merchant acquirer and the largest card issuer in the U.S. And it has more than 30,000 staffers. The size of JPMorgan and Citi will influence blockchain, digital asset and stablecoin strategies at other banks, according to Wester.\n\"The connections and partnerships are being established today, so the choice for banks is whether they view this as an opportunity to stake their position and actively shape the ecosystem or wait until the rules are written by others,\" Wester said. \"For some banks, it may make sense to take a wait-and-see approach, but the decision should be intentional and not simply inaction dressed up as caution.\"\nScale becomes a challenge when banks expand the use of blockchain-powered transactions from intrabank to interbank. Two major models are emerging among banks to use distributed ledger technology to improve transaction processing for treasury management, Duane Block, managing director of digital assets at Accenture, told American Banker. Deposit tokens are a better fit for intrabank payments, or transactions between different accounts at the same bank; while stablecoins are more suited to interbank payments, Block said, due to the stablecoins' ability to act as a bridge between payment processing systems at different organizations.\n\"When banks move from tokenized deposits to stablecoins, distribution can be a challenge,\" Block said. \"And partnerships are one way to accelerate that.\"", "content_hash": "ed1a2e8e4f3bce7b7132722998c977d6", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

That’s a positive for DE shares because it supports strong margins and revenue growth, even in a down-cycle for farm equipment.\nUSDA’s recent bullish forecasts for yield reflect not just good weather, but the impact of this tech, reinforcing Deere’s role as a leader in precision agriculture, she concluded.\nNote that Deere stock currently pays a dividend yield of 1.35% as well, which makes it even more attractive as a long-term holding.\nDeere Remains a ‘Buy’-Rated Stock Among Wall Street Analysts\nDeere stock may be worth buying on post-earnings weakness also because other Wall Street firms remain bullish on it as well.", "content_hash": "7c7ec92793f110028f21069740069277", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Between this international quirk and some name confusion, U.S. investors may be wondering whether PagSeguro's news was good or bad.\nPagSeguro Q2 earnings\nAccording to the press release, PagBank grew its revenue 18% year over year, to 5.1 billion reals ($940 million), not counting foreign exchange rates, which is a great way to start off. Profits increased only 7% year over year, however, rising to 537 million reals ($98.7 million).\nDeposits grew by 9% in local currency, and the company's loan portfolio grew by 11%. In a tough economy, PagBank purposely grew conservatively, expanding \"low-risk, high-engagement products\" in particular by 34%.\nCommenting on the quarter, CEO Artur Schunck admitted the company is operating \"in a challenging economic environment,\" but insisted the company has \"grown profitably\" in Q2, and is \"on the right path\" to continue doing so.\nIs PagSeguro stock a sell?\nTurning to S&P Global Market Intelligence for reliable data on this difficult to value bank, we see that PagSeguro has a $2.8 billion market capitalization, and earned $405 million in profit over the last 12 months. That makes for a P/E ratio of only about 6.9, which seems cheap to me in light of the deposits and loan growth -- maybe really cheap if the loans are conservatively made.\nThrow in a modest 1.5% dividend for good measure, and PagSeguro looks like a buy to me -- not a sell.\nShould you invest $1,000 in PagSeguro Digital right now?\nBefore you buy stock in PagSeguro Digital, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and PagSeguro Digital wasn’t one of them.

That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nAfter barely moving for two straight weeks, mortgage interest rates have finally decreased this week. However, rates are still higher than they were this time last year. The average 30-year fixed rate is down six basis points this week but up 15 basis points from September 2024. This could leave potential home buyers wondering, “Is this a good time to buy a house?”\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nIn this article:\nAre mortgage rates dropping?\nAs of Sept. 4 this year, Freddie Mac reported that rates for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages were 6.5%. Although they have inched down since last week, they’re still up 15 basis points from last September. This time last year, mortgage rates were averaging 6.35%.\nIn situations like these, it pays to look at the numbers. Here’s the Freddie Mac data on mortgage rates for the past 52 weeks as of Sept. 4, 2025:\n-\n30-year fixed-rate mortgage: 6.08% to 7.04%\n-\n15-year fixed-rate mortgage: 5.15% to 6.27%\nIf you just go by the numbers, rates on both 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages remain mostly below the highs noted above. So, yes, mortgage rates have decreased incrementally over the past year. Will they keep dipping? That remains to be seen.\nDive deeper: Will mortgage rates go back up to 7%?\nSo, will mortgage rates go down at all this year?\nIf you’re looking for a substantial interest rate drop in 2025, you’ll likely be left waiting. The latest news from the Federal Reserve and other key economic data point toward steady mortgage rates on par with what we see today.\nThe latest from the Federal Reserve\nWhen the Fed — the common nickname for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) — held its July 2025 meeting, it voted to keep the federal funds rate the same for the time being. After cutting its rate three times at the end of 2024, it has yet to slash the rate in 2025.\nThat federal funds rate tends to directly influence rates on shorter-term lending. While mortgage rates aren’t directly based on the fed funds rate, they typically mirror fed fund rate trends. So, if the fed funds rate goes up, mortgage rates will likely follow. The inverse is also true.\nThe next Fed meeting is set for September 16 and 17. According to the CME FedWatch tool, there’s roughly a 98% chance that the fed funds rate will decrease at this meeting. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean rates will follow suit. When people anticipate a fed funds rate cut, mortgage rates usually fall in the weeks leading up to the meeting.\nSo, mortgage rates might not fall much more significantly in 2025.\nLearn more: How the Fed rate decision impacts mortgage rates\nThe latest on 10-year Treasury yields\nWhile short-term lending rates closely follow the fed funds rate, mortgage rates more closely follow the 10-year Treasury yield. As of Sept. 2, the 10-year Treasury yield sat at 4.28% — up from 3.84% a year prior.\nYou’re probably wondering why today’s mortgage rates aren’t in the 4% range, right?\nTo determine current mortgage rates, lenders add a “spread” to the 10-year Treasury yield. The spread is simply the difference between the rates consumers pay and the rate on the 10-year Treasury. Without getting too much into the weeds, charging a spread helps mortgage lenders cover costs associated with making loans to the public and the risk of providing such loans.\nFor example, the current average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.5%, and the 10-year Treasury yield is 4.28% — a spread of 2.22%.\nRead more: When will mortgage rates finally go back down to 5%?\nShould you wait to buy until mortgage rates go down?\nIn short, no. You probably shouldn’t wait to buy a home until mortgage rates drop. Mortgage rates are just one part of the affordability equation. You also have to consider home prices, a factor of housing supply and demand.\nThe current housing market is in a crunch. To put it simply, buyers outnumber homes for sale, especially homes in price ranges accessible to the first-time home buyer. When supply and demand are out of balance like this, home prices tend to remain high since sellers know they’ll have multiple buyers interested.\nAccording to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the median sale price of single-family homes has generally trended upward since Q1 of 2009. At that time, the median sale price was $208,400. The median price had risen to $410,800 by Q2 2025.\nWhile recession chatter has recently increased, prospective buyers likely won’t see much relief in a true recession. If interest rates drop like they tend to do in recessions, that will increase the number of people looking to buy and lock in a lower interest rate. That drives up demand for the already limited supply of homes.\nTo truly save, buyers need both interest rates and home prices to drop. Mortgage rates are inching down this month, and housing prices are stagnant or even lowering in certain parts of the country. Still, rates are higher than they were this time last year, and prices are still increasing in many cities. Situations may be improving for buyers, but there’s a lot of work to be done.\nKeep reading: Do mortgage rates go down in a recession?\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nStrategies for buyers in today’s mortgage market\nIf you crave the comforts of homeownership, the best strategy in today’s market may be to buy what you can afford. Whether that means a smaller house or a condo instead of a single-family home, owning something puts you in a position to start building equity.\nYes, shopping for the best mortgage lenders with low rates and fees is crucial when getting a mortgage. But to help you find your ideal home that balances affordability and desirability, it pays to adopt a curious mindset and consider lesser-discussed financial tools.\nGet curious\nThere’s no better time to learn more about your local real estate market than today. By adopting a sense of curiosity, you could discover that your city has more to offer housing-wise than you previously thought.\nYou may want to take weekend excursions to lesser-known neighborhoods and suburban developments beyond the city limits. You never know what you’ll find that could expand your idea of what “home” looks like — including new developments, school districts, and types of homes.\nLearn more: This map shows average mortgage rates by state\nConsider a fixer-upper\nIf you’re looking to spend less on a home in today’s mortgage market, a house needing a bit of TLC could help you do just that. Loans like the FHA 203(k) mortgage can roll your purchase and renovation costs into one convenient loan. When you qualify and have an accepted offer, your lender immediately funds the home’s purchase price and puts the cost of renovations into an escrow account. As you make repairs, funds get dispersed.\nRethink your commute\nHow would it feel to have a longer commute yet come home to a house you love? Master-planned communities tend to crop up outside major cities, offering amenities like parks, shopping, and top-notch schools — all in exchange for a longer commute. These areas could look a lot more palatable if they offer commuting options like park-and-ride or commuter rail. Dare to consider parking the car and taking public transit if it could get you into the home of your dreams.\nGo condo\nWhile shared walls, floors, and ceilings might not immediately scream “dream home,” they could help you find an affordable home in a terrific area. Condominiums come in various shapes and sizes, from apartment-style flats to townhomes. Depending on the area, you might even score a small backyard. However, be sure to consider HOA fees when calculating your monthly payment.\nConsider a 15-year mortgage\nWhile the monthly payment on a 15-year mortgage will be higher than the typical 30-year, these loans have plenty of upsides. Not only will you pay off your home on a speedier timeline, but you’ll also likely score a lower interest rate and save a ton on interest over the life of your loan.\nExplore rate buydowns\nTo make today’s mortgage rates more palatable, look into rate buydown options. An interest rate buydown lets you pay cash up front in exchange for a reduced interest rate on your mortgage. Buydowns can be permanent or temporary (for your loan's first one to three years, for example). Even a few years of lower rate relief can make today’s home prices more affordable.\nLearn more: What will mortgage rates do over the next five years?\nWhen will mortgage rates go down? FAQs\nHow soon will mortgage interest rates go down?\nMortgage rates probably will not drop significantly before autumn. The August Fannie Mae Housing Forecast predicts that rates will continue to decrease gradually but will stay above 6% throughout 2025 and 2026.\nIs 7% a high mortgage rate?\nCompared to historical mortgage rates, 7% isn’t considered a high rate. While it might be high compared to pandemic-era rates that were sub-3%, it’s on par with mortgage rates in the 1990s, and considerably lower than the double-digit rates seen in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\nIs it impossible to get a 3% interest rate on a mortgage?\nIt’s not impossible to get a 3% interest rate, but doing so requires the perfect set of circumstances. You’d need to find a homeowner with an assumable mortgage — one that can be passed to a new owner at the same interest rate as the original loan. Assumable mortgages are generally government-backed loans from agencies like the VA, FHA, or USDA.\nLaura Grace Tarpley edited this article.", "content_hash": "c9e8e1d9634e267864cc804b674dad46", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

At just above the $62 level in mid-August, the energy commodity is sitting below the midpoint of the 2025 trading range. In my Q2 Barchart report on the energy sector, I concluded with the following:\nMeanwhile, OPEC+ has increased petroleum output, and the U.S. energy policy now favors a “drill-baby-drill” and “frack-baby-frack” approach to oil and gas. Increasing U.S. and OPEC+ output could put downward pressure on prices. The bottom line is that petroleum and product prices could be highly volatile over the second half of 2025.\nNearby NYMEX crude oil futures fell 8.91% in Q2, and were 9.22% lower over the first six months of 2025, settling at $65.11 per barrel on June 30, 2025. The NYMEX futures were lower in mid-August as the end of the 2025 peak driving season approaches, and the trend has turned lower since the late July high.\nThe short-term trend is lower\nBearish sentiment has crept into the NYMEX crude oil market, as the price has been trending lower since the most recent July 30, lower high of $70.51 per barrel on the September contract.\nThe daily chart highlights the pattern of lower highs and lower lows since the end of July, with crude oil posting mostly daily declines from July 31 through August 13.\nOPEC+ and U.S. energy policy point lower\nCrude oil fundamentals reflect increased production. While U.S. daily domestic crude oil production was at 13.327 million barrels per day as of the week ending on August 8, 2025, U.S. energy policy under the Trump administration favors a “drill-baby-drill” and “frack-baby-frack” approach to oil and gas production. In a reversal from the previous Biden administration, President Trump supports traditional energy production and consumption to achieve energy independence and self-sufficiency. Moreover, the current administration favors increasing U.S. traditional energy exports, creating revenues. Increased U.S. production, which weighs on oil prices, will help lower inflationary pressures, increasing the odds of falling U.S. interest rates, a key goal of the Trump administration.\nMeanwhile, OPEC+ has increased production over the past months, adding further pressure to the oil price. While crude oil’s price remains higher than the 2025 low, the short-term trend has turned lower as the petroleum market shifts toward the end of the gasoline demand season, which typically concludes after summer.\nCritical levels to watch in the NYMEX futures\nThe monthly chart shows that nearby NYMEX crude oil futures have traded on a $55.12 to $79.39 per barrel range in 2025. At around $62.25 per barrel on August 13, the energy commodity was around $5 below the midpoint of this year’s trading range.\nThe monthly chart highlights that the current downside technical support level is at the April 2025 low of $55.12 per barrel. Technical resistance levels are at the June 2025 high of $78.40 and the January 2025 peak of $79.39 per barrel. A break below the $60 level will likely cause crude oil prices to challenge the critical technical resistance at just above $55 per barrel, the lowest price since February 2021.\nThe Middle East and Russia remain potential issues\nThe Middle East is a critical factor in determining the path of least resistance for crude oil prices. Israel and the U.S. remain at odds with Iran despite the ceasefire of hostilities after the bombing of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. However, the theocracy remains firmly in control and has not backed off from inflammatory statements towards Israel, the United States, and other Western countries. Iran’s proxies in the region continue to pose a threat to peace.\nThe Straits of Hormuz remain a major chokepoint for worldwide petroleum exports, so any future conflicts could ignite an explosive crude oil rally due to supply concerns.\nMeanwhile, Presidents Trump and Putin will meet in Alaska on Friday, August 15 to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine. Any peace deal could include Russian cooperation on energy policies that would lead to crude oil prices to declining toward the $50 per barrel level or lower, given President Trump’s desire to curb inflation and lower interest rates.\nUCO and SCO turbocharge volatility in NYMEX crude oil but require careful risk-reward attention\nCrude oil is one of the most politically charged commodities, and in a highly volatile world, the price of petroleum is likely to experience ongoing elevated volatility. Since the 2020 global pandemic, nearby NYMEX prices have traded as low as in negative territory to as high as $130.50 per barrel. While I do not expect any challenge of those lows or highs in 2025, the potential for sudden rallies above this year’s high or declines to new lows remains high in the current environment.\nTrading crude oil could be a highly profitable strategy. The most direct route for a risk position in the energy commodity is through the WTI futures or futures options trading on the CME’s NYMEX division, or Brent futures or futures options traded on the Intercontinental Exchange.\nThe USO and BNO ETFs are unleveraged products that track the performance of WTI and Brent futures, respectively. UCO and SCO are twice-leveraged ETFs that track the NYMEX WTI crude oil prices.\nAt $21.83 per share, UCO, the bullish ETF, has over $386.4 million in assets under management. UCO trades an average of nearly 2.7 million shares daily and charges a 0.95% management fee. The most recent significant rally in September NYMEX crude oil futures took the price 39% higher, from the May 5 low of $54.66 to the June 23 high of $75.98 per barrel.\nOver the same period, UCO rallied 54.88% from $18.35 to $28.42 per share, delivering a leveraged upside percentage return.\nAt $18.27 per share, the bearish SCO ETF had over $158.4 million in assets under management. SCO trades a daily average of over 2.955 million shares and charges the same 0.95% management fee. The most recent significant decline in WTI September futures took the price 18.2% lower from a high of $75.98 on June 23 to a low of $62.16 on August 13.\nOver around the same period, the SCO ETF rose 25.5% from $14.57 to $18.29 per share, delivering a leveraged percentage return when crude oil prices moved to the downside.\nUCO and SCO are leveraged trading tools that are only appropriate for short-term risk positions on the long or short side of the oil market. However, they provide market participants the opportunity to position in crude oil in standard brokerage accounts. The leveraged ETFs have drawbacks, including:\nLeverage comes at a cost. If NYMEX crude oil prices move contrary to expectations, the leverage results in a greater percentage decline than the crude oil futures market.\nIf crude oil prices stabilize and remain within a trading range, UCO and SCO will experience time decay, which erodes their values and causes losses.\nWhile the international crude oil markets, including NYMEX futures, trade around the clock, UCO and SCO are only available during the U.S. stock market’s trading hours. Therefore, the leveraged ETFs can miss highs or lows when the U.S. stock market is closed.\nUCO and SCO’s leverage requires careful attention to risk-reward dynamics. Time decay means that price and time stops are required for risk positions, which are only appropriate for short-term horizons.\nCrude oil is leaning lower in August 2025, with the odds of a challenge to the 2025 lows rising. However, the volatile Middle East could turn the bear into a bull in the blink of an eye. Trading in crude oil rather than investing, could be optimal over the coming weeks and months. The August 15 meeting between Presidents Trump and Putin could cause significant price volatility in the crude oil market.\nOn the date of publication, Andrew Hecht did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The firm takes no directional position on brokered trades, and only takes commission when it matches a buyer and a seller.\n“We have not facilitated or executed any trades in that market,” Cantor spokesperson Erica Chase told Bloomberg by phone.\nWarren and Wyden had cited a late July report by Wired that alleged the financial services company created a “litigation finance” product that brokers bets that the courts will strike down the tariffs.

While the disputed amount is stated as having a preliminary estimate of 1 million euros, or nearly $1.2 million at current exchange, that number is more likely a “holding” tally just to get the lawsuit filed and before the German patent court. Also named in the patent infringement suit were the German, Swiss, Belgian, Italian and French arms of Skechers operations across Europe.\nMore from WWD\n-\nSkechers and 3G Get Green Light: Here's When The Biggest Shoe Buyout Deal at $9 Billion Will Close\n-\nSkechers Beat Expectations in Q2 as Shoe Firm Continues on Path to Go Private\n-\nWhy Arhaus Is Suing RH and Its Co-Chief Merchandising and Creative Officer\nEssentially, the complaint follows similar patent infringement claims in the U.S. Kizik lawsuit filed last month regarding the slip-in shoe technology. Hands Free is also seeking an order barring Skechers from selling its alleged infringing shoes across 18 European countries: Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Finland, France, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, and/or Sweden. The complaint is also seeking a recall of products already placed on the market since July 9, 2025. And there are requests for provisional damages in the amount of 200,000 euros ($232,694), as well as a penalty payment to the court in other amounts under certain circumstances.\n“As the holder of more than 200 patents and applications worldwide, HandsFree Labs is committed to protecting our hands-free footwear technology from those who seek to profit from our intellectual property and duplicate our cutting-edge products,” said Hands Free CEO Gareth Hosford.\nWhile Hosford is making a show that his company is bent on protecting its patents, whether it can win on the merits of its claims here and abroad remains to be seen.\nThe Kizik parent’s U.S. patent infringement suit was filed on July 24 in a federal district court for the Eastern District of Texas. It also alleged that the Skechers Hands Free Slip-in debuted a few years ago, fueling “astonishing growth” that fueled a “windfall $9.42 billion acquisition announcement.” That announcement that Skechers would be acquired by 3G Capital is now the largest buyout in the shoe industry.\nSkechers said on July 28 that the hands-free concept is a “century-old idea” and that it has developed its own “unique Slip-ins technology.” The company also said in a statement that it has obtained more than 140 utility and design patents worldwide and will vigilantly enforce its patent rights.\nSkechers president Michael Greenberg also noted that the company has been advertising and selling its slip-in shoes since December 2021, without any contract from Kizik. He suggested that the recent angst by Hands Free amounts to nothing more than a money grab as it follows the $9.42 billion merger agreement with 3G Capital.\n“We believe that, after all these years of silence, the true motivation for this lawsuit might be found right on the face of Kizik’s complaint, where they state that they are looking for a share of the $9.42 billion being paid for Skechers, money Kizik did not earn and does not deserve,” Greenberg said. He added that the company has become the market leaders in the hands-free footwear space by innovating and not imitating the idea of hands-free fit using its own technology.\nGreenberg said the company is “undeterred by transparent litigation efforts to thwart competition,” adding that Skechers “will aggressively challenge both the validity of the patents and the infringement claims.”\nAs for the overseas complaint, a Skechers spokeswoman said the company will have “no further comment beyond” its July 28th statement.\nBest of WWD\nSign up for FN's Newsletter.

These low-priced shares can deliver explosive gains if the underlying company executes well and capitalizes on a fast-growing market. One such intriguing play right now is GameSquare (GAME), which is making a bold pivot into the world of cryptocurrency and Web3.\nThe company recently announced it will add Animecoin (ANIME-USD), a digital asset tied to anime production and Web3 strategy, to its treasury as part of a $2.5 million revenue agreement. In addition, GameSquare will serve as the agency of record for the Animecoin Foundation, helping to expand its global reach and strengthen its presence in the gaming sector.\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nAs the Glacier Drop Rolls Out, Should You Buy the Cardano Crypto Here?\n-\nBullish Soared on Its First Trading Day. Should You Buy BLSH Stock?\nFor investors seeking speculative upside in digital assets and niche entertainment markets, GAME’s latest move could be worth a closer look.\nAbout GAME Stock\nBased in Texas, GameSquare is a small-cap media and technology company focused on reaching Gen Z and Millennial audiences through gaming and entertainment channels. It owns assets like FaZe Clan (a major esports team) and Stream Hatchet (a live-stream analytics firm) and operates an Ethereum-based (ETHUSD) treasury program to earn on-chain yields.\nGameSquare is a highly speculative penny stock, hitting a low of $0.50 in April 2025 before rebounding to around $0.90–$0.95 by mid-August. Shares remain volatile, with a 48% drop over the past month, still up 12% YTD.\nHowever, the company valuation looks pretty attractive for now, with a Price/Sales ratio of 0.32. That's significantly less expensive than the sector median of 1.27. This suggests the stock is undervalued compared to its peers.\nWhat This Partnership Means for GAME’s Web3 Push\nGameSquare's new Animecoin Foundation strategic partnership will be fundamental in expanding its Web3 presence. The company will purchase up to $2.5 million in Animecoin and act as the token’s marketing “agency of record” for one year, receiving $2.5 million in Animecoin for creative and promotional services. Valued at about $180 million fully diluted, Animecoin targets fans of both anime and gaming. The deal provides GameSquare with immediate revenue, diversifies its digital asset holdings, and offers upside if Animecoin’s value rises.", "content_hash": "30e2434e71b7428fe93cdf0d2ef402e6", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Shares of AMD fell by more than 6% in the session that followed, even though the company reported a terrific increase in revenue.\nEven its guidance was better than analysts were expecting. Investors, however, appeared to be more concerned about the performance of AMD's data center business, where slower-than-expected growth led investors to hit the panic button.\nHowever, a closer look at AMD's financial results and guidance reveals that the company has a solid artificial intelligence (AI)-fueled catalyst beyond the data center business that should help it sustain its impressive performance for years to come.\nAI-powered personal computers (PCs) are driving solid growth for AMD\nAMD's quarterly revenue increased by an impressive 32% year over year in Q2 to $7.7 billion. The company's client PC processor and gaming segment played a key role in driving this solid growth: Revenue from the segment jumped by 69% to $3.6 billion.\nAMD says that it witnessed record revenue from sales of its desktop and notebook processors last quarter, while sales of its client graphics processing units (GPUs) improved as well. Its Ryzen 9000 series processors are in hot demand, and that's not surprising considering the in-built AI processing capabilities that they pack.\nAMD says that its latest processors are powerful enough to run applications such as generative AI assistants, accelerate content creation with the help of AI tools, and enhance productivity by running applications such as Copilot seamlessly. The company's focus on churning AI-capable PC processors is clearly paying off, and that should remain a long-term tailwind for AMD.\nThat's because shipments of AI-enabled PCs are projected to increase at a compound annual rate of 42% through 2028, according to market research firm IDC. Based on that, IDC expects that by 2028, PCs equipped with a neural processing unit (NPU) to tackle AI workloads will account for almost 95% of the overall market.\nAMD is already capitalizing on this trend by integrating NPUs into its client processors. On the other hand, the company's client graphics card business also has a secular growth opportunity. By 2028, annual shipments of GPUs capable of supporting AI workloads are expected to be almost 60% higher than 2023 levels. AMD has already launched client graphics cards that accelerate AI workloads locally on PCs.\nIn all, the company's client segment seems well-placed to keep growing at healthy rates for years to come. Importantly, this segment's growth should be complemented by the ongoing expansion of the data center GPU market.\nThe data center business seems primed for stronger growth\nThere's no question that AMD's data center revenue growth of 14% year over year in Q2 wasn't all that great. After all, Nvidia reported 73% year-over-year growth in this segment to $39.1 billion last quarter. AMD's revenue was way lower at $3.2 billion.\nHowever, AMD had to write down $800 million worth of its data center GPU inventory last quarter because of federal restrictions on the export of its chips to China. This headwind tempered AMD's data center growth, offsetting the solid demand for its Epyc server processors, which are increasingly being adopted by cloud computing giants such as Oracle and Google.\nInvestors, however, will do well to note that AMD's data center revenue could clock a faster growth rate from here, as it expects to resume shipments to China following recent developments in Washington. The company will have to pay the U.S. government 15% of its revenue from AI chip sales to China, but that's better than being completely locked out of the Chinese market.\nThe good part is that the company is expecting shipments to non-Chinese customers to increase as well in the second half with help from its MI350 AI accelerators. These chips are on track for a \"steep production ramp in the second half of the year to support large-scale production deployments with multiple customers,\" said CEO Lisa Su on the Q2 earnings call.\nAMD is forecasting a 28% year-over-year increase in revenue in the current quarter, and that excludes any potential revenue from China. It could end up delivering stronger growth than that, thanks to the opportunity in AI-powered PCs as well as the ramp-up of its data center GPU sales in the second half.\nThat's why investors should consider buying AMD, as it is now trading at 9.5 times sales, which is almost in line with the U.S. technology sector's average price-to-sales ratio. The AI stock's ability to grow revenues at a faster pace in the second half of the year could lead the market to reward it with a higher multiple, and that could pave the way to more share price upside.\nDo the experts think Advanced Micro Devices is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

See our Advertiser Disclosure.\nGrowing your savings can be a challenge, especially if you face competing financial obligations. So if you’ve managed to save $10,000 — congratulations. The next step is putting that money to good use.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nWhat to do with $10,000 in savings: 3 smart options\nIt can take a lot of time, dedication, and patience to hit $10,000 in savings. Once you get there, you might not have a clear plan for using that money.\nIf you’re looking for inspiration, consider these three ways you can use $10,000 in savings to improve your personal finances and set your future self up for success.\n1. Earn interest on your savings\nIf you’ve been keeping your money in a basic checking or savings account, you could be losing out on hundreds of dollars in interest earnings.\nToday, the national average interest rate for savings accounts is just 0.38%. However, some banks and credit unions offer rates well above this average. In fact, you could earn as much as 4% APY by opening a high-yield savings account, certificate of deposit (CD), or money market account.\nWhat would that mean for your savings? If you deposited $10,000 in a savings account that earns 4% APY and didn’t touch the money for one year, you’d earn $400 in interest.\nNow let’s say you left your original $10,000 in the account for three years while it continued to accumulate compound interest (and you don't make any additional contributions). At that point, you’d have $11,248 — including $1,248 in earned interest. Not bad for money that’s just sitting in the bank.\n2. Pay off high-interest debt\nCarrying high-interest debt means you’re losing money each month. Even if you’re saving money while paying off debt, the interest rates you’re paying are likely much higher than what you’re earning on your savings.\nSo, if you have $10,000 in savings, consider using it to pay off some or all of your debts.\nSay you have a credit card balance of $5,000 at an APR of 22%, and you pay $200 toward that balance each month. Assuming you don’t make any new charges, it would take you 34 months to pay off that debt and cost you $1,604 in interest.\nHowever, you could take half of your savings and wipe out that $5,000 debt immediately. Not only would you save over $1,600 in interest charges, but you would also have an extra $200 per month you could set aside to earn interest.\nRead more: 4 ways to increase cash flow and pay off debt faster\n3. Invest\nIf you’re saving for a long-term goal, such as retirement or a child’s college education, or simply trying to grow your wealth as much as possible, even the competitive interest rates offered on high-yield deposit accounts won’t be enough to get you there within a reasonable amount of time.\nIn this case, you’ll need to invest in the market. Historically, the average stock market return is about 10% per year as measured by the S&P 500 index. Though you’ll take on more risk — and maybe even see your portfolio value go down at times — you’ll be able to grow that $10,000 significantly in the long run.\nIf possible, prioritize contributing to a tax-advantaged account such as an IRA, 401(k), or 529 plan. If you’ve already maxed out your contributions for the year, you can buy additional investments through a taxable brokerage account.\nBut if you’re not comfortable crafting your own investment strategy, consider speaking with a reputable financial adviser who can customize a plan that fits your risk tolerance and financial needs.\nFinding a fiduciary financial adviser doesn't have to be hard. SmartAsset's free tool matches you with up to 3 financial advisers that serve your area in 5 minutes.\nFrequently asked questions\nIs $10,000 in savings good?\nOverall, $10,000 is a positive step toward financial security, but whether it's \"good\" depends on your individual circumstances and financial goals.\nThe median balance for all transaction accounts (checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, call accounts, and prepaid credit cards) is just $8,000, according to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances.\nSo, if you have $10,000 saved up, you’re ahead of the curve. And in general, $10,000 is a good starting point for many people, especially if you have clear goals and little debt. And there are steps you can take to maximize that money and save even more.\nRead more: How to save $10,000 in 6 months\nHow much interest will I get on $10,000 a year in a savings account?\nThe interest you earn on $10,000 in a savings account depends on the account's annual percentage yield (APY). Today, the national average savings account rate is 0.38% APY. At this rate, a $10,000 deposit would earn approximately $38 in interest over one year.\nHowever, high-yield savings accounts offer significantly higher rates. For instance, some accounts provide APYs up to 4%. With a 4% APY, a $10,000 deposit would yield about $400 in interest over one year.\nIs $10,000 too much to keep in savings accounts?\nFinancial experts often recommend maintaining an emergency fund of three to six months' worth of expenses. If $10,000 fits this guideline based on your expenses, it's the right amount to keep in a savings account. For savings in excess of $10,000, you might consider other investments that offer higher returns, depending on your financial goals and risk tolerance.\nWhat percentage of people have $10,000 in savings?\nThe typical American has $8,000 in cash across their bank accounts, including savings accounts, according to the Federal Reserve. The median balance in all transaction accounts varies by age:\n-\nUnder 35: $5,400\n-\nBetween 35 and 44: $7,500\n-\nBetween 45 and 54: $8,700\n-\nBetween 55 and 64: $8,000\n-\nBetween 65 and 74: $13,400\n-\n75 and older: $10,000", "content_hash": "1365a6f2a2d87155de12f13f34336c20", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

That’s the lowest in 10 months. The 30-year-fixed moves in line with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which has been lurching lower since mid-July.\nBond yields – rates – fall when prices rise, and vice versa. As investors dial back their expectations about inflation and up their forecasts for Fed rate cuts, bonds become more attractive.\nOn Aug. 13, a measure of trader expectations for rate cuts showed near universal consensus that the central bank would deliver one 25-basis cut at its September meeting – though that was trimmed to about 90% on Aug. 14, when a fresh report showed wholesale inflation was hotter than expected.\nFreddie’s weekly data was collected before the producer price index release Aug. 14, however, and it can take a little more time for mortgage rates to respond to market conditions.\nLower borrowing costs have helped boost the housing market over the past few weeks. Mortgage applications were about 11% higher in the most recent week, with applications to refinance up 23%, the Mortgage Bankers Association said. And applications for home purchases were 22% higher than at the same time last year.\nThe bigger question is what happens next. Fed officials are caught between responding to news about a slowing job market and the unknowns about inflation as tariff effects take hold.\nAnd even if the central bank does decide to cut rates this fall, that doesn’t necessarily mean that Treasury yields will follow. An analysis out Aug. 14 before the producer price index found that when rate cuts take place outside of recessions, like in 1995-1996, 2019 and 2024, 10-year yields move very little – and may even increase.\n\"This makes sense to us,\" wrote Nicholas Colas, co-founder of the financial-markets analytics company DataTrek Research. \"When the Fed is fine-tuning policy rates rather than responding to recession, the market can read that as either a sign that inflation is under control or that lower rates might spark an increase in aggregate demand that pushes prices higher.\"\nJust last fall, the Fed lowered its benchmark rate a full percentage point, but mortgage rates ended the year higher than they did in September.\nThe Fed is lowering interest rates. So why are mortgage rates going up?\nStill, the housing market remains pricey, and many buyers are skittish about their own finances, pointed out Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist for Bright MLS.", "content_hash": "d5c72f3db929f89307104316d7557b7d", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

With economic growth slowing and consumer prices going up, it's more important than ever to ensure your money is working harder for you.\nThat’s where a high-yield savings account (HYSA) comes to the rescue.\nA HYSA leverages high interest rates to help you save more faster — which is perfect if you’re looking to set up an emergency fund or have a specific savings goal in mind.\nRead on to find out what a HYSA is, the key benefits of high-yield accounts, and get some of the best HYSA deals in August 2025.\nA high-yield savings account (HYSA) is a savings product that offers substantially higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts.\nHigh-yield accounts work a lot like traditional savings products. You can link existing checking accounts, make deposits, and withdraw your cash when you need it.\nBut banks offer better annual percentage yield (APY) rates on HYSAs for a couple of reasons.\nThe best high-yield account providers tend to be online-only challenger banks. They don’t have physical branches, which means lower operating costs. To win business, those savings are then passed on to customers in the form of higher APYs.\nHigh-yield accounts also tend to offer variable rates.\nThat means the rate you’re shown when opening an account may fluctuate when the Federal Reserve changes its base borrowing rate. Rates can also shift in line with demand and each bank’s respective growth strategy.\nYou should also bear in mind that some high-yield accounts have access limits.\nFor example, you might need to wait 1-2 working days to receive your funds after requesting a withdrawal. Many HYSA providers also impose monthly withdrawal limits.\nIf you’re debating whether to set up a HYSA, here’s what makes high-yield accounts stand out:\nThe core benefit of a HYSA account is higher levels of compound interest.\nAccording to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the average savings account yield in July 2025 was 0.38%. By contrast, some of the best high-yield accounts are paying over 4.00% APY.\nThat means you could earn up to seven times more on your deposit by placing it in a HYSA.\nBecause many HYSA providers are online banks with few overheads, they can afford to drop monthly maintenance fees.\nThat makes saving cheap and simple.\nA HYSA is an easy way to accumulate interest without sacrificing liquidity.\nUnlike other high-interest savings products, the cash you deposit in a high-yield account is still accessible. Some online HYSAs take a couple working days to process withdrawals, but there’s a growing range of accounts that offer instant 24/7 access.\nThere’s no such thing as a sure thing in markets. That’s one reason savers turn to HYSAs.\nThe FDIC insures all balances of up to $250,000. Even if your online bank goes bust, you’re not going to lose your deposit. That level of safety, paired with relatively high interest rates, makes high-yield accounts an attractive alternative to investing.\nOpening a high-yield savings account is typically a fast and straightforward process.\nHere’s how it works:\nStart by shopping around. Create a shortlist of savings providers and products, then compare:\n-\nAPY\n-\nDeposit requirements\n-\nAccount fees\n-\nAccess rules\nStack these features against your savings goals and access requirements. Then, go for the account that looks like the best fit.\nDon’t be afraid to get in touch with providers to let them know you’re shopping around. They may pull out some extra incentives.\nAfter selecting the high-yield account you’re after, it’s time to apply.\nYou’ll need to have documentation handy to complete the application. This will include your:\nMost HYSA applications are online-only. They take a few minutes to complete, and approval is often instant.\nAfter approval, you can immediately deposit money into your HYSA.\nThe easiest way to do this is by making an external bank transfer from an existing checking account. Some high-yield account providers will also offer ACH options.\nAfter that, you can sit back, relax, and watch your savings build. Most HYSA providers compound interest and deposit interest payments on a monthly basis.\nThere are some attractive HYSA options available on the market in 2025.\nTo help you get started, here are some top picks that have no monthly fees:\n-\nAxos ONE® Savings: 4.46% APY with $1,500 minimum balance.\n-\nPeak Bank Envision Savings: 4.35% APY with $100 minimum balance.\n-\nEverBank Performance Savings: 4.30% APY with $0 minimum balance.\n-\nBread Savings: 4.25% APY with $100 minimum balance.\n-\nOpenbank High Yield Savings: 4.20% APY with $500 minimum balance.\n-\nCIT Bank Platinum Savings: 4.00% APY with $5,000 minimum balance.\n-\nBarclays Tiered Savings: 3.90% with $0 minimum balance.\nRemember: These are the tip of the iceberg. There are loads of HYSAs to choose from, and the best fit for you will depend on a few factors.\nGo for an account that offers a minimum balance you’re comfortable with and accessibility rules that work for you. It’s also important to look at fees. And if you’d like easy and regular contact with bank staff, you might need to trade in the highest possible APY that online-only banks offer.\nNot sure if a HYSA is right for your savings strategy? Don’t worry. There are several popular alternatives worth exploring:\nCertificates of Deposit (CDs) let you lock up your funds for a set term. This term can vary anywhere between three months and five years, and the rate is generally on par with a HYSA.\nUnlike a high-yield account, a CD’s interest rate is fixed for the duration of your term.\nThe catch: your deposit is inaccessible. Early withdrawals often lead to large fees or account closure.\nA money market account (MMA) essentially combines the features of a checking and savings account.\nMMAs offer debit cards and can make transactions like a checking account. They also offer higher APY than a traditional savings account.\nIn exchange for added functionality, the APY on an MMA is normally lower than a HYSA or CD. Minimum balances and monthly maintenance fees are also common.\nTreasury Bonds are another easy way to put idle cash to work without shouldering much risk.\nAs of August 2025, US Series I Savings Bonds (I Bonds) are posting an average rate of 4.24%. Returns are adjusted for inflation, which makes bonds a relatively safe investment. Just remember you can’t cash in a bond for 12 months — and if you cash in before the five-year mark, you’ll lose three months of interest.\nAt the end of the day, a high-yield account is an easy way to generate high levels of interest on your savings.\nThere’s a wide range of HYSA products available that offer varying rates, deposit requirements, and access rules. So you should be able to find a solution that aligns with your savings strategy.\nBut don’t forget to shop around. And if a high-yield savings account doesn’t quite work for you, be sure to check out alternatives like CDs or MMAs so you can start cashing in on higher interest rates.\nOn the date of publication, Nash Riggins did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Marjorie Taylor Greene loaded up on Palantir stock. Since Greene's trades were reported between April 7 and 8, shares of Palantir have soared by 130% as of this writing (Aug. 8). In hindsight, buying the dip in Palantir stock earlier this year looks like an incredibly savvy move.\nWhile some investors may think they've missed the boat, fear not! Wedbush Securities technology research analyst Dan Ives recently raised his price target on Palantir to $200 following the company's astonishing blowout second-quarter earnings report.\nLet's dig into the catalysts fueling Palantir's business right now and explore whether Ives' new price forecast is feasible.\nPalantir is dominating the AI software agenda\nAt its core, Palantir develops a host of AI-powered software suites -- Foundry, Gotham, and Apollo -- each designed to solve complex data-driven challenges. These platforms are stitched together to form a broader fabric, integrating services across data analytics, real-time simulated modeling, and decision-making tools. Together, they form an AI backbone for both large corporate enterprises and government agencies around the world.\nDuring the second quarter, Palantir generated growth of 47% and 49% across its commercial and public sector businesses, respectively. To understand just how impressive this is, consider that Palantir's Rule of 40 score now sits at 94% -- materially higher than any of its software-as-a-service (SaaS) peers and trails only Nvidia when benchmarked against the 25 largest companies by market cap.\nCan Palantir stock reach $200?\nAs of this writing, Palantir stock trades for $180 per share -- implying only an 11% move to reach Ives' $200 target. Ives has been celebrating Palantir's \"hyper growth demand,\" citing the \"use case era of the AI Revolution\" as Palantir's key differentiator -- suggesting that Palantir is uniquely positioned relative to its software peers.\nThe steepening curves in both revenue and profitability imply a strong unit economics across Palantir's operation. Much of this momentum can be attributed to notable upsells with existing customers, as well as the company's leading position for emerging use cases at the intersection of defense and technology -- just as Ives implies.\nIs Palantir stock a buy right now?\nThe chart below benchmarks Palantir against a peer set of leading enterprise software stocks on a price-to-sales (P/S) basis. With a P/S ratio of 132, Palantir is the clear outlier in this cohort.\nTo me, Palantir's continued valuation expansion suggests that growth investors are looking beyond traditional metrics and increasingly buying into a greater narrative -- one that positions Palantir in a league of its own as a company on the cusp of prolonged periods of accelerating revenue, profitability, and outright domination in the AI software realm.\nAs a longtime Palantir bull, I'm both excited and optimistic about the company's future. While I do think Ives' forecast of $200 per share is achievable, it's also worth pointing out that Palantir stock now trades at a historically high valuation -- similar to levels seen during prior stock market bubbles.\nFor these reasons, buying Palantir stock today comes down to individual risk tolerances. If you are an investor with a long-term time horizon, the payoff from Palantir could be enormous as the AI narrative continues to unfold. But like most growth stocks, owning Palantir will not come without periods of extreme volatility.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

So, changes (and expected changes) to Fed interest rates, and the resulting impact on the prime rate and Treasury yields, influence how much shoppers and businesses pay in interest and have left over to spend.\nThat affects economic activity, which in turn affects corporate revenue and earnings growth, which are the lifeblood of higher stock prices.\nAs a result, investors closely watch the Fed's monetary policy.\nThe central bank decides its monetary policy based on economic data, specifically data on jobs and prices, which enable it to balance its dual mandate to foster low unemployment and inflation.\nSo far, the data have led the Fed to sit on its hands in 2025, leaving rates unchanged because of concern that the tariffs would cause inflation to spike.\nBut investors have increasingly modeled for eventual rate cuts, hoping trade negotiations would lower effective tariffs by more than expected this spring, thus supporting stock prices and, eventually, lower rates.\nThose hopes strengthened following recent weak jobs data, leading most to predict that the Fed will lower rates in September, driving higher GDP, sales and earnings.\nUnfortunately, the July PPI report may have tossed a monkey wrench into that optimism.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produces the inflation report, PPI increased 0.9% in July, the most significant jump since June 2022. Economists expected a 0.2% increase.\nOverall, headline PPI inflation rose 3.3% in July year-over-year. The index for final demand minus volatile foods, energy, and trade services was up 2.8% in the past year, \"increasing 0.6% in July, the largest increase since rising 0.9% in March 2022,\" according to the BLS's statement.\n\"July PPI explodes to the upside leaving Powell in a bind and expected rate cuts in question,\" wrote longtime Wall Street analyst Stephen Guilfoyle in a TheStreet Pro post.\n\"In what can only be termed as a kick in the pants for anyone hoping for (or betting on) a series of aggressive rate cuts to kick off with the Sept. 17 Federal Open Market Committee policy decision, this was a rude awakening.\"\nWhat PPI means for the stock market and the Fed\nThe average annual return for the S&P 500 since the 1950s is about 10%, yet the benchmark index has rallied 28% since April 9's reciprocal tariff pause.\nThe gains have been unrelenting, locking many investors out of the market. As a result, the S&P 500's valuation has arguably become stretched and may be pricing stocks for perfection.\nThe S&P 500's price-to-earnings multiple, a key valuation measure investors use to determine whether stocks are cheap or pricey, has climbed above 22. That's flirting with levels last seen near the highs in February before stocks fell sharply on tariff announcements.\nHistorically, high p/e multiples haven't translated into significant gains one year later, suggesting that earnings will have to grow faster than prices if stocks are to continue moving up.\nAny delay to rate cuts that could fuel GDP and profit growth would be unwelcome.\n\"July producer prices simply exploded to the upside. There's no way to sugarcoat this,\" said Guilfoyle. \"Unless this is reversed or revised in a more frigid direction with the early September release of the August data, the Fed has all the ammo it needs to be more cautious, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell looks a lot less foolish than I thought he had.\"\nCurrently, the CME's FedWatch tool, which tracks rate-cut probabilities based on the futures markets, still shows a likely cut in September and October. However, the chances for a third cut in 2025 fell dramatically.\n\"That third rate cut of a quarter point that had been priced in for December ahead of this release has now been pushed out to April. That's a big deal,\" said Guilfoyle.", "content_hash": "18711b3a9abbf5ec4abd95bf35353f12", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Now, his eyes are set on MicroStrategy, a Virginia-based software company that has lately changed its name to \"Strategy.\"\nThe company is well known for its corporate Bitcoin vault. But Chanos is clear in his criticism: the company's business model is \"financial nonsense,\" and its shares are worth a lot more than the Bitcoin they represent.\nChanos's main point is based on a single number: market net asset value, or mNAV. This represents the value of the company's Bitcoin holdings per share, minus its debts and preferred equity, relative to the actual stock price.\nStrategy now has around $77.2 billion worth of Bitcoin. However, the price of its shares suggests that each share is worth significantly more than the coins themselves. Traders call that extra gap the \"premium,\" and Chanos thinks it's not fair.\nStrategy's premium has been under both scrutiny and praise. The corporation doesn't just use cash reserves or issue traditional debt to get money. It also sells perpetual preferred shares, such as its STRD (\"Stride\") and STRC (\"Stretch\") offerings.\nInvestors in these preferreds receive regular dividends, typically ranging from 9% to 12%, which Strategy uses to purchase additional Bitcoin.\nThe method gives investors more power: when the market is strong, the extra Bitcoin raises returns for regular stockholders. But in poor markets, those fixed dividend obligations stay in place, which might lower value and force Strategy to keep raising money.\nIn favor of MSTR\nMichael Saylor, the executive chairman of Strategy and the person who came up with this plan, says the extra money is well worth it. He talks about it in terms of four main benefits.\nThe first is \"credit amplification,\" which means that the company can raise more money than its equity base would normally allow, which increases its exposure to Bitcoin.\nThe second is an \"options advantage.\" Strategy's common stock, which still trades under the MSTR ticker, has one of the most active options markets tied to the price of Bitcoin. This allows investors to set up trades using calls, options, and spreads in ways that aren't easily possible with direct Bitcoin holdings.\n\"Passive flows\" is the third pillar. MSTR is included in index funds and other investment products that follow regulations. These funds automatically acquire the stock, regardless of its cost, which keeps the demand consistent.\nLastly, there is \"institutional access.\" Many big pools of money, such as pension funds and endowments, can't acquire Bitcoin directly. By holding MSTR shares, they can still acquire exposure to Bitcoin's price swings.\n\"Believe it or not, there are a lot of people who …don't want the Bitcoin return. They want 100% return. So MicroStrategy, the equity, or strategy,..We actually aim to generate 2x the Bitcoin return and 2x the volatility.\"\nAnalysis by Ryan (@ryQuant) highlights that the perpetual preferred model could drive 51% annual growth and a $1,960 fair value, allowing Strategy to keep adding Bitcoin indefinitely by paying dividends.\nChanos and other skeptics are uncertain whether the benefits outweigh the costs.\nFirst of all, \"credit amplification\" costs money. Chanos says that preferred dividends must be paid no matter how well Bitcoin does, and that individual investors can often borrow money at lower rates than Strategy does.\nSkeptics also disagree with the \"passive flows\" thesis, arguing that index inclusions can alter the market and that the buying pressure they create is not permanent.\nCritics argue that the restrictions preventing large investors from buying Bitcoin directly are diminishing, particularly with the introduction of U.S.-listed spot ETFs.\nFurther, holding Bitcoin through a corporate wrapper introduces \"double taxation,\" where profits could be taxed at both the corporate and shareholder level, as per reports.\nChanos says that the biggest risk is that the premium itself might fall apart. If investors are less inclined to pay more than mNAV, MSTR's shares could drop a lot even if the price of Bitcoin stays the same.\nSome traders take a short position in MSTR and a long position in Bitcoin at the same time, anticipating that the premium would go down over time.\nAt press time, Strategy's mNAV stands at up by 0.62%. Interestingly, MSTR has been 91% volatile among all assets over the last year — even more extreme than Tesla or Bitcoin.", "content_hash": "d04f59c53242ed8ab9cc9a90858b3d35", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Ives has been celebrating Palantir's \"hyper growth demand,\" citing the \"use case era of the AI Revolution\" as Palantir's key differentiator -- suggesting that Palantir is uniquely positioned relative to its software peers.\nThe steepening curves in both revenue and profitability imply a strong unit economics across Palantir's operation. Much of this momentum can be attributed to notable upsells with existing customers, as well as the company's leading position for emerging use cases at the intersection of defense and technology -- just as Ives implies.\nIs Palantir stock a buy right now?\nThe chart below benchmarks Palantir against a peer set of leading enterprise software stocks on a price-to-sales (P/S) basis. With a P/S ratio of 132, Palantir is the clear outlier in this cohort.\nTo me, Palantir's continued valuation expansion suggests that growth investors are looking beyond traditional metrics and increasingly buying into a greater narrative -- one that positions Palantir in a league of its own as a company on the cusp of prolonged periods of accelerating revenue, profitability, and outright domination in the AI software realm.\nAs a longtime Palantir bull, I'm both excited and optimistic about the company's future. While I do think Ives' forecast of $200 per share is achievable, it's also worth pointing out that Palantir stock now trades at a historically high valuation -- similar to levels seen during prior stock market bubbles.\nFor these reasons, buying Palantir stock today comes down to individual risk tolerances. If you are an investor with a long-term time horizon, the payoff from Palantir could be enormous as the AI narrative continues to unfold. But like most growth stocks, owning Palantir will not come without periods of extreme volatility.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

So, changes (and expected changes) to Fed interest rates, and the resulting impact on the prime rate and Treasury yields, influence how much shoppers and businesses pay in interest and have left over to spend.\nThat affects economic activity, which in turn affects corporate revenue and earnings growth, which are the lifeblood of higher stock prices.\nAs a result, investors closely watch the Fed's monetary policy.\nThe central bank decides its monetary policy based on economic data, specifically data on jobs and prices, which enable it to balance its dual mandate to foster low unemployment and inflation.\nSo far, the data have led the Fed to sit on its hands in 2025, leaving rates unchanged because of concern that the tariffs would cause inflation to spike.\nBut investors have increasingly modeled for eventual rate cuts, hoping trade negotiations would lower effective tariffs by more than expected this spring, thus supporting stock prices and, eventually, lower rates.\nThose hopes strengthened following recent weak jobs data, leading most to predict that the Fed will lower rates in September, driving higher GDP, sales and earnings.\nUnfortunately, the July PPI report may have tossed a monkey wrench into that optimism.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produces the inflation report, PPI increased 0.9% in July, the most significant jump since June 2022. Economists expected a 0.2% increase.\nOverall, headline PPI inflation rose 3.3% in July year-over-year. The index for final demand minus volatile foods, energy, and trade services was up 2.8% in the past year, \"increasing 0.6% in July, the largest increase since rising 0.9% in March 2022,\" according to the BLS's statement.\n\"July PPI explodes to the upside leaving Powell in a bind and expected rate cuts in question,\" wrote longtime Wall Street analyst Stephen Guilfoyle in a TheStreet Pro post.\n\"In what can only be termed as a kick in the pants for anyone hoping for (or betting on) a series of aggressive rate cuts to kick off with the Sept. 17 Federal Open Market Committee policy decision, this was a rude awakening.\"\nWhat PPI means for the stock market and the Fed\nThe average annual return for the S&P 500 since the 1950s is about 10%, yet the benchmark index has rallied 28% since April 9's reciprocal tariff pause.\nThe gains have been unrelenting, locking many investors out of the market. As a result, the S&P 500's valuation has arguably become stretched and may be pricing stocks for perfection.\nThe S&P 500's price-to-earnings multiple, a key valuation measure investors use to determine whether stocks are cheap or pricey, has climbed above 22. That's flirting with levels last seen near the highs in February before stocks fell sharply on tariff announcements.\nHistorically, high p/e multiples haven't translated into significant gains one year later, suggesting that earnings will have to grow faster than prices if stocks are to continue moving up.\nAny delay to rate cuts that could fuel GDP and profit growth would be unwelcome.\n\"July producer prices simply exploded to the upside. There's no way to sugarcoat this,\" said Guilfoyle. \"Unless this is reversed or revised in a more frigid direction with the early September release of the August data, the Fed has all the ammo it needs to be more cautious, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell looks a lot less foolish than I thought he had.\"\nCurrently, the CME's FedWatch tool, which tracks rate-cut probabilities based on the futures markets, still shows a likely cut in September and October. However, the chances for a third cut in 2025 fell dramatically.\n\"That third rate cut of a quarter point that had been priced in for December ahead of this release has now been pushed out to April. That's a big deal,\" said Guilfoyle.", "content_hash": "18711b3a9abbf5ec4abd95bf35353f12", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Now, his eyes are set on MicroStrategy, a Virginia-based software company that has lately changed its name to \"Strategy.\"\nThe company is well known for its corporate Bitcoin vault. But Chanos is clear in his criticism: the company's business model is \"financial nonsense,\" and its shares are worth a lot more than the Bitcoin they represent.\nChanos's main point is based on a single number: market net asset value, or mNAV. This represents the value of the company's Bitcoin holdings per share, minus its debts and preferred equity, relative to the actual stock price.\nStrategy now has around $77.2 billion worth of Bitcoin. However, the price of its shares suggests that each share is worth significantly more than the coins themselves. Traders call that extra gap the \"premium,\" and Chanos thinks it's not fair.\nStrategy's premium has been under both scrutiny and praise. The corporation doesn't just use cash reserves or issue traditional debt to get money. It also sells perpetual preferred shares, such as its STRD (\"Stride\") and STRC (\"Stretch\") offerings.\nInvestors in these preferreds receive regular dividends, typically ranging from 9% to 12%, which Strategy uses to purchase additional Bitcoin.\nThe method gives investors more power: when the market is strong, the extra Bitcoin raises returns for regular stockholders. But in poor markets, those fixed dividend obligations stay in place, which might lower value and force Strategy to keep raising money.\nIn favor of MSTR\nMichael Saylor, the executive chairman of Strategy and the person who came up with this plan, says the extra money is well worth it. He talks about it in terms of four main benefits.\nThe first is \"credit amplification,\" which means that the company can raise more money than its equity base would normally allow, which increases its exposure to Bitcoin.\nThe second is an \"options advantage.\" Strategy's common stock, which still trades under the MSTR ticker, has one of the most active options markets tied to the price of Bitcoin. This allows investors to set up trades using calls, options, and spreads in ways that aren't easily possible with direct Bitcoin holdings.\n\"Passive flows\" is the third pillar. MSTR is included in index funds and other investment products that follow regulations. These funds automatically acquire the stock, regardless of its cost, which keeps the demand consistent.\nLastly, there is \"institutional access.\" Many big pools of money, such as pension funds and endowments, can't acquire Bitcoin directly. By holding MSTR shares, they can still acquire exposure to Bitcoin's price swings.\n\"Believe it or not, there are a lot of people who …don't want the Bitcoin return. They want 100% return. So MicroStrategy, the equity, or strategy,..We actually aim to generate 2x the Bitcoin return and 2x the volatility.\"\nAnalysis by Ryan (@ryQuant) highlights that the perpetual preferred model could drive 51% annual growth and a $1,960 fair value, allowing Strategy to keep adding Bitcoin indefinitely by paying dividends.\nChanos and other skeptics are uncertain whether the benefits outweigh the costs.\nFirst of all, \"credit amplification\" costs money. Chanos says that preferred dividends must be paid no matter how well Bitcoin does, and that individual investors can often borrow money at lower rates than Strategy does.\nSkeptics also disagree with the \"passive flows\" thesis, arguing that index inclusions can alter the market and that the buying pressure they create is not permanent.\nCritics argue that the restrictions preventing large investors from buying Bitcoin directly are diminishing, particularly with the introduction of U.S.-listed spot ETFs.\nFurther, holding Bitcoin through a corporate wrapper introduces \"double taxation,\" where profits could be taxed at both the corporate and shareholder level, as per reports.\nChanos says that the biggest risk is that the premium itself might fall apart. If investors are less inclined to pay more than mNAV, MSTR's shares could drop a lot even if the price of Bitcoin stays the same.\nSome traders take a short position in MSTR and a long position in Bitcoin at the same time, anticipating that the premium would go down over time.\nAt press time, Strategy's mNAV stands at up by 0.62%. Interestingly, MSTR has been 91% volatile among all assets over the last year — even more extreme than Tesla or Bitcoin.", "content_hash": "d04f59c53242ed8ab9cc9a90858b3d35", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Importantly, it looks like this cloud infrastructure provider has room for more upside even after its phenomenal rally.\nNebius is a Dutch company that provides artificial intelligence (AI) cloud computing infrastructure. It operates AI data centers with large-scale graphics processing unit (GPU) clusters and provides tools and software solutions that customers can use to train AI models and run inference applications.\nThe AI cloud infrastructure market that Nebius serves is growing at a breathtaking pace. Let's take a closer look at Nebius and see why this red-hot growth stock has room for more upside.\nNebius' eye-popping growth is here to stay\nNebius has built its business by accumulating powerful AI GPUs from Nvidia and renting them out to customers. Developers can access a range of Nvidia GPUs such as the H100, the H200, and B200 at hourly rates from Nebius and run various AI models from Microsoft, Meta Platforms, DeepSeek, and others.\nNebius' full-stack AI infrastructure allows customers to train and fine-tune AI models, develop custom AI applications, and run inference tasks. Importantly, customers can increase or decrease the usage of Nebius' platform according to their needs. The company's latest quarterly results make it clear that its business model is a hit with customers.\nIts revenue in the second quarter of 2025 jumped by more than 7x year over year to $105 million. Nebius also reduced its net loss by 49% owing to its focus on lowering the operating costs of data centers. Management points out that Nebius lowered its total cost of ownership by 20% by improving the hardware design of its data centers and investing in energy-saving solutions.\nLooking ahead, Nebius is focused on aggressively expanding its data center capacity so that it can corner a bigger share of the fast-growing cloud AI infrastructure market. The company aims to boost its data center capacity to 220 megawatts by the end of 2025 before ramping it up to 1 gigawatt by the end of next year.\nNebius was sitting on $1.68 billion worth of cash at the end of the previous quarter, which it will use for capacity expansion. The company says that the demand for its solutions is outpacing supply, which is why it is important for it to keep investing in more capacity. Also, higher data center capacity will translate into more business for Nebius, which explains why the company has increased its annualized run-rate revenue (ARR) for 2025.\nIt now expects ARR to land between $900 million and $1.1 billion this year as compared to the earlier estimate of $750 million to $1 billion. Analysts, meanwhile, are expecting Nebius' top line to jump by over 5x in 2025, followed by robust growth over the next couple of years as well.\nHowever, don't be surprised to see Nebius blowing past analysts' expectations in the current year and beyond. The company was originally guiding for $500 million to $700 million in revenue for 2025, and the increased ARR guidance indicates that it could exceed the midpoint of its original guidance range. So, a stronger-than-expected performance going forward should set Nebius up for more gains.\nThe valuation is expensive, but investors should look at the bigger picture\nNebius' remarkable rally this year has brought the stock's price-to-sales ratio to 66. That's well above the U.S. technology sector's average sales multiple of 8.7. However, Nebius' outstanding growth explains why it is richly valued. The company is growing at an eye-popping pace and is relatively cheaper than some other AI stocks.\nWhat's more, the outstanding sales growth that the company is expected to deliver in the future is the reason why its forward sales multiples are much lower.\nFinally, investors shouldn't forget that Nebius is operating in a market that's expected to grow rapidly in the long run. Fortune Business Insights estimates that the cloud infrastructure-as-a-service market could clock an annual growth rate of almost 21% through 2032, generating more than $712 billion in annual revenue at the end of the forecast period.\nNebius is currently growing at a much faster pace than the end market, and its capacity expansion efforts should allow it to become a key player in this space. All this makes Nebius a top AI stock to buy right now as its phenomenal growth is likely to result in more upside.\nShould you buy stock in Nebius Group right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nebius Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nebius Group wasn’t one of them.

See our Advertiser Disclosure.\nHome equity can be a helpful way to pay for home repairs, renovations, or improvements. Not only do home equity loans and lines of credit typically come with lower interest rates than other forms of borrowing, but they also come in fairly large loan amounts (usually up to 80% of your equity). You could also earn a valuable tax deduction with these products.\nStill, every homeowner should understand the process and its pros and cons before taking equity out of their house to pay for home improvements.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nLearn more: The best home equity loan lenders\nWhat is home equity?\nHome equity is the portion of your house’s value you actually own. To calculate yours, you take the value of your home and subtract your outstanding mortgage balance. That’s your home equity stake.\nLet’s say you own a $400,000 home and still owe $300,000 on your mortgage loan. Here’s how to determine how much equity you have:\n$400,000 - $300,000 = $100,000.\nYou have $100,000 in equity.\n$100,000 is 25% of $400,000, so you have 25% equity in your home.\nYou build home equity every time you make a mortgage payment because you are paying down your loan balance. Your equity also increases when your home gains value (or decreases if your home loses value).\nWays to use your home equity to pay for home improvements\nWhen you build up enough equity, you have a few options for tapping into it. You can use money from the following financial products for any purpose, but many borrowers put the money toward home improvement projects and major renovations.\nHere are your main financing options for putting your home equity toward home improvements.\nHome equity loans\nIn some ways, home equity loans work similarly to traditional mortgages. You get an up-front lump sum, and then you repay the balance monthly over an extended period of time, such as 30 years.\nHome equity loans tend to have fixed interest rates. This is ideal if you have one or two main home improvement projects, know how much money you need, and want to use the cash all at once. It’s also good if you want fixed, predictable payments.\nHome equity lines of credit (HELOCs)\nBecause they’re lines of credit, HELOCs work more like credit cards. You can withdraw money from the allotted amount during the draw period, which typically lasts 10 years. You’ll usually only make interest payments during this time.\nHELOC lenders often charge variable interest rates, meaning the rate can rise or fall over the loan term. Make sure you can handle the changing interest rate and payments that come with a HELOC.\nBecause you take out money as you need it, HELOCs can be ideal if you have several ongoing improvement projects or aren’t sure how much a renovation project will cost up front.\nHome equity sharing\nHome equity sharing contracts allow you to sell a portion of your home’s future value to investors in exchange for a lump sum. You don’t have to pay interest or make monthly payments, but you do have to pay off the balance — plus a portion of your home’s appreciation when your term ends or you sell the home.\nHome equity sharing can benefit homeowners whose credit scores are too low to qualify for home equity loans or HELOCs. However, it is only available in certain markets where home equity investing companies operate. Some examples of these companies include Unison, Hometap, and Point.\nLearn more: How to tap into home equity with a second mortgage\nPros and cons of using home equity for home improvements\nHome equity is often a good way to pay for home improvements, but it’s not always the right answer. If you’re considering putting your home equity toward repairs or home projects, weigh these pros and cons first.\nPros\n-\nPotential tax deduction. If you use your home equity funds to “buy, build, or substantially improve” your home, you can deduct the interest from your loan on your annual tax return.\n-\nLower interest rate than other options. HELOCs and home equity loans tend to have much lower interest rates than other borrowing options you might be considering, including credit cards and personal loans.\n-\nIt could improve your home value. Depending on what improvements you make, you could increase your home value. This could lead to higher profits when you sell.\n-\nLarge loan amounts. Many lenders will let you borrow up to 80% of your home equity (sometimes even 90%). If you’ve paid down a substantial percentage of your debt, this could amount to a pretty hefty sum.\nCons\n-\nPuts your home at risk. Home equity loans and HELOCs are secured loans, meaning they use your home as collateral, so if you fail to make payments, your lender could foreclose on your house. Unsecured debts, such as credit cards, don’t put your real assets in jeopardy.\n-\nReduces your equity. Taking out a HELOC or home equity loan lessens how much equity you have in your home. Should your property lose value later, you could end up owing more on the home than it’s worth. This could result in selling your home at a loss.\n-\nIt may come with closing costs and fees. As with your original mortgage, you’ll typically need to pay various closing costs and fees when you use a home equity product. Make sure to shop around for HELOC and home equity loan lenders to find ones that charge fewer fees.\n-\nNeed lots of equity to qualify. You will usually need at least 20% equity in your home to qualify for a home equity loan or HELOC. So, on a $300,000 house, your mortgage balance when applying should be no more than $240,000.\nIf you’re not sure whether the pros outweigh the cons in your situation, talk to a professional. A mortgage broker, loan officer, or financial planner can help you make the right decision for your goals and budget.\nUsing home equity for home improvements FAQs\nIs it wise to use home equity for home improvements?\nBorrowing against your home equity to pay for improvements can be a smart move, as long as you borrow only what you need and can afford to cover the monthly payments. Failing to make payments on a home equity loan or HELOC could lead to foreclosure — meaning you’d lose your house.\nHow do you take equity out of your home for renovations?\nTwo of the best types of loans for home renovations are home equity loans and HELOCs. Home equity sharing agreements may also be an option, depending on where you live. All three let you take equity out of your house, which you can use for home improvements.\nHow is a $50,000 home equity loan different from a $50,000 home equity line of credit (HELOC)?\nThe difference lies in how you receive the money. With a home equity loan, you’d get $50,000 up front and pay interest on that entire amount. A $50,000 HELOC, on the other hand, functions more like a credit card. You can withdraw as much (or as little) as you like from that $50,000 over a set period of time, and you’ll only pay interest on what you take out.\nHow does a HELOC for home improvement work?\nA HELOC can be a good option for home improvements, as it allows you to withdraw money over an extended period of time.

In addition, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and St Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem both threw cold water on the idea of a -50 bp rate cut at the September FOMC meeting. The dollar's interest rate differential improved with the 10-year T-note yield rising +5 bp and the 2-year T-note yield up +6 bp.\nThursday’s PPI report was much stronger than market expectations. The PPI report suggested that the markets might have been overly optimistic about Tuesday's CPI report and that companies are passing through tariffs at the wholesale level at a higher pace than earlier thought.\nThe July US final-demand PPI report of +0.9% m/m and +3.3% y/y was substantially stronger than market expectations of +0.2% m/m and +2.5% y/y.

The markets are no longer discounting any chance of a -50 bp rate cut at the September meeting and are now assigning a 93% chance of that rate cut. After Treasury Secretary Bessent's interest rate suggestion to the Fed on Wednesday, the markets temporarily assigned an 11% chance of a -50 bp rate cut at the September meeting. Nevertheless, the current 93% chance of a -25 bp rate cut in September is still substantially more dovish than the 40% chance assigned before the news of the weak July payroll report on August 1 and the in-line CPI report this past Tuesday.\nUS weekly initial unemployment claims fell by -3,000 to 224,000, which was close to expectations for a slight decline to 225,000. US weekly continuing claims fell by -15,000 to 1.953 million, which showed a slightly stronger labor market than expectations of a dip to 1.967 million.\nSan Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told the WSJ that she does not support a -50 bp rate cut at the September meeting, saying that \"would send off an urgency signal that I don't feel about the strength of the labor market.\" Ms. Daly said she still supports two rate cuts this year, but that three cuts could be warranted \"if we saw more signs that the labor market was more precarious.\"\nSt Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said that a -50 bp rate cut at the September meeting would be \"unsupported by the current state of the economy and the outlook for the economy\" in his view. He said it is too early for him to make a decision on a rate cut at the September meeting.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent Thursday tried to backtrack a bit on his statements on Wednesday in which he said interest rates are \"too constrictive\" and that rates \"should probably be 150, 175 basis points lower.\" He added, \"There's a very good chance of a 50 basis point cut. We could go into a series of rate cuts here, starting with a 50 basis point rate cut in September.\"\nIn an interview with Fox Business Thursday, Mr. Bessent said he was not telling the Fed what to do and that he was not calling for a series of Fed rate cuts with his comments on Wednesday. He said he was merely trying to say that models show the neutral rate is lower, although he didn't specify which models he was referring to. Mr. Bessent said he supports transparency and the call to clean up investment conflicts among members of Congress.\nThe markets are awaiting this Friday's Trump-Putin summit in Alaska for any progress in ending the Russian-Ukrainian war. President Trump on Monday downplayed expectations of a breakthrough, saying the summit is a \"feel-out meeting\" to end the war in Ukraine. Also, recent comments from Ukrainian President Zelenskiy dampened hopes for a quick end to the war when he rejected any talk of Ukraine ceding territory to Russia.\nIn recent tariff news, President Trump early Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. Last Wednesday, Mr. Trump announced that he will impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. Still, companies would be eligible for exemptions if they demonstrate a commitment to building their products in the US. However, the US will levy a separate tax on imports of electronic products that employ semiconductors. Also, Mr. Trump announced last Wednesday that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil. Last Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced \"within the next week or so.\" According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 93% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and at 53% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.\nEUR/USD (^EURUSD) fell -0.49% due to dollar strength. Also, sentiment on the euro remains cautious due to the negative impact of US tariffs on the European economy. Meanwhile, market expectations are low for any significant progress at Friday's Trump-Putin summit in Alaska, which suggests that the Russia-Ukraine war is likely to drag on and continue to dampen sentiment in the Eurozone economy.\nSwaps are pricing in a 7% chance of a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\nUSD/JPY (^USDJPY) rose +0.27% due to strength in the dollar. The yen saw some underlying support after US Treasury Secretary Bessent said the Bank of Japan is falling behind the curve in addressing inflation and that he expects a rate hike. However, the yen continues to be undercut by concern that US tariff policies will harm the Japanese economy.\nDecember gold (GCZ25) on Thursday closed down -25.10 (-0.74%), and September silver (SIU25) closed down -0.533 (-1.38%). Precious metals prices closed lower due to the higher dollar and the rise in T-note yields that accompanied Thursday’s hawkish US PPI report.\nGold continues to have safe-haven support related to US tariffs and geopolitical risks, including the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. Fund buying of precious metals continues to support prices after gold holdings in ETFs rose to a 2-year high on Tuesday, and silver holdings in ETFs reached a 3-year high last Friday.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The CNBC TV host believes the firm’s vast depository of user data will serve it well in today’s AI era, where firms are hungry for training data. Reddit, Inc. (NYSE:RDDT)’s shares have gained 35% year-to-date, primarily due to a 55% surge since late July. The stock rose after the firm’s second quarter revenue of $500 million and earnings per share of $0.45 beat analyst estimates of $426 million and $0.19 by a wide margin. Despite the share price gains, Cramer believes Reddit, Inc. (NYSE:RDDT) is still undervalued:\n“And then. . .I think Pinterest and Reddit are the two most undervalued companies, of the new companies, because they are being scraped and the scrapers are going to have to pay the piper. Pinterest, Reddit, they’re gonna pay the piper.”\nCopyright: dedivan1923 / 123RF Stock Photo\nHere are his earlier comments about Reddit, Inc. (NYSE:RDDT):\n“Let me start with Reddit. I use Reddit pretty aggressively. It’s a terrific product. My wife uses it to sell… her mezcal brand because Reddit has an entire mezcal forum. So I like it. The advertiser likes it. That’s where I start. I then try to find out what other people… whether they feel like I do. Rob (Rob Pace, founder and CEO of HundredX) has told me that Reddit customers are planning to increase future use because people love crowdsourced information, seems to be able to be independent… Reddit demonstrates the increasing value of human intelligence, increasing value of human intelligence, I like that. In fact, he’s betting that as the future of search evolves from finding things to figuring things out, Reddit could be a major winner. Now you take your own use as I have… You then take data from HundredX to see if your experience lines up with reality. Only then you go to the web, you look up articles, check out websites to see things like the piece we ran on Reddit a couple of days ago, which said it was great to buy. Wow, that’s been terrific. To me, that produced a terrific, really special reason to buy the stock, and I’m sticking with it. I just wish I had bought it for my Charitable Trust when I first got the hunch, but I hadn’t done the homework. Can’t jump that.”\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of RDDT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

The less-popular 15-year mortgage came in at 5.71% (down from 6.63% last week).\nThese rates represent the lowest point that we've seen since Oct. 20. At this point, they are just a little higher than their historical average since 1991. And they're likely to go lower.\nWhy are mortgage rates falling now?\nPer Fannie Mae, mortgage rates are \"determined by adding a spread to the benchmark 10-year Treasury note.\" The 10-year Treasury is a common kind of government bond, which is sold and guaranteed by the U.S. government.\nThe aforementioned spread is a premium collected by a financial institution in exchange for the risk of lending you money. Those risks consider your background, the state of the mortgage market, and the broader economy. As a result, spreads may vary from borrower to borrower.\nHowever, the real factor influencing America's recent mortgage rates has been the 10-year. Despite the Federal Reserve, America's central bank, cutting interest rates twice last year, the 10-year remained elevated into 2025. As of today at 1:49 p.m. ET, the 10-year stood at 4.287%. (Compare that with the Fed Funds Rate (FFR) of 4.25% to 4.50%.)\nThe higher yield reflects bond investors' persistent worries about inflation and the U.S. government's debt. These worries have worsened since September, when the 10-year was under 4%, reflecting investor expectations for the Fed to cut interest rates.\nOnly recently has optimism about rate cuts returned, due to the slowing rate of inflation and a more tepid economic environment. In September, the Fed is said to weigh a 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut, which could affect the 10-year.\nWhere are interest rates going from here?\nThe Fed is expected to entertain up to a half dozen rate cuts between now and the end of 2026, contingent on the state of economy. The central bank's 'dual-mandate' emphasizes maximizing employment, while maintaining low inflation. If either of those things are threatened, it could change the track of the Fed's cuts. And with that, the 10-year.\nLower interest rates are expected to revive the housing market, which has stagnated in the face of still-high rates and sky-high home valuations. Some right-sizing has happened in recent quarters, reflecting the weaker homebuying demand. Per data from FRED, median sales price for homes are down from an all-time high of $442,600 (in Q4 2022). In Q2 2025, median sales prices were $410,800. That's a 7.2% decline.", "content_hash": "741459ef4054e19477027533d656c04a", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The company meanwhile posted $114.5 million in Q2 revenue, largely from software subscriptions and providing product support.\nUnder generally acceptable accounting principles (GAAP), Strategy started recording its Bitcoin holdings at fair value this year, reflecting quarter-to-quarter price swings. Under previous rules, firms recorded cryptocurrencies at their original cost; they could write them down as an “impairment charge” if the value dropped—but could not mark them up when prices rose.", "content_hash": "3f17f2eeda6ba546c13eb99d4007884f", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Subscribe to our free daily Nrn newsletter.\nConsumer sentiment has changed since Noodles & Company rolled out its new menu on March 12. Restaurant goers are even more price sensitive than before, and that has meant the fast-casual chain has needed to readjust its brand positioning and introduce a value-oriented combo meal.\nOutgoing chief executive officer Drew Madsen said that, although same-store sales were up by 1.5% for the quarter ended July 1 — perfectly respectable in the current climate — he was disappointed in the results and is taking measures to improve traffic and sales which appear to be bearing fruit.\n“While we delivered positive same-store sales in a choppy consumer environment for our segment, overall results were below our expectations going into the quarter,” he told investors during a conference call after market on Wednesday.\nAlthough comps were up, that was due in part to the higher prices tied to new menu items: Average checks were up by 4%, but traffic was down by 2.5%\n“We have identified what we believe drove the traffic shortfall versus our expectations and have been working quickly to address it,” said Madsen, who last week announced his resignation as CEO effective Aug. 31. He will be succeeded by current chief operating officer Joe Christina.\nMadsen said the decline in traffic was due to “unexpected decline in guest value perception following our menu launch in March, something we did not see during our test market phase last year.\n“This is due in part to a change in the consumer environment over the past 12 months and the growing consumer demand for increased value and affordability, which is evidenced by the heightened discounting and promotions across the QSR, fast-casual, and casual dining segments of our industry,” he said.\nNoodles & Company responded with the July 30 introduction of its Delicious Duos value offering of a small entrée and side starting at $9.95.\nIt seems to have worked, at least in the first two weeks of its existence. Since the launch of Delicious Duos, same-store sales jumped by 5%. Traffic also improved to flat, and in the past few days leading up to the earnings call was actually up by between 1% and 2%.\nAnd the menu rolled out on March 12 has had positive results, Madsen said, with a J-curve in guest satisfaction, meaning it went down at first but then bounced back to higher than before the menu launch.\nAll of the chain’s four mac & cheese items — its top sellers — score above average in terms of taste and value perception, especially the new Garlic Bacon Crunch and Buffalo Ranch options.\nBut there were some operational challenges, and one new dish, the Green Goddess Salad, was ultimately pulled from the menu “because the recipe complexity made it difficult to execute consistently and too often left our guests dissatisfied,” Madsen said.\nNoodles & Company also reworked some of the new recipes to replace higher-cost secondary ingredients with less expensive ones, though still premium compared to the ingredients used before the relaunch. The changes so far have “had no perceived impact on taste or overall guest satisfaction,” Madsen said.\nThe chain has rolled out a new coaching program to improve operations and is working on creating six “operations excellence” coaches who will work with general managers and their teams “to continually improve the guest experience.”\nLooking forward, the next limited-time offer, to be launched early in the fourth quarter of this year is a chile-garlic ramen for which the noodles will be sautéed in butter chile garlic soy sauce and tossed with Napa and red cabbage and spinach and topped with scallions, Parmesan cheese and Asian spices for $8.95.\nDuring the second quarter the company opened one restaurant and closed six restaurants and franchisees closed two restaurants.\nAll told, nine company-owned restaurants were closed so far this year and more closures are to come, according to chief financial officer Michael Hynes.\nDuring last quarter’s earnings call, he said the company would close up to 21 underperforming restaurants, and that number has since grown to 49.\n“We recently expanded our efforts to close underperforming restaurants and now expect to close a total of 28 to 32 company-owned restaurants in 2025. In addition, we expect to close 12 to 17 company owned restaurants in 2026.”\nLooking ahead, Hynes projected total revenue for the year at between $487 million and $495 million with same-store sales growth between 2.5% and 4%.\nIncoming CEO Christina, who will assume that role at the end of the month, said in the conference call, “I am honored to lead Noodles & Company in this next chapter as we welcome 30 years of brand strength and connection.\n“I am focused on enhancing the guest experience, strengthening operational execution, driving increased traffic, and expanding unit-level margins.\n“Backed by our dedicated teams, franchisees and partners, we will strive to deliver meaningful value to our guests and stakeholders.\n“I look forward to working with Drew during this transition period in August and speaking with you all next quarter.”\nNoodles & Company Q2 by the numbers:\n• Revenue decreased 0.7% to $126.4 million\n• Same-store sales increased 1.5%\n• Net income was -$17.6 million, or a loss of 38 cents per share, compared to -13.6 million or -30 cents per share in the same quarter last year\n• Restaurant margin was down 270 basis points to 12.8% from 15.5% in Q2 2024.", "content_hash": "172ea8804dd2e1462fe740bd6d6963e7", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Because, if you want to take trip, if you want to learn to paint, if you want to learn to cook, if you want to cook something really special, it’s where you go. It’s a very useful site.

The meme coin's token price was down 8.4% over the previous 24 hours of trading as of 4 p.m. ET. Over the same period, Bitcoin was down 3.8%, and Ethereum was down 4%.\nDogecoin's valuation is slipping today after the Bureau of Labor Statistics published its Producer Price Index (PPI) report for July. The report showed PPI inflation came in at 3.7% last month -- up 0.9% from June's level. July's PPI inflation came in far higher than the broadly forecasted 3% level for the period, and the cryptocurrency market is seeing sell-offs in response.\nInflation data is dragging Dogecoin lower\nAfter July's jobs report arrived with much weaker-than-anticipated growth and huge downward revisions for estimated jobs added in May and June, it seemed virtually certain that the Federal Reserve would issue a rate cut at its meeting next month in order to stimulate activity in the economy. Following today's PPI report, the broader outlook on the interest rate front has become a lot more complicated.\nThe July uptick in sequential PPI inflation represented the highest increase since 2022, and investors are worried that the data could cause the Fed to hold off on cutting rates at its September meeting. The anticipation of rate cuts have been central to rallies for Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies in recent months, and investors are reducing exposure to the space today in response to the shifting outlook on interest rates.\nWhat's next for Dogecoin?\nWhile investors and analysts still think it's likely that the Fed will cut rates next month, the PPI data published by the BLS today could play a significant role in shaping the interest rate schedule. The report suggests that the inflationary impacts of new tariffs are still working their way through the economy. Along those lines, consumer prices could see accelerated increases in the near term -- or companies could wind up seeing significantly reduced margins on sales.\nIf key inflation data continues to come in at higher-than-expected levels, the Fed may bring rates down by a relatively small amount this year, or continue to take a wait-and-see approach.

Two million of the shares will be issued by the company, while a hefty 8 million will come from existing shareholders. The offering also includes a greenshoe option for an additional 1.5 million shares, potentially amplifying dilution for current holders.\nCircle expects to raise roughly $309.4 million from its portion of the offering, or as much as $542.6 million if underwriters exercise their greenshoe option in full. The company says the proceeds will fuel working capital needs, cover payment obligations, and support business investments and potential acquisitions, giving it more firepower to expand its stablecoin footprint. Of course, Circle will not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by existing stockholders.\nWith 80% of the secondary offering coming from existing stakeholders, the move signals clear profit-taking by insiders, including the company’s CEO, Jeremy Allaire. Moreover, coming just two months after the IPO, the secondary offering has raised questions about the company’s outlook, sparked concerns over short-term dilution and has momentarily eclipsed its strong top-line growth in the latest earnings report, as well as its ongoing efforts to advance stablecoin infrastructure.\nAbout Circle Stock\nNew York-based Circle is a global fintech firm that helps businesses of all sizes use digital currencies and public blockchains for payments, commerce, and other financial applications. Through its regulated affiliates, it issues USDC and EURC, fully backed stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar and euro respectively, and runs one of the most widely used stablecoin networks.\nCircle, which made its public debut on June 5, is quickly emerging as a rising star in the stablecoin world and the crypto industry. The momentum grew even stronger after the GENIUS Act passed in July, setting clear rules and protections for asset-backed digital tokens like those tied to the U.S. dollar. A big chunk of Circle’s revenue comes from interest earned on short-term U.S. Treasury bills that back its dollar-based stablecoin, USDC.\nValued at roughly $38.1 billion by market capitalization, this stablecoin issuer’s stock has been feeling the heat lately following a mixed earnings report and uncertainty surrounding a planned 10 million-share secondary sale. After an eye-popping triple-digit surge since its market debut, the rally has lost steam, sliding nearly 47% from its July high of $262.97. Over the past five days, shares have dipped 9%, signaling a cooling-off period after its explosive run.\nDespite its recent selloff, Circle still trades at 16.46 times sales, far above the industry average of 3.29x. This sizable premium reflects the strong confidence investors have in the company’s growth prospects, while also highlighting that much of the anticipated success may already be priced into the stock.\nInside Circle’s Q2 Earnings Report\nCircle dropped its first earnings report since its blockbuster public debut on Aug. 12, which gave investors plenty to digest. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, total revenue came in at $658.1 million, up a hefty 53% from a year ago and topping Wall Street’s $644.7 million estimate. The jump was powered by an 86% surge in average USDC in circulation. By the quarter’s end, USDC supply had swelled 90% year-over-year (YOY) to $61.3 billion and has since grown another 6.4% to $65.2 billion as of Aug. 10.\nAdjusted EBITDA also climbed 52% YOY to $126 million, reflecting the stablecoin’s rapid adoption. The headline numbers, however, were overshadowed by a steep bottom-line hit. Circle posted a net loss of $482.1 million, or $4.48 per share, compared to a $32.9 million profit, or breakeven per share, in the year-ago period. The loss was largely the result of $591 million in non-cash charges tied to the company’s June IPO. Moreover, adjusted operating expenses shot up 22% annually to $128.2 million.\nOn the growth front, Circle unveiled “Arc,” its own proprietary blockchain aimed at powering stablecoin payments, foreign exchange, and capital markets applications. Arc will be built into the company’s broader platform and is expected to start developer testing this fall. The company also rolled out a slate of new strategic partnerships with Binance, Corpay (CPAY), FIS (FIS), Fiserv (FI), and OKX, strengthening its global reach.\nLooking forward to fiscal 2025, Circle is guiding for $75 million to $85 million in other revenue, with adjusted operating expenses between $475 million and $490 million. The crypto company also sees USDC circulation expanding at a 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the cycle, underscoring its bullish outlook for the stablecoin market.\nWhat do Analysts Think About Circle Stock?\nAfter the company’s latest earnings report, US Tiger Securities analyst Bo Pei has dialed back his optimism, cutting Circle’s price target from $200 to $180. While acknowledging the company’s strong foothold in regulated stablecoins and the upcoming Arc blockchain, the analyst flagged mounting risks, shrinking profit margins, rising operating costs, and heavy reliance on interest income from reserves. With 96% of revenue still tied to interest-sensitive assets, a Fed rate cut could sting. Plus, the stock’s steep valuation leaves little room for error.\nOverall, Wall Street appears divided on Circle’s outlook, with the stock carrying a consensus “Hold” rating that reflects a tug-of-war between bullish optimism and bearish caution. Of the 14 analysts tracking the company, five are firmly in the “Strong Buy” camp, while one takes a softer stance with a “Moderate Buy.”\nOn the flip side, four analysts are content to sit on the sidelines with a “Hold,” and another four are decidedly bearish, labeling it a “Strong Sell.” CRCL’s average analyst price target of $183.54 indicates 19.8% potential upside from current levels, while the Street high price target of $280 suggests that the stock can climb as much as 82.8% from here.\nOn the date of publication, Anushka Mukherji did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

If there were signs that tariff impacts would significantly damage the economy, the Fed would have more wiggle room to cut interest rates aggressively, and bond traders would likely help bring long-term rates down.\nRight now, analysts say, the economy doesn’t seem to be weakening enough to warrant that type of action—if it even gets to that point at all in the coming months.\n“For the foreseeable future, it really does feel like mortgage rates are going to be staying pretty close to where we are,” said Chen Zhao, head of economics research at Redfin.\nMortgage rates could even rise if tariffs end up pushing up inflation substantially, Zhao said.\nIf so, markets’ expectations of Fed cuts would diminish, keeping rates elevated. One potential harbinger of that scenario came on Thursday, when new data on inflation for producers rose far more than expected, raising the prospect that businesses will pass on price increases to consumers.\nFed Actions Only Have Indirect Impact\nFed cuts would immediately make borrowing cheaper on credit cards and auto loans, since those products are based on the short-term interest rates the central bank heavily influences. Mortgages are a different story, however.\nRates on a 30-year mortgage are based heavily on investors' expectations of the economy and inflation over the next decade, not on the Fed’s near-term actions.\nWhile mortgage rates include other costs to process each loan, they rely heavily on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield—the interest rate that the U.S. government pays to issue debt over 10 years. A complex mix of factors helps determine 10-year yields, including economic growth forecasts, inflation, demographics, and U.S. fiscal deficits.", "content_hash": "10118aa5b4f48928e221b030ff777e2b", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

More recently, shares of Amazon (AMZN) have shown substantial life.\nThey finished Thursday up nearly 3%, extending Wednesday gains and leaving them just over 5% for the year—fifth-best among the group of seven tech giants year-to-date. Behind the latest bump: enthusiasm for yesterday's announcement that it would extend a move into fast delivery of fresh groceries, seen as a shot across the bows of other retailers and delivery companies. (Think Walmart (WMT), Instacart (CART) and Kroger (KR), for example.)\nSeveral Wall Street analysts applauded the move, which followed a second-quarter earnings announcement that disappointed some investors. \"Fresh grocery has been a significant missing piece in Amazon's offering [versus] competitors,\" Bank of America wrote, naming Walmart and Target (TGT). \"With better grocery capabilities, Amazon should see important customer frequency benefits and potential lock-in.\"\nIs There a 'New Narrative' for Amazon?\nMorgan Stanley estimates that offline grocery spending is worth about $1.5 trillion in the U.S., or nearly half of all offline consumer spending. Fresh and perishable goods, they write, are about 45% of that total; Amazon, they said, was at risk of losing grocery market share before its latest move.\nBetter grocery service could also boost the value of Prime membership, according to JP Morgan analysts, who think the company could raise membership prices next year without significantly causing churn or eating into customer acquisition.\nAmazon is widely liked by Street analysts, who according to Visible Alpha are unanimously bullish. The current consensus price target, near $262, suggests a roughly 13% premium to Thursday's close.

(AP) — Berkshire Hathaway revealed four new investments Thursday in steelmaker Nucor, insurer UnitedHealth and two of the nation's biggest homebuilders — Lennar and DR Horton — but it's not clear if the investments are big enough to ensure that legendary investor Warren Buffett handled them.\nBuffett, who plans to retire as CEO at the end of the year after six decades of building Berkshire, handles all of the conglomerate's biggest investments worth $1 billion or more. Three of the new investments disclosed Thursday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission are worth less than that, so they could be the ideas of one of Berkshire's two other investment managers.\nBut Berkshire’s new UnitedHealth stake that was also revealed Thursday was worth $1.57 billion, so that one could be big enough to be Buffett’s handiwork. Berkshire got permission from the SEC to keep the other three investments confidential earlier this year while it built those stakes, but it apparently bought nearly 5 million UnitedHealth shares just in the second quarter. That stock jumped nearly 8% in aftermarket trading.\nBerkshire's filings simply offer a snapshot of its $258 billion portfolio at the end of the second quarters. Many investors comb through Berkshire's filings every quarter because they like to follow Buffett's moves. His record of trouncing the S&P 500 for decades has inspired legions of followers.\nThe filing doesn't make clear who at Berkshire handled each investment. Besides Buffett, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs also pick stocks, but they generally handle smaller portfolios and Combs also serves as Geico's CEO. But Buffett has had a hard time finding stocks or any other investments in recent years that he wants to invest much of Berkshire's $344 billion cash in.\nBerkshire's Nucor stake of 6.6 million shares was the biggest new investment worth roughly $857 million at the end of the quarter. Shares of that company rose more than 6% in extended after-hours trading.\nThe Lennar investment was worth nearly $800 million. While the DR Horton stake was much smaller worth $191.5 million. Those companies' stocks also saw gains in late trading\nBuffett already knows quite a lot about the home building business because Berkshire owns the nation's largest manufactured homebuilder, Clayton Homes.\nBesides stocks, Berkshire owns dozens of companies in a variety of industries including Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an assortment of manufacturing and retail companies.

It was the biggest monthly increase since 2022, and well above the projected growth of 0.3 percent.\nJuly’s increase pushed annual index growth to 3.3 percent, the most significant 12-month bump since the 3.4 percent announced in February.\nWhat does it all mean? Well, compared to Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released Wednesday, the price index for the American manufacturing sector is up—way up. CPI data showed that inflation accelerated for shoppers from June to July at a rate of 0.2 percent, and an annualized rate of 2.7 percent. While consumers have indeed clocked higher prices at retail, inflation was cooler than analysts and economists expected.\nThe divergence between the CPI and the PPI suggests that until very recently, companies were largely eating the cost of President Donald Trump’s tariffs rather than passing them along to their clients. That may not be true for much longer.\n“Tariff-exposed goods are rising at a rapid clip, indicating that the willingness and ability of businesses to absorb tariff costs may be waning,” Oxford Economics analysts wrote in a research note on Thursday, referencing the PPI. “We anticipate broader signs of tariff-driven inflation in the data over time as inventories roll over and firms adjust pricing under margin pressure.”\nWith the president’s “reciprocal” tariffs kicking in last week and producers feeling squeezed by higher import costs, American consumers may be in for much steeper prices in the months to come.\n“As of now, we have absorbed the costs of the increased tariffs. We know this is not sustainable. We will be having a price increase soon to offset increase costs for trimmings, cloth, tariffs and labor,” Alexa Roberti, director of sales for Rochester, N.Y. custom suiting and apparel company Adrian Jules, told Sourcing Journal.\nAdrian Jules brings in much of its fabrics and inputs from countries throughout Europe and Asia—now, all subject to double-digit duty increases. But there aren’t many onshore options to turn to.\n“In the ‘70s much of the U.S.A. textile industry was offshored to keep labor costs down,” Roberti said. “Consequentially, the internal trimmings and exterior cloth was also made outside the U.S.A.,” and importing that arsenal of inputs is essential to business continuity.\nAdding insult the injury of added tariff costs, some of Adrian Jules’ overseas suppliers began notifying the company this spring that the duties would make doing business cost-prohibitive—even suggesting that the factory source from other countries and producers with a lower tariff burden.\n“They were looking out for our best interests, but where are we to go?” Roberti said. “Tariffs have been increased to most of our trading partners; changing suppliers would just mean we would pay tariffs to a different country.”\nThe firm, which sells private-label goods to New York City brick-and-mortars and runs its own custom suiting shops, is clinging to the upsides of the turmoil of the past eight months.\n“There is a positive to this. We are seeing an increase in the demand for Made in U.S.A. garments. We just completed a strong Q2, and we are bullish on Q3,” Roberti said. “I am hopeful that once all the dust has settled, American manufacturing has a resurgence, and the U.S.A. is in a stronger, more prosperous position for citizens and businesses.”\nNewark, N.J. manufacturer Unionwear, which crafts hats, bags, promotional products and military gear, is also contending with higher costs—and working hard not to shift the sting of bloated prices to its customers.\n“We are definitely absorbing tariffs,” owner and president Mitch Cahn said.\nPart of the struggle stems from the changeability of tariff rates, revised or threatened on a near-weekly basis by the White House.\nWithin the company’s business-to-business arm, “We are selling goods before we order them, but the tariffs are changing after we have received an order but before we are shipping,” Cahn said, illuminating the complexity of setting prices. “We are hedging a little bit and making sure we have alternative sources, but there really is no other way to do this.”\nAccording to Cahn, the firm buys some of its fabric from India, which is slated to be hit with another round of 25 percent tariffs later this month, bringing the total reciprocal duty rate to a staggering 50 percent. “We are planning to absorb the cost increases if necessary, but most likely we will shift purchasing to Pakistan,” he said.\nDown the road elsewhere in Newark, Mitch Gambert, CEO and owner of Gambert Shirtmakers, is fretting over the future of his business due to the upheaval caused by the administration’s ever-evolving trade policy.\n“It’s become borderline unmanageable,” he said. “It’s been literally eight months of utter confusion.”\nThe custom and wholesale shirting supplier hasn’t been able to raise prices despite crippling increases to overhead costs (due predominantly to tariffs), along with compounding logistical challenges.\n“The way that we work with our retail partners is that they set their [prices] for the season at the beginning of every season. So to go in and change pricing on them…it’s a real disruption to the flow of business,” he said.\nGambert is also ambivalent about raising prices when consumer confidence is in the doldrums. “I’m afraid that when the prices do go up, that people are going to be so sticker shocked that it’s just going to have an even deeper impact on sales,” he said, noting that Gambert Shirtmakers’ sales ledger is “hovering at 30 percent less than where we should be” at this time of year. That doesn’t bode well for fall or holiday, traditionally the manufacturer’s boom time.\nGambert has even had to reduce working hours due to the slowdown—a concession he’s making in order to avoid layoffs within his 90-worker facility.\n“I have not had any surging American production because of tariffs, none whatsoever,” he said. That’s because of a simple truth that thus far, the administration has neglected to acknowledge.\n“It would be different if raw material prices weren’t going up—then I could be more competitive with Asia,” he said. “But with raw material prices going up, my prices are just going up in perfect sequence with the Asian prices. There’s no competitive advantage for me.”\nWith steep new tariffs on trade partners across the globe compounding existing duties, something’s got to give, he said. Even countries subject to the 10 percent universal baseline tariff could still see prohibitively high rates on certain types of products.\nGambert Shirtmakers imports much of its woven cotton for shirting from Europe, and the company pays a variegated rate between 18 percent and 19 percent depending on the characteristics of the fabric. Those same products will see added duties of 15 percent under the new tariff regime.\n“We’re also getting hit with the increases on our button supply,” which comes from China, he said. The manufacturer brought in a “huge shipment” of product before the tariffs took effect, but charged its customers, like Gambert Shirtmakers, for the added cost of transportation and warehousing in the U.S. “It forced me to put out a lot of cash up front to beat these tariffs before they hit, which absolutely kills cash flow. I mean, it’s like a death kiss,” he added.\nIt’s not just new costs that have thrown a wrench into the company’s value chain. Longtime mill partners in Europe that once offered low MOQs and flexible terms are seeking out safer bets, opting for bigger sales to prominent players with more robust cash flow. “I might do, let’s say, $400,000 of business with one mill in the course of a year. But now you have the big brands who are doing $2.5 million of business with the same mill. Who’s going to take priority?” he said.\nGambert is also facing a complex problem that many U.S. makers are contending with: their place in the market. At $280 or $350 a pop, the firm’s custom shirts are a carefully considered purchase, not an impulse buy. “For a lot of people who purchase my products, when they look at a gallon of milk at $11 and a full tank of gas at $90, those things are going to take precedence in their life,” he said.\nFor that reason, raising prices—however necessary—is a highly unpalatable prospect.\nIt’s not just East Coast manufacturers feeling the burn. Across the country in Los Angeles, Lalaland owner Alex Zar is taking creative license to his business model in a bid to mitigate costs.\nThe founder of L.A.’s largest leather goods factory said he’s seen increased demand for local production in recent months as the Trump trade agenda has taken hold. “However, it’s a double-edged sword—tariffs are impacting all our material imports, which in turn is driving up the cost of finished products,” he said.\nThe full-service manufacturer is pulling all the levers to make up for cost increases. “We are working closely with our clients to design products so that materials make up the largest portion of the finished product cost, while labor is minimized,” he said. “This helps absorb some of the increased costs from imported materials by reducing the labor share.”\nIn L.A., minimum wage is $17.87—far higher than most of country. Zar is uniquely positioned, having invested heavily in cutting-edge production technology and dabbling in automated processes that reduce the need for a high factory headcount.\nThe aim is to ensure that final product costs are aligned with overseas production—an objective the designer, merchandiser and factory collaborate to achieve during product development, he said. But it’s not easy, especially when domestic capacity for manufacturing of footwear and handbags is so limited.\n“Many factories have shut down as production shifted overseas, which limits available resources for local manufacturing,” he said—ergo, the need to rely on foreign partners for the parts and pieces that make up his creations.\nAnother L.A. native and owner of Lefty Production Co., Marta Miller, co-signed the observation that raw material costs have risen “across the board” since the onset of the trade wars.\n“Fabrics, trims, and certain imported components are all more expensive now, and machinery pricing is also increasing,” she said, attributing the increases to new duties and other supply chain constraints.\n“China is by far the most impactful when it comes to tariffs,” Miller, who also owns Austin-based manufacturing body Stitch Texas, said. “Many of the fabrics, trims, and certain categories of apparel we source have traditionally come from China, and the duties there have had a significant impact on landed costs,” she added, noting that sourcing from Vietnam and India has also been challenging.\n“I have tried to avoid raising prices dramatically for my clients,” the factory owner said. “My goal is to manage these cost increases in a way that softens the impact on their businesses, so they can continue to grow. That said, modest adjustments have been necessary in some cases, and I would expect to see some additional increases if tariffs and input costs remain high.”\nDespite the intricacies of maintaining a balance sheet with ever-shifting line items, Miller maintains that tariffs have, on the whole, given her a leg up.\n“Clients who previously defaulted to overseas production are now giving serious consideration to producing here at home, and I am leaning into that opportunity,” she said. Emphasizing speed-to-market, lower shipping costs and better quality control has indeed driven new business to California and Texas over the past eight months, Miller added.\n“The increased cost of overseas production for certain categories has encouraged some brands to explore domestic manufacturing for the first time. We’ve seen new clients coming to Lefty Production Co. and Stitch Texas specifically because the tariff environment has tipped the scale toward U.S. production,” she explained. “It’s an unexpected win that’s helping offset some of the challenges.”", "content_hash": "b725ac3bdf9ec91127f2d1520710d034", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Despite delivering a second quarter that (slightly) beat analyst estimates, factors such as growth deceleration in a key business segment raised some concern.\nWith that, more than a few market players assertively sold out of the stock to leave it with a loss of almost 20% on the day. That compared quite unfavorably to the more or less flat trajectory of the S&P 500 index.\nA double beat wasn't good enough\nFor its fiscal Q4 of 2025, Coherent's revenue was $1.53 billion, notching a new record for the company.

The company's non-GAAP (adjusted) net income grew more modestly, advancing by nearly 9% to $192 million or an even $1.00 per share.\nBoth headline figures came in slightly higher than the consensus analyst estimates of $1.51 billion for revenue and $0.92 for adjusted earnings per share (EPS).\nCoherent attributed the improvements to the liveliness of certain revenue drivers, such as artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\nHowever, in a new research note on the company, analyst Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities pointed out that the company's revenue growth in the data center space was slowing. According to reports he wrote, this was 24% in Q4, but 39%, 46%, and 58% in the three preceding frames.\nThis was one of the factors that inspired Arya to downgrade his recommendation on the stock to neutral from his previous buy.\nModeling a better first quarter\nCoherent management proffered guidance for its current (first) quarter. It believes revenue will fall between $1.46 billion and $1.6 billion, and adjusted EPS will come in at $0.93 to $1.13.

And those during those times they tend to step off of the gas.\"\nIt seems that the fog is getting pretty thick out there, and many consumers have been hitting the brakes when it comes to dining out.\nIn the first half of 2025, US restaurants and bars saw one of the weakest six-month periods of sales growth in the past decade, according to a CNN analysis of U.S. Commerce Department data.\nVeteran trader: Cava balance sheet a work of art\nThis year has shown weaker growth than even during the Covid-19 pandemic, when restaurants and bars closed due to lockdown orders, CNN reported,\nAnd in June Campbell’s Co. (CPB) said it saw stronger quarterly sales of broth and condensed soup as more Americans cooked their meals at home.\n\"The team’s done an outstanding job navigating tariffs both on the supply chain construction side so that we’re not anticipating material changes at all in our ability to grow and continue to leverage those robust new restaurant openings that we’ve been experiencing,\" Toliver said.\nTheStreet Pro's Stephen Guilfoyle pulled up a chair at Cava Group's table and reviewed the company's financials.\nThe firm has hit a bump, the veteran trader said. \"Still, cash flows are positive, margins are holding up. Same-store sales are pressured. That said, the balance sheet is a work of art. In theory, I find this company investable as long as a decent entry point can be found.\"\nGuilfoyle, whose career dates back to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in the 1980s, pointed to the stock's simple moving average, which is used to calculate the average price of a stock over a specific period, and exponential moving average, which unlike the SMA places more emphasis on recent price data.\n\"The stock has now lost its 50-day SMA after losing its 21-day EMA,\" he said. \"This will force portfolio managers to either exit the stock or reduce exposure as the 200-day SMA is nothing but a distant memory.\"\nCava Group's stock is down 40% in 2025 and has tumbled 29% from a year ago.\nAnalyst sees buying opportunity\nInvestment firms issued research reports following Cava Group's earnings report.\nWhile \"disappointed\" by Cava's Q2 same-restaurant sales growth of 2.1%, Stifel analyst Chris O'Cull said that doesn't justify a $2 billion hit to its market value. He sees the sharp pullback in shares as a buying opportunity, according to The Fly.\nDespite the comparables miss, Cava beat Ebitda estimates and new stores are ramping quickly, said O'Cull, who views the recent weakness as \"a temporary setback, not a change in the fundamental outlook.\"\nStifel affirmed a buy rating and $125 price target on Cava shares.\nKeyBanc analyst Christopher Carril lowered the firm's price target on Cava Group to $85 from $100 and maintained an overweight rating on the shares.\nThe investment firm noted that Q2 same-store-sales trends missed consensus and likely fell short of buy-side expectations.\nThat said, earnings per share and Ebitda exceeded Wall Street's estimates as store-level margins fell in line with the analyst consensus, and general and administrative expense largely offset most of the revenue shortfall. G&A expense in the current quarter was 11.4% of revenue compared with 12.1% a year earlier.\nSame-store-sales growth improved in July and in the quarter-to-date, but trends likely remain short of the mid-single-digit-percent range Wall Street expected in the second half, the analyst said.\nBank of America Securities lowered its price target on Cava Group to $100 from $121 and reiterated a buy rating on the shares.\nA \"modest\" revenue miss, despite a \"more meaningful\" miss on same-store-sales growth, is a function of an evolving restaurant maturity curve, the firm said.\nWhile the tailwind to comparisons from maturing stores has moderated, the investment firm said it was encouraged by new unit-volume strength across markets of widely disparate sizes.", "content_hash": "6d3e3d67395b88b690e778396bf9d3c6", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Financial expert Suze Orman recently detailed some of its key benefits on her \"Women & Money\" podcast.\nWhile she acknowledges there are many parts of the bill she hates, she encourages her listeners to focus on the practical perks that can help you keep more of your money or save on taxes.\nHere's a breakdown of some important highlights.\nDon't Miss:\n-\nWould You Have Invested in eBay or Uber Early? The Same Backers Are Betting on This Vacation Home Platform\n-\n‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share.\nExpanded Child Tax Credit\nOne of the standout features of the bill is the expanded child tax credit, which Orman highlights as a vital lifeline for parents raising children under 17.\n\"Right now, the child tax credit gives you up to $2,200 per child,\" she explains.

See our Advertiser Disclosure.\nBuying a car is a rite of passage, and owning a car is a necessity in many places. But it's not always the most straightforward process. From researching different cars and taking test drives to comparing loan interest rates, it's even more complicated if you’re going into the car-buying process independently.\nHaving bought my first car in July, the process was nerve-racking, especially as a fresh college graduate with minimal credit history and new employment. Ultimately, though, I found success with a local dealership that offered lower interest rates to recent college grads (a program that many dealerships have an equivalent of).\nEven if you can’t find a dealership with a similar program, there are plenty of other ways to buy a car without a co-signer. As long as you meet a few qualifying criteria, it’s possible to get a reasonable deal on a vehicle.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nWhat is a co-signer?\nIf you have a family member or close friend with good income and credit, they may qualify to serve as a co-signer for your car purchase. When someone co-signs your auto loan, they provide the dealership with their financial information and pledge to take responsibility if you fail to make a monthly payment.\nHaving a co-signer can be a simple way to qualify for a good car deal, especially if your co-signer has an excellent credit history, but it doesn’t mean it's the only way. If you don’t have anyone willing to co-sign your loan, you may still qualify for a car loan if you explore multiple lenders, make sure your credit and income are in good standing, and are open-minded about the type of car you purchase.\nWhy do I need a co-signer?\nYou don’t technically need a co-signer to buy a car. However, it can make you a more attractive buyer in the eyes of a lender, especially if you are a first-time buyer. If you have a limited or unfavorable employment or credit history, you’ll likely be deemed a risky buyer. Having a well-qualified co-signer reassures the lender that payments will continue to be made if you fail to do so for whatever reason.\nCar loan options without a co-signer\nWhile having a co-signer can be beneficial when applying for a car loan, it’s a big responsibility for the person co-signing, and sometimes even close family members or friends are unwilling to do it. Here are a few things you can do to improve your odds of successfully qualifying for a loan independently if you don't have strong credit.\n1. Apply through a credit union\nCredit unions can often be a good alternative to financing a car outside of an auto dealership or other lender. Many credit unions are known to have lower interest rates on loans and put a higher priority on flexibility and personal connection with their members compared to auto dealerships or other types of banks. However, be aware that some credit unions may still deny you if you have a limited credit history.\nEven if you don't secure a loan through your credit union, you can still get loan preapproval through your credit union. If you are preapproved with a low interest rate, you can use said rate as leverage with dealerships or other lenders as you shop around for a vehicle.\nRead more: See our picks for the best credit unions of the year\n2. Investigate no-credit options\nIf you have a limited or unfavorable credit history, there are a few options outside of a traditional auto loan through a dealership or bank. Several online and in-person financing options market themselves with having high approval rates, no credit requirements, lower down payments, or longer payment terms, which in turn makes monthly payments lower.\nFor example, online lender Carvana offers financing to any prospective buyer over 18 without bankruptcies and a minimum annual income of $5,100, so long as you haven’t defaulted on a Carvana loan in the previous two years. For those who want a more traditional dealership experience, CarMax Auto Finance accommodates most credit profiles and offers prequalification online.\nBe aware that while you may get approved with no credit or poor credit, the terms will likely be less favorable compared to other options.\n3. Consider a personal loan\nAnother alternative to traditional financing from an auto dealership, bank, or credit union is taking out a personal loan. Personal loans can be used for almost any purpose and are given in a lump sum, which you then pay off in fixed monthly increments. Personal loans also give you the freedom to shop around from a variety of different lenders.\nShould I pay for my car using a personal loan?\nWhile taking out a personal loan to finance your car can be beneficial to some, it’s generally not the best option for an auto loan. Because personal loans are unsecured, meaning there is no collateral on the loan, they typically have a higher interest rate than traditional auto loan options.\nFurthermore, personal loans are typically unsecured; that means they're often harder to get approved for, requiring a high credit score and good credit history. So if you are already struggling to get approved for a car loan via more traditional methods, you might also find it tough to qualify for a personal loan. There are personal loans specifically for people with bad or no credit history, but those loan terms are usually much less favorable.\nStill, personal loans can be a good option for some first-time car buyers. For instance, if you're purchasing an older car or a used vehicle with high mileage, you may have trouble getting a traditional auto loan. A personal loan could be a good option to pursue if you don’t have enough cash to secure the vehicle.\nHow to buy a car without a co-signer\nOnce you have secured your financing or loan preapproval for your vehicle, it’s time to start shopping. After doing your research on what type of vehicle you are interested in and what features you are looking for, here are a few other things to consider when thinking about what cars you’ll best qualify for as an independent buyer:\n1. Check out first-time buyer programs\nMany dealerships, as well as banks and credit unions, offer first-time car-buyer programs. While most of these programs don’t expect you to have a co-signer or an extensive credit history, many will still require you to have a good credit score, a good existing credit history, and proof of income. Shop around with multiple lenders to see which first-time buyer programs in your area offer the best interest rate and lowest down payment for the vehicle you want.\n2. Invest in a used car\nA three-year-old vehicle is, on average, around $13,435 cheaper than a brand new car, according to Edmunds — and is often easier to qualify for compared to a new car. By shopping for low-mileage used cars, you could find a vehicle in good condition that is both less expensive and slower to depreciate compared to newer models.\nJust make sure you run an inspection before committing to a car to learn about any previous issues or accidents the vehicle has experienced, as well as any previous maintenance issues the owner had before you.\n3. Trade in an older vehicle\nIf you were previously a car owner or were gifted a car, you can trade in your older vehicle and put that cash back into your new vehicle. This can help you by allowing you to put down a larger down payment or lowering your monthly payments.\nAccording to JD Power, someone buying a car can save $834 on a new car worth $42,000 by trading in their previous vehicle. The exact value you can expect on your vehicle depends on various factors, including the car’s condition, history, and depreciation rates.\n4. Put down a larger down payment or accept a higher monthly payment\nIf you don’t have a vehicle to trade in, you may have to put more money into your vehicle than you initially planned, either as a larger down payment to secure your car or by paying more into your car monthly. While experts recommend a down payment of 10% on a used car and 20% down on a new car, putting down a larger down payment can help you more easily secure the car you want.\nAs far as average monthly car payments, Experian's 2025 State of the Automotive Finance Market report says auto loan payments averaged $745 per month for new cars and $521 per month for used cars. So expect to pay similar, or possibly even more, when buying your car without a co-signer.\nRead more: How much you should save before you buy a car?\nI did the above, and I still can’t afford the car I want. Now what?\nIf, after approaching multiple lenders and looking at more affordable car options, you still aren’t able to secure a car with a price tag you can stomach, here are some long-term solutions you can pursue to qualify for the car that fits your needs:\n1. Build your credit profile\nMost car lenders want applicants with a credit score of at least 661 and a lengthy credit history, which showcases responsible credit usage and financial management skills. If you don’t urgently need new transportation, spending a few more months or even one or two years improving your credit score can greatly help you qualify for the car you want.\n2. Increase your income\nShowing proof of stable income and references to your current place of employment is also a big part of qualifying for the car you want. Most auto sellers want independent buyers to have a full-time income (or at least part-time streams that equate to full-time income) to make sure they will be able to afford the car’s monthly payments.\nRead more: 7 ways to improve your personal cash flow\n3. Look into alternative avenues\nIf you are unable to secure a car through a traditional dealer, consider buying a car through private sellers such as local used car sales, auctions, or online listings. If you secure a car through a private seller, make sure to do your research on the vehicle’s history and previous ownership.\nFAQs\nWhat is an auto loan?\nAn auto loan is a type of secured loan used to finance your vehicle. When you buy a car with an auto loan, the lender pays the seller the full amount once the loan is issued. Then, you make monthly payments to the lender over a several-month term (usually somewhere between 36 to 96 months), paying off the original amount plus interest. If you miss multiple monthly payments or are otherwise unable to repay your loan, your lender can repossess your vehicle.\nWhat are the risks of buying a car without a co-signer?\nWhile it's definitely possible to buy a car independently and even qualify for a good deal, there are a few things you might have to accept:\n-\nUsed car: Unless you have the money for a large down payment and high monthly payment, it might be most logical for you to invest in a more affordable used car.\n-\nHigher monthly payment or down payment: Many dealerships view first-time buyers as risky, so you may have to accept putting more money into your car, either initially or through your monthly payment.\n-\nHigher interest rate: If you don’t get bogged down with higher payments up-front, your lender could offer you a deal with higher interest rates. On the other hand, many first-time buyer programs actually offer lower interest rates to certain favorable buyers, such as recent graduates or those with full-time work.\nThis article was edited by Alicia Hahn.", "content_hash": "f345033c3981553d54dbbf51a3852952", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Only one-quarter of consumers say they like or love AI in customer service, according to a HubSpot and SurveyMonkey survey of 1,800 business leaders and 15,000 consumers across seven global markets, released Monday.\n-\nJust over half of consumers — 53% — actively dislike or hate AI's use in service interactions. Four in five say they’d prefer human support even if the outcome and wait time are the same.\n-\n“This widespread aversion suggests that current AI applications often fail to meet customer expectations for empathy, nuance and genuine connection,” Zoe Padgett, senior research scientist at SurveyMonkey, said via email. “Rather than seeing AI as a helpful tool, many customers perceive it as a barrier, leading to frustration and a feeling that their unique concerns aren't truly understood.”\nDive Insight:\nDespite the growing prevalence of AI in customer service, customers still want to be able to talk to a human.\n“While younger consumers are slightly more open to the technology, the preference for human interaction and support remains steadfast,” Padgett said. “This tells us that a one-size-fits-all AI strategy will likely fall short.”\nKlarna’s customer strategy is a case in point. After going all in on an AI chatbot and reducing its workforce, the buy now, pay later firm began hiring customer service employees again this May. A spokesperson for the company told CX Dive that they want customers to always have the option to speak to a human.\n“AI gives us speed. Talent gives us empathy,” a spokesperson told CX Dive at the time.\nWhile AI can provide fast responses, some customers don’t see speed as paramount when it comes to their interactions with a company. A Five9 survey from March found that the vast majority of customers — 86% — say empathy and human connection are more important than a quick response in providing excellent customer experience.\nThat’s especially the case with complex or sensitive issues for which customers appreciate the reassurance offered by speaking to another human, experts told CX Dive. Even just knowing a human representative is available can reduce anxiety in customers stressed by self-service encounters, a recent study found.", "content_hash": "77081b3350a76e5df72e35a984aded1e", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Duong frames this as a cyclical transition, with capital moving down the risk curve as market confidence builds.\nBitcoin dominance — its share of total crypto market value — has shown signs of softening after peaking earlier this year. Coinbase argues that as this measure declines, capital historically flows into large-cap altcoins, and then into mid- and small-cap names. This rotation effect, they suggest, will become more pronounced in September.\nLiquidity trends are also turning more favorable for altcoins. Coinbase notes tighter bid-ask spreads and deeper order books across major exchanges, making it easier for traders to enter and exit altcoin positions without incurring heavy slippage. Improved liquidity often encourages participation from larger players who might otherwise avoid less-traded tokens.\nThe third factor is sentiment. Duong writes that as macro conditions stabilize and volatility remains contained, investors are more likely to seek higher returns in riskier crypto assets. This environment could foster sustained inflows into the altcoin market, particularly if bitcoin’s price consolidates rather than surges to new highs.\nCoinbase stops short of predicting which tokens will lead the charge but highlights the pattern from previous market cycles, where blue-chip altcoins outperformed first, followed by smaller-cap assets. The report cautions that while September may mark the start, the duration and magnitude of the move will depend on both market and macroeconomic conditions.\nBTC is up 27.2% year-to-date but has trailed some major altcoins such as ETH (+37.9%) and XRP (+49%), while others like SOL (+1.67%), ADA (+8.96%) and DOGE (-27.5%) have lagged. Coinbase maintains that market conditions overall could favor a broader rotation into altcoins in the coming months.", "content_hash": "bf24c0988c8168e5bd408bd8fce8f556", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Only one-quarter of consumers say they like or love AI in customer service, according to a HubSpot and SurveyMonkey survey of 1,800 business leaders and 15,000 consumers across seven global markets, released Monday.\n-\nJust over half of consumers — 53% — actively dislike or hate AI's use in service interactions. Four in five say they’d prefer human support even if the outcome and wait time are the same.\n-\n“This widespread aversion suggests that current AI applications often fail to meet customer expectations for empathy, nuance and genuine connection,” Zoe Padgett, senior research scientist at SurveyMonkey, said via email. “Rather than seeing AI as a helpful tool, many customers perceive it as a barrier, leading to frustration and a feeling that their unique concerns aren't truly understood.”\nDive Insight:\nDespite the growing prevalence of AI in customer service, customers still want to be able to talk to a human.\n“While younger consumers are slightly more open to the technology, the preference for human interaction and support remains steadfast,” Padgett said. “This tells us that a one-size-fits-all AI strategy will likely fall short.”\nKlarna’s customer strategy is a case in point. After going all in on an AI chatbot and reducing its workforce, the buy now, pay later firm began hiring customer service employees again this May. A spokesperson for the company told CX Dive that they want customers to always have the option to speak to a human.\n“AI gives us speed. Talent gives us empathy,” a spokesperson told CX Dive at the time.\nWhile AI can provide fast responses, some customers don’t see speed as paramount when it comes to their interactions with a company. A Five9 survey from March found that the vast majority of customers — 86% — say empathy and human connection are more important than a quick response in providing excellent customer experience.\nThat’s especially the case with complex or sensitive issues for which customers appreciate the reassurance offered by speaking to another human, experts told CX Dive. Even just knowing a human representative is available can reduce anxiety in customers stressed by self-service encounters, a recent study found.", "content_hash": "77081b3350a76e5df72e35a984aded1e", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Duong frames this as a cyclical transition, with capital moving down the risk curve as market confidence builds.\nBitcoin dominance — its share of total crypto market value — has shown signs of softening after peaking earlier this year. Coinbase argues that as this measure declines, capital historically flows into large-cap altcoins, and then into mid- and small-cap names. This rotation effect, they suggest, will become more pronounced in September.\nLiquidity trends are also turning more favorable for altcoins. Coinbase notes tighter bid-ask spreads and deeper order books across major exchanges, making it easier for traders to enter and exit altcoin positions without incurring heavy slippage. Improved liquidity often encourages participation from larger players who might otherwise avoid less-traded tokens.\nThe third factor is sentiment. Duong writes that as macro conditions stabilize and volatility remains contained, investors are more likely to seek higher returns in riskier crypto assets. This environment could foster sustained inflows into the altcoin market, particularly if bitcoin’s price consolidates rather than surges to new highs.\nCoinbase stops short of predicting which tokens will lead the charge but highlights the pattern from previous market cycles, where blue-chip altcoins outperformed first, followed by smaller-cap assets. The report cautions that while September may mark the start, the duration and magnitude of the move will depend on both market and macroeconomic conditions.\nBTC is up 27.2% year-to-date but has trailed some major altcoins such as ETH (+37.9%) and XRP (+49%), while others like SOL (+1.67%), ADA (+8.96%) and DOGE (-27.5%) have lagged. Coinbase maintains that market conditions overall could favor a broader rotation into altcoins in the coming months.", "content_hash": "bf24c0988c8168e5bd408bd8fce8f556", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

From graphics processing unit (GPU) leader Nvidia to hyperscalers like CoreWeave and Nebius, it's unsurprising when investors focused on AI stocks find certain names popping up again and again -- and again.\nBut the lack of popularity with respect to other AI-focused companies doesn't mean that their stocks are any less desirable. In fact, it's possible that those names that are less familiar have the potential to provide market-beating returns.\nLook beyond the hype with these hyperscaler names\nAI investors may not be able to speak to the super-specific, technical aspects of AI technology, but one thing they're likely familiar with is the importance of data centers. Providing the capability for AI computing to occur, data centers -- the sources of massive investments from AI companies -- have emerged as a critical aspect of AI development. Nvidia reported in its first quarter 2026 that data center revenue totaled $39.1 billion, climbing 73% year over year, and it announced it's building factories to produce its AI supercomputers in the U.S. in support of data center development.\nSome data centers, however, are hyperscalers -- specifically designed to support the high computing demands of AI. Recognizing their importance, AI investors have leapt at the opportunity to load up on hyperscaler stocks like CoreWeave and Nebius to broaden their AI exposure.\nSay \"hi\" to this hyperscaler helper\nWhile savvy investors recognize the value of hyperscalers, they may be missing a related opportunity that's less discussed. Brandishing itself as the world's largest IT infrastructure services provider, Kyndryl(NYSE: KD) stands to benefit from the growth of hyperscalers.\nWith respect to its cloud services business, Kyndryl identifies in a recent filing that it helps businesses to improve the effectiveness of their work with hyperscale cloud providers in a \"unified environment by seamlessly integrating services delivered by independent software vendors (ISVs), large public cloud providers, internal platforms, and other technologies.\" In other words, Kyndryl adds value in helping companies to bring everything together, including the smooth combination of services from different software companies, big cloud providers, their own systems, and other technologies.\nAlthough it generates revenue from a variety of sources, hyperscaler-related revenue is providing a major engine of growth for the company. In June 2025, Kyndryl generated $1.4 billion in revenue over the previous 12-month period, a 119% increase over the 12-month period that preceded June 2024.\nAt the same time its hyperscaler-related revenue is soaring, Kyndryl's total revenue has been on the decline, sliding to $15.1 billion in 2025 from $16.1 billion in 2024 and $15 billion in 2023. While this may be disconcerting, it illustrates how the company is pivoting to seize the growing opportunity that its hyperscaler business presents.\nKyndryl's AI expertise extends beyond hyperscalers\nThose speculating that Kyndryl is a Silicon Valley start-up with little experience may be surprised to find that the company has a much richer legacy. Operating as an independent company for nearly four years, Kyndryl is the result of a spinoff from its former parent company, International Business Machines.\nOver the past few years, Kyndryl has succeeded in forging partnerships with leading AI companies. In May 2024, for example, Kyndryl announced a partnership with Nvidia wherein the two companies will collaborate to provide \"customers looking to rapidly scale generative AI solutions to remain competitive in their respective industries.\" For example, with Nvidia's help, Kyndryl will add generative AI capabilities to its Kyndryl Bridge platform, which helps customers integrate data across their enterprise.\nDemonstrating how its cloud prowess transcends hyperscalers, Kyndryl is working with Amazon to expedite the modernization of mainframe applications and data for Amazon Web Services (AWS). Plus, it partners with leading cybersecurity companies like Rubrik to help protect customers from cyberattacks in several ways, such as reducing the amount of downtime that customers suffer from a cyber incident.\nIs now a good time to pick up Kyndryl stock?\nWhether Kyndryl has the ability to reproduce the incredible performances of leading AI stocks like Nvidia is questionable. However, there's certainly a conceivable path forward for Kyndryl stock to provide a market-beating performance as the AI industry develops thanks to its ample hyperscaler exposure and other AI-related businesses.\nWith shares of Kyndryl currently trading at only 13.7 times forward earnings, today certainly seems like a good time for patient investors to click the buy button on Kyndryl stock.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CFO.com newsletter.\nBuckled in? 2025 has, by many accounts, been a wild, unpredictable ride for those working in corporate finance. Amid ongoing geopolitical conflicts and a U.S. president intent on reshaping global trade, CFOs have had much to grapple with over the last few months.\nAs we move past the halfway point, finance chiefs are being tapped, as always, to provide a sense of stability. But they’re also increasingly being asked to offer a forward-looking, strategic lens for their organizations.\nHere are five ongoing trends that are likely to dominate boardroom conversations over the remainder of 2025.\nThe domain of the CFO is widening. Most in the profession agree that the days of simply reporting financial results after the fact are largely over; now, finance chiefs are being asked more and more to peer into the future and step into strategic roles.\n“We’re definitely starting to leave behind traditional Excel sheets,” said Amy Dickerson, EVP, CFO and CHRO with environmental remediation firm Regenesis. “I don’t dabble in Excel every day anymore. I’m dealing with higher-level initiatives and strategies.”\nThat also means that CFOs are working more closely with other C-Suite peers. In some cases, like Dickerson’s, they’re filling multiple C-Suite roles themselves. CFO and COO hybrids, for example, are not uncommon. As one finance chief put it, it’s a trend that is likely to continue “on steroids” in the years ahead.\n“A CFO is trained in regulation and financial metrics originally, but you have a lot of exposure across an organization,” added Dickerson, who also sits on the CFO Alliance’s global advisory board. “You’re probably sitting in the one seat where you have the most exposure to crossover.”\nKadidia Cooper, chief financial and operating officer at nonprofit scholarship provider 10,000 Degrees, noted CFOs are also “often the first ones who see certain trends happening because we have all the data in one place.”\n“Forecasting has become much more important for businesses to remain competitive,” she added.\nAs President Donald Trump continues on-again, off-again levies on foreign-made goods, finance chiefs are doing what they can to respond. But their responses, of course, are hardly uniform.\n“The size of the company, in some ways, dictates the response,” said Stephen Philipson, head of wealth, corporate, commercial and institutional banking at U.S. Bank. “A very large corporation has lots of leverage through liquidity. They oftentimes have pretty good room in their margins to absorb short-term tariff increases, and a lot more flexibility in terms of moving around supply chains. Middle-market clients tend to have a little less flexibility.”\nJeff Codd, VP of finance at Connecticut-based electrical supplier U.S. Electrical Services, said his company has, generally speaking, adjusted language in its terms and conditions to provide some protection from any tariff-related impacts. The business put those in place during Trump’s first term in office.\nAt the same time, Codd said he’s also been making quick inventory adjustments to guard against any potential disruptions.\n“We are cautiously evaluating impact across specific categories on the amount of inventory we’re holding, while making sure we have inventory on the shelves for our customers,” Codd said.\nFor some finance chiefs, tariffs have some clear historical parallels.\n“The whole situation with tariffs mimics, to me, what it felt like during COVID,” Dickerson says.\nWith a seemingly business-friendlier administration in the White House, many leaders expected 2025 to be a year of deals. And indeed, some reports have shown that M&A activity has increased marginally over the first half of the year. Codd with U.S. Electrical Services, for instance, noted his firm has completed three acquisitions over the last 12 months.\nBut there have also been some stumbling blocks due, in part, to an aggressive tariff regime that has paralyzed deals for some firms, especially middle-market ones.\nWhere do things go from here? Some observers see reason for M&A optimism over the rest of 2025. “It feels like there is a reemergence” in risk appetite among business leaders, U.S. Bank’s Philipson said.\n“You’ve got a very attractive finance environment. You’ve got spreads at all-time tights. There’s the expectation that the Fed will resume cutting again starting next month, which again creates a positive risk appetite environment.”\nIn some cases, Philipson said, leaders are simply adjusting to a new normal. “Some of the worst-case scenarios have been taken off the table, whether that’s around the tax bill or how meaningful tariffs could be,” he said. “Inflation is still present, but it hasn’t spun out of control at this point.”\nWith the official blessing of AICPA and NASBA last month, the 120-hour CPA pathway may well see adoption by all 50 states. If not this year, it may come soon.\nIn the ninth edition of the Uniform Accountancy Act, the two organizations included a pathway that would require only a bachelor’s degree in accounting — the equivalent of 120 credit hours — as well as two years of experience and passage of the CPA exam. Notably, the traditional 150-hour pathway remains a valid option.\nIn a July interview, Jack Castonguay, associate professor of accounting at Hofstra University, predicted that it’s in every state’s best interest to adopt the change.\n“If they don’t, they’d be putting themselves at a competitive disadvantage,” he said. “I don’t see any reason why all the jurisdictions won’t ultimately adopt this.”\nThat’s not to say that all finance leaders are fully on board with CPA licensure changes.\n“It’s touchy,” said Dickerson. “The talent pipeline is a huge issue, and I know they’re trying to alleviate it” with these changes.\nThat being said, “I worry about lessening too much,” she added. “I know there’s still a lot of discussion” around it.\nEvangelists of generative AI and agentic AI — types of artificial intelligence designed to operate with little or no human oversight — are betting big on more automation in the workforce. Big Tech firms are dumping billions of dollars into the emerging technology.\nFinance leaders see potential, but many are moving forward with caution. Similar to tariff responses, an organization’s size plays a role in how its leaders think about AI. The risks, of course, have not totally gone away, and some large language models’ propensity for “hallucinations” — chatbots’ tendency to occasionally produce misleading or false responses — has given some business leaders pause.\nAs a result, finance leaders are looking for narrow, discrete use cases for the tech, with clear guardrails in place. That might mean a tailor-made large language model using only internal company data instead of dumping proprietary information into, say, ChatGPT.\n“We’ve taken a slower approach to make sure our systems are ready,” Regenesis’ Dickerson said of AI tools.\nFor his part, U.S. Bank’s Philipson maintained AI is likely to drive productivity gains in the months and years ahead. “I think there is very real momentum to it,” he said.", "content_hash": "68fbfd39d97b57f51c46717db9eb7e4e", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

On June 21, XRP was trading for just $2. Just 30 days later, it hit a 52-week high of $3.65. Since then, however, it has pulled back to the $3 level.\nTypically, this would be a buy-the-dip opportunity for XRP investors. But a number of warning signals are now flashing red, and investors are understandably concerned.\nWhat's priced into XRP right now?\nIn many ways, crypto prices are similar to stock prices. They should reflect investor expectations, based on all publicly available data. Right now, it looks like the market has already priced in many of the growth catalysts that were supposed to send XRP higher this year.\nFor example, consider the recent settlement of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) case involving Ripple, the company behind the XRP token. The final settlement of the case took place on Aug. 7. Since then, the price of XRP has slipped. On Aug. 7, the price of XRP was $3.30. Today, it is $3.08 (as of Aug. 14).\nSo it is safe to say that the SEC legal settlement has already been priced in. The market has known about it for a long time -- ever since the U.S. presidential election, in fact. That's because the election of the pro-crypto Trump administration was widely viewed as a clear signal that many of the legal and regulatory issues that dogged the crypto industry (and Ripple specifically) would soon be resolved.\nThe arrival of new XRP spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is also likely priced in. Right now, Bloomberg gives these spot XRP ETFs a 95% chance of approval. Ever since January, there has been constant debate about their potential effect on the price of XRP. So, again, it's safe to say that approval of these ETFs has already been priced in. When they're finally approved, most likely sometime between now and October, don't expect a big bump in XRP's price.\nWhat's not priced into XRP right now?\nThings get interesting when you start to consider what has not been priced into XRP. The market, for example, seems to be finally coming to grips with just how comcentrated ownership of XRP really is. According to some estimates, just 20 XRP blockchain wallets hold 50% of all XRP in circulation.\nThus, when one of these big wallets decides to sell XRP on the market, it can have a very big effect on XRP's price. This is exactly what happened in mid-July, when a top Ripple insider dumped 50 million XRP worth a combined $175 million.

See our Advertiser Disclosure.\nFind out which banks are offering the best MMA rates right now. The Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate three times in 2024 for a total reduction of one percentage point. As a result, deposit interest rates — including money market account rates — have been falling.\nIt’s more important than ever to compare MMA rates and ensure you earn as much as possible on your balance.\nA look at the best money market account rates today\nAlthough money market account rates are elevated by historical standards, the national average rate for MMAs is just 0.62%, according to the FDIC. The good news: Top high-yield money market accounts offer well over 4% APY — more than six times the national average.\nThat’s why it’s important to shop around before opening a money market account. Interest rates vary widely, but there are several banks (in particular, online banks) and credit unions with highly competitive offers.\nHere’s a look at some of the top MMA rates available today:\nSee our picks for the 10 best money market accounts available today>>\nAdditionally, the table below features some of the best savings and money market account rates available today from our verified partners.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nWhy do online banks have the best money market account rates?\nOnline banks operate exclusively via the web. This significantly reduces their overhead costs, so they’re able to pass those savings onto customers in the form of high deposit rates and low fees. If you’re searching for the best money market account rates, online banks are a great place to start.\nThat said, online banks aren’t the only place you can find savings accounts with rates of 4% to 5% APY. Credit unions are not-for-profit financial cooperatives, and are also know for providing competitive rates and fewer fees. Many credit unions have certain requirements that must be met in order to become a member, though there are some that allow just about anyone to join.\nRead more: Are online banks really safe?\nShould you open a money market account?\nMoney market accounts can be a great option for short-term savings goals, like building an emergency fund or setting aside money for an upcoming expense. They generally offer higher interest rates than regular savings accounts, and they provide easier access to your money compared to some other options like certificates of deposit (CDs).\nMoney market accounts are also considered low-risk, and they are FDIC-insured up to the standard $250,000 per depositor, per institution. This makes them safer than money market funds, which can be subject to market risk.\nHowever, keep in mind that many money market accounts require a minimum balance to open the account and earn the highest advertised rate. If you can’t maintain this balance, you might incur fees or miss out on the best rates.\nAnd although you can generally access your funds as needed, MMAs may limit the number of transactions you can make each month. If you need frequent access to your money, this might be a consideration.\nRead more: Is there a penalty for withdrawing from your money market account?\nWhen a money market account makes sense:\n-\nYou want to earn more interest than a regular savings account without locking up your money in a CD.\n-\nYou can maintain the minimum balance to avoid fees.\n-\nYou want to keep funds easily accessible for emergencies or near-term expenses.\nFrequently asked questions — money market rates\nWhat are money market interest rates right now?\nCurrently, the average money market account rate is 0.63%. However, several high-yield accounts pay upwards of 4% or more. If you're considering opening a money market account, be sure to shop around and compare rates.\nWhere can I get 12% interest?\nThere is no one account or investment that guarantees a 12% return. However, if your goal is to earn a strong return on your money and grow your wealth significantly, investing in market securities such as stocks, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds is the best strategy for doing so. The stock market returns about 10% per year, on average.\nIf you aren't sure where to start, it can be helpful to speak with a financial advisor about your financial goals and priorities. Alternatively, you can sign up with a robo-advisor, which is an automated, cost-effective option for managing your portfolio.\nRead more: Robo-advisor: How to start investing right away\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.", "content_hash": "4630083b1c3c9e3620630d2be3af53d7", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Tapestry (TPR) plunged over -15% and was the top percentage loser on the S&P 500 after the fashion-brand company issued below-consensus FY26 EPS guidance. Also, Deere & Company (DE) slumped more than -6% after the agricultural and construction equipment maker cut the upper end of its full-year net income guidance. In addition, Cisco Systems (CSCO) fell over -1% after the computer networking company gave a cautious full-year forecast. On the bullish side, Eli Lilly (LLY) rose over +3% after the drugmaker announced it would raise the list price of its Mounjaro weight-loss treatment in the U.K. by as much as 170%.\nEconomic data released on Thursday showed that the U.S. producer price index for final demand rose +0.9% m/m and +3.3% y/y in July, much stronger than expectations of +0.2% m/m and +2.5% y/y. Also, the core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose +0.9% m/m and +3.7% y/y in July, stronger than expectations of +0.2% m/m and +2.9% y/y. In addition, the number of Americans filing for initial jobless claims in the past week fell by -3K to 224K, compared with the 225K expected.\n“This doesn’t slam the door on a September rate cut, but based on the market’s initial reaction, the opening may be a little smaller than it was a couple of days ago,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley.\nSt. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said on Thursday that it is still too soon for him to determine whether to support an interest rate cut at next month’s meeting. Asked whether a 50 basis point cut could be warranted next month, Musalem said that, in his view, such a move would be “unsupported by the current state of the economy and the outlook for the economy.” Also, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that she is not in favor of a 50 basis point rate cut at the September meeting, saying that “would send off an urgency signal that I don’t feel about the strength of the labor market.”\nU.S. rate futures have priced in a 92.6% probability of a 25 basis point rate cut and a 7.4% chance of no rate change at the next FOMC meeting in September.\nInvestors await a meeting later today in Alaska between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine. Trump cautioned there would be “very harsh consequences” if Putin failed to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine, while suggesting the possibility of a follow-up meeting that could include Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and some European leaders. Meanwhile, Putin looked to strengthen his relationship with Trump ahead of their summit, commending the U.S. leader’s attempts to mediate an end to the war in Ukraine and offering the prospect of economic cooperation along with a new arms control agreement.\nOn the economic data front, all eyes are focused on U.S. Retail Sales data, which is set to be released in a couple of hours. Economists, on average, forecast that Retail Sales will show a +0.6% m/m rise in July, the same as the previous month.\nInvestors will also focus on U.S. Core Retail Sales data, which rose +0.5% m/m in June. Economists expect the July figure to be +0.3% m/m.\nThe University of Michigan’s U.S. Consumer Sentiment Index will be closely monitored today. Economists forecast that the preliminary August figure will stand at 61.9, compared to 61.7 in July.\nU.S. Industrial Production and Manufacturing Production data will be released today. Economists expect Industrial Production to be unchanged m/m and Manufacturing Production to drop -0.1% m/m in July, compared to the June figures of +0.3% m/m and +0.1% m/m, respectively.\nThe Empire State Manufacturing Index will be reported today. Economists foresee the Empire State manufacturing index standing at -1.20 in August, compared to last month’s value of 5.50.\nU.S. Export and Import Price Indexes will be released today as well. Economists anticipate the export price index to rise +0.1% m/m and the import price index to rise +0.1% m/m in July, compared to the previous figures of +0.5% m/m and +0.1% m/m, respectively.\nIn the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.289%, down -0.09%.\nThe Euro Stoxx 50 Index is up +0.61% this morning on optimism that the U.S.-Russia summit could serve as a first step toward brokering a peace deal in Ukraine. Mining and chemical stocks outperformed on Friday. The benchmark index is on track to post its second consecutive weekly gain, supported by a largely upbeat domestic earnings season and expectations for monetary easing in the U.S. U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are set to meet later today in Alaska for their first in-person talks since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Mohit Kumar, chief European strategist at Jefferies International, said, “We do expect some progress in today’s meeting and a path set for further discussions between Russia and the U.S.,” adding that “if we move towards a peace deal, it would be positive for the European markets.” In other news, the EU and U.S. are moving toward finalizing the trade deal that President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed to in July. In corporate news, NKT A/S (NKT.C.DX) climbed over +8% after updating its full-year guidance. At the same time, Pandora A/S (PNDOR.C.DX) tumbled over -12% after the Danish jewellery maker posted weaker-than-expected Q2 organic revenue.\nThe European economic data slate is mainly empty on Friday.\nAsian stock markets today settled in the green. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed up +0.83%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed up +1.71%.\nChina’s Shanghai Composite Index ended higher today as weak economic data from the country bolstered expectations of new stimulus measures from Beijing to support growth. Real estate stocks climbed on Friday after Bloomberg News reported that China is planning to mobilize companies owned by the central government in Beijing to purchase unsold homes from struggling property developers. The benchmark index notched its biggest weekly gain in nine months. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics released on Friday showed that China’s economy weakened across the board in July, with factory activity, investment, and retail sales disappointing, indicating that Beijing’s crackdown on destructive price wars and the spillover effects of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs are weighing on the world’s second-largest economy. Also, the country’s prolonged housing market downturn continued to weigh on growth, with the latest figures showing declining home prices and property investment. In addition, unemployment inched higher in July as millions of new graduates entered a sluggish labor market. China’s top leaders refrained from introducing any major new stimulus measures in July, a cautious approach that economists say will need to be reconsidered to keep this year’s 5% growth target attainable. ING economist Lynn Song said on Friday that “the slump in July’s data was more pronounced than expected,” noting that China needs to roll out additional stimulus measures. In other news, the Financial Times reported on Thursday that China is cautioning Western companies against stockpiling rare earths, warning they could face even greater shortages. In corporate news, JD.com slid over -3% in Hong Kong after the e-commerce operator posted a 51% drop in Q2 net income.\nThe Chinese July Industrial Production rose +5.7% y/y, weaker than expectations of +6.0% y/y.\nThe Chinese July Retail Sales rose +3.7% y/y, weaker than expectations of +4.6% y/y.\nThe Chinese Fixed Asset Investment rose +1.6% y/y in the January-July period, weaker than expectations of +2.7% y/y.\nThe Chinese July Unemployment Rate was 5.2%, weaker than expectations of 5.1%.\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index closed sharply higher today, posting a new record high, after the nation’s economy expanded faster than expected last quarter. Financial stocks led the gains on Friday, supported by expectations that a Bank of Japan rate hike might come sooner rather than later. The benchmark index posted strong gains for the week. Preliminary government data released on Friday showed that Japan’s economy expanded far more than expected in the second quarter, driven by robust domestic demand, strengthening the case for the BOJ to raise its benchmark rate again this year and offering embattled Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba some rare good news. Separately, data showed that Japan’s June industrial production was unexpectedly revised upward. Meanwhile, Benjamin Shatil, an economist at JPMorgan Securities, said, “We continue to think that solid domestic demand data will necessitate a shift in the BOJ’s narrative that tariff-related uncertainty is weighing on activity,” adding that he expects the central bank to raise its policy rate in October. According to the latest Bloomberg survey of economists tracking the BOJ, about 42% of respondents said they anticipate a hike in October, while one-third expect a move in January. Governor Kazuo Ueda said last month that policymakers will continue to raise borrowing costs if they are confident domestic demand will remain stable. In other news, foreign investors bought a net 489.3 billion yen ($3.32 billion) worth of Japanese stocks in the week through August 9th, fueled by a series of strong earnings that propelled domestic equities to new record highs, according to data from Japan’s Ministry of Finance. The Nikkei Volatility Index, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed up +0.20% to 24.61.\nThe Japanese GDP has been reported at +0.3% q/q and +1.0% y/y in the second quarter, stronger than expectations of +0.1% q/q and +0.4% y/y.\nThe Japanese June Industrial Production rose +2.1% m/m, stronger than expectations of +1.7% m/m.\nPre-Market U.S. Stock Movers\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH) surged over +12% in pre-market trading after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed in a regulatory filing that it purchased about 5 million shares of the health insurer last quarter.\nIntel (INTC) rose more than +3% in pre-market trading after Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration was in talks to have the U.S. government take a stake in the company.\nSalesforce (CRM) gained about +1% in pre-market trading after DA Davidson upgraded the stock to Neutral from Underperform.\nApplied Materials (AMAT) plunged over -14% in pre-market trading after the largest chip-equipment maker in the world provided downbeat FQ4 guidance.\nTarget (TGT) fell more than -1% in pre-market trading after BofA downgraded the stock to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $93.\nYou can see more pre-market stock movers here\nToday’s U.S. Earnings Spotlight: Friday - August 15th\nFlowers Foods (FLO), So-Young (SY), T1 Energy (TE), Tuniu Corp (TOUR).\nOn the date of publication, Oleksandr Pylypenko did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

He fears meme stocks inflate Gen Z’s dreams of getting rich quick\n-\nSteven Wang, the 23-year-old CEO of Dub, a copy-trading platform, has been an investor almost all his life. Fueled by get-rich-quick aspirations, Wang told Fortune he’s seen how viral moments like rare meme-stock success stories have inflated his peers’ investment expectations and diminished their risk considerations. He hopes to change this.\nWhen Steven Wang was in second grade, he convinced his parents to open a custodial stock account. Now 23 years old, he’s running Dub, a copy-trading platform aimed at solving the financial literacy gap among his peers.\nA recent Harris Poll survey commissioned by Dub highlights the contradiction: While 60% of Gen Z and 66% of millennials are investing in the stock market outside of their 401(k)s, just 17% of Americans feel “very confident” in their understanding of how markets actually work. Most believe investing, rather than a traditional nine-to-five career, offers the fastest path to wealth—a dream increasingly shaped by viral TikTok finance videos or meme-stock success stories rather than grounded investment knowledge, Wang told Fortune.\nCopy trading, the concept underpinning Dub, allows everyday investors to automatically replicate the trades of more skilled market participants in real time. Instead of picking their own stocks, users can select vetted traders, hedge fund veterans, and other experienced investors to follow. Whenever those investors make a move, the same trade is executed in the user’s account, mirroring strategies and outcomes.\n“The ultrawealthy are already betting on smart people to deploy their capital,” Wang told Fortune. “We’re bringing that experience to regular Americans.”\nWang grew up 20 minutes outside Detroit, the child of poor Asian immigrants who both worked in the auto industry. He watched the city’s decline after the Great Financial Crisis and the auto industry’s blows to blue-collar families, an experience that shaped his desire to build a more stable financial future for himself.\nA self-described “hustler,” Wang sold Pokémon cards on the playground and flipped Air Jordans in grade school. Growing up, he nerded out on Warren Buffett books and Howard Marks memos, fueled by a self-professed “childish” vision to get rich through stock market investments.\n“I really learned the hard way,” Wang said. “I’m competing against hundreds of thousands of people on Wall Street trading for a living…[who] have decades of investing experience over me.”\nBy the pandemic, he was day-trading from his Harvard dorm room—watching waves of new investors enter the market and lose big to “hype, misinformation, and bad timing.” Wang said that’s when he decided the tools of professional investors should be accessible to everyone.", "content_hash": "aa36a98f8694ea1191e2104505928720", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The data analytics company has captured investor attention with record results, surging demand for its AI-driven platforms, and a stock price that's been on an impressive run.\nFor many, the bullish case seems obvious: strong growth, expanding margins, and a technology stack that appears well positioned for the AI era.\nBut as any seasoned investor knows, there's a difference between a great business and an excellent stock. Palantir may have the first part nailed -- but the second is where the story gets complicated. Let's unpack both sides of the argument.\nPalantir is firing on all cylinders\nPalantir's latest results blew past expectations. In the second quarter of 2025, revenue rose 48% year over year to $1 billion -- the highest in its history -- while adjusted operating income rose 24% to $464 million.\nWhat's driving this surge? One is that Palantir's commercial business is expanding rapidly as enterprises adopt its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) for their AI transformation. For perspective, the AI company closed a record $803 million in U.S. commercial total contract value (TCV), representing a 134% year-over-year improvement in the latest quarter.\nBut that's just part of the story. Palantir's traditional public sector business also delivered improvements, as U.S. government revenue increased 45% year over year in the same quarter. These twin engines of growth position the tech company well to sustain its momentum in the coming quarters, if not years, riding on the massive AI transformation wave.\nMomentum could keep the rally going\nBeyond fundamentals, Palantir is benefiting from a powerful momentum wave. The stock has gained more than 500% over the past year, and such rapid appreciation often attracts momentum traders and algorithmic funds. These investors aren't necessarily buying because they've done a deep dive into Palantir's financials -- they're buying because the trend is up.\nMomentum can be a powerful short-term force. In Palantir's case, several factors are aligning to keep investor enthusiasm high:\nA strong narrative around AI leadership.\nExpanding adoption across both commercial and government sectors.\nUpwardly revised guidance often keeps analysts and traders optimistic.\nThis dynamic doesn't guarantee further gains, but it does mean that sentiment may continue to act as a tailwind in the coming month, especially if Palantir continues to deliver quarterly upside surprises.\nHowever, momentum is notoriously fickle. When it turns, the same traders who piled in can exit just as quickly, amplifying the downside. That's why long-term investors should be careful not to confuse a price surge with a permanent shift in value.\nThe other side of the coin: valuation risk\nWhile the business story is compelling, the investment case becomes more complex when we factor in valuation. Palantir currently trades at over 132 times sales -- a premium multiple that incorporates a significant amount of future success, among other factors.\nHistory shows that even great companies can deliver mediocre returns if bought at overly optimistic valuations. Microsoft, for example, was a phenomenal business in the late 1990s -- yet investors who bought at the height of the dot-com boom had to wait more than a decade to break even, despite Microsoft's continued operational success.\nThat's the risk here: Palantir could continue to win new contracts, expand margins, and deepen its AI moat -- yet still deliver underwhelming stock returns if today's valuation already incorporates too much optimism.\nBesides, paying a high premium for a stock leaves little margin for error. Just one quarter of weaker-than-expected performance can lead to a stock being rerated to a more reasonable valuation. Great for investors looking to buy, but a disaster for those who have purchased the stock at high prices.\nWhat does it mean for investors?\nPalantir's latest quarter showed record revenue and growing profits -- the kind of financial performance any growth investor would love to see. Furthermore, the company's AI platform is gaining traction, lending it a credible claim to being one of the most significant players in applied artificial intelligence.\nIn the near term, momentum and investor enthusiasm could push the stock higher. But over the longer term, the most significant risk may not be the business itself -- it's the price investors are willing to pay for it today.\nWhile traders may be happy to ride the momentum, long-term investors, however, should think twice before making a bet. It will be prudent to wait for a more reasonable entry point.\nShould you buy stock in Palantir Technologies right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

See our Advertiser Disclosure.\nHELOC rates today remain under 9%. While the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates next month, rates on a home equity line of credit are unmoved for now. However, HELOC introductory rates, valid for six months or longer, currently range from 3.99% to 6.49% APR.\nRead more: Is now a good time to take out a HELOC?\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nHELOC rates Friday, August 15, 2025\nAccording to Bank of America, the largest HELOC lender in the country by volume, today's average annual percentage yield (APR) on a 10-year draw HELOC is 8.72%. That is a variable rate that kicks in after a six-month introductory rate, which is 6.49% in most U.S. states.\nOf course, your personal HELOC rate will depend on various factors, including where you live and your creditworthiness.\nHomeowners have an impressive amount of value tied up in their houses — more than $34 trillion at the end of 2024, according to the Federal Reserve. That's the third-largest amount of home equity on record.\nWith mortgage rates lingering in the high 6% range, homeowners are not going to let go of their primary mortgage anytime soon, so selling a house may not be an option. Why let go of your 5%, 4% — or even 3% mortgage?\nAccessing some of that value with a use-it-as-you-need-it HELOC can be an excellent alternative.\nDig deeper: Is a HELOC a good idea? Pros and cons to consider.\nHow lenders determine HELOC interest rates\nHELOC interest rates are different from primary mortgage rates. Second mortgage rates are based on an index rate plus a margin. That index is often the prime rate, which today is 7.50%. If a lender added 1% as a margin, the HELOC would have a rate of 8.50%.\nLenders have flexibility with pricing on a second mortgage product, such as a HELOC or home equity loan. Your rate will depend on your credit score, the amount of debt you carry, and the amount of your credit line compared to the value of your home. Shop two or three lenders for the best terms.\nAnd average national HELOC rates can include \"introductory\" rates that may only last for six months or one year. After that, your interest rate will become adjustable, likely beginning at a substantially higher rate.\nHow a HELOC works\nYou don't have to give up your low-rate mortgage to access the equity in your home. Keep your primary mortgage and consider a second mortgage, such as a home equity line of credit.\nThe best HELOC lenders offer low fees, a fixed-rate option, and generous credit lines. A HELOC allows you to easily use your home equity in any way and in any amount you choose, up to your credit line limit. Pull some out; pay it back. Repeat.\nMeanwhile, you're paying down your low-interest-rate primary mortgage like the wealth-building machine you are.\nLearn more: How do fixed-rate HELOCs work, and which lenders offer them?\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nLook for introductory rates, but be aware of a rate adjustment later\nToday, FourLeaf Credit Union is offering a HELOC APR of 6.49% for 12 months on lines up to $500,000. That's an introductory rate that will convert to a variable rate later. When shopping lenders, be aware of both rates. And as always, compare fees, repayment terms, and the minimum draw amount. The draw is the amount of money a lender requires you to initially take from your equity.\nThe power of a HELOC is tapping only what you need and leaving some of your line of credit available for future needs. You don't pay interest on what you don't borrow.\nHELOC rates today: FAQs\nWhat is a good interest rate on a HELOC right now?\nRates vary so much from one lender to the next that it's hard to pin down a magic number. You may see rates from 7% to as much as 18%. It really depends on your creditworthiness and how diligent a shopper you are.\nIs it a good idea to get a HELOC right now?\nFor homeowners with low primary mortgage rates and a chunk of equity in their house, it's probably one of the best times to get a HELOC. You don't give up that great mortgage rate, and you can use the cash drawn from your equity for things like home improvements, repairs, and upgrades. Of course, you can use a HELOC for fun things too, like a vacation — if you have the discipline to pay it off promptly. A vacation is likely not worth taking on long-term debt.\nWhat is the monthly payment on a $50,000 home equity line of credit?\nIf you take out the full $50,000 from a line of credit on a $400,000 home, your payment may be around $395 per month with a variable interest rate of 8.75%. That's for a HELOC with a 10-year draw period and a 20-year repayment period. That sounds good, but remember, it winds up being a 30-year loan. HELOCs are best if you borrow and pay back the balance in a much shorter period of time.", "content_hash": "00b4a3a83591b1ce3ee7a98a1ff4c769", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

I suspect, therefore, that the executives running Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE: BABA) don't mind it too much when their company is called the \"Amazon of China.\"\nAmazon's and Alibaba's businesses are remarkably similar. Both operate e-commerce platforms that dominate their target markets. Both are leading cloud service providers and have invested heavily in artificial intelligence (AI). Each of the two companies has expanded into digital entertainment and healthcare as well.\nThe comparisons don't hold up as well when it comes to stock performance, though. Amazon has delivered a jaw-dropping return of over 226,000% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1997. Since Alibaba's IPO in 2014, its stock has risen by only around 30%.\nBut which of these two growth stocks is the better pick right now? Here's how Amazon and Alibaba stack up against each other.\nCurrent growth\nWhile Amazon's stock performance has trounced Alibaba's over the long term, it's a different story more recently. So far in 2025, Alibaba's American depositary receipts have soared close to 50% while Amazon is barely in positive territory.\nHowever, Amazon is growing faster than Alibaba in at least one way. In the second quarter of 2025, Amazon's net sales jumped 13% year over year. Alibaba's revenue in its latest reported quarter increased by 7% year over year.\nIt was a similar story on the two companies' bottom lines. Amazon's net income soared 35% year over year, while Alibaba's adjusted earnings grew by 22%. Granted, Alibaba's earnings based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) skyrocketed by 13 times. However, this increase was primarily due to mark-to-market changes from its equity investments.\nGrowth prospects\nThe more important question is how much Amazon and Alibaba will continue to grow in the future. What is Wall Street's take? The consensus revenue growth estimate for Amazon next year is nearly 10%, compared to 8.3% for Alibaba, according to LSEG.\nBut analysts are more optimistic about Alibaba's earnings growth. The average estimate of the 29 analysts surveyed by LSEG is for the Chinese company to increase its earnings per share by roughly 20% next year. The average estimate of the 61 analysts surveyed by LSEG that cover Amazon is for the e-commerce and cloud services giant to grow its EPS by around 14.8%.", "content_hash": "173d4248d304bcaec0495a70e26217a0", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The source said they also discussed how to incorporate government data in the wake of Trump's decision to fire the head of BLS, claiming — without evidence — that its data had been politicized. Still, the bank was not considering changing the way research operates.\n\"This is going to come down to a person’s ability to withstand a barrage of criticism from the Oval Office, and the extent to which these banks provide support for their chief economists,\" said Dave Rosenberg of Rosenberg Research, who has worked in the economics departments at several banks. \"If we notice that research is being watered down ... then we’ll know that this has had an effect.\"\nJack Ablin, chief investment strategist at Cresset Capital, said if banks do start self-censoring, smaller investors who do not have the resources to do their own analysis are likely to suffer most.\nTrump's criticism is his latest attack on corporate America and other institutions, and is a break from historical norms, where presidents have typically avoided calling out private companies and executives for things they do not like.\nSome companies that have considered passing on tariff costs to customers have faced public criticism, and Trump, who came to politics after running businesses, has intervened directly in private business decisions by making a deal with Nvidia (NVDA) to give a portion of its revenues from sales to China of AI chips to the government.\nTrump “certainly is taking a number of steps that diverge from the traditional view of the respective roles of the government and private industry,” said Henry Hu, a securities law professor at the University of Texas.\nIn a social media post earlier this week, Trump said foreign companies and governments were mostly absorbing the cost of his tariffs, counter to Goldman's research.\n\"Given that sell-side Wall Street analyst predictions have been about as accurate as random guessing, small investors will do just fine with the president exercising his First Amendment right about flawed Wall Street research,\" a White House official told Reuters.\nOn Wednesday, Goldman's U.S. head economist David Mericle defended its research on CNBC, vowing to \"keep doing\" what the bank considers informative research.\nGoldman declined requests for further comment.\nOther major banks, including Wells Fargo, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America and Citigroup, declined to comment.\nREPUTATIONAL RISKS\nThere has already been evidence of self-censorship. A senior JPMorgan Asset Management investment strategist, Michael Cembalest, earlier this year said during a webinar that he refrained from voicing some of his thoughts on U.S. tariffs publicly. Shortly after Cembalest's comments, Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's CEO, said that he expects analysts to speak their minds. Both Cembalest and the bank declined to comment for this story.\nHu said there is a risk involved in even appearing to give way to political pressure.\n“Goldman’s reputational capital is at stake here,” he said. “If their views on the economy become biased, and they are shown to be wrong, why would anyone choose Goldman to advise them on anything?”\nMike Mayo, banking analyst at Wells Fargo, said independent research is critical for investment bank's reputation. \"Investment banks live and die by their reputation and independence. That transcends all other considerations.\"\nWall Street research has long been tightly overseen, one source said, with supervisory analysts reviewing research reports to ensure that language is not inflammatory, emotive or partisan and that reports are objective and cite sources.\nThat person said that if analysts feel unable to speak openly then investors will pay more or take greater risk. Liquidity will suffer and there will be less foreign participation in U.S. markets, the person said.\nIt was large losses by smaller investors that triggered the first major probe of Wall Street research in the aftermath of the dot com stock bubble of the late 1990s. Eliot Spitzer, then New York Attorney General, found that Wall Street analysts had swapped their honest opinions for unwarranted \"buy\" ratings on companies to help their banks win underwriting and advisory business. The result: a $1.5 billion global settlement payout by Wall Street and lifetime bans for some analysts.\nIt remains to be seen whether the current kerfuffle will have an outsized impact on Wall Street or if it is a storm in a teacup, said Steve Sosnick, market strategist at IBKR.\n\"It does raise a lot of questions,\" he added.\n(Reporting by Suzanne McGee and Saini and Saeed Azhar, Additional reporting by Davide Barbuscia, Nupur Anand, Lananh Nguyen and Ross Kerber; editing by Megan Davies, Paritosh Bansal and Deepa Babington)", "content_hash": "b1e8454ed4c5ae2d6f6cc892e3df0cc9", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

You even have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues if those apply to you. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.\n30-year fixed mortgage rates: Pros and cons\nThere are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.\nThe main disadvantage to 30-year fixed mortgage rates is mortgage interest — both in the short and long term.\nA 30-year fixed term comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed term, and it’s higher than the intro rate to a 30-year ARM. The higher your rate, the higher your monthly payment. You’ll also pay much more in interest over the life of your loan due to both the higher rate and the longer term.\n15-year fixed mortgage rates: Pros and cons\nThe pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are basically swapped from the 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.\nHowever, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.\nDig deeper: 15-year vs. 30-year mortgages\nAdjustable mortgage rates: Pros and cons\nAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined amount of time, then change it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.\nThe main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't necessarily reflect this, though — in some cases, fixed rates are actually lower. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)\nWith an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.\nBut if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.\nLearn more: Adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage\nIs now a good time to buy a house?\nFirst of all, now is a relatively good time to buy a house compared to a couple of years ago. Home prices aren't spiking like they were during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. So, if you want or need to buy a house soon, you should feel pretty good about the current housing market.\nHowever, mortgage rates are staying relatively high due to the political and economic climate. Experts don't think rates will plummet in 2025, so you might not want to base your decision on whether to buy strictly on interest rates. Recent news that home price gains are slowing, with predictions that house values may actually ease lower this year, can be part of your home-buying decision.\nThe best time to buy is typically whenever it makes sense for your stage of life. Trying to time the real estate market can be as futile as timing the stock market — buy when it's the right time for you.\nRead more: Which is more important, your home price or mortgage rate?\nToday's mortgage rates: FAQs\nWhat is a 30-year mortgage rate right now?\nAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.52% right now. But keep in mind that mortgage rates vary by state and even ZIP codes. For example, if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be higher.\nAre interest rates expected to go down?\nOverall, mortgage rates are expected to decrease slightly in 2025. Rates may inch up or down daily, but there shouldn't be a huge shift in the next couple of weeks.\nAre mortgage rates dropping?\nMortgage rates are dropping slightly overall, but today's 30-year fixed mortgage rate is up by five basis points.\nHow do I get the lowest refinance rate?\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.", "content_hash": "8445dcf513c2f7d14b0b11ef0bd42e36", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

It also factors in your homeowners insurance, property taxes, mortgage insurance, and HOA fees.\nHow mortgage interest rates work\nA mortgage interest rate is a fee for borrowing money from your lender, expressed as a percentage. You can choose from two types of rates: fixed or adjustable.\nA fixed-rate mortgage locks in your rate for the entire life of your loan. For example, if you get a 30-year mortgage with a 6% interest rate, your rate will stay at 6% for the entire 30 years unless you refinance or sell.\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage locks in your rate for a predetermined amount of time and then changes it periodically. Let’s say you get a 7/1 ARM with an introductory rate of 6%. Your rate would be 6% for the first seven years, then the rate would increase or decrease once per year for the last 23 years of your term. Whether your rate goes up or down depends on several factors, such as the economy and housing market.\nAt the beginning of your mortgage term, most of your monthly payment goes toward interest. Your monthly payment toward mortgage principal and interest stays the same throughout the years — however, less and less of your payment goes toward interest, and more goes toward the mortgage principal or the amount you originally borrowed.\nLearn more: Adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgages\nWhich mortgage term length should you get?\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is a good choice if you want a lower mortgage payment and the predictability that comes with having a fixed rate. Just know that your rate will be higher than if you choose a shorter term, and you will pay significantly more in interest over the years.\nYou might like a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage if you want to pay off your home loan quickly and save money on interest. These shorter terms come with lower interest rates, and since you’re cutting your repayment time in half, you’ll save a lot in interest in the long run. But you’ll need to be sure you can comfortably afford the higher monthly payments that come with 15-year terms.\nRead more: How to decide between a 15-year and 30-year fixed-rate mortgage\nTypically, an adjustable-rate mortgage could be good if you plan to sell before the introductory rate period ends. Adjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, then your rate will change after a predetermined amount of time. However, 5/1 and 7/1 ARM rates have similar to (or even higher than) 30-year fixed rates recently. Before getting an ARM just for a lower rate, compare your rate options from term to term and lender to lender.\nAre mortgage rates decreasing?\nYes and no. Mortgage rates have decreased over the last few weeks, but rates are still firmly planted between 6% and 7% and are set to stay that way. The 30-year and 15-year fixed rates are also a little higher than they were this time last year.\nMortgage interest rates will probably stay relatively high for the rest of the year. The latest Fannie Mae and Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) forecasts predict that mortgage rates will stay at or above 6% even through 2026.\nMortgage interest rates today: FAQs\nWhat are mortgage interest rates doing today?\nAccording to Freddie Mac, the national average 30-year mortgage rate is holding firm at 6.58%, and the average 15-year mortgage rate has decreased by two basis points to 5.69%.\nHow low will mortgage rates go in 2025?\nAccording to its July forecast, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be 6.8% in Q3 2025 and 6.7% by the end of the year.

One company that Wood and her team have been bullish on for a while is Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ: HOOD), a stock trading app. Ark Invest first bought shares of Robinhood in 2021, and although it faced significant volatility at the time, things have improved significantly since then. Robinhood's shares have skyrocketed by almost 500% during the past year, but there might still be plenty of upside left for long-term investors. Here's what investors need to know.\nWhy Robinhood is flying high\nWhile Robinhood's performance during the past year might seem surprising -- and perhaps unwarranted -- it's important to point out that the company faced some challenges back in 2021 for its role in the meme stock phenomenon. Many critics argued that the company's gamified trading platform made it easy for inexperienced investors to engage in high-risk trades. Robinhood also had to deal with a regulatory probe regarding some of its practices. On top of all that, Robinhood still wasn't profitable. All that has changed.\nDuring the past few years, Robinhood has established itself as a serious financial services provider. Consider the company's second quarter update. Robinhood's revenue increased by 45% year over year to $989 million. Most of Robinhood's key metrics moved in the right direction during the period, including total platform assets, net deposits, and subscribers to the company's Gold premium option, as well as average revenue per user. And on the bottom line, Robinhood's net income more than doubled to $386 million. Robinhood has been routinely posting results of this kind during the past few quarters. That's why the stock has soared as much as it has.\nThink long-term\nFollowing its success over the past year, Robinhood's shares appear expensive, to say the least. The company's forward price-to-earnings ratio is well above the average for financial stocks of 16.3, while its forward price-to-sales ratio is significantly higher than the undervalued range of 2 and below.\nCan the stock still have some upside at these levels? In my view, there is a good chance of a pullback. However, for those willing to hold onto the stock for more than five years, there could still be significant upside. First, high-growth companies often command steep premiums, especially when they are profitable, as is the case with Robinhood. Second, Robinhood's long-term prospects appear attractive. One key reason Robinhood's outlook is bright is its popularity among younger generations.", "content_hash": "e985218019b2fc77068fc106284a422c", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

It revealed a handful of new companies Berkshire has invested in, including stakes it sought to keep confidential earlier this year.\nREAD ALSO: Ethereum Battles Bitcoin for Wall Street Whales and Keurig Dr Pepper Adds Peet’s Coffee to Soon-to-Fracture Beverage Empire\nIn Full Form\nBerkshire’s 10Q filings this year suggested the holdings giant had added a sizable stake or stakes to its “commercial, industrial and other” investment categories. But Buffett’s firm also requested to keep at least one first-quarter investment confidential: This is a common strategy when building up stakes, one Buffett used in the past to accumulate holdings in Chubb, Chevron and Verizon. But when you’re the most famous investor on earth, even your quietest maneuvers garner Super Bowl-level viewership on trading floors, not to mention the sort of speculative guessing that comes in advance of the big game.\nGiven Buffett’s well-known investment philosophy, in which companies with reliable cash flows and a deep moat are king, speculative guesses ranged from defense contractor Lockheed Martin to construction equipment-maker Caterpillar and shipping giant United Parcel Service. Berkshire went in another direction and dropped a second-quarter surprise to boot:\n-\nThe mystery stocks that Berkshire started accumulating in the first quarter were homebuilders Lennar and DR Horton, as well as Nucor, America’s biggest steelmaker. That suggests, in particular, that Berkshire is going long on housing. Interest-rate cuts are coming, after all, aren’t they? Aren’t they?\n-\nThe big surprise, however, was a brand new, $1.6 billion stake in UnitedHealth, accumulated entirely during the second quarter. Berkshire steps in as the healthcare and insurance giant is reeling from soaring medical costs, facing a federal criminal fraud probe, and is warning its profits will drag for quarters to come.\nOther companies Berkshire added in the second quarter were home security firm Allegion and billboard and outdoor advertising operator Lamar. It also pared its holdings in Bank of America and made further cuts to its remaining Apple shares, while divesting from T-Mobile, continuing a trend of moving money out of tech and financials.\nDoubling Up: What Berkshire might see in UNH is value: The world’s largest healthcare company by revenue, it pays dividends (a quality shared by more than half the stocks Berkshire owns), and its shares have tumbled 46% this year. A turnaround would net a tidy sum, while the $1.6 billion position is but a fraction of Berkshire’s $300 billion portfolio, limiting risk. Of note, Scion, the investment firm of Big Short investor Michael Burry, also disclosed a new position in UNH on Thursday, meaning two “oracle” investors are making the same bet.\nThis post first appeared on The Daily Upside.

Currently trading for just $3.08 (as of Aug. 14), XRP is up more than 400% since November. The positive growth catalysts for XRP just keep on coming.\nAll this makes XRP the highest-upside cryptocurrency you can buy with $1,000. Let's take a closer look.\nPrice targets for XRP\nOne way to see just how much higher XRP might go this year is by looking at online prediction markets, where people are making daily trades based on where they think the prices of cryptocurrencies such as XRP might be headed.\nRight now, online prediction markets are giving XRP a 65% chance of hitting $4 this year, and a 29% chance of hitting $5. Considering that XRP hit a 52-week high of $3.65 earlier this summer, both of these price targets appear to be within reach.\nMoreover, in April, Standard Chartered predicted that XRP might soar as high as $5.50 this year, based on strong underlying fundamentals and a number of emerging growth catalysts.\nSo, based on XRP's current price of a bit more than $3, there is a reasonably good chance that it might increase in value by as much as 80% this year. Aside from perhaps Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC), it's hard to think of a higher-upside cryptocurrency for 2025.\nPotential growth catalysts\nThe good news for crypto investors is that XRP has a number of potential growth catalysts in play. Being able to deliver on just one of them might be enough to push XRP higher.\nAccording to Bloomberg, XRP now has a 95% chance of getting new spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission this year. These spot ETFs would make it much easier for institutional investors to get exposure to XRP. By some estimates, this could result in $8 billion in new money flowing into XRP. That would almost certainly help to push up the price of XRP.\nMoreover, the SEC recently wrapped up its long-running case against Ripple, the company behind the XRP token. This case, which dates back to December 2020, alleged that XRP was a security, and that the sale of XRP represented a sale of unregistered securities. With this legal battle in the rear view mirror, Ripple is able to go back to business in the U.S. market, and that likely means new growth for the XRP blockchain ecosystem.\nRipple has already explored a number of alternatives to boost the value of XRP. These include the launch of a stablecoin in December 2024, and the embrace of new real world asset (RWA) tokenization initiatives. According to top consulting firms, RWA tokenization is a potential multi-trillion-dollar market opportunity. So if XRP gains even a tiny market share of this market, there is even more potential for XRP to soar.\nBut is XRP overvalued?\nJust keep in mind: There has always been an enormous amount of buzz, hype, and speculation surrounding XRP, and it has rarely played out as expected. In more than a decade, XRP has never traded higher than $3.84. Its reputation as a high-upside cryptocurrency dates back to 2018, when there were significantly fewer cryptocurrencies to choose from. Until recently, XRP has fizzled, primarily due to all the regulatory uncertainty surrounding its SEC litigation.\nMoreover, an often-used market signal is flashing red right now. If you compare the total market cap of XRP ($190 billion) to the amount of total value locked (TVL) on the XRP blockchain ($88 million), there is a serious mismatch. This multiple for XRP is 2,159. By way of comparison, the multiple for Ethereum(CRYPTO: ETH) is just 5.7, and the multiple for Solana(CRYPTO: SOL) is 9.6.\nIf anything, this shows that XRP has been hyped up to incredible levels, with little real activity actually taking place on the blockchain to support such a high valuation.\nA key date on the calendar\nAn important moment for XRP is coming soon. The SEC is scheduled to rule on the new spot XRP ETFs by mid-October, and some analysts think a decision might come as soon as September. Wrapping up the SEC case in August was absolutely critical in that regard. Until all the legal and regulatory matters were resolved, the SEC was unlikely to approve new ETFs.\nAn investment in XRP is hardly without risk. But with high risk also comes high upside reward. If you have $1,000, and are looking for a high-upside cryptocurrency with the potential to double in value within an incredibly short period of time, XRP is an enticing option.\nDo the experts think XRP is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

If you’re looking for a secure place to store your savings, a certificate of deposit (CD) may be a great choice. These accounts often provide higher interest rates than traditional checking and savings accounts. However, CD rates can vary widely. Learn more about CD rates today and where to find high-yield CDs with the best rates available.\nBanks with the best CD rates right now\nToday’s CD rates vary quite a bit. In general, however, CD rates are beginning to decline due to the Fed’s decision to cut its benchmark rate three times in the later part of 2024. Even so, some banks are still offering competitive CD rates.\nFor those that are, top rates reach about 4% APY. This is especially true for shorter terms of one year or less.\nAs of August 15, 2025, the highest CD rate is 5.5% APY, offered by Gainbridge® on its 5-year CD. There is a $1000 minimum opening deposit required.\nHere is a look at some of the best CD rates available today from our verified partners:\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nCompare these rates to the national average as of July 2025 (the most recent data available from the FDIC):\nCompared with today’s top CD rates, national averages are much lower. This highlights the importance of shopping around for the best CD rates before opening an account.\nWhy do online banks have the best CD rates?\nOnline banks and neobanks are financial institutions that operate solely via the web. That means they have lower overhead costs than traditional brick and mortar banks. As a result, they’re able to pass those savings on to their customers in the form of higher interest rates on deposit accounts (including CDs) and lower fees. If you’re looking for the best CD rates available today, an online bank is a great place to start.\nHowever, online banks aren’t the only financial institutions offering competitive CD rates. It’s also worth checking with credit unions. As not-for-profit financial cooperatives, credit unions return their profits to customers, who are also member-owners. Although many credit unions have strict membership requirements that are limited to those who belong to certain associations or work or live in certain areas, there are also several credit unions that just about anyone can join.\nShould you open a CD?\nWhether or not you should put your money in a CD depends on your savings goals. CDs are considered a safe and stable savings vehicle — they don’t lose money (in most cases), are backed by federal insurance, and allow you to lock in today’s best rates.\nHowever, there are some drawbacks to consider. First, you must keep your money on deposit for the full term, otherwise you’ll be subject to an early withdrawal penalty. If you want flexible access to your funds, a high-yield savings account or money market account might be a better choice.\nAdditionally, although today’s CD rates are high by historical standards, they don’t match the returns you could achieve by investing your money in the market. If you’re saving for a long-term goal such as retirement, a CD won’t provide the growth you need to reach your savings goal within a reasonable time frame.\nRead more: Short- or long-term CD: Which is best for you?\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.", "content_hash": "5f37b176b26ff91e569ee51ffba2cbda", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

See our Advertiser Disclosure.\nThe Federal Reserve reduced its target interest rate three times in 2024. As a result, high-yield savings account rates have been falling. That said, some of the best accounts still pay above 4% APY. In order to get the highest interest rate possible on your savings, it’s important to do your research and find competitive offers. Not sure where to start? Here’s a closer look at savings interest rates today and where you can find the best ones.\nWhere are the best savings interest rates today?\nThe average interest rate on a traditional savings account is only 0.42%, according to the FDIC. However, the best savings rates can be found on high-yield accounts, which often pay much more.\nAs of August 15, 2025, the highest savings account rate available from our partners is 4.3% APY. This rate is offered by EverBank and requires a $0 minimum opening deposit.\nHere is a look at some of the best savings rates available today from our verified partners:\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nHistorical savings account rates\nOver the last decade, savings account interest rates have fluctuated quite a bit. From 2010 to about 2015, rates were rock-bottom, hovering at around 0.06% to 0.10%. This was largely due to the 2008 financial crisis and the Federal Reserve’s decision to lower its target rate to near zero in order to spur economic growth.\nFrom 2015 to 2018, interest rates began to increase gradually. However, they remained low by historical standards. Then the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to another sharp decrease in rates as the Fed once again cut rates to stimulate the economy. This brought average savings interest rates down to new lows, around 0.05% to 0.06% by mid-2021.\nSince then, savings account rates have recovered considerably, largely driven by the Fed's interest rate hikes in response to skyrocketing inflation. However, the Fed finally lowered the federal funds rate in September, November, and December 2024, and as a result, deposit rates are beginning to fall as well. Whether or not rates will continue to fall after its September meeting is yet to be determined.\nThe following is a look at how savings interest rates have changed over the past decade:\nIs a high-yield savings account right for you?\nDespite the fact that interest rates have risen substantially since 2021, the average savings account rate is still fairly low, especially compared to market investments. If you’re saving for a long-term goal such as a child’s education or retirement, a savings account probably won’t generate the returns needed to reach your goal.\nOn the other hand, if you’re saving for an emergency fund, home down payment, vacation, or other short-term goal, a high-yield savings account is ideal — especially if you want to access the funds as needed. Other types of deposit accounts, including money markets and CDs, may offer similar or even better rates, but restrict how often you can make withdrawals. The key is to shop around and find an account that provides a competitive rate with low or no fees.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.", "content_hash": "c41c1635ee219a38c123faa1e9970b0a", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

There are several ways to profit from this buildout, but one of my favorites is through the chipmakers.\nAt the top of the list is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), the world's leading contract chip manufacturer. TSMC, as it's known, dominates this space and looks to be getting stronger. Despite hitting a 52-week high, I still think it's undervalued and has room to run. It's one of my top stocks to buy now, and if you don't already own shares, it's not too late to pick some up.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a critical supplier to many AI companies\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a chip fabricator, but it doesn't sell its products on the open market. Instead, it acts as a foundry for fabless chip companies like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Apple. Because of its customer base, it has massive exposure to the artificial intelligence buildout. AI hyperscalers are racing to construct data centers filled with massive processing power to train and run AI models. The chips within these data centers have to come from somewhere, and TSMC is the source of most of these chips.\nWhile some may be concerned about TSMC's location, management is working to diversify its footprint and has plans to spend $165 billion to increase U.S. capacity. This will allow products like Nvidia's GPUs to have chips completely sourced from the U.S., which secures supply chains and sidesteps tariffs.\nTaiwan Semiconductor has gone all-in on increasing chip production with heightened demand, and that will pay off for the company in the long term. It is the top partner of choice for many AI companies, and this trend is far from over.\nHowever, the stock has risen 220% since the AI arms race began in 2023. So how does it have room for more?\nTaiwan Semiconductor's growth and valuation make the stock look cheap\nAt the start of 2025, management gave a bold prediction that AI-related revenue would grow at a 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years, with overall revenue increasing at a 20% CAGR. That's market-crushing growth, yet TSMC's stock trades at about the same valuation as the broader market.", "content_hash": "abf4beca107fdabc9fe697b84ce7f47e", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

It’s the first – and often the hardest – step toward building a winning portfolio. Every investor has a method: some rely on gut instinct, others on expert opinions, and many turn to technical analysis.\nElevate Your Investing Strategy:\nTake advantage of TipRanks Premium at 50% off! Unlock powerful investing tools, advanced data, and expert analyst insights to help you invest with confidence.\nEach approach has its merits, but for those who prefer a data-driven edge, there’s TipRanks’ Smart Score – an AI-powered system that turns mountains of market data into clear, actionable insights. By analyzing millions of daily trades and grading every stock against proven performance factors, Smart Score distills the complexity into a simple 1-to-10 ranking. A ‘Perfect 10’ signals a stock with strong potential, and when that rating aligns with Wall Street’s own bullish outlook, it’s a combination worth paying attention to.\nWe dug into the TipRanks database to find just such opportunities – and uncovered two ‘Perfect 10’ stocks that analysts are also backing with conviction. Let’s take a closer look.\nRegal Rexnord(RRX)\nRegal Rexnord, the first Perfect 10 stock we’ll look at, is a manufacturing company that specializes in motion control. That is, the company designs and builds tools and solutions for power and transmission systems for moving systems. Regal Rexnord’s product lines include such items as AC drives and controls; electric motors; clutches and brakes; bearings; couplings; gearings; industrial chains and sprockets; mechanical power transmission components; and predictive maintenance systems – and that list is by no means exhaustive. Motion control is a vital aspect of modern industry, and Regal Rexnord is an expert at it.\nThe company’s products, as can be expected, have found application in a wide range of industrial fields, including the aerospace and automotive industries; quarrying; cement manufacturing; industrial fans; commercial laundries; farming and agriculture; again, the list is long, and this only touches some of it. The point here is that Regal Rexnord is a major player in American manufacturing.\nThat can be seen from some of the numbers involved. The company boasts a market cap of more than $9 billion. Last year, Regal Rexnord brought in some $6 billion in total sales. Zooming out for a macro view, we see that Regal Rexnord has over 30,000 employees worldwide, operating a network of manufacturing facilities and sales and service offices. The company has been in business since 1955, and keeps its headquarters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\nIn its last earnings report, released on August 5 and covering 2Q25, the company showed just under $1.5 billion in quarterly revenue. This represented a 3.2% decline year-over-year, but edged over the forecast by 10 million. The firm’s $2.48 non-GAAP EPS was 4 cents better than expected. In some other key points, the company reported an adjusted free cash flow of $493 million – and in early July, the company won a $35 million data center contract, and expects to see significant additional business with that customer going forward.\nFor Baird analyst Michael Halloran, this company’s sound pipeline for future orders outweighs the slow-moving second quarter. Halloran writes of RRX, “2Q orders were directionally sluggish, but underlying momentum is beginning to build as indicated by healthy July orders (+4%) including large data center wins with line of sight for more to come. Additionally, management sees ~+MSD% growth in orders in 2H (strong IPS/AMC, negative PES). Combined with cross-selling synergies, cost synergies, and debt paydown, cumulatively, we see an attractive 2025 exit rate/2026 earnings profile… Recognizing risk remains (primarily shipment timing) we continue to believe RRX will benefit meaningfully from a cyclical recovery, has more secular tailwinds than investors realize, and has a strong long-term opportunity approaching (dynamic earnings/FCF profile that remains undervalued). Combined, RRX remains a top idea.”\nThis ‘top idea’ gets an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating from Halloran, with a $180 price target that indicates potential for a 22% upside in the year ahead. (To watch Halloran’s track record, click here)\nThe 9 recent analyst reviews of RRX shares include 7 Buy and 2 Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is priced at $154.57, and its $176 average price target implies that the shares will appreciate by 14% in the next 12 months. (See RRX stock forecast)\nFTAI Aviation (FTAI)\nThe second Perfect 10 stock we’ll look at is FTAI Aviation, another American industrial specialist. FTAI bills itself as ‘providing power for the aftermarket;’ in simpler terms, the company is known mainly for providing maintenance and upgrade services for both CFM56 and V2500 commercial airliner engines. That’s a highly niche role, but an important one – many airlines don’t own all of their flight equipment, but rather lease engines and maintenance plans from third-party providers. This arrangement allows the airline to focus on its core work of scheduling and flying, while FTAI and its peers provide and keep track of the engines.\nIn addition to airliner engines, FTAI will also purchase commercial airliners for leasing to airlines. The arrangement is similar to that for engines, and for the same reasons. FTAI is known as an important owner/provider of Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft. FTAI provides maintenance support for its leased aircraft and engines. Prominent among the company’s services are its module factory overhaul services and its engine piece parts and kits. These services are vital for maintaining or replacing engine fans and turbines, the beating hearts of modern jets.\nThe company’s largest facilities, capable of updating or repairing as many as 25 engines per month, are located in Canada. These are supplemented by modern facilities in the US, dedicated to light repair, module swaps, and field services. The company also has important facilities in Europe, where it conducts module maintenance and piece-part repair, and can turn out 150 engines each year. FTAI has global certifications, an important qualification in a worldwide business like commercial aviation.\nIn its 2Q25 financial release, FTAI reported quarterly revenues of $676.2 million, for an impressive 52% year-over-year increase and beating the forecast by $129.6 million. The company’s bottom line, of $1.57 per share, was 19 cents per share better than had been expected. The company finished Q2 with $301.9 million in cash and other liquid assets on hand.\n5-star analyst Brian McKenna, of Citizens JMP, covers this stock, and he sees FTAI in an all-around solid position. Laying out the company’s situation, McKenna says, “We believe 2Q25 results represented another inflection for FTAI, specifically related to underlying cash flow and GAAP earnings as well as the capital structure. Based on the outlook for FCF in 2H25 as well as the firm’s $300M cash position, we think there is an increasing probability that FTAI will be in a position to accelerate the pace of capital return to shareholders in 2026 (i.e., dividend increase and/or buybacks), even after allocating a sizable portion of this excess capital to other strategic growth initiatives. The momentum in Aerospace Products is nothing short of impressive, and we see significant upside in this business over time, which will only be accelerated as SCI scales further from here (i.e., 2026 vintage, etc.).”\nLooking ahead, the analyst describes an upbeat outlook, writing, “So, we believe the fundamental outlook for FTAI has never been better, and we remain buyers of the stock, specifically as we see idiosyncratic upside in both earnings and shares over the next several quarters.”\nAs a buyer of the stock, McKenna rates FTAI shares as Outperform (i.e., Buy), and he complements that with a $205 price target that implies a one-year upside potential of 40%. (To watch McKenna’s track record, click here)\nThis stock’s 9 recent analyst reviews break down to a lopsided 8 Buys and 1 Hold, supporting the Strong Buy consensus rating on the shares. FTAI has a current selling price of $146, and its average price target, $180.89, suggests that the shares will gain 24% on the one-year horizon.

See our Advertiser Disclosure.\nHELOC rates today are steady. While home equity line of credit lenders may offer similar variable rates, introductory offers vary widely. You may see rates as low as 3.99% to 6.75%. These teaser rates usually last from six months to one year before your adjustable rate kicks in.\nNow, let's check today's HELOC rate.\nDig deeper: How to use a HELOC to pay off debt (and when it makes sense)\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nHELOC rates Saturday, August 16, 2025\nAccording to Bank of America, the country's highest-volume HELOC lender, today's average APR on a 10-year draw HELOC is 8.72%. That is a variable rate that kicks in after a six-month introductory APR, which is 6.49% in most states.\nHomeowners have a abundant amount of value tied up in their houses — more than $34 trillion at the end of 2024, according to the Federal Reserve. That's the third-largest amount of home equity on record.\nWith mortgage rates lingering in the high 6% range, homeowners are not going to let go of their primary mortgage anytime soon, so selling a house may not be an option. Why let go of your 5%, 4% — or even 3% mortgage?\nAccessing some of that value with a use-it-as-you-need-it HELOC can be an excellent alternative.\nRead more: How to get a HELOC in 6 steps\nHow lenders determine HELOC interest rates\nHELOC interest rates are different from primary mortgage rates. Second mortgage rates are based on an index rate plus a margin. That index is often the prime rate, which today is 7.50%. If a lender added 1% as a margin, the HELOC would have a rate of 8.50%.\nLenders have flexibility with pricing on a second mortgage product, such as a HELOC or home equity loan, so it pays to shop. Your rate will depend on your credit score, the amount of debt you carry, and the amount of your credit line compared to the value of your home.\nAnd average national HELOC rates can include \"introductory\" rates that may only last for six months or one year. After that, your interest rate will become adjustable, likely beginning at a substantially higher rate.\nHow a HELOC works\nYou don't have to give up your low-rate mortgage to access the equity in your home. Keep your primary mortgage and consider a second mortgage, such as a home equity line of credit.\nThe best HELOC lenders offer low fees, a fixed-rate option, and generous credit lines. A HELOC allows you to easily use your home equity in any way and in any amount you choose, up to your credit line limit. Pull some out; pay it back. Repeat.\nMeanwhile, you're paying down your low-interest-rate primary mortgage like the wealth-building machine you are.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nLook for introductory rates, but be aware of a rate adjustment later\nToday, FourLeaf Credit Union is offering a HELOC rate of 6.49% for 12 months on lines up to $500,000. That's an introductory rate that will convert to a variable rate later. When shopping lenders, be aware of both rates. And as always, compare fees, repayment terms, and the minimum draw amount. The draw is the amount of money a lender requires you to initially take from your equity.\nThe power of a HELOC is tapping only what you need and leaving some of your line of credit available for future needs. You don't pay interest on what you don't borrow.\nHELOC rates today: FAQs\nWhat is a good interest rate on a HELOC right now?\nRates vary so much from one lender to the next that it's hard to pin down a magic number. You may see rates from nearly 7% to as much as 18%. It really depends on your creditworthiness and how diligent a shopper you are.\nIs it a good idea to get a HELOC right now?\nFor homeowners with low primary mortgage rates and a chunk of equity in their house, it's probably one of the best times to get a HELOC. You don't give up that great mortgage rate, and you can use the cash drawn from your equity for things like home improvements, repairs, and upgrades. Of course, you can use a HELOC for fun things too, like a vacation — if you have the discipline to pay it off promptly. A vacation is likely not worth taking on long-term debt.\nWhat is the monthly payment on a $50,000 home equity line of credit?\nIf you take out the full $50,000 from a line of credit on a $400,000 home, your payment may be around $395 per month with a variable interest rate beginning at 8.75%. That's for a HELOC with a 10-year draw period and a 20-year repayment period. That sounds good, but remember, it winds up being a 30-year loan. HELOCs are best if you borrow and pay back the balance in a much shorter period of time.", "content_hash": "52486550e9d421d1097076bf3801489f", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Could they mark a turning point for this struggling stock, and could now be a good time to invest in Pfizer?\nPfizer posts strong Q2 numbers and boosts guidance\nOn Aug. 5, Pfizer released its second-quarter earnings for 2025. Revenue for the June quarter totaled $14.7 billion, rising 10% year over year. And it easily came in above analyst estimates of $13.6 billion. On the bottom line, its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.78, also smashing expectations of $0.58. It also raised its guidance, now projecting adjusted EPS between $2.90 and $3.10 for the full year (versus its previous guidance of $2.80 to $3.00).\nWith a result like that, you might have expected shares of Pfizer to take off. Not only did it beat expectations, it performed the highly coveted beat-and-raise combo. And yet, the stock has barely moved since releasing its quarterly numbers.\nThe stock is now being weighed down by other factors\nPfizer can't catch a break. Its strong earnings performance comes at a time when the U.S. government is threatening tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals and is trying to get pharma companies to reduce drug prices. This doesn't bode well for the company, as these types of developments could lead to shrinking numbers on both its top and bottom lines.\nThe good news is that this isn't a Pfizer-specific problem. These are industry headwinds weighing down healthcare stocks as a whole. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund has declined by 13% in the past 12 months, which is similar to how Pfizer has performed over that stretch.", "content_hash": "6fd17520690c4ce391b4d2714d988d83", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Ramsey hosts respond\nWhen Ami drove her newly purchased used car off the lot, she thought she was set. Instead, she ended up with a blown engine, a $30,000 loan and a $6,000 warranty that won’t pay up — and now she’s fighting to keep her life from stalling out.\nWhen everything went south, the Tampa resident took it to a mechanic. She was shocked to discover that the warranty company wouldn’t cover repairs to the engine.\nDon't miss\n-\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n-\nI'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast)\n-\nWant an extra $1,300,000 when you retire? Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it\n“They’re trying to get out of it,” said Ami.\nInstead, the company told her she’d have to pay for the teardown to determine the cause of the problem — an out-of-pocket expense she can’t afford.\n“Basically, I have no car and I’m stuck with this,” Ami said.\nAfter going back and forth with the dealership and warranty company, she ran out of ideas and turned to The Ramsey Show for advice.\nExploding engine? Not covered by her car warranty\n“Does it not cover exploding engines?” asked co-hot John Delony.\nThe details matter when it comes to car warranties. Depending on the fine print, Ami might have to cover the teardown costs before the warranty pays for certain repairs.\n“That is insane,” fellow co-host George Kamel said. “I’ve never heard where you have to pay and then maybe the warranty company will reimburse you later.”\nIt’s rare for a warranty to cover everything that could go wrong with your vehicle. But many do cover engine problems.\nSince Ami paid $6,000 for an extended warranty, you’d think it would. But she may have overpaid. The average extended warranty costs about $1,300 a year, according to MarketWatch. Unless hers lasted at least four and a half years, she paid more than most.\n“If you bought that warranty through that dealer, then there may be some liability on their part, that they’re pushing a bad product on you,” Delony said.\nA key detail: Ami signed an as-is agreement when purchasing the car. Essentially, this legalese means that she purchased the car in its existing condition.\nShe’s not alone. Other customers of the same dealership have complained about similar warranty issues. The Better Business Bureau’s shows mixed reviews for the business, but many complaints share the same story. In its responses, the dealership often points to the as-is agreement, saying it doesn’t owe help to customers — even those who bought extended warranties.", "content_hash": "27a2e2f421bb065afd59718eb1f982af", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Pfizer said it would share analyses of the data with the scientific and patient community in “due course.” Last year, the company pulled from market another sickle cell drug, Oxbryta, that it gained from Global Blood, citing safety concerns.

Bitcoin has more than doubled since last August and reached a new all-time high well above the six-figure mark.\nWhile Bitcoin remains the top dog, two of the most popular and well-established altcoins -- Ethereum(CRYPTO: ETH) and XRP(CRYPTO: XRP) -- have grabbed headlines of their own with big gains. Though in many ways they are very different, their futures are both heavily tied to the legacy financial system. Both will also be affected significantly if there's mass adoption of stablecoins, and with the recent passage of the Genius Act, that looks entirely possible.\nSo, which is the better long-term pick? I believe that if you look past the hype, there's a clear answer.\nMass adoption could drive XRP's price\nThe technology underpinning legacy banking's settlements (how banks actually send and receive funds) is extremely useful and secure, but it has some pretty significant shortcomings. Transactions can take days or even weeks to finalize. The process -- especially when sending money across borders -- often involves several intermediaries, and the fees can stack up quickly.\nRipple, the company behind XRP, set out to solve those problems. It created the XRP blockchain and its native token to make financial transactions faster, cheaper, and more secure.\nThe basic investment thesis for XRP has always been that as banks adopt Ripple's technology, demand for XRP will rise and its price will follow. The more widespread the adoption, the higher XRP's value.\nHere's the thing: Banks can use Ripple's blockchain with little or no exposure to XRP at all. In fact, that's how most banks -- especially the largest ones -- choose to interact with the technology. They can capture most of the time and cost savings without taking on the risk of holding a volatile asset like XRP.\nRipple's on-demand liquidity (ODL) product is the exception. ODL helps institutions that face liquidity issues in cross-border payments by eliminating the need for pre-funded accounts in foreign currencies. Instead, banks use XRP as a bridge asset. This is where the popular investment case holds up.\nThe problem is, most major financial institutions don't face liquidity issues -- at least not to the extent that holding a risky asset like XRP would justify -- and I believe ODL is unlikely to be adopted at scale.\nAdding another wrinkle, Ripple just bought Rail, a stablecoin payment platform, and looks to be trying to position itself as a leader in stablecoins as the market takes off. This could further reduce demand for XRP, offering another payment system that doesn't require direct XRP exposure, and even potentially replacing XRP as the asset needed for ODL. The success of stablecoins could actually hurt XRP's value.\nEthereum is the backbone of the stablecoin market\nThat isn't the case for Ethereum. The pioneer of smart contracts underpins a large portion of stablecoin usage. By far, the most USDC transactions happen on its blockchain. As stablecoins grow in adoption, demand for Ethereum is likely to grow, not diminish.\nEvery stablecoin transaction on the Ethereum network requires a small payment in Ether (ETH) -- the actual coin investors hold -- for gas, or transaction fees. Part of that fee is automatically burned, meaning that the ETH is permanently destroyed and removed from circulation. The more activity on Ethereum, the more ETH is burned.\nBut wait, XRP works the same way, correct? XRP has to be burned for every transaction on its network. Why is this different? The mechanisms are similar, but the economics are very different. A minuscule amount of XRP is burned for each transaction; it has very little effect on price. In contrast, enough ETH is burned in each transaction to meaningfully affect the price.\nThe better long-term bet\nStablecoins could define the next wave of crypto adoption. For XRP, that's more risk than reward, and it's just the opposite for Ethereum. Stablecoin growth directly boosts activity on its network, burns ETH, and reduces supply.\nBeyond stablecoins, the possibilities offered by Ethereum's smart contracts in finance, the tokenization of stocks, and more make it the clear answer.

When the futures market is closed over the weekend, bitcoin's movements can create a discontinuity in prices on the CME chart. While filling the gap is a recurring pattern in market behavior, there's not guarantee it will take place.\nBitcoin has now set four all-time highs in 2025. Importantly, the magnitude of pullbacks following these peaks has been shrinking. After it hit $109,000 in January, BTC fell 30% to $76,000 by April. In May, the $112,000 high was followed by a 12% drop in June. July’s $123,000 peak led to a 9% decline. Most recently, August’s $124,000 high has so far seen only a 7% percent pullback, though we're only one day in.\nLooking ahead, Friday’s U.S. retail sales report is forecast at 0.7% month-over-month, which would mark the strongest reading since March. A stronger-than-expected number could further undermine expectations for a September rate cut.\nFurther out, attention turns to the end of August when $12 billion in bitcoin options are set to expire on Deribit. The majority of open call options are concentrated between the $120,000 and $124,000 strike prices, suggesting that if bitcoin trades near these levels, it would align with the positioning of many derivatives traders.

Off-price retailers have mostly benefited, though tariffs have emerged as more of a problem for them than previously thought.\nDillard’s said in its press release Thursday that Q2 gross margin, along with the steep decline in women’s apparel, rose moderately in shoes and slightly in ladies’ accessories and lingerie; fell slightly in men’s apparel and accessories; and was relatively flat in juniors’ and children’s apparel, cosmetics and home and furniture.\nThe retailer’s performance in the quarter could be a harbinger for department stores more generally, or a reflection of what many analysts see as standout fundamentals in the space, including strong merchandising, a regional store footprint and founding-family control.\n“The company continues to buck the trend for department stores,” Zachary Warring, equity analyst at CFRA Research, said in emailed comments.\nStill, Dillard’s isn’t immune to the challenges faced by its peers. From May to June, visits to its website fell in the mid-teens year over year, physical store sales fell 1.6%, and promotions are up, according to research earlier this month from UBS analysts led by Mauricio Serna.\nThe company doesn’t hold a conference call with analysts and doesn’t usually provide guidance.", "content_hash": "5ddd27a258bd01704457ba62742ed56d", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Following the announcement, Risher was named as new CEO on April 17, 2023.\nBy cashing out their Class B shares, Green and Zimmer have effectively given up their enhanced voting rights and control of the company’s future direction. The Class B shares they once held gave the two executives \"super-voting\" power of 20 votes per share.

It makes sense: Critics say his social networks are bad for your mental health; he’s aggressively hiring people across Silicon Valley to staff up his ambitious AI projects (which are, unto themselves, polarizing); and he owns wide swaths of land in Hawaii, which has rankled residents and activists alike. It makes sense that he might want to shield his livelihood, considering he’s almost certainly the target of public ire.\nAccording to a new Financial Times analysis, security budgets for the chief executives of 10 major tech companies climbed above $45 million in 2024—but still, nobody protects their boss more than Meta does for Zuckerberg.\nAcross the board, companies like Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, and Palantir all increased protection budgets by more than 10% year over year, driven by heightened threats and a worsening security environment for public-facing business leaders. But Meta’s security allocation for Zuckerberg reached more than $27 million in 2024, up from $24 million the previous year.\nThis dwarfs the amount spent by peers: In 2024, Nvidia spent $3.5 million to secure CEO Jensen Huang, an increase from $2.2 million the previous year. Amazon allocated $1.1 million for CEO Andy Jassy, while former CEO Jeff Bezos continued to receive $1.6 million annually toward his personal security. Apple spent $1.4 million to protect Tim Cook in 2024, which was actually lower than the $2.4 million spent in 2023. Alphabet’s security spending for Sundar Pichai reached $6.8 million, according to public data, and Tesla disclosed it spent just $500,000 to protect Elon Musk, although industry experts emphasize that this sum represents only a small portion of his actual security expenses as the world’s richest man has his own security companies like Foundation Security.\nNotably, if you add up how much Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Palo Alto Networks spent protecting their CEOs in 2024, it’s still about $7 million—26%—less than what Meta spent to guard Zuckerberg.\nSecurity in Silicon Valley\nFor what it’s worth, Meta’s security program is a bit different from the others as it covers Zuckerberg’s residences, family, and travel, since Zuckerberg is synonymous with Meta, né Facebook. As both CEO and cofounder, he also holds majority voting power—and a lot of people have strong feelings about Zuckerberg given his very public role in society, layoffs, and consumer privacy.\nSecurity in Silicon Valley is often managed by private security firms, many of which are staffed by former law enforcement and military professionals. Hamilton Security, founded by former FBI agent James Hamilton, provides comprehensive assessments and risk mitigation services. Gavin de Becker & Associates and LaSorsa & Associates are also considered major players, protecting executives like Musk and Bezos, respectively. Their services include risk assessment, intelligence monitoring, residential security with hardened features (e.g., Amazon’s bulletproof panels), 24/7 personal protective details, secure transportation, cybersecurity, anti-stalking measures, as well as preparation for assassination attempts, kidnap attempts, and digital threats such as deepfakes.", "content_hash": "051a0c40010d2c425e684b8b89c0b198", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Buying on the dip is even better, provided, of course, they have the means to bounce back.\nInvestors looking for companies that fit this profile should strongly consider Pfizer(NYSE: PFE) and Merck(NYSE: MRK). These two market leaders have lagged broader equities over the trailing-12-month period, but for those focused on the long game, they still look attractive. Here's the rundown.\n1. Pfizer\nOver the past few years, Pfizer has dealt with worsening financial results and stiff competition for some products. It also faces the prospect of losing patent protection for others; these include Eliquis, an anticoagulant that is one of its top-selling drugs, and Xtandi, a cancer treatment. Both will lose their patents in the U.S. within the next few years.\nThese challenges have led to terrible stock-market performance. However, the sell-off may have gone too far. At current levels, Pfizer's shares look attractive.\nOne reason the company should bounce back and continue to deliver strong returns over the long run is its deep pipeline, particularly in oncology, one of the largest therapeutic areas in the industry. Pfizer currently has five blockbuster cancer medicines, and plans to raise that number to eight by 2030.\nPfizer has exciting candidates in other areas as well, and in recent years has earned approval for several new products. Though these aren't yet meaningfully contributing to its top-line growth, they should do so eventually as they earn label expansion.\nThe company's vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Abrysvo, generated $143 million in sales in the second quarter, which isn't bad for a product approved in 2023. It also recently earned a label expansion in Europe for adults age 18 to 59 (it was previously indicated for those 60 and older). Pfizer should make progress with Abrysvo and other newer launches.\nThe company has also been reducing expenses. These initiatives were likely partly responsible for Pfizer's earnings beat during the second quarter. Management intends to achieve $4.5 billion in net cost savings this year and pursue further reductions in the years ahead, efforts that should help improve profitability.\nPfizer is a solid dividend stock. Its forward yield currently tops 7%, and the company has increased its payouts by 19.5% in the past five years. While the stock may take some time to recover, Pfizer could be an excellent long-term investment for income-seeking investors.\n2. Merck\nMerck is facing several issues, none more important than increased competition for its best-selling drug, cancer medicine Keytruda, and an upcoming patent cliff in 2028 for the medicine. Also, the company's second-quarter results were not strong: Revenue declined by 2% year over year to $15.8 billion, while adjusted earnings per share declined by 7% to $2.13.\nHowever, there were some bright spots for the company. Most notably, Winrevair -- one of its newest launches, which earned approval last year -- reported sales of $336 million. Winrevair is a therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension with a new mechanism of action. It should become a blockbuster relatively soon.\nMerck's business in animal health -- where it's one of the leaders -- also performed well, with sales from that segment rising by 11% year over year to $1.6 billion in the second quarter.\nMeanwhile, Merck has some exciting pipeline candidates that should help it overcome Keytruda-related challenges. One of them is a subcutaneous version of Keytruda, which has already aced phase 3 studies and will help extend the medicine's patent protection. Merck has also significantly improved its pipeline in recent years thanks to licensing agreements. Its candidates include promising cancer products and weight loss medicines.\nJust as Winrevair appears to be a major success, Merck is also likely to develop innovative therapies that will mitigate potential Keytruda-related revenue losses. So, despite recent setbacks, the business could bounce back given Merck's history of innovation.\nTurning to Merck's dividend program, the company now offers a forward yield of 4.1%, with its dividends increasing by 39% over the past five years. The stock remains a good pick for dividend seekers.\nShould you buy stock in Pfizer right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Pfizer wasn’t one of them.

Stocks have been on a tear since Trump backed away from steep tariffs in early April and instead pursued a more modest country-by-country approach to trade deals.\nBut all is not well. An Aug. 15 New York Times headline told readers, \"The stock market is getting scary.\" Economist Burton Malkiel pointed out that stock valuations are near the highest levels in 230 years, warning that \"there are worrisome signs that investor optimism may have gotten out of hand.\"\nIt's not just the mainstream press that's worried. Money managers at Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, and Evercore are preparing clients for a possible 10% to 15% drop in stock values, according to Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs sees a \"latent risk of unwinds\" if anything upsets a fragile \"Goldilocks\" setup. In an Aug. 14 video for clients, Tom Lee, co-founder of investing firm Fundstrat, highlighted the recent jump in wholesale inflation and said, \"yet the stock market barely cared.\"\nWhat seems to be happening is that the stock market is diverging from the real economy. The signs of an economic slowdown include sharply slowing job growth and a surge in wholesale inflation caused largely by all of Trump's new taxes on imports. Consumers expect higher producer costs to push up retail costs in the coming months, pushing overall inflation from 2.7% now to around 4.5%. That's depressing overall consumer sentiment.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, take his inflation quiz, or sign up for his newsletter.\nIt's not alarming for the stock market and the economy to go in slightly different directions. As Sam Ro points out in his TKer newsletter, the stock market often functions as a \"discounting mechanism\" assessing future growth and earnings. And some Wall Street analysts think the early 2025 swoon — with the S&P down 21% from late February to early April — represented stocks pricing in the slowdown we're undergoing now. If so, the current run-up might be telling us the economy will do better by the end of the year than the meek 1% GDP growth many economists are forecasting.", "content_hash": "487a254aa75d4d69a3398cc3952af3d9", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

(Nasdaq: ALCO) completed a major strategic shift towards transforming into a diversified land management company.\nFinalizing this key milestone in the company’s transitioning process allows financial and operational resources to be redirected towards high-potential initiatives in line with the new business strategy. To unlock scalable and less volatile revenue streams, ALCO now focuses on land development, conservation projects and alternative agricultural uses.\nAdding to the transformational momentum, land sales are already ahead of target for fiscal year 2025, exceeding original guidance by $3.5 million. This strong asset monetization provides additional resources to advance new strategic focal points.\nFinancial results are undergoing a transitional period that should be temporary, clearing the way for a cleaner and more lucrative set of revenue streams. Overall revenue from citrus operations declined reasonably by 41%, which is to be expected. But looking ahead, management reaffirmed the fiscal 2025 EBIDTA guidance of $20 million, so investors should keep their eye on the prize.\nAs a baseline, our own DCF analysis that takes future land sales as a basis for cash-flow run rate, we arrive at an upside potential of 7% in the stock.

Especially when stocks are swinging in volatile times, reliable income is a rare anchor.\nRight now, I like the following three dividend stocks because they're steady, well-positioned, and proven in every economic weather pattern you can name. That's a trifecta you can rarely go wrong with, whether you're investing $100, $1,000, $10,000, or $50,000.\n1. Coca-Cola\nNot many brands are as well-known globally as Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO). Its flagship soda is one of the most recognized products on the planet, and the company's portfolio stretches far beyond colas (think Dasani water, Minute Maid juice, and Topo Chico sparkling water).\nAlthough Coca-Cola's stock has outperformed the market through Aug. 13 (compared to the S&P 500), the appeal of its stock has long been its dividend. Indeed, Coca-Cola has raised its dividend for 63 consecutive years, making it a Dividend King. Today's yield sits just below 3%, with a payout ratio that leaves room for steady increases. That means investors get a dependable income stream that's not tied to market swings.\nThe headwinds? Currency fluctuations can bite into earnings, and global health trends could pressure sugary beverage sales over time. But Coca-Cola's ability to adapt, whether through zero-sugar drinks or premium hydration brands, keeps it well-anchored in the \"reliable\" category.\n2. Realty Income\nWhen Realty Income(NYSE: O) calls itself \"The Monthly Dividend Company,\" it's not bluffing. This real estate investment trust (REIT) has paid dividends for 661 consecutive months, or roughly 55 years.\nThat kind of track record comes from a simple but effective business model: Long-term, net lease agreements with single tenants in stable, non-discretionary industries. Think Lowes, 7-Eleven, and Chipotle, among others. Today, Realty Income owns more than 15,600 commercial properties leased to over 1,600 clients across 91 separate industries, achieving a portfolio occupancy of 98.5%.\nEven when the economy cools, those tenants still pay rent, and Realty Income's contract structure shifts maintenance and insurance costs to them. That keeps cash flow predictable, which in turn supports the monthly dividend. The yield, currently around 5.6%, ranks it as a top dividend REIT.\nElevated interest rates have weighed on the share price, but that's more of a short-term sentiment hit than a problem with its fundamentals. As borrowing costs normalize, Realty Income stands to regain some ground, while delivering monthly payments while you wait.\n3. Johnson & Johnson\nLike Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson(NYSE: JNJ) is a Dividend King, a company that has increased its annual dividend for at least 50 consecutive years. Johnson & Johnson has done so for 63 years, putting it firmly within this elite group.\nJohnson & Johnson is a household name, and you've probably purchased or used one of its products at some point in your life. Its operations cover two main areas: Pharmaceuticals and medical devices. The pharmaceutical segment brings in the largest share of revenue, anchored by blockbuster drugs, while medical devices benefit from steady demand for surgical and orthopedic products.\nOne of Johnson & Johnson's strengths is that, even in downturns, people don't usually postpone essential treatments. True, there are litigation risks (around talc and opioids), so the company isn't completely shielded from volatility. But with a strong balance sheet and a payout ratio just over 50%, the dividend looks well supported and has room to grow from here.\nIt currently offers a dividend yield of about 3%. That's not flashy, but it's steady enough to keep paying you while you hold the stock for the long haul.\nThree dividend stocks built to last\nDividends aren't about income as much as they are about discipline. Coca-Cola, Realty Income, and Johnson & Johnson have spent decades proving they can reward shareholders through every cycle. That doesn't mean share prices won't fluctuate -- they will -- but these dividends don't flinch easily. That's the kind of steady footing that makes it a little easier to hang on when the market feels anything but steady.\nShould you buy stock in Coca-Cola right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

Deficits and debt levels of governments, which can affect the bond markets and economic growth and inflation. The third is globalization. That's in the headlines for tariffs, but there are other aspects of globalization, such as where good ideas come from, an underrated part of globalization. The fourth is the two dimensions of demographics. It’s population growth, which includes immigration, as well as the aging of society.\nEven if AI delivers extraordinary breakthroughs, there is still the real possibility that technology will not rescue us from the headwinds the economy faces.\nHow does someone build a resilient retirement portfolio taking all that into account?\nThere's a lot of change (coming) in the years ahead from the economic perspective. Focus on the things that you can control.\nCreate clear, realistic investment goals for your portfolio, incorporating your time horizon and an honest assessment of your tolerance for risk. And stick with a research-based investment plan through good times and bad. Investing evokes strong emotions that can lead to impulsive decisions.\nMax out your savings and stay invested in the market. There's going to be a lot of concern in terms of what interest rates may do and what the stock market may do. But in virtually all scenarios, everyone will heavily benefit from compounding and staying invested in the markets.\nMaintain a diversified mix of broad investments across different kinds of investments to reduce a portfolio’s exposure to the risk common to an entire asset class, such as stocks and bonds.\nMinimizing cost and fees was perhaps Bogle’s greatest contribution to investors and the financial services industry, and it’s not going away. As Bogle often said, “in investing, you get what you don’t pay for.” Assume an annual return of 6%. With annual costs equal to 0.1% of assets, a $100,000 investment will grow to $557,383 after 30 years. If annual costs are 2.0%, the total will be just $317,081, some $240,000 less. When higher costs compound, the differences in your wealth can be staggering.\nHow will Bogle’s mantra 'stay the course' hold up?\nAs someone who has spent over 20 years at Vanguard, I firmly believe in the power of “staying the course” when navigating economic and financial uncertainty, but it doesn't mean that you never adjust your portfolio.\nIt has been misinterpreted as \"I should ignore all headlines and not care about risks that may emerge.\"\nStaying the course by being continually invested in the markets is correct, but be prudent. There's always risk in tilting your portfolio too far in one way or the other. Everything in moderation is good. Jack was clearly of that mind, and I try to channel that.\nYou write that an aging society can be productive. Could you elaborate?\nOlder consumers do not spend less as they age, although what they spend on changes — for instance, healthcare.\nAcademic research and our analysis both show that over the past 20 years, as we moved more jobs in the United States to service-based ones — finance, education, healthcare, business services, where there's somewhat less of a physical demand — it opens the door to working longer for people. And that’s a positive. Experience matters a lot, what economists call human capital. It’s very valuable.\nFor those choosing to work longer, it's a good thing for the economy. Economists are underestimating this aspect of the US labor force, which is its fastest growing segment at this very moment.\nShould alternative investments be held in retirement plans over the next decade? There's so much buzz with the president signing the executive order recently encouraging the use of these investments in our 401(k)s.\nCosts will have to be reduced to improve the odds of success investing in them. And secondly, I cannot index all private investments. I don't get the full pool. I can only buy individual strategies. Unlike the public markets, I can't buy all of the investments and diversify my risk. I have to put my eggs in a few managers, and that's going to be much like if I was just picking individual stocks.\nSo these types of investments are not a great idea for the typical retirement saver?\nI’m not saying you shouldn't do it. What does this mean for investors? Eyes wide open. It's who you pick as the manager that determines your success along the way. Investors have to understand that.\nThese can clearly add value, but not all boats rise in the ocean. If you select a manager that's not among the best, your investments are going to trail the public markets.\nManager selection is really critical, and why we view these kinds of investments as an extension of active management. The good news is some private investments, based upon skill of the managers, can do exceptionally well in outperforming the broad public markets.\nThat has been true for 20 years. It'll be true in the next 20 years.\nWhen you consider that the top 20 stocks make up half of the market cap of the S&P 500 Index, what should investors like me be thinking? Should I be diversifying out of this index fund?\nIf someone has only been invested in the S&P 500 in their retirement account, congratulations. It has done exceptionally well.\nI would not urge anyone to do drastic selling. This is where I say \"stay the course,\" but start thinking about diversifying. It could be smaller-cap companies in the United States, which have trailed over the past 10 or 15 years, as well as non-US investments. Every market has trailed the United States almost without exception.\nSome of the next great companies may be small today, or may be located outside the US. That has not been the case in the past 10 or 15 years, but I don't think investing should be looked at through the rearview mirror.\nParting thoughts?\nMy goal is to demystify these trends and how they relate to investing, not sugarcoat it.", "content_hash": "754e861931e7b3ddbef5d71d56c9abf2", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The problem? They're concentrated in just a handful of countries, with the lion's share of processing capacity in China. It's a concentration of power that has governments and companies alike scrambling to secure non-Chinese sources before a trade dispute or export ban turns supply chains into choke points.\nEnter, The Metals Company(NASDAQ: TMC), an early-stage mining company with a plan to scoop billions of tons of metal-rich rocks from the deep Pacific. If it works, these rocks (called \"nodules\") could feed the clean-energy supply chain for decades, not to mention give the U.S. and allies a rare chance to loosen China's hold on critical minerals.\nBut with the company yet to secure mining permits, and potentially years away from turning a profit, the gap between vision and reality is about as wide as the ocean the company is trying to mine. All things considered, can this metal stock generate $1 million from today's share price?\nWhy deep-sea mining has investors talking\nFirst, let's talk opportunity.\nThe Clarion-Clipperton Zone, where The Metals Company plans to operate, contains trillions of potato-sized polymetallic nodules. These small, metal-rich rocks contain nickel, manganese, copper, zinc, cobalt, and other minerals. In other words, they hold the building blocks for EV batteries, renewable power grids, advanced defense systems, and dozens of other uses.\nThe U.S. still imports roughly 80% of rare earths, and more than three-quarters of that comes from China. After leaping into the rare-metal business before most of the rest of the world, Beijing now controls about 70% of global rare-earth mining and nearly 90% of processing. Recent export restrictions on certain rare earths and magnets have only underscored the need for alternative sources.\nBut big hurdles remain\nTMC's pitch is that deep-sea mining could deliver rare earths at scale without relying on land-based mines. The plan seems simple enough: With vacuum-like machinery, it'll pump nodules to the surface, process them in a seawater slurry, then discharge sediment back to the sea.\nLocating nodules isn't a problem. The company has mapped and secured exploration rights to two massive swaths of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone. Its biggest hurdle, however, is getting permission to start mining. The key gatekeeper is the International Seabed Authority (ISA), a U.N.-linked body that sets the rules for mining in international waters. Currently, the ISA is still finalizing its rulebook, and, until it's finished, nobody's getting a commercial license.\nFor TMC, that could mean waiting months, maybe years, before the ISA gives it the green light. Any longer than a few years, and the company could burn through its cash reserves long before the first nodules surface.\nThat said, there is an unusual wrinkle with the ISA: The U.S. never ratified the treaty that created it. That could open the door -- narrowly -- for a U.S.-based company to bypass the ISA entirely if national interest is at stake.\nTMC is currently trying to wedge its way though that gap. Earlier this year, it filed for a mining permit under an old U.S. offshore minerals law just days after a White House order revived political interest in rare earths. If it works, the company could have a head start that no other deep-sea miner currently has, effectively turning years of regulatory waiting into an open lane toward production.\nIs The Metals Company a millionaire maker?\nLet's do the math.\nIf you bought 1,000 shares of TMC at today's price ($5.32), your initial position would be worth about $5,320. For that to grow to $1 million, you would need a 188-fold gain from today's price, or a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 68.8% over a decade. That's extremely rare in public markets.\nTrue, TMC has massive potential. But the company is still pre-revenue. Despite the fact that its market cap sits around $2.1 billion, it isn't generating commercial revenue, at least not meaningfully.\nIt's also burning cash. In the first quarter of this year, it reported a net loss of $20.6 million, or $0.06 per share. Although it claims to have about $43.8 million in total liquidity -- with $2.3 in cash -- that cushion could evaporate quick without a breakthrough on the permit front.\nDon't get me wrong: TMC can disrupt the global supply of rare earths, if it can get its business off the ground and into the sea. But since its business model is still unproven, sentiment and expectations will drive the stock in the short term, which could make it volatile. It's one to keep on the radar, but without clear steps toward production, I'm not ready to anchor a large position here.\nShould you invest $1,000 in TMC The Metals Company right now?\nBefore you buy stock in TMC The Metals Company, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and TMC The Metals Company wasn’t one of them.

Those who invest in silver will be paying more for it. To put it another way, the amount of silver you’d own for $500 in 2025 is less than what you’d purchase for the same amount in 2024, as the dollar is not growing with the metal.\nFind Out: 12 Best Safe Investments To Grow Your Money in 2025\nA Weakening Dollar\nSpeaking of the dollar not buying as much: Periods of increased previous metal values tend to inversely indicate a period of weak currency, as the dollar’s purchasing power inherently diminishes in the face of silver (and gold’s) rising value.\nInflation on the Rise?\nHistorically, an increase in silver’s value often hints at (or outright reflects) investor skittishness about inflation. Silver’s rise is often concomitant with investors preparing for an expected increase in inflation because of the dollar’s devaluation. While not an guarantor of inflation, a steep rise in silver’s value should be taken as a serious financial omen, at the very least.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Silver Is Reaching Record Highs: What This Means for Your Dollar", "content_hash": "eb5bd112a4721afd550c06cf939f4fb8", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The Canadian pipeline and utility giant has paid dividends for over 70 years and has increased its payment for the past 30 consecutive years. Its earnings are so predictable that the company has achieved its annual financial guidance for 19 straight years and is on track to extend that to 20.\nThe company has again demonstrated its reliability this year. The pipeline operator has delivered strong earnings and continued enhancing its long-term growth profile. These factors reinforce why the energy stock deserves a place in your portfolio.\nOn track for another solid year\nEnbridge enjoyed a strong first half, posting record second-quarter results with adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) up 7% despite significant market volatility from tariffs. High utilization across its systems and stable commercial frameworks contributed to its predictable results. The company also benefited from last year's acquisition of three U.S. natural gas utilities.\nThat strong start has the company on track to deliver results at or above the mid-point of its 2025 financial guidance range. It also expects to get some incremental income in the second half from its recent purchase of a 10% interest in the Matterhorn Express Pipeline.\nEnbridge's strong performance despite volatile market conditions during Q2 highlights its low-risk business model. About 98% of its earnings come from predictable revenue frameworks with no commodity price exposure and minimal volume risk. Over 95% of these are with investment-grade customers, and 80% of its revenue arrangements shield earnings from inflation.\nMore growth secured\nThe Canadian energy infrastructure giant also continues to secure new growth opportunities. The most notable new addition to its backlog is Clear Fork, a 600-megawatt solar energy facility designed to support the data center operations of Meta Platforms. The company expects to complete the $900 million project by 2027.\nEnbridge also approved the $100 million Line 31 expansion of its Texas Eastern Transmission system to meet the growing demand from industrial and power customers in the region. Additionally, the company approved a 300 million Canadian dollar ($217.4 million) project to expand its Aitken Creek gas storage facility, providing enhanced flexibility to LNG customers in Western Canada. These new projects increased the company's secured backlog to CA$32 billion ($23.2 billion) of expansions through the end of the decade.\nThis backlog supports Enbridge's long-term outlook. The company expects 7% to 9% compound annual adjusted EBITDA growth through 2026 and about 3% annual distributable cash-flow per-share growth. Growth rates are projected to stabilize at around 5% annually after 2026, supporting dividend growth of up to 5% per year.\nBacked by a fortress financial profile\nEnbridge supports its growth and dividend with a strong financial position. At the end of Q2, the company had a leverage ratio -- a measure of debt compared to earnings -- of 4.7 times, safely within its target range of 4.5 to 5.0 times. This ratio improved from 5.0 times at the end of last year thanks to higher earnings and the sale of a 12.5% share in its West Coast natural gas pipeline system for CA$700 million ($507.3 million). The company also maintains a conservative approach to paying dividends, distributing only 60% to 70% of its steady cash flow.\nEnbridge estimates it has about CA$9 billion to CA$10 billion ($6.5 billion to $7.3 billion) in annual investment capacity from its post-dividend free cash flow and balance sheet availability while staying within its targeted leverage ratio. This is enough to fund its current backlog and provide room for more expansion projects and bolt-on acquisitions as opportunities arise. The company is currently pursuing CA$50 billion ($36.2 billion) in longer-term investment opportunities to further strengthen its outlook.\nEnbridge checks all the boxes\nEnbridge stands out for its low-risk model and resilient financials. These attributes allow it to consistently expand operations and steadily grow its dividend. As CEO Greg Ebel noted in the Q2 earnings report, the company's visible earnings and dividend growth \"position Enbridge as a first-choice investment opportunity.\"\nShould you invest $1,000 in Enbridge right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Enbridge, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Enbridge wasn’t one of them.

AI is changing how people do nearly everything, speeding up processes and making many actions cheaper and easier.\nMany popular AI stocks continue to climb, including Nvidia and Palantir Technologies, up 36% and 147% respectively. But there are also smaller stocks that offer incredible opportunities, perhaps even more compelling than the stocks that have already caught market attention.\nConsider Upstart Holdings(NASDAQ: UPST). The AI-based lending platform was a market favorite before its business seemed to implode, and investors have lost interest in it. It's up only 4% year to date, despite an outstanding second-quarter report. But as the business rebounds, Upstart stock could soar a lot higher.\nA better way to lend money\nUpstart's platform uses AI and machine learning to evaluate credit risk. It uses millions of data points and many different criteria and offers nearly instant approvals -- a modern version of the traditional credit score, which has a limited scope. It says that its model approves more loans without adding risk to the lender, which puts more money to work for lenders and gives borrowers greater financial freedom.\nAlthough it was growing by leaps and bounds when interest rates were at zero, the good times came to an end when interest rates were raised, since it was more challenging to identify good borrowers when default rates were climbing.\nAlthough interest rates have started to come down, management says its return to growth is unrelated to the decline. It's leaned into its business over the past few years, rolling out new products, expanding the platform, and improving its algorithms.\nThere was major progress in the second quarter. Revenue more than doubled from last year, and transaction volume was up 159%. It also returned to positive net income on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis a quarter earlier than expected, with $5.4 million in the second quarter.\nA huge opportunity\nThe credit evaluation industry is huge, but it's been dominated by a small number of leaders for several decades. Upstart says that $25 trillion is originated in loans globally among all categories, including personal, home, credit card, and more. It claims that at least $1 trillion goes to whoever originates and services the credit.\nUpstart offers a better and cheaper experience for everyone involved along the service line, which is how it has entered this space and captured market share. Since it started, customer acquisition costs have been halved despite sales growing fivefold, it has reduced its workforce by 66%, and it approves loans at 36% lower rates.\nAs it continues to train its models with more data points, they're improving, offering an even better value proposition. And as it continues to enter new categories, the opportunity expands. Originations from its newest product, a home equity line of credit, increased ninefold from last year in the second quarter.\nA better entry point\nUpstart stock had risen to astronomical valuations before it plunged, but the price is looking reasonable today. It trades at a forward, 1-year P/E ratio of 25 and a price-to-sales ratio of 7. That gives it room to expand as the market gains more confidence in its chances.\nThe market found what to worry about in the second quarter update despite the strong performance, including Upstart holding too many loans on its books, the health of its funding pipeline, and an outlook that included a lowering of full-year net interest income. But if you can zoom out and focus on the bigger picture, Upstart could be a lot bigger and more profitable over the next three years.\nIt's hard to come up with a potential growth rate over the next three years because the business is in flux. Last year at this time, revenue decreased 6% from the year before. But interest rates are likely to keep coming down, and Upstart's improvements make it likely that it will get more business as they do. If it can manage a compound annual growth rate of 30% over the next three years, revenue would more than double, and keeping the price-to-sales ratio constant, so would the stock.\nShould you buy stock in Upstart right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Upstart, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Upstart wasn’t one of them.

Their research shows 20% of employees experience it frequently, and 34% occasionally.\nUnlike quiet quitting, quiet cracking isn’t immediately visible but is equally harmful. Disengaged employees cost the global economy $8.8 trillion annually, according to Gallup.\nWhat is quiet cracking?\nWhile quiet quitting refers to workers who purposely slack off at a job they no longer want, quiet cracking refers to those who “gradually become mired in feeling both unappreciated by managers and closed off from career advancement while doing work they otherwise like,” according to an article from Inc.\nOr, as TalentLMS puts it, people who feel “some kind of workplace funk.”\nIt’s a deeper, harder-to-detect burnout where workers silently struggle under ongoing pressure. Those affected feel less valued and less confident about their future at work. Employees don’t always recognize the warning signs until they’re “spinning their wheels doing jobs they’re losing interest in yet stick with, fearing it will be too difficult to find a new one,” according to Inc.\nThe trends impacting quiet cracking, and how to mitigate them\nThe TalentLMS survey of 1,000 U.S. employees found that top concerns include:\nEconomic uncertainty\nWorkload and job expectations\nPoor leadership or uncertain company direction\nLayoffs or restructuring\nLack of career advancement opportunities\nTo address quiet cracking, the first step is recognizing its causes — feeling stuck, unheard or uncertain about the future.\nAccording to Nikhil Arora, CEO of Epignosis, the solution is simple: Offer growth opportunities through learning, skill development, and open communication to re-engage employees.\nBut there are other possible solutions that can also be considered:\n1. Uncertainty and overload\nIt’s important to set expectations and balance workloads, since 29% of employees say their workload is unmanageable. Employers can help by auditing task distribution, setting clear expectations, and offering stress management tools. This helps employees regain a sense of purpose and momentum.\n2. Lack of recognition and growth\nEmployees experiencing quiet cracking are 152% more likely to feel undervalued, according to the TalentLMS survey. Regularly recognizing contributions is a simple yet powerful way to boost morale and engagement.\n3. Few learning or career advancement opportunities\nEmployees who received training in the past year feel 140% more secure in their roles, according to HR Digest. To combat stagnation, employers should invest in structured learning paths, mentorship, and clear communication about growth opportunities — even when resources are limited.\nTalentLMS recommends that employers “double down on learning and development, with structured, ongoing learning paths.”\nRead more: Nervous about the stock market? Gain potential quarterly income through this $1B private real estate fund — even if you’re not a millionaire. Here’s how to get started with as little as $10\nWhat employees and employers can do\nEmployees noticing quiet cracking should discuss workload and expectations with their managers, suggest morale-boosting ideas and seek development opportunities. If improvements don’t happen, they may need to consider leaving.\nEmployers can combat disengagement by auditing engagement efforts, addressing gaps in support and recognition, and implementing regular feedback and learning programs.\nQuiet cracking is a business risk that undermines productivity, creativity and loyalty — making it crucial to act early.\nCreate a financial cushion\nTo prepare for any career shift, employees need to build a financial safety cushion, including an emergency fund. Having such savings in place offers flexibility — whether to take time to plan your next career move, explore new opportunities or simply leave a toxic work environment without immediate financial stress.\nThere are a few ways to get started on sewing together you financial cushion. If your checking account is flush with cash, one option it to develop an emergency fund using a high yield savings account to take advantage of compound interest. It's also often a good idea to start investing as soon as possible so your money can develop in the market.\nAn easy way to get started is by automatically investing your spare change with Acorns.\nHow it works is simple: Acorns automatically rounds up your everyday purchases to the nearest dollar and invests the difference into a diversified portfolio of ETFs. In other words, each transaction, whether it’s your daily coffee or a trip to the grocery store, contributes to building your savings.\nFor example, if you grab a $9.62 slice of pizza late at night, Acorns will round it up to $10 and invest the 38-cent difference — all before your head even hits the pillow. These small amounts add up over time.\nAcorns is also offering an extra $20 for those who sign up with a recurring deposit.\nAnother long-term strategy for developing wealth is to explore investing in real estate through assets such as the $34.9 trillion U.S. home equity market.\nFor accredited investors, Homeshares gives access to this massive real estate market segment — a space that’s historically been the exclusive playground of institutional investors.\nWith a minimum investment of $25,000, investors can gain direct exposure to hundreds of owner-occupied homes in top U.S. cities through their U.S. Home Equity Fund without the headaches of buying, owning or managing property.\nWith risk-adjusted target returns ranging from 14% to 17%, this approach can provide an effective, hands-off way to invest in owner-occupied residential properties across regional markets.\nOnce you’ve established your asset base, the next step is managing it to secure more financial flexibility. After all, quiet cracking can happen at all levels of the income spectrum, even in high-paying positions.\nMaking your wealth work for you can make it easier to exit a high-stress, low-fulfillment environment and prioritize your well-being, or allow you to take the time to find an alternative.\nTo do so, you’ll probably need expert guidance across all areas of your wealth — and that’s where the trusted team of financial planners at Range can come in.\nFor high-earning professionals or households making over $200,000, Range offers a smart, streamlined way to manage your full financial life — especially your real estate investments.\nThrough a strategic partnership with Engineered Tax Services, Range members receive free cost segmentation analysis and discounted cost segmentation studies. Range advisors will then use the study as part of a member's tax planning and strategy.\nCost segmentation shortens depreciation timelines — from the standard 27.5–39 years down to just 5–15 years—allowing you to claim significantly larger tax deductions sooner and keep more money in your pocket. Note that only investment properties qualify for segmentation studies.\nRange also delivers proactive advice across your entire financial life — not just real estate or taxes\nFrom stock options and tax strategies to real estate and big-picture planning, Range integrates it all under one roof.

The stock is up over 100% in the last 12 months, but still has not eclipsed previous highs after going through a brutal drawdown in 2022. At the same time, business performance has been rock-solid if not stellar, as management keeps adding new commerce tools and attracting new businesses to join the platform.\nWith Shopify stock still down from all-time highs, should you buy shares in 2025 for your portfolio? Here's what the numbers say.\nSteady global expansion\nAs a software and payments provider for online businesses, Shopify has grown to dominate the North American market. Now, it is moving internationally.\nLast quarter, growth in payments volume for its European division was 42%, outpacing overall growth. The company has built up a best-in-class set of tools for entrepreneurs and businesses of all sizes to sell and process payments online. Last quarter, even Starbucks signed a deal with Shopify, which shows the capabilities of the platform for online shopping.\nOverall revenue grew 31% year over year in the quarter, with strong growth expected for the rest of the year. Profit margins remain strong, with free cash flow margins of 16% in the quarter. This combination of growth and profitability is impressive and the key reason why Shopify's stock has soared in the last 12 months.\nAs more and more businesses sign up for Shopify's software tools and payment processing, the more growth Shopify will achieve. Add new features such as advertising and the Shop Pay application for consumers, and it looks like growth will continue for many years into the future.\nAI, crypto, and new products\nShopify is embracing new technologies as a way to leverage more usage from its business customers. It now has two artificial intelligence (AI) services called Sidekick and Magic that help analyze trends for a business, create content, and marketing products. Providing more value for enterprises will help customers stay entrenched within the Shopify ecosystem, leading to revenue growth and pricing power.\nWhat's more, Shopify is now beginning to expand and accept more forms of payment, such as Circle's stablecoin USDC. This should help with cross-border transactions and make it easier for shoppers who want to pay in different ways on Shopify's e-commerce storefronts. It will not only help drive new payment growth (which directly translates to revenue for Shopify), but also adoption of shopping across borders.", "content_hash": "6b6c8e62611b666fccf458f631564318", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

On July 22, Bernstein SocGen Group reiterated an ‘Outperform’ rating on the stock and raised the price target to €28 from €27. The positive stance follows the stock’s remarkable strength year to date.\nThe Irish airline continues to deliver solid results by benefiting from fare growth. Fares have increased compared to both 2023 and 2024, attributed to high demand for revenge travel. The high travel demand has resulted in a 9.24% increase in revenue and a 28.86% improvement in the gross profit margin. In June, the airline carried 19.9 million passengers, marking 3% year-over-year increase, affirming the strong demand.\nIn addition, Ryanair has been effective in cost control, with unit costs excluding fuel increasing by just 1.6% amid robust revenue growth. While Bernstein expects non-fuel costs to increase by between 3% and 4% for the year, the lower fuel costs are expected to help offset this increase. Therefore, total cost growth is likely to be below management guidance.\nRyanair Holdings plc (NASDAQ:RYAAY) is an Irish airline holding company that provides low-fare, short-haul passenger airline services to destinations with a network connecting over 240 destinations in more than 40 countries. In addition to its core flight operations, the company also offers various ancillary services, including car hire, travel insurance, and accommodation, through its website and mobile app.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of RYAAY as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Peers like Sweetgreen (SG) and Chipotle (CMG) both reported a second straight quarter of same-store sales declines in Q2 as demand for the trusty lunch bowls of choice for America's white-collar workforce waned.\n\"We do see what I would classify as a macroeconomic fog around the consumer that they're trying to navigate through, and that has the consumer less front-footed, less ebullient, less forward-leaning than they were, say, this time last year,\" Cava CEO Brett Schulman told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday.\nSame-store sales at Cava rose 2.1% in the second quarter, a deceleration from the double-digit growth in each of the prior three quarters. Analysts expected the company to post same-store sales closer to 6%.\nAt Chipotle, same-store sales fell 4% in the second quarter, a larger drop than the 2.3% fall seen in the year's first quarter.\nCEO Scott Boatwright told investors it was due to \"ongoing volatility in our trends in the consumer environment,\" which prompted the company to cut its full-year same-store sales forecast.\nSweetgreen posted the steepest decline among the three, with same-store sales falling 7.6% in the quarter.\nCo-founder and CEO Jonathan Neman said it was \"pretty obvious that the consumer is not in a great place overall\" on a call with investors.\nThe \"pressure on consumer spending for many of our consumers has persisted longer than we expected,\" he added. Shares of the salad chain fell more than 20% on the news.\nShares of Chipotle are down more than 25% this year, while Cava stock has lost over 35%. Sweetgreen stock has fallen nearly 70%.\nA challenge for these chains, in part, is lapping a strong 2024.\n\"The backdrop of the restaurant environment has not changed that dramatically since last year,\" Bank of America analyst Sara Senatore said, noting these fast-casual players \"can't take massive share every year.\"\nAt Cava, Schulman said the current quarter has shown signs of a pickup in sales and that the company is \"encouraged by what we're seeing in the exit rate of the quarter.\"\nStill, all three brands are considering a mix of more carefully curated menus and emphasizing value in an effort to win back sales at a time when consumers seem keen to scrutinize their budgets more closely.\nCava, for instance, is introducing chicken shawarma in September and cinnamon sugar pita chips later on this year, and is testing salmon.

The largest private-equity firms and other asset managers are salivating at the opportunity to pitch this untapped market of retirement savers.\nPrivate assets encompass a range of investments that do not trade on a public exchange. Examples include hedge funds, private equity, private credit and infrastructure.\nThe case for private assets is they can provide a buffer against inflation — plus steady returns. The downsides include high fees, illiquidity and complexity.\nThe nation’s biggest asset managers welcome the executive order. They want to develop funds that make private assets easier for people to buy, and argue that the added diversification serves savers’ best interests.\nLarry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock BLK, says retirement savers should replace the traditional 60% stocks/40% bonds asset-allocation model with a 50/30/20 split: 50% stocks, 30% bonds and 20% private assets.\nShould you be excited about this widening menu of investment choices? It depends on whom you ask.\nSome investment professionals like the idea of making private assets more available to more people.\n“Historically, a number of private-market strategies have produced higher performance and additional diversification in defined-benefit pensions,” says Peter von Lehe, head of investment solutions and strategy at Neuberger Berman. “It’s appropriate that a broader range of investors have access to private assets in their defined-contribution plans because of the potential for return and diversification that these long-term investments can provide.”\nHowever, von Lehe cautions that these investments are illiquid and “have a higher degree of complexity.” He says his “most appropriate use case” for private-market investments is through professionally managed target-date funds or other funds that allocate a percentage of defined-contribution money to these complex but potentially more lucrative alternatives.\nFinancial advisers have differing views on the role of private assets in client portfolios. Steven Roge, a certified financial planner in Bohemia, N.Y., says private markets are not for everyone.\n“It’s for people in the wealth-accumulation phase, say 40 to 50 years old, who have a long time horizon and a high risk tolerance,” Roge says. “And they have to be sophisticated enough to understand it. We know if they don’t understand it, they may not stick with it.”\nOf the firm’s 300 clients, he says that “only about a dozen” fit the bill for adding private-market assets to their retirement accounts.\nEven with the expanded investment options that may result from the White House’s action, Roge remains a fan of passive strategies for most investors. “Indexing is how they will win over the long run,” he says. “But some clients want something that’s special and different” as they seek market-beating returns.\nGiven the illiquidity of private assets, Roge anticipates setting expectations for those clients who tend to monitor their portfolio daily — and who engage in frequent trading. “These private investments may only price four times a year,” Roge says. “That’s not enough action for certain clients who track their portfolio like a hawk.”\nIn his personal portfolio, Roge uses private markets — especially private equity — to diversify his holdings. He says he allocates about 25% to alternative assets. “It helps me sleep at night knowing my portfolio isn’t being pushed around by the volatility of public markets,” he says.\nRoge adds that he is not concerned about the current high valuations of private-equity funds. “The valuations [of private-equity funds] are more realistic than the erratic valuations we see in public markets on a daily basis,” he says.\nOther advisers are more skeptical of the White House executive order.\n“It’s less being done out of interest for the general public and more for private industry lobbying the [Trump] administration,” says Alex Ruda, an adviser in Silver Spring, Md.\nThe executive order undoubtedly pleases asset managers and private-equity firms. For years, they’ve wanted to attract retirement savers’ money. These savers bear primary responsibility for managing their 401(k) compared with today’s older retirees, many of whom receive employer-funded defined-benefit pensions. While some younger savers enjoy picking their investments, others dread it.\n“The average American worker isn’t equipped to navigate these complex [private-market] investments,” Ruda says. “And they may fall prey to a little performance chasing given where we are in the market cycle” — as private markets have outperformed publicly traded stocks since 2000.\nRuda feels so strongly about not incorporating private assets into client portfolios that he’s willing to forgo newcomers who express such interest.\n“If I wanted to broaden my client base, I’d have to play to what they want,” he says. “But I don’t have to do that. So I’d say to them, ‘I’m not the best fit.’”", "content_hash": "22cb991d63149aa85c5d3938ad09534c", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Zillow anticipates this seasonal pattern will repeat this year after a “lackluster spring” during which buyers didn’t show up.\nA fall with high inventory and fewer buyers means that if you’re in the market for a new home, “you’re likely to have more time to decide on your options,” Ng said. “You have time to really consider if that home is the right fit for you.”\nWith fewer buyers, you’re also less likely to endure a bidding war for the home you want and you may have more negotiating power.\nSome sellers are lowering prices\nIn some markets, prices aren’t rising as quickly as they have been over the past few years.\nHome values across the U.S. grew by 45.3% between February 2020 to 2025, Zillow reported earlier this year — a rate that’s more than double the historic rate of increase.", "content_hash": "bf1a0f291e0bf708b2de754cbcc988b8", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

He emphasized that despite the froth, today’s market is more rational.\nCramer drew attention to the irrationality in recent IPOs like Circle, Figma, and Bullish, which have witnessed significant gains since their launch.\nOn CNBC, he also noted Oklo Inc., a firm with ambitions to construct a compact nuclear reactor powered by nuclear waste, whose stock has surged 247% year-to-date.\n“Flying cars, supercharged crypto ETFs, secretive companies that consult in magical ways, all irrational. I could go on and on,” Cramer said. “Is the widespread irrationality a reason to sell down your positions in perfectly rational stocks? Absolutely not.”\nAlso Read: Jim Cramer Has Blunt Message for Fed Chair Powell After July Job Numbers Tanked\nOn the other hand, Cramer pointed to Amazon Inc.

Cramer’s previous comments about Circle Internet Group (NYSE:CRCL) have outlined that while it does have the benefit of being an early mover in the industry, the lead might not last due to no competitive advantage. He maintained the sentiment this time as well:\n“Well I just think, I still believe and I know that Circle, does not like my analysis, necessarily. They’re . .actually very forthcoming guys and they have a good rap. But, I just think that other companies can do it. They do, David, have a tremendous first mover advantage. And it does matter. Coinbase did too, I mean it’s just first mover advantage.\nHere are his previous thoughts about Circle Internet Group (NYSE:CRCL):\n“Next up, the larger deal was Circle Internet Group. The IPO market was starting to heat up… by the time Circle came public in early June. But even though Circle upsized its deal significantly and raised its offer price range and then still priced well above the high end of the range, it wasn’t ambitious enough. Deal priced at 31, but the stock opened for trading at 69. Within three weeks, it was nearly at 300. It’s since cooled off around, they’ve come down to 165, but that’s still probably way too high. I think winners from CoreWeave rolled their take into Circle and turned it into a meme stock.”\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of CRCL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

He has previously threatened sanctions on Moscow and secondary sanctions on countries such as China and India that buy Russian oil if no moves are made to end the Ukraine war.\n\"This will mean Russian oil will continue to flow undisturbed and this should be bearish for oil prices,\" said ICIS analyst Ajay Parmar. \"It is worth noting that we think the impact of this will be minimal though and prices will likely see only a small dip in the very near term as a result of this news.\"\nThe oil market will wait for developments from a meeting in Washington on Monday between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

Werner Ponikwar, chief executive of Thyssenkrupp Nucera, on August 13 said the company has been in discussions with stakeholders in its U.S. hydrogen projects and would cancel any that are no longer deemed viable due to tax and spending changes from the U.S. government. Ponikwar noted that global demand for green hydrogen, which is produced using renewable energy resources, has been curtailed as governments sort out what President Trump's policies, including elimination of tax credits for low-carbon energy sources, mean for the hydrogen industry. \"We have sorted out all projects that have less chance of being realized due to the new framework conditions in the U.S.,\" Ponikwar said in a media call Wednesday after the company's earnings call with investors. Ponikwar noted that the administration's tax and spending rules are making it more difficult to develop clean energy projects in the U.S., particularly by phasing out renewable energy tax credits after 2026 if projects have not started construction. Ponikwar did say, though, that a revision in the deadline to year-end 2027 for projects to start construction could keep some U.S. projects in development, particularly those already in advanced stages. \"We are convinced that the hydrogen electrolysis market continues to offer enormous potential,\" Ponikwar said. The executive said Thyssenkrupp Nucera will continue to be active in the U.S., though it will use resources \"for other purposes\" if hydrogen projects are canceled. Thyssenkrupp Nucera is the world's leading provider of electrolysis technology, the process used to produce hydrogen. The company said it has improved its revenue and profit year-over-year through the first nine months of its fiscal year, and is on track to achieve its financial targets for the full fiscal year. “Thanks to its business model and strict cost management, Thyssenkrupp Nucera continues to generate positive free cash flow even in this difficult market for hydrogen solutions. This underscores our stable financial position,\" said Dr. Stefan Hahn, chief financial officer of Thyssenkrupp Nucera. The company in June of this year strengthened its strategic technology portfolio with the acquisition of a modular high-pressure electrolysis solution from Danish company Green Hydrogen Systems (GHS). The high-pressure electrolysis developed by GHS operates highly efficiently at up to 35 bar operating pressure, which is considered advantageous for certain industrial applications where hydrogen is required in compressed form. Thyssenkrupp Nucera previously has entered into a strategic collaboration with Germany's Fraunhofer IKTS on high-temperature electrolysis technology, known as SOEC. A pilot production plant for SOEC stacks was opened in Arnstadt, Germany, in May. \"By further expanding our strategic technology portfolio, we at Thyssenkrupp Nucera are enabling hydrogen solutions with optimized levelized cost of hydrogen. This makes green hydrogen more attractive,” said Klaus Ohlig, the company's chief technology officer. Officials said Thyssenkrupp Nucera provided technology for about 1.5 GW of hydrogen production last year, with similar or better growth expected this year. \"Europe is currently the most promising market. We are currently working on engineering orders totaling 1.5 gigawatts of electrolysis capacity,\" said Ponikwar. \"This clearly shows that thyssenkrupp nucera's pipeline of green hydrogen projects is maturing and industrial projects are progressing. We are therefore looking ahead with confidence.\" Said Ponikwar: \"Green hydrogen, a climate-friendly energy source, is and will remain the central pillar of the decarbonization strategies required by industry worldwide. The growth prospects for the hydrogen market remain intact, despite the challenges currently facing the global hydrogen market. With more than 60 years of experience in electrolysis technology, we at Thyssenkrupp Nucera have the necessary technological expertise.\" Ponikwar added, \"although large-scale projects naturally have longer development times ... we remain one of the most sought-after partners on the market.” —Darrell Proctor is a senior editor for POWER.", "content_hash": "0b7c22af31ae84dc68edad53b07b1234", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Skeptics point to Palantir's lofty valuation as the cornerstone of the bear argument, as the stock trades at levels encroaching on dot-com-era bubble territory. While that's true, such concerns haven't stopped the stock from repeatedly notching new highs.\nI think there is a far subtler detail surrounding Palantir stock that rarely gets discussed. If history is any guide, it could set the stage for an epic reversal.\nIs now the time to sell Palantir stock? Read on to find out.\nValuation that redefines what it means to be \"expensive\"\nDuring the late 1990s, internet companies were often measured by non-financial metrics based on user engagement. Businesses such as Amazon, Cisco, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Yahoo! were valued based on eyeballs and clicks rather than sales and profits. At the peak of dot-com euphoria, many of these internet pioneers traded at price-to-sales (P/S) multiples between 30 and 40 -- considered unsustainably high at the time.\nPalantir has completely redefined how next-generation technology businesses are valued, though. As of Aug. 12, Palantir boasts a market cap of nearly $444 billion -- larger than Salesforce, SAP, and Adobe, which are far more mature, diversified businesses. Perhaps even more striking is that Palantir's P/S of 137 exists in its own stratosphere -- completely outside the dimensions of its software-as-a-service (SaaS) peers.\nSome argue that traditional valuation methodologies such as P/S or earnings multiples don't fully capture Palantir's true value or its full potential. Instead, they urge investors to focus on industry-specific and financially engineered metrics such as the Rule of 40 to see just how \"cheap\" Palantir stock really is.\nI think this argument is flawed. There's a more telling metric -- and one that almost nobody talks about -- that makes me think Palantir stock could be on a collision course with history.\nIs \"smart money\" trying to tell us something?\nThe chart below tracks buying activity in Palantir stock across institutional investors since its initial public offering (IPO) in late 2020.\nInitially, there was a wave of \"smart money\" buying during early 2021, which was met with substantial selling during the latter half of that year. Palantir's institutional ownership picked up again following the company's splash into the AI realm a couple of years ago. It's this dynamic where I think the retail investing crowd is missing the bigger picture and buying into a mirage.\nAs the chart above illustrates, there is a convergence happening between the institutional buying and selling in Palantir stock. When net demand tightens -- meaning that buying is no longer materially higher than selling -- it takes less downside pressure to inspire a precipitous drop in share price. I see the dynamics illustrated in the chart above as an inflection point for Palantir stock.\nIn addition, banks, wealth management firms, mutual funds, and hedge funds all have different priorities. Many of these institutions are required to hold large-cap stocks for benchmarking purposes, not because they think the stock is undervalued or because they carry some \"diamond hands\" conviction that shares are going higher despite abnormal volatility in the present. When a stock becomes an abnormally high weight relative to the overall portfolio, institutional investors often trim their exposure. This is known as portfolio rebalancing.\nThis scenario can be perfectly explained in the video clip above in which mutual fund billionaire Ron Baron describes his fiduciary responsibility to take profits from time to time in even his highest-conviction positions, such as Tesla. If a stock becomes overinflated, institutions will use this market liquidity as a mechanism to sell their shares to retail at a premium. This dynamic is more colloquially referred to leaving retail \"holding the bag\" when the hype narrative fades.\nWhile I can't say for certain where Palantir stock is headed, my thought is that fund investors are going to pressure portfolio managers to trim exposure to Palantir and take some money off the table, much like what Baron experienced. I think the pressure will be rooted in the anticipation of a valuation reset for Palantir given its frothy positioning relative to peers.\nWill history repeat itself?\nAlthough history is not always a perfect predictor, I think it's a strong barometer in this case. While it's virtually impossible to pick the perfect time to sell a stock, I think there are some compelling -- and overlooked -- details that suggest Palantir stock could be headed lower from current price points sooner than many bulls expect.\nShould you buy stock in Palantir Technologies right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

He was telling the business world that some of the most enduring competitive advantages are forged not in corporate boardrooms, but in grit, frugality, and an obsession with customer value.\nIt’s a tale that remains as relevant to modern investors and entrepreneurs as it was four decades ago. The story exemplifies just what it is that Buffett looks for in an acquisition and in a business leader, and can help investors understand what they should look for when investing in a company.\nIn 1917, at just 23 years old, Rose Blumkin talked her way past a border guard to escape Russia and start a new life in America. She had no formal education, didn’t speak English, and began with nothing.\nBy 1937, after years of selling used clothing, she saved $500 — enough to open her dream business: Nebraska Furniture Mart. Facing entrenched, well-capitalized competitors, she relied on unconventional tactics: radical frugality, relentless price competition, and legal resilience. When cash ran out early on, she sold furniture and appliances from her own home to pay creditors in full.\nRose constantly undercut competitors so dramatically that they tried to block her supply lines, pressuring manufacturers not to sell to her. When she was dragged into court for allegedly “violating Fair Trade laws,” she won every case, and even sold the judge $1,400 worth of carpet after proving her pricing worked.\nBy the early 1980s, her single store was generating over $100 million in annual sales — outselling all competitors in Omaha combined.\nWhy Buffett Couldn’t Resist\nBuffett famously said, “I’d rather wrestle grizzlies than compete with Mrs. B.” From his perspective, Nebraska Furniture Mart had the trifecta of business excellence:\nSavvy purchasing: sourcing inventory better and cheaper than competitors.\nLean operations: expense ratios so low that rivals couldn’t imagine them.\nCustomer loyalty: passing on savings instead of padding margins.\nIt was, in Buffett’s words, “the ideal business — one built upon exceptional value to the customer that in turn translates into exceptional economics for its owners.”\nBuffett purchased 90% of the business in 1983, leaving family members in key management roles. Mrs. B, then 90 years old, kept showing up seven days a week to personally sell carpet.\nLessons for Modern-Day Entrepreneurs\nWhile the business world has shifted from brick-and-mortar showrooms to e-commerce platforms and digital-first marketing, Mrs. B’s principles remain timeless:\nObsess over value, not hype: In an era of viral brands and influencer marketing, sustainable growth still depends on giving customers more than they expect for the price they pay.\nOperate lean: Venture-backed startups often burn through capital chasing scale, but Mrs. B’s model shows how low overhead and disciplined purchasing can create enduring competitive moats.\nPlay the long game: Mrs. B fought legal battles, endured supplier pushback, and navigated multiple economic downturns, yet never compromised on her value proposition.\nLead from the floor: Even as an owner, she remained deeply involved in sales, reinforcing company culture through example.\nLessons for Modern-Day Investors\nMrs. B’s story also speaks to investors looking for the next great compounder. Buffett didn’t buy Nebraska Furniture Mart for its short-term profits; he bought it for its unbeatable market position and operational culture. The story is the moat. They grew because people loved the business, and people loved the business because they always strived to do right by their customers. Integrity, discipline, and customer-first thinking matter as much as — if not more than — the financial statements.\nBuffett notes that capital allocation in a bad industry is like “struggling in quicksand.” In other words, even a great operator can be dragged down if the sector is fundamentally flawed. People need furniture now just as much as they needed it 100 years ago, and just as much as they will need it in 100 years.\nRecognizing a moat is crucial. The store’s cost advantages and buying power made it difficult, if not impossible, for competitors to win customers without losing money. This means Mrs. B was going to be the leader in the area, and nobody around could change that.\nWhy the Story Still Matters in 2025\nIn a global economy dominated by online retail giants like Amazon (AMZN) and fast-scaling disruptors in every sector, Mrs. B’s example is a reminder that moats are built in the details: buying better, spending less, and treating customers better than anyone else.\nWhether you’re a startup founder in fintech or a private equity investor looking for durable businesses, the lesson is clear: find — or build — the Mrs. B of your industry, and you’ll have a business worth owning for decades.\nBuffett bought into Nebraska Furniture Mart for one reason: he recognized a business so good that price almost didn’t matter. For modern investors and entrepreneurs, the challenge — and opportunity — is to recognize the next Mrs. B before everyone else does\nOn the date of publication, Caleb Naysmith did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The Wilmington-based chipmaker builds the backbone of our digital age, designing semiconductors that power everything from hyperscale data centers to 5G networks and advanced automotive systems.\nThe year began with fireworks, as Marvell delivered record revenue and earnings in Q1, propelled by AI’s insatiable appetite and Marvell’s surging custom silicon business. Now, all eyes are on Aug. 28, when the infrastructure semiconductor solutions leader unveils its Q2 results. Management is projecting robust growth, with investors eager for updates on AI momentum, new product rollouts, and market expansion plans.\nThough MRVL stock sits nearly 40% below its 52-week high of $127.48, its 21% rally over the past three months signals that momentum is building, and Aug. 28 could mark another defining chapter in Marvell’s climb.\nAbout Marvell Stock\nMarvell, founded in 1995, set out to accelerate how the world moves and processes data. This Delaware-based company, valued at $67.2 billion by market capitalization, designs semiconductor solutions that reach from the heart of the data center to the farthest edge of the network. Today, with AI demand surging, Marvell’s technology powers high-speed networking, advanced storage, and 5G connectivity, quietly driving the backbone of our digital world.\nMarvell’s shares have been on a roller coaster worthy of Wall Street’s highlight reel. Over the past 52 weeks, MRVL stock climbed 23.8%, peaking at $127.48 earlier this year before tumbling to a bruising year-to-date (YTD) low of $47.08 in April. Down 28.2% in 2025, the chipmaker became a short-seller’s darling, until momentum flipped.\nOver the past three months, MRVL has surged 21.2%, up 9.1% in the last month alone, and now sits nearly 70% above its lows. Meanwhile, the 14-day RSI is just above 60, signaling healthy buying interest. This rebound is not just technical – bullish management guidance, upbeat analyst calls, and Marvell’s ambitious goal of seizing 20% of the custom AI chip market by 2028 are fueling the rally.\nMarvell’s pullback in 2025 has opened a rare lane in the crowded chip space. Priced at approximately 36 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and 11.58 times sales - well below its historical averages - this AI-driven chipmaker is priced like it is on clearance, despite heavyweight growth prospects.\nFueled by booming demand in custom chips, high-speed memory, and optical tech, Marvell’s data center momentum and hyperscaler alliances make its valuation look primed for takeoff.\nA Closer Look at Marvell’s Mixed Q1 Earnings Report\nMarvell’s fiscal 2026 Q1 earnings results, released on May 29, was the kind of report that keeps investors leaning forward in their seats. The chipmaker’s top and bottom lines beat Wall Street’s projections, with revenue surging 63% year over year (YoY) to $1.9 billion, well above its own guidance midpoint. Adjusted EPS came in at $0.62, rocketing 158% annually.\nThe primary growth driver was the Data Center segment, which generated $1.44 billion, 76% of total revenue, reflecting a 76% annual increase and 5% sequential growth. This momentum was fueled by high-volume production of custom AI silicon programs and strong electro-optics shipments supporting AI and cloud infrastructure. Enterprise Networking and Carrier Infrastructure each advanced 14% sequentially, continuing their post-pandemic recovery.\nHowever, other areas softened. Consumer revenue declined 29% sequentially, though management anticipates a 50% rebound in Q2, supported by seasonal gaming demand. Automotive and industrial revenue fell 12% sequentially, with a flat outlook for Q2.\nThe balance sheet is looking healthy, with Marvell ending Q1 with $885.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and a conservative debt-to-equity ratio of 0.3x. Shareholder returns remained a priority, with $52 million paid in dividends and a sharp increase in stock buybacks to $340 million, up from $200 million in the prior quarter.\nAI All the Way\nBuilding on its strong Q1 results, Marvell is doubling down on its AI-led growth strategy. CEO Matt Murphy says AI now drives most of its data center revenue, with bigger gains ahead. As part of a broader strategic realignment, Marvell is selling its Automotive Ethernet business to Infineon (IFX.D.DX) for $2.5 billion, the deal is expected to close later this year.\nOn the innovation side, Marvell bolstered its custom silicon platform through a new collaboration with Nvidia, integrating NVLink Fusion into its XPU roadmap to enable more scalable AI architectures. It also rolled out a multi-die packaging platform, already in production, using its interposer technology for faster, cheaper system designs.\nCEO Murphy sees Marvell at the heart of the custom AI infrastructure boom, with its silicon business set to fuel growth in Q2 and beyond. While the company is all set for the Q2 report on Aug. 28, after the bell, the management expects $2 billion in revenue (plus or minus 5%), up 57% YoY, fueled by AI momentum, expanded custom silicon programs, and stronger networking infrastructure. Additionally, adjusted EPS is estimated to land somewhere around $0.67 (plus or minus $0.05) per share, more than doubling last year’s figure.\nAnalysts tracking Marvell anticipate its Q2 revenue to rise to $2 billion, with adjusted EPS rising 325% YoY to $0.51. Looking further ahead, fiscal 2026 EPS is anticipated to surge by 133.7% YoY to $2.15, before rising by another 31.6% annually to $2.83 in fiscal 2027.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for Marvell Stock?\nAnalysts maintain a decidedly favorable view of this chip stock, assigning it an overall “Strong Buy” rating. Of the 32 analysts covering the stock, 24 recommend a “Strong Buy,” two stick to a “Moderate Buy,” and the remaining six are staying on the sidelines with a “Hold” rating.\nMRVL stock’s mean price target of $92.17 hints at a 16.2% upside potential from where it’s trading now. The Street-high target of $149 implies the stock could rally as much as 87.8%.\nOn the date of publication, Sristi Suman Jayaswal did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s shares have entered a period of strong performance after the firm smoothed over its frictions with the Trump administration. It announced an additional $100 billion investment in American manufacturing, and the shares have gained 14.8% since CEO Tim Cook was well-received by President Trump in the White House. More recently, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)s App Store came under fire from Elon Musk after he accused the company of favoritism when it came to OpenAI. Musk believes that his Grok AI is being disadvantaged in the App Store and has sued Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Here is Cramer’s take on the affair:\n“It wasn’t clear, although, I would tell you that I don’t believe, I think that, it’s pay to play, to be at the top. I tried to load DoorDash today and Grubhub came up. Pay to play, above DoorDash, that’s the way it works. This is, did anyone say that this is, that there is like a Truth In Lending here or anything? You can do whatever you want.”\nPreviously, the CNBC TV host discussed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s share price performance and the potential drivers:\n“I kept hearing that Cook and the president didn’t get along because he wouldn’t commit to making the iPhone in the United States. The drum beat grew so loud that I even asked Tim in my private chat… is it possible for you to work with the president?… He came back and he said that he has good relations with the president…. Tim Cook, if he says the relationship is good, then it’s good, and that gave me the guts to tell you to stick with it. Now, with the stock at $220, nicely above where it was when the company reported, I need you to think about what has happened in the last 24 hours…\nCould Apple go from being the most expensive to being the cheapest, the best one for the phone companies to offer, so they can get new accounts? Isn’t that what the stock’s monstrous move from 203 to 220 in just two days is telling us?…\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Sure, high yields are attractive, but a company that has high yields and the ability to sustain them is worth its weight in gold. Even better if such companies have a good track record of increasing dividends, preferably consecutively.\nNow, there are groups of companies like Dividend Aristocrats and Kings that already offer the qualities I like. But that doesn't mean we need to limit ourselves to those top-shelf companies. Sometimes, there are dividend-paying gems exhibiting high growth, low payout ratios, and decent yields that are waiting on the sidelines.\nToday, I’ll be reviewing my list of notable dividend stocks to see which ones meet my stringent criteria for high yields and high growth.\nHow I Came Up With The Following Stocks\nAs usual, I fired up Barchart’s Stock Screener tool and used the following filters:\nAnnual Dividend Yield: Left blank so I can sort the list using this criterion.\nCurrent Analyst Rating & Number of Analysts: 3.5 (Moderate Buy) to 5 (Strong Buy), and 16 or above. This combination ensures I get companies that have Wall Street’s (generally) positive regard.\n5-Year Dividend Growth: 50% and above. This filter compares the company’s payouts from five years ago to the current ones. On average, a 50% growth rate represents a 10% growth annually, which is considered strong and sustainable for many mature businesses.\nDividend Payout Ratio: 65% or less. The payout ratio shows how much the company uses of its earnings to pay dividends. 65% is on the high end of what many consider the “healthy” range.\nWatchlists: As someone who loves dividend stocks, I maintain several dividend-centric watchlists that I now use for this search. These include the Dividend Contenders, Aristocrats, Kings, high-yield stocks, growth stocks, and monthly dividend stocks.\nI ran the screen and got 28 companies, which I then arranged from highest to lowest yields:\nNow, I’ll take the top three and discuss each one, starting with number one:\nBest Buy Company (BBY)\nFirst up is Best Buy Company (NYSE:BBY), a multinational consumer electronics retailer that sells a wide range of products, including computers, smartphones, televisions, home appliances, video games, and related accessories. The company has over 1000 stores in the US and Canada alone, and now operates an online platform that offers the same extensive product selection, along with convenient delivery, pickup, and customer support services.\nBest Buy currently pays 95 cents per share quarterly, which works out to $3.80 per year and around a 5.29% yield. Aside from the high yield, the company also boasts a relatively healthy dividend payout ratio of 59.14% and an 88% 5-year dividend growth rate. Even more impressive, the company has increased dividends since 2004, for 22 straight years. Three more years of increases, and Best Buy will become a Dividend Aristocrat!\nAnalysts also rate BBY stock a Moderate Buy.\nComcast Corp A (CMCSA)\nComcastCorporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is one of the biggest global media and technology companies in the United States, offering services that range from cable television and high-speed internet to wireless communications and home phone solutions. In the last few decades, it also started acquiring large-scale networks and communications providers, including NBCUniversal, Sky, and various regional sports and entertainment networks.\nThe company pays $1.32 in dividends annually, translating to around a 4% yield based on the stock's last closing price. Dividends have increased 93.65% in the last five years, while Comcast currently has an impressive 28.15% payout ratio despite its relatively high yield. It also has an 18-year dividend increase streak, and today, CMCAS stock has a Moderate Buy rating.\nRegions Financial Corp (RF)\nLast but not least is Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF), a banking and financial services company that operates primarily in the Southern and Midwestern United States. It offers a full range of services, including personal and business banking, mortgage and lending products, wealth management, and insurance solutions.\nRegions Financial has a long and storied history of paying dividends - since 1989. The company increased its payouts until it went stagnant between 2000 and 2004 at 33 cents quarterly, around the time when the dot-com bubble burst and the markets were recovering. It picked up the pace after that, but then the global financial crisis hit, and it was forced to cut dividends to 1 cent a share quarterly.\nSince 2013, however, the company has continued increasing its dividends, with the most recent one being $1.00 per share per year, which reflects around a 3.8% yield. Regions Financial has increased its dividend by 66.10% over the last five years, and its current dividend payout ratio is a healthy 41.16%. Meanwhile, analysts rate RF stock a Moderate Buy.\nFinal Thoughts\nLooking for long-term dividend stocks is not just about yields. You need to look at the company’s ability to maintain its payments, check if the current levels are at risk of cuts, and determine whether its financial performance, industry position, and growth prospects can support consistent dividend increases in the future.\nOn the date of publication, Rick Orford did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The move came as he announced at the White House that Apple would invest $100 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, adding to the $500 billion the company had announced in February.\nThe plaque was engraved with Trump’s name, a reference to Apple's U.S. manufacturing efforts, Cook’s signature and the phrase \"MADE IN USA.\"\nDon't Miss:\n-\nThe same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.\n-\nBill Gates Warned About Water Scarcity.

Cook said it was all designed by a former U.S. Marine who now works for Apple.\n\"Thank you very much, it’s fantastic,\" Trump said.\nCook’s gift may offer a masterclass on how to curry favor with the president, combining two things of apparent symbolic importance to Trump: gold and the military.\nFrom golden tweezers to gold merchandise and, most recently, the gold card visa, Trump’s love for gold is well documented.

You can invest today for just $0.30/share.\nBut Cook’s gift also adds to mounting legal and ethical concerns about Trump accepting gifts from foreign governments and business leaders seeking to curry favor. Still, the White House continues to deny any wrongdoing on the part of the president.\n\"Elected leaders and business titans from around the world are traveling to the Oval Office to make historic investments into America because of President Trump’s bold vision,\" White House spokesperson Davis Ingle told Axios. \"Often these leaders are eager to share gifts highlighting the exciting work they are doing.\"\nNonetheless, for Cook and Apple, the recent presentation has had the desired effect.

It has reshaped our understanding of what cars can be.\nArcher Aviation (ACHR), valued at $5.5 billion, is developing electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, which are essentially air taxis intended for short-distance urban and regional travel. Archer Aviation stock has gained just 2.3% in the year to date, underperforming the S&P 500 Index ($SPX), despite its massive 167% gain over the past 52 weeks. For this under-the-radar aerospace company to become “the Tesla of the skies,” it must do more than just make air taxis viable. It must also make them desirable and indispensable for daily travel.\nLet us find out how Archer Aviation is working on this, and if the stock is a buy now.\nAn Industry Moving From Ambition to Execution\nThe eVTOL industry was once considered futuristic. But it is rapidly becoming a reality. Archer’s flagship product is the Midnight aircraft. The company currently has six additional Midnight units in production, with three in final assembly, bringing the fleet to eight aircraft. These models have a production-ready four-bladed rear propeller design and are ready for certification flight testing or early commercial deployment.\nArcher is rapidly approaching the commercialization of its Midnight aircraft, signaling a critical period of progress in both civil and defense programs. In the second half of 2025, Archer intends to accelerate pilot and flight testing, expand performance parameters, and begin full eVTOL operations. Because the company has no revenue yet, it reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $119 million and an adjusted net loss of $114 million in the second quarter.\nPerhaps the most notable achievement for Archer is the U.S. government’s decision to showcase air taxis at the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics. It is the official exclusive air taxi provider for the event.\nArcher is not waiting for FAA approval to start monetizing Midnight. Through its Launch Edition Program, the company is delivering early aircraft to countries with more favorable regulatory environments, including the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, and Indonesia. These partnerships not only diversify Archer’s revenue streams, but also help to establish the business case for eVTOLs. In the UAE, the Midnight aircraft has already been delivered and is awaiting commercial flight authorization. This will help the company generate revenue. Analysts expect Archer to report revenue of $1.42 million in 2025, rising to $103.4 million by 2026.\nThe Challenges\nArcher ended the second quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, following a capital raise of $850 million in June. Despite strategic investments in manufacturing, certification, and defense programs, Archer maintained disciplined capital allocation. Furthermore, a growing multibillion-dollar order book from both government and commercial customers helps to strengthen the company’s position. Early launch deals abroad offer significant revenue potential before the full U.S. rollout.\nWithout a doubt, Archer is following Tesla’s leadto dominance by controlling manufacturing, developing proprietary technology, and pursuing both consumer and government markets. However, the challenges to eVTOL adoption differ. Infrastructure development, public trust, air traffic integration, and safety certification are challenges that Tesla has never encountered in the automotive industry.\nIf Archer can overcome these challenges, it will have established an industry with potentially fewer direct competitors than the crowded EV car market that Tesla is currently facing.\nWhat Is Wall Street Saying About Archer Aviation Stock?\nRecently, Canaccord Genuity analyst Austin Moeller reiterated his “Buy” rating on Archer Aviation stock with a price target of $13, citing the company’s strong production momentum and solid financial position. Moeller believes that by focusing on refining manufacturing processes and increasing efficiency, Archer is well-positioned to expand operations. Early revenue opportunities from Launch Edition customer evaluations strengthen Moeller’s belief in the company’s growth prospects.\nSeparately, H.C. Wainwright analyst Amit Dayal reiterated his “Buy” rating on the stock. Dayal stated that, in addition to its urban air mobility plans, Archer is expanding into the defense market through recent acquisitions and the development of a hybrid electric aircraft for long-range and military applications. With catalysts ahead, such as certification completion and the first passenger flights, Dayal believes the company is well-positioned to create meaningful value in the years to come.\nOverall, Archer Aviation stock is a “Moderate Buy” on Wall Street. Among the 10 analysts covering the stock, five rate it a “Strong Buy,” two say it is a “Moderate Buy,” and three rate it a “Hold.” The average target price of $12.39 is 25% above current levels. Plus, its Street-high estimate of $18 suggests the stock can rally around 82% over the next 12 months.\nThe Bottom Line\nIf Archer follows through on its promises, such as launching Olympic-scale air taxi operations, expanding its Launch Edition footprint, and entering defense markets, it has the potential to define the first generation of practical, profitable urban air mobility. If the company succeeds, flying cars will no longer be considered science fiction. Archer Aviation would have made this happen. Early investors who believe in the company’s potential and are willing to take on the short-term risk may profit handsomely once it reaches its full potential.\nOn the date of publication, Sushree Mohanty did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

This sum includes $149 million for the initial class-action lawsuit and an additional $28 million for the second one.\nThe first data breach, revealed in March 2024, impacted 73 million account holders, with hackers obtaining personal information and disseminating it on the dark web. A subsequent breach in July 2024 compromised the call and text records of almost all AT&T customers.\nAccording to the report by New York Post, the settlement is yet to receive approval, with a final hearing set for December 3 in the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Customers who had their data compromised can apply for compensation before the hearing.\nThey will be notified via an email from Kroll Settlement Administration and must submit a claim form by November 18.\nAlso Read: GameStop to Pay $4.5 Million Over Alleged Privacy Violations Involving Facebook Data Sharing\nCustomers affected by the March 2024 breach can claim up to $5,000, while those impacted by the July breach can claim up to $2,500. Customers who were affected by both breaches could be eligible for up to $7,500.\nAT&T will require evidence of losses associated with the breaches. Payouts are anticipated to commence by the end of the year, but may be postponed if appeals are lodged after the hearing.\nWhy It Matters: This settlement proposal comes as a significant development for AT&T customers who were affected by the data breaches.\nThe proposed compensation not only acknowledges the inconvenience and potential harm caused by the breaches, but also serves as a reminder of the importance of robust data security measures for companies handling sensitive customer information.\nThe outcome of the final hearing will be closely watched, as it could set a precedent for future data breach settlements.\nRead Next\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

He doesn't hold an MBA, and his public remarks often come in the form of unscripted, philosophical musings. Yet as CEO of data analytics powerhouse Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR), Karp has led the company's transformation from a secretive government contractor into a leading force in artificial intelligence (AI) adoption across the enterprise software landscape.\nWhat many investors once viewed as a niche corridor, the intersection of defense operations and AI has swiftly become fertile ground supporting Palantir's generational run. The company has secured some of the Department of Defense's (DOD) most complex, mission-critical contracts, worth billions of dollars, cementing its role as a trusted partner in national security.\nFollowing Palantir's monster Q2 earnings report earlier this month, Karp's confidence was on full display. During an interview on financial news program CNBC, he delivered a blunt message to Palantir's rivals: \"read 'em and weep.\"\nLet's unpack what Karp really meant and assess why investors in competing platforms such as BigBear.ai(NYSE: BBAI) can no longer afford to ignore Palantir's commanding lead in the AI defense arena.\nPalantir is setting the pace to become the AI backbone for military operations\nDuring the second quarter, Palantir's revenue surged 48% year over year to $1.0 billion. While that growth is impressive on its own, the finer details reveal just how deeply Palantir has embedded itself in the military operations pocket of the AI landscape.\nThe company's government segment grew 49% year over year, slightly outpacing overall growth. Drilling down further, Palantir's U.S. government revenue rose by an even stronger 53% -- reaching $426 million in the quarter. This momentum is supported by a string of high-profile Pentagon deals.\nIn March, Palantir partnered with defense contractorsNorthrop Grumman and L3Harris Technologies, along with autonomous systems specialist Anduril, in a $178 million U.S. Army deal to help build the Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node (TITAN) ground transportation system.\nJust months later, the Army extended its relationship with Palantir, awarding a $795 million extension to continue using the company's Maven Smart System(MSS) platform -- bringing the total deal value above $1.2 billion.\nMore recently, Palantir further strengthened its public sector footprint with two additional contracts: a multiyear contract with the Army worth up to $10 billion, as well as a separate award to help develop a surveillance system for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\nWhy is this important for BigBear.ai investors?\nDuring BigBear.ai's second-quarter earnings call, CEO Kevin McAleenan acknowledged that the company has \"seen disruptions in federal contracts from efficiency efforts this quarter, most notably in programs that support the U.S. Army, as they seek to consolidate and modernize their data architecture.\"\nGiven the details outlined above, there's a strong possibility that the \"disruptions\" McAleenan referenced reflect Palantir winning these contracts. While BigBear.ai operates in some of the same broad fields as Palantir, such as AI analytics and machine learning, I think the comparison between the two companies is increasingly lopsided.\nEach new government contract awarded to Palantir deepens its competitive moat. The company's Foundry and Gotham platforms are evolving into a comprehensive, integrated ecosystem for the public sector -- supporting a range of mission-critical needs.\nRather than true \"network effects,\" Palantir is enjoying a cumulative competitive edge that's compounding with each deployment of its software -- ultimately broadening the company's footprint, strengthening its relationships, and making the cost of switching to competing platforms more costly.\nThese dynamics have effectively given Palantir a mini-monopoly on certain pockets of public sector deal flow, beyond the capacities of traditional defense contractors specializing in manufacturing hardware or equipment.\nIs BigBear.ai stock a buy?\nKarp's soundbite wasn't just swagger, nor was it merely aimed at short-sellers who have been betting against Palantir for years. It was a direct shot at every competing platform.\nThe 2025 stock chart reflecting Palantir and BigBear.ai tells a very different story.\nPalantir has built steady momentum on the back of rising deal flow, translating directly into accelerating revenue and profitability. BigBear.ai, by contrast, has seen far more volatile price swings, with its moves often driven by hype and the hopeful narrative that it could one day become the \"next Palantir.\"\nThat outcome appears increasingly improbable. Each new government contract Palantir secures widens the gap between it and smaller rivals struggling to keep pace.\nFor investors seeking exposure to AI's role in military operations, Palantir offers a proven track record over speculative counterparts such as BigBear.ai, whose traction remains more aspirational than tangible.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

Chair Jerome Powell in remarks on Friday is expected to unveil the Fed’s new policy framework — the strategy it’ll use to achieve its inflation and employment goals.\nPowell may also drop some hints about the Fed’s thinking ahead of its September policy meeting. Officials have left interest rates on hold so far this year as they wait to see how the Trump administration’s tariffs impact the economy.\nWith inflation still above the Fed’s 2% goal and signs of a slowdown in the labor market, policymakers have become divided on when to resume rate cuts. Powell’s speech could give Fed watchers a fresh update on how much support there is to lower rates in September — at a time the Trump administration is piling on the pressure to start easing.\nData over the past week likely did little to shift opinions on inflation and the economy. The core consumer price index, which excludes food and fuel, rose in July by the most since the start of the year. Yet the cost of tariff-exposed goods didn’t rise as much as feared.\nA separate report on wholesale inflation suggested price pressures on companies are mounting, however. And a fresh read on retail sales showed American consumers flexed a bit more muscle over the past two months, though a decline in sentiment pointed to anxiety about inflation and the job market.\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n“Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has the opportunity to settle the speculation with his speech at the annual Jackson Hole Symposium (Friday). Last year, he used the gathering of central bankers to telegraph that the Fed was ready to cut rates. But the circumstances are different, and we don’t think he’ll be as frank this year.”\n— Anna Wong, Stuart Paul, Eliza Winger, Estelle Ou and Chris G. Collins, economists. For full analysis, click here\nThe global nature of the Jackson Hole conference also offers an opportunity for Powell’s peers to express their support amid persistent criticism from President Donald Trump. Central bank independence is likely to be a topic on the sidelines of the confab.\nA handful of economists will present new research papers during the meeting, and there’s usually a panel featuring heads of some of the world’s biggest central banks.\nElsewhere, central bankers in New Zealand are projected to cut rates in a bid to shore up the labor market. Inflation and retail sales data take top billing in the UK, while purchasing managers indexes for economies across the world will help shed light on the impact of US tariffs.\nClick here for what happened in the past week, and below is our wrap of what’s coming up in the global economy.\nUS and Canada\nThe US economic calendar lightens up in the coming week and will include several reports on the housing market. Cheaper borrowing costs would stoke demand in a residential real estate sector that’s been bogged down by low affordability.\nOn Tuesday, economists expect government figures to show a decline in US housing starts. National Association of Realtors data out Thursday are projected to show sales of previously owned homes hovering near a 15-year low.\nTariff machinations remain top of mind. Trade talks between the US and India scheduled for late this month may be postponed at Washington’s request, Indian media reported.\nFor more, read Bloomberg Economics’ full Week Ahead for the US\nTurning north, Statistics Canada will release inflation data for July, the first of two such reports before the Bank of Canada’s September rate decision.\nThe central bank is closely watching core measures and the share of components in the consumer price index basket that are rising, both of which accelerated in the previous month’s data. Signs of cooling would open the door to a rate cut.\nAdvance retail sales data for July will shed light on Canadian consumer health after June’s preliminary estimate surprisingly pointed to the strongest spending this year.\nAsia\nThe Reserve Bank of New Zealand is the focus on Wednesday, when authorities are expected to resume a monetary easing cycle. Economists forecast the RBNZ will trim its benchmark rate by a quarter-point, to 3%, as officials look to keep a sagging labor market from impeding growth.\nBank Indonesia is seen keeping its policy settings unchanged the same day. China will likely hold its 1- and 5-year loan prime rates steady.\nAsia sees a slew of indicators that are expected to underscore the impact of US trade policies on the region’s manufacturers. South Korea publishes early trade statistics for August, while Japan, Singapore, New Zealand and Malaysia all release reports for July. Thursday brings manufacturing PMI data for Japan, Australia and India.\nThailand’s economic growth likely slowed a tad in the second quarter, data on Monday are expected to show, validating the Bank of Thailand’s recent move to to cut its benchmark rate.\nJapan’s national CPI data, scheduled for release on Friday, are forecast to show consumer inflation stayed well above the Bank of Japan’s target in July, backing the case for the BOJ to remain on the path toward gradual rate hikes.\nHong Kong and Malaysia also release inflation figures in the coming week. Australia issues consumer confidence on Tuesday.\nFor more, read Bloomberg Economics’ full Week Ahead for Asia\nEurope, Middle East, Africa\nJuly inflation from the UK is likely to be the week’s most-watched release, with the Bank of England seeing price gains creeping up to a 4% peak in September. Bloomberg Economics is looking for a slight uptick on the month, to 3.7% from 3.6%. Analysts at Bank of America see services inflation edging up.\nThe UK also reports retail sales at the end of the week, though before that it will join the region’s other major economies in getting an update on private-sector activity from S&P Global’s Purchasing Managers’ Index.\nLike the euro zone, the UK’s reading has been a point or two above the 50 level that separates expansion from contraction. Analysts will look at how companies in Europe are reacting to the tariff deal between Brussels and Washington after investor confidence sank in Germany.\nSwiss exports, due on Thursday, will shed light on that country’s trade dealings with the US, which ended up hitting Switzerland with the highest tariffs among developed countries.\nRemarks on Wednesday in Geneva from European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde may offer more pointers on the continent’s outlook. Traders have pared bets on further ECB interest-rate cuts but will have an eye on negotiated-wage data due Friday to make sure moderation is continuing there.\nWednesday sees policymakers convene at Sweden’s Riksbank. They’re likely to keep the benchmark rate at 2%, looking past a temporary summer flare-up in inflation.\nBeyond Europe, South Africa publishes inflation data on Wednesday, with price growth seen accelerating to 3.5% in July from 3%. Israel will set borrowing costs the same day, with analysts looking for rates to be held steady for a 13th consecutive meeting. Rwanda and Botswana set rate policy on Thursday.\nFor more, read Bloomberg Economics’ full Week Ahead for EMEA\nLatin America\nChile kicks off the week with its second-quarter output report, central bank survey of traders, and quarterly current account data.\nGrowth may undershoot central bank forecasts, though the consensus calls for a second-half rebound supported by domestic demand, slowing inflation, and easing financial conditions.\nBrazil’s central bank on Monday posts its usual weekly Focus market readout along with its June economic activity report. May’s month-on-month dip aside, indicators such as the output gap suggest that Latin America’s No. 1 economy is still running hot.\nArgentina on Wednesday delivers June GDP-proxy data on the heels of a disappointing -0.1% month-on-month reading in May. Economists surveyed by the central bank forecast growth of 5% in 2025.\nClosing out the week, Mexico publishes June economic activity data and its final output figures for the three months through June, likely coming in quite close to flash readings of 0.7% quarter-on-quarter and 0.1% year-on-year reported on July 30.\nUncertainty over Trump’s trade and tariff policies, along with scaled back public investment, are expected to drag on Latin America’s No. 2 economy in the second half and into 2026.\nAfter consumer prices slowed more than expected in July — excluding services and core readings — mid-month inflation readings on Friday may have reversed course and ticked higher.\nFor more, read Bloomberg Economics’ full Week Ahead for Latin America\n--With assistance from Beril Akman, Jana Randow, Brian Fowler, Vince Golle, Monique Vanek, Robert Jameson, Laura Dhillon Kane, Mark Evans and Andrew Langley.\n(Updates with possible US-India trade talk postponement in 13th paragraph.)", "content_hash": "81a1054b91f753777e06f8c827dffd65", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Open interest is a measure of the total value of outstanding active futures contracts that investors have committed to Dogecoin.\nData from CoinGlass shows that Gate investors were at the forefront, with a total open interest of 3.29 billion DOGE, valued at $750.20 million.\nThis accounts for 21.92% of the total open interest. Binance was a close second with 20.13%, as investors committed 3.03 billion DOGE worth approximately $688.92 million.\nBybit, OKX, and Bitget rounded out the top five, with respective commitments of 2.05 billion DOGE, 1.71 billion DOGE, and 1.58 billion DOGE. These commitments are valued at $467.01 million, $388.56 million, and $358.71 million in fiat currency.\nAlso Read: Dogecoin Set To Soar 2,600% and Hit $1 Trillion Market Cap, Says This Crypto Analyst\nAlongside the rise in open interest, there has been an increase in whale activity, with a large holder transferring 400 million DOGE from Robinhood, indicating potential accumulation moves in anticipation of a bullish rally.\nDespite the recent dip in price, the open interest figures ignite hopes for a potential recovery. Should Dogecoin bounce back, market participants are likely to set their sights on the $0.30 price level, as previously hinted by its technical indicator.\nWhy It Matters: The surge in open interest and whale activity in Dogecoin, despite its recent price decline, indicates a strong belief among investors in the cryptocurrency’s potential for recovery.\nThis bullish sentiment, coupled with the significant amount of capital committed to the derivatives market, suggests that investors are positioning themselves for a potential rally in the near future.\nThe movement of a large amount of DOGE from Robinhood further fuels this speculation, hinting at possible accumulation moves in anticipation of a price surge.\nRead Next\nAnalyst Forecasts Mammoth 200% Surge for This Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Competitor\nImage: Shutterstock/alfernec\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

Known for his use of vivid metaphors and grounded logic, one of Buffett’s more striking observations reminds investors of the importance of personal responsibility: “The market, like the Lord, helps those who help themselves. But, unlike the Lord, the market does not forgive those who know not what they do.”\nThis quote appeared in Buffett’s 1982 annual letter to shareholders, and has endured as a succinct summary of his broader investing philosophy. It reflects a core belief that markets, while offering ample opportunities for those who act with informed intent and prudence, are inherently indifferent to the “sin” of ignorance. Investors who participate without understanding risks, fundamentals, or valuation can suffer lasting consequences, regardless of their intentions.\nMore News from Barchart\nBuffett’s credibility in making this statement is hard-earned. Over his multi-decade career at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, he has steered the firm through multiple market cycles, consistently outperforming equity benchmarks and avoiding the same pitfalls that have undone others. His approach — rooted in the principles of value investing, risk awareness, and fundamental analysis — has served as a counterweight to the speculative fervor and emotional decision-making that frequently dominate market behavior.\nThe context of the quasi-religious quote underscores its practical relevance. Buffett wrote those words in a period when speculative market behavior was on the rise, and when many investors were relying on short-term momentum or hype rather than disciplined research. The remark served as a warning that the stock market offers no divine mercy. It may reward careful planning, but will not absolve poor judgment or lack of preparation.\nThat principle is as relevant today as it was four decades ago. In recent years, markets have witnessed dramatic surges in retail trading, the rise of meme stocks, and the proliferation of complex investment products easily accessible through apps. While some investors have benefited from these trends, others have learned costly lessons — often by entering positions without fully understanding the underlying businesses or risks.", "content_hash": "7295617ed564b419d7580a25c0a76640", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

But he's not convinced that the recent Ethereum surge will continue.\nThe BTC prediction comes as crypto markets flirt with record highs and institutional investors pile into exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $124,128 on Wednesday.\n“There’s a greater than 50% chance that Bitcoin goes to the $140,000 to $150,000 range this year before we see another bear market next year,” McClurg said in a Friday interview with CNBC.\nMcClurg attributed the rally to rising demand from ETFs and an expanding base of institutional buyers, including sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporate treasuries.\n“These inflows are creating a higher price in Bitcoin,” he said.\nThe forecast comes as Canary Capital has filed ETF applications tied to several altcoins, including XRP, Sui, Cronus (CRO), Hedera (HBAR), and President Trump’s official meme coin on Solana.\nThe firm has not filed an ETF application related to Ethereum, which McClurg criticized as an outdated network—though ETH has been the biggest gainer in recent weeks among major cryptocurrencies, nearing an all-time high on Thursday before cooling off alongside the broader market.\n“I’m not a big fan of Ethereum, only because it is an older technology,” he said. “There’s a lot of other protocols that are faster, cheaper to transact, and fundamentally more secure.”\nWhat's Driving Ethereum's Surge—And Can It Last?\nMcClurg credited Ethereum with “a great run over about a five-year period,” but said newer blockchains like Solana and Sui have eclipsed it. “I do expect it to wane and not see all-time highs,” he added.\nOne analyst that Decrypt spoke with questioned McClurg’s skepticism toward Ethereum.\n“Ethereum will be extremely hard to compete with despite what some call ‘older tech,’ because Ethereum owns the developer ecosystem,” Amberdata Director of Derivatives Greg Magadini told Decrypt. “It’s like the iPhone platform that enables developers to build apps directly on its infrastructure. Those network effects only compound over time.”\nMagadini predicts Ethereum will catch up to Bitcoin on a relative basis, with ETH/BTC reaching 7%—implying an ETH price between $8,000 and $10,000.\nDespite this, Magadini agreed that Bitcoin could exceed $150,000 in 2025, driven by inflation hedging and investor appetite for risk.\n“Given the combination of an equity market rally and political pressure on the Fed to cut rates while inflation remains high, we have the perfect context for higher Bitcoin prices,” he said. “Bitcoin moves like a mix of digital gold and a risk-on asset—and right now, both those sentiments are helping prices move higher.”", "content_hash": "dea969b0431a7cedf54b273cff72ed36", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Known for his use of vivid metaphors and grounded logic, one of Buffett’s more striking observations reminds investors of the importance of personal responsibility: “The market, like the Lord, helps those who help themselves. But, unlike the Lord, the market does not forgive those who know not what they do.”\nThis quote appeared in Buffett’s 1982 annual letter to shareholders, and has endured as a succinct summary of his broader investing philosophy. It reflects a core belief that markets, while offering ample opportunities for those who act with informed intent and prudence, are inherently indifferent to the “sin” of ignorance. Investors who participate without understanding risks, fundamentals, or valuation can suffer lasting consequences, regardless of their intentions.\nMore News from Barchart\nBuffett’s credibility in making this statement is hard-earned. Over his multi-decade career at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, he has steered the firm through multiple market cycles, consistently outperforming equity benchmarks and avoiding the same pitfalls that have undone others. His approach — rooted in the principles of value investing, risk awareness, and fundamental analysis — has served as a counterweight to the speculative fervor and emotional decision-making that frequently dominate market behavior.\nThe context of the quasi-religious quote underscores its practical relevance. Buffett wrote those words in a period when speculative market behavior was on the rise, and when many investors were relying on short-term momentum or hype rather than disciplined research. The remark served as a warning that the stock market offers no divine mercy. It may reward careful planning, but will not absolve poor judgment or lack of preparation.\nThat principle is as relevant today as it was four decades ago. In recent years, markets have witnessed dramatic surges in retail trading, the rise of meme stocks, and the proliferation of complex investment products easily accessible through apps. While some investors have benefited from these trends, others have learned costly lessons — often by entering positions without fully understanding the underlying businesses or risks.", "content_hash": "7295617ed564b419d7580a25c0a76640", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

But he's not convinced that the recent Ethereum surge will continue.\nThe BTC prediction comes as crypto markets flirt with record highs and institutional investors pile into exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $124,128 on Wednesday.\n“There’s a greater than 50% chance that Bitcoin goes to the $140,000 to $150,000 range this year before we see another bear market next year,” McClurg said in a Friday interview with CNBC.\nMcClurg attributed the rally to rising demand from ETFs and an expanding base of institutional buyers, including sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporate treasuries.\n“These inflows are creating a higher price in Bitcoin,” he said.\nThe forecast comes as Canary Capital has filed ETF applications tied to several altcoins, including XRP, Sui, Cronus (CRO), Hedera (HBAR), and President Trump’s official meme coin on Solana.\nThe firm has not filed an ETF application related to Ethereum, which McClurg criticized as an outdated network—though ETH has been the biggest gainer in recent weeks among major cryptocurrencies, nearing an all-time high on Thursday before cooling off alongside the broader market.\n“I’m not a big fan of Ethereum, only because it is an older technology,” he said. “There’s a lot of other protocols that are faster, cheaper to transact, and fundamentally more secure.”\nWhat's Driving Ethereum's Surge—And Can It Last?\nMcClurg credited Ethereum with “a great run over about a five-year period,” but said newer blockchains like Solana and Sui have eclipsed it. “I do expect it to wane and not see all-time highs,” he added.\nOne analyst that Decrypt spoke with questioned McClurg’s skepticism toward Ethereum.\n“Ethereum will be extremely hard to compete with despite what some call ‘older tech,’ because Ethereum owns the developer ecosystem,” Amberdata Director of Derivatives Greg Magadini told Decrypt. “It’s like the iPhone platform that enables developers to build apps directly on its infrastructure. Those network effects only compound over time.”\nMagadini predicts Ethereum will catch up to Bitcoin on a relative basis, with ETH/BTC reaching 7%—implying an ETH price between $8,000 and $10,000.\nDespite this, Magadini agreed that Bitcoin could exceed $150,000 in 2025, driven by inflation hedging and investor appetite for risk.\n“Given the combination of an equity market rally and political pressure on the Fed to cut rates while inflation remains high, we have the perfect context for higher Bitcoin prices,” he said. “Bitcoin moves like a mix of digital gold and a risk-on asset—and right now, both those sentiments are helping prices move higher.”", "content_hash": "dea969b0431a7cedf54b273cff72ed36", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

I removed Nvidia from the chart below because it's up over 30,000% in the past decade, which skews the graph, but the other four have also done phenomenally well.\nThe \"worst\" performer of the remaining four has been Alphabet, with its stock rising nearly five times in value.\nThese five stocks have had a strong run over the past decade, but I still believe they are excellent picks for the next decade, mainly due to the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI). They are at the top of my list right now, and I think buying shares with the mindset of holding for the next decade is a wise investment strategy.\nNvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor are providing AI computing power\nAll five of these stocks are benefiting in various ways from the AI race.\nNvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which are currently the most popular computing hardware for running and training AI models. It owns this market, and its dominance has allowed it to become the world's largest company.\nThere's still a huge AI computing demand that hasn't been met, which bodes well for Nvidia's future. Because of this, it remains one of the best stocks to buy and hold over the next decade.\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSMC for short) is a manufacturer that produces chips for many of the major players in AI, including Nvidia. These companies don't have chip production capabilities, so they farm that work out to TSMC, which has earned its reputation for being the best foundry in the world through continuous innovation and impressive yields. There are few challengers to its supremacy, and this position will help it continue to be a market-crushing stock for the foreseeable future.\nNvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor are seeing huge growth right now because they're providing the computing power necessary for AI. The next three are also benefiting and will likely see even more success over the next decade.\nMore AI applications will rise over the next few years\nAt first glance, Amazon doesn't seem like much of an AI company. However, it has large exposure through its cloud computing wing, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is the largest cloud computing provider.\nIt's seeing strong demand for increased computing capacity for AI workloads. With this demand expected to rapidly increase over the next decade, this bodes well for AWS, which makes up the majority of Amazon's profits, helping drive the stock to new heights.\nMeta Platforms is developing its own in-house generative AI model, Llama. It has several uses for it, but the biggest is maintaining its role at the top of the social media world.\nMeta owns two of the biggest social media platforms, Facebook and Instagram, which generate most of their money through ad revenue. The company has integrated AI tools into its ad services and has already seen an uptick in interaction and conversion rates. This effect will become even greater as generative AI technologies improve, making Meta a strong stock pick for the next decade.\nLastly is Alphabet. Many think Alphabet will be displaced by AI because it gets the majority of its revenue through Google Search, which is seen as a target for AI disruption. However, that hasn't happened yet, and Google Search continues to get larger, with revenue rising 12% in the second quarter.\nPart of its success can be attributed to the rise of its Search Overviews, which are a hybrid between a traditional search engine and generative AI. This feature has become popular and could be enough to keep Google on top in search, allowing it to achieve new heights over the next decade.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

But what if you could skip all of that and still collect your share of the returns? That's exactly what thousands of investors are doing on Arrived Homes, the fractional real estate platform backed by Jeff Bezos. In Q2 2025 alone, Arrived's portfolio of vacation rentals generated more than $723,000 in gross booking revenue, all without a single investor having to worry about late checkouts or replacing broken coffee makers. And the best part? You can get started with as little as $100.\nA Hands-Off Way to Earn from Vacation Rentals\nArrived's vacation rental strategy is designed to open the door to an asset class that has historically been out of reach for everyday investors. The platform currently operates vacation rentals across 26 high-demand U.S. markets, from sunny beach towns to mountain destinations that stay booked year-round. In Q2, 39 active properties fueled the impressive revenue haul, all managed by professional operators tasked with maximizing occupancy, nightly rates, and guest satisfaction.\nInstead of dealing with the operational headaches of running an Airbnb or Vrbo listing, investors on Arrived own fractional shares of these properties and simply collect their portion of the returns. The average guest rating across the portfolio sits at 4.95 out of 5 stars, a level of consistency that drives repeat bookings and strong visibility on booking platforms. That kind of performance shows why short-term rentals remain a powerful income generator even in a crowded hospitality market.\nWhy This Matters for Investors\nShort-term rentals can deliver strong income, but they're also notoriously time-consuming. Between the cleaning schedules, pricing algorithms, and constant communication with guests, many would-be hosts never actually take the leap. Arrived solves this problem by pooling investor capital to purchase and manage vacation rentals at scale. That means you're not running a business — you're collecting your share of the income while professionals do the work.\nIt's worth noting that the $723,000 figure is gross booking revenue, which comes before expenses like property management, cleaning, and maintenance. But even with deductions, the numbers illustrate the power of vacation rentals as part of a diversified real estate portfolio. And unlike trying to buy and operate one property on your own, investing through Arrived means you're spreading your money across multiple homes, locations, and guest bases — reducing your risk while keeping your upside.", "content_hash": "8c8126dde357cc7e2d57d5cbb4099829", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

She frequently adjusts her positions, buying more when stock prices fall and trimming when they rally, balancing short-term gains and her long-term vision.\nThat’s what she just did, buying shares of a popular tech stock that has tumbled 36% after earnings.\nWood’s funds have experienced a volatile ride this year, swinging from sharp losses to strong gains.\nIn January and February, the Ark funds rallied as investors bet on the Trump administration's potential deregulation that could benefit Wood’s tech bets. But the momentum faded in March and April, with the funds trailing the market as top holdings — especially Tesla, Wood’s biggest position — slid amid growing concerns over the macroeconomy and trade policies.\nNow, the Ark funds are making a strong comeback. As of Aug. 15, the flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up 33.7% year-to-date, far outpacing the S&P 500’s 9.7% gain.\nWood's remarkable return of 153% in 2020 helped build her reputation and attract loyal investors. Her strategy can lead to sharp gains during bull markets but also painful losses, like in 2022, when ARKK dropped more than 60%.\nThose swings have weighed on her long-term results. As of Aug. 15, the Ark Innovation ETF has delivered a five-year annualized return of negative 1.4%, while the S&P 500 has an annualized return of 15.6% over the same period.\nCathie Wood’s investment strategy explained\nWood’s investment strategy is straightforward: Her Ark ETFs typically buy shares in emerging high-tech companies in fields such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, biomedical technology, and robotics.\nShe says these companies have the potential to reshape industries, but their volatility leads to major fluctuations in Ark funds' values.\nOver the 10 years ending in 2024, the Ark Innovation ETF wiped out $7 billion in investor wealth, according to an analysis by Morningstar’s analyst Amy Arnott. That made it the third-biggest wealth destroyer among mutual funds and ETFs in Arnott’s ranking.\nStill, Wood has been bullish on the market. In a letter to investors published in late April, she dismissed predictions of a recession dragging into 2026 and struck an optimistic tone for tech stocks.\n\"During the current turbulent transition in the U.S., we think consumers and businesses are likely to accelerate the shift to technologically enabled innovation platforms including artificial intelligence, robotics, energy storage, blockchain technology, and multiomics sequencing,\" she said.\nMany investors share this optimism. Over the past five days through Aug. 14, the Ark Innovation ETF attracted $5.52 billion in net inflows, according to data from ETF research firm VettaFi. That’s almost 70% of the fund’s $8 billion assets at the end of July.\nCathie Wood buys $12 million of CoreWeave stock\nOn Aug. 15, Wood’s Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) bought 120,229 shares of CoreWeave Inc. (CRWV) worth roughly $12 million.\nThe purchase came after CoreWeave tumbled 20.8% on Aug. 13 and another 15.5% on Aug. 14, following earnings that showed a larger-than-expected loss as the company increased spending to meet surging demand.\nCoreWeave is a cloud infrastructure company specializing in GPU-accelerated computing for artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads. The company is backed by Nvidia (NVDA) , now the AI chipmaker’s largest holding.\nOn Aug. 12, CoreWeave posted a second-quarter loss of 60 cents per share, much wider than Wall Street analysts' forecast of a loss of 45 cents. Still, revenue jumped 207% from a year earlier to $1.21 billion, topping estimates.\nOperating expenses in Q2 nearly quadrupled, rising 276% to $1.19 billion. “We are scaling rapidly as we look to meet the unprecedented demand for AI,” said Michael Intrator, co-founder and CEO of CoreWeave.\nCFO Nitin Agrawal said during the earnings call that the company is \"still operating in a structurally supply-constrained environment, where demand far outstrips supply for our products and services.\"\nIn Q2, CoreWeave’s operating margin fell to 2% from 20% a year ago. Agrawal cautioned that the company will \"incur some costs prior to revenue generation,\" which will have a short-term impact on margins.\nFor the current quarter, the company expects revenue between $1.26 billion and $1.30 billion, slightly above the $1.25 billion analysts had forecast.\nDespite the recent drop, CoreWeave stock is still up 156% since its March debut.\nWhile Wood is buying, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, and Goldman Sachs are arranging sales of up to $10 billion of CoreWeave stock as the IPO lock-up ends.", "content_hash": "046b1eb977ca13345a3e50e55e003c4d", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Consider how much money you'd have today if you'd invested $10,000 in Apple stock 20 years ago vs. in the S&P 500; the difference gets wider as you go back in time.\nIt has outperformed the market over the past five years, too, but only by a hair's breadth. That's largely due to its performance this year, which has been dismal.\nHowever, there have been many times in the past when Apple stock plunged, and there were times it remained low even for several years before rebounding in a big way. For example, it hit a high in 2007 before the mortgage crisis and didn't reach it again until 2009. Let's see what's happening at Apple and where it might be in five years.\nTariffs, iPhones, and AI\nThere are several factors working together against Apple stock these days, as there usually are when there's a drastic change from the norm. They are mostly concentrated in tariff uncertainty, iPhone sales, and artificial intelligence (AI).\nTariff uncertainty is weighing on it\nThe market has been worried about how Apple will be impacted by tariffs, considering its reliance on getting its products made in China. It has already diversified its supply chain to include India to a large degree, but tariffs went there, too, and seem to have chased it into a corner where it recently announced that it would invest $600 billion in manufacturing in the U.S.\nThe tariff issue is stabilizing, and should be a blip five years from now. However, there could be large-scale aftereffects as it changes its supply chain. Having more operations domestically could lead it in many different directions that are unforeseeable today, such as having a more expensive workforce but a lower tariff rate.\niPhones account for a large part of sales\nThere's also been concern that it has too few products, which means that any change in one of them could impact the business in a big way. iPhones account for nearly half of total sales, and as artificial intelligence changes how people engage with technology, the iPhone business is vulnerable to innovation in new areas from competitors.\nApple still has a tight ecosystem with users who are loyal to its products, so it's not a near-term worry. But in five years, the landscape could look a lot different, with other kinds of devices taking the place of smartphones for many actions. I don't see iPhones becoming obsolete even in five years, but Apple would need to make some major changes to its premier products to keep customers buying new ones.\nSlow progress in AI\nCEO Tim Cook gave an upbeat outlook about Apple Intelligence on the fiscal third-quarter earnings call (for the period ended June 28), but so far, it hasn't suitably impressed investors, who feel it's falling behind the competition.\nHowever, as Cook noted, \"In everything we do, we're driven by transformative innovation, delivering the most exceptional products and services we've ever created, and we're especially excited about what's ahead.\" I think that sums up Apple's approach to its consumer goods business. It's not, for example, like Amazon, which tries to be everything to everyone. Many users still remember its \"Think Different\" campaign, which still defines its model, and investors shouldn't expect it to do things the same way as other companies. It wouldn't be Apple if it did.\nThings could get better, but how much?\nThat said, Apple is now the third-largest company in the world by market cap, and it's questionable whether it can continue beating the market at this size. It still offers value and is likely to keep growing, but there's a cap on how much it can gain. For example, if we surmise it can grow its revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 8% over the next five years, which is a generous estimate considering its recent performance, and assume the price-to-sales ratio remains constant, revenue and the stock price would increase 47%. That's one possibility of many, and a new product or advances in AI could boost revenue growth.\nConsidering its recent drop, I would expect it to recoup the loss and go on to be bigger and better sooner rather than later. But over the next five years, I wouldn't count on Apple gaining as quickly as it has in the past.\nShould you buy stock in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

This is great news for chip powerhouses and hyperscalers like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Broadcom, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Microsoft, Amazon, or Alphabet, but investors could be overlooking emerging opportunities beyond the usual suspects.\nEnterprise-grade software will become an increasingly vital layer atop the hardware stack. The commercial angle is to market AI-powered software to large corporations with complex needs spanning data analytics, logistics, human resources, cybersecurity, and more.\nBut there is another opportunity outside of the private sector: how AI is redefining one of the largest and most sophisticated enterprises of all, the U.S. government. Earlier this year, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a plan to allocate more spending toward the Software Acquisition Pathway (SWP), a strategy first deployed in 2020. Its stated aim is to \"provide for the efficient and effective acquisition, development, integration, and timely delivery of secure software.\"\nLet's explore how Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR) and BigBear.ai(NYSE: BBAI) are capitalizing on AI's shift from hardware to software and how each company is approaching the opportunity with SWP.\n1. Palantir Technologies: The AI darling of the U.S. government\nPalantir has been at the center of several notable deals with the federal government throughout 2025. In late May, it deepened its relationship with the Department of Defense (DOD) through a $795 million extension featuring its Maven Smart System (MSS). This brought the total value of the MSS program to $1.28 billion, making it a long-term revenue driver. More recently, the company won a deal with the Army reportedly worth up to $10 billion over the next 10 years.\nPalantir's wins extend beyond the U.S. military as well. The company is building the Immigration Lifecycle Operating System -- often referred to as ImmigrationOS -- for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\nSigning multiyear billion-dollar deals provides Palantir with high revenue visibility, keeps its customer base sticky, and opens the door to upsell or cross-sell added services down the road.\nThe ability to parlay its defense expertise into other government functions also expands Palantir's public sector footprint and reinforces the breadth of its capabilities -- solidifying its role as a ubiquitous AI backbone for the U.S. government.\n2. BigBear.ai: A niche player helping the public sector\nAnother AI software developer that has signed deals with the U.S. government this year is BigBear.ai. In February, it won a contract with the DOD to design a system to assist national security decision-making by analyzing trends and patterns in foreign media.\nShortly thereafter, the company won a $13.2 million deal spread over three and a half years to support the Joint Chiefs of Staff's force management and data analytics capabilities.\nIn May, the company partnered with Hardy Dynamics to advance the Army's use of machine learning and AI for autonomous drones.\nLastly, BigBear.ai has a deal with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to deploy its biometric AI infrastructure system, called Pangiam, at a dozen major airports across North America to help streamline arrivals and improve security protocols.\nWhich is the better stock: Palantir or BigBear.ai?\nBetween the two stocks, I see Palantir as the clear choice. BigBear.ai has proved it can win meaningful government contracts, but its work is more niche-focused and smaller in scale compared to Palantir's multibillion-dollar deals across multiple platforms.\nIn my view, BigBear.ai's popularity is largely with retail investors who are hoping that it becomes the \"next Palantir.\" Smart investors know that hope is not a real strategy. Prudent valuation analysis -- and not speculation -- is required to know which stock is truly worth buying.\nWhile some on Wall Street may argue that Palantir stock is cheap based on software-specific metrics such as the Rule of 40, I'm not entirely bought into such a narrative.\nTraditional approaches to valuation, such as the price-to-sales ratio (P/S), show that Palantir is the priciest software-as-a-service stock among the businesses in the chart above -- and its valuation expansion means that shares are becoming even more expensive as the stock continues to rally.\nPalantir is an impressive company that has proved it can deliver on crucial applications, but the stock is historically expensive. I think that investors are better off waiting for a more reasonable entry point and paying a more appropriate price down the road.\nShould you buy stock in Palantir Technologies right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.
