US producer prices – a measure of wholesale costs – rose 3.3pc annually in July, which was much higher than forecasts of 2.5pc.
Wholesale prices bounced by 0.9pc in July compared to June, government data showed, which was the fastest growth since 2022 and well above the 0.2pc expected by analysts.
Producer prices measure wholesale inflation and are often a precursor to rises in consumer prices. The data also serves as an early indicator of the impact of president Trump’s tariffs on the US economy.
Stephen Brown of Capital Economics said the data showed “some signs of tariff effects” with underlying wholesale inflation rising at the fastest pace in more than a year.
Stocks on Wall Street fell at the open, while the FTSE 100 also declined as traders reduced bets on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates in September.
Bond yields began to rise in debt markets as money markets indicated that the chances had faded of a bigger half a point rate cut, encouraged by US treasury secretary Scott Bessent this week.
Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at research firm Fwdbonds, said: “It will only be a matter of time before producers pass their higher tariff-related costs onto the backs of inflation-weary consumers.”

European stocks close at two-month highs propelled by defence industry
European shares closed at their highest level in more than two months on Thursday, with aerospace and defence stocks, and the finance sector, providing the biggest boost as investors assessed a spate of corporate earnings.
The pan-European Stoxx 600 index, which includes some of Britain’s biggest companies, closed 0.6pc higher.
Industrial stocks were among the biggest sectoral gainers, with aerospace and defence companies taking charge.
Richard Flax, chief investment officer at Moneyfarm, said that despite expectations of Europe spending more on defence, questions remained about when it would come through and how much would go to European firms.
Upbeat corporate earnings reports also aided sentiment. Insurers were up 0.9pc, after trading near record highs touched last Thursday earlier in the session.
Britain’s Admiral hit a record high, rising 6.6pc after a strong first-half profit, while Aviva jumped 2.6pc to its highest since December 2007, after raising its interim dividend and reporting stronger half-year operating profit.

Inflation data ‘a strong validation’ of Fed
Higher wholesale inflation in the US is a “strong validation” of the Fed’s repeated decisions to wait and see before cutting interest rates, an economist has said.
“This [the latest producer prices index report] is a kick in the teeth for anyone who thought that tariffs would not impact domestic prices in the United States economy,” said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. “This report is a strong validation of the Fed’s wait-and-see stance on policy changes.”
Peter Andersen, founder of Andersen Capital Management in Boston, said: “We have been too anxious to draw a conclusion that the economy is fine; it’s not overheated.
“But this wholesale data does show that perhaps there is some inflation working and we shouldn’t be so quick to conclude, we need to cut interest rates.”

FTSE 100 hits record closing high
The FTSE 100 hit a record closing high today, despite struggling for direction in trading
The blue-chip index closed up 0.1pc, at 9,177.24, with investors weighing better-than-expected UK growth figures and a surprise pick-up in producer price inflation across the pond.
The FTSE 250 ended down 0.2pc, at 21,801.67, and the AIM All-Share finished 0.3pc higher, at 759.71.
In Europe, the Cac 40 in Paris rose 0.7pc, while the Dax in Frankfurt advanced 0.8pc.
The Office for National Statistics said UK gross domestic product (GDP) rose 0.3pc in the second quarter from the first, slowing from a 0.7pc expansion in the first three months of the year.
According to the market consensus, cited by FXStreet, growth of 0.1pc on-quarter had been expected for the three months to June.

Bessent’s ‘neutral’ interest rate is unknowable, economist suggests
Scott Bessent’s call for a “neutral rate” of interest has come under fire from an economist at Liverpool.
Prof Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool Management School, said: “I have some difficulty with Bessent and his argument regarding the neutral rate.
“This is the rate expected to prevail when an economy is at ‘equilibrium’ [maximum sustainable output and employment] and inflation is ‘stable’.
“Nevertheless, ‘equilibrium’ output cannot be measured accurately.
“At the same time, a 2pc inflation rate prevailing over (say) four years is mathematically as ‘stable’ as (say) a 4pc inflation rate prevailing over four years.”
04:34 PM BST
Bessent denies pressuring the Fed to cut rates
Scott Bessent has denied pressuring the Fed to make rate cuts, hours after wholesale inflation data was unexpectedly high.
The US Treasury secretary told Fox Business: “I didn’t tell the Fed what to do.
“What I said was that to get to a neutral rate on interest, that would be an approximately 150 basis point [1.5 percentage point] cut. I did not call for them to get there.”
Economists define a neutral rate of interest as one that allows full employment and stable inflation.
Mr Bessent added: “The other thing that I said was that perhaps because they had bad BLS [Bureau of Labor Statistics] data in June and July [on employment] that perhaps, perhaps, a 50 basis point [half a percentage point] cut in September was warranted.”
Julia Coronado, of the research firm MacroPolicy Perspectives, told Bloomberg: “It’s not really the role of the Treasury secretary to opine [on interest rates].
“The fact that the most senior economic official in the administration is saying these things publicly is direct, public pressure on what he wants the Fed to do.”

Interest rates ‘not to blame for slowing economy’
Worries about rising costs, not high interest rates, are to blame for the US economy slowing down, a leading market commentator has claimed.
Michael Hewson said: “All this chatter from the likes of President Trump, as well as many armchair critics comes across as a little reckless when inflation risks in the US are becoming increasingly two-sided due to the effects of tariffs.
“You will hear no end of commentary from people insisting that the Fed is being too slow, and that may well be the case, however there is also the risk that they could cut too quickly, and be forced to raise rates again if inflation ramps up above 3pc in the coming months.
“This is why talk of a [half a percentage point] rate cut in September [by the Trump administration] comes across as reckless at a time when tariff effects remain a huge unknown, and in a lot of cases have yet to be felt.
“You only have to look at today’s [producer price index] numbers to understand that inflation pressures are far from benign.
“The US economy may well be slowing however it’s not due to interest rates being too high, but due to concerns about rising prices.”
04:06 PM BST
US companies poised to raise prices further
Companies are poised to raise prices for US consumers in the coming months as the effects of Donald Trump’s trade policies flow into the domestic economy.
Ben Ayers, a senior economist at US insurer Nationwide, said: “While businesses have assumed the majority of tariff costs increases so far, margins are being increasingly squeezed by higher costs for imported goods.”
He said that tariff price hikes were most obvious within metal and food categories, with readings for steel and aluminium – both targeted with 50pc levies – jumping in recent months and adding to cost concerns for manufacturers.
Mr Ayers expects more of the tariff burden borne by companies so far to pass through to consumer prices in the coming months.
Matthew Martin, at Oxford Economics, said: “Tariff-exposed goods are rising at a rapid clip, indicating that the willingness and ability of businesses to absorb tariff costs may be beginning to wane.”

Wall Street recovers following inflation setback
Stocks have been recovering on Wall Street after being hit earlier this afternoon by today’s inflation data.
The benchmark S&P 500 index is flat, having fallen as much as 0.4pc.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 01.pc, having fallen 0.5pc, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 0.2pc, having been down 0.4pc earlier this afternoon.
The inflation data forced traders to second guess their widespread consensus that the Federal Reserve will deliver some relief next month by cutting interest rates. Lower rates can boost investment prices and the economy by making it cheaper for US households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment, but they also risk worsening inflation.
“This doesn’t slam the door on a September rate cut,” but it may raise some doubt, according to Chris Larkin, of E-Trade.
Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 is now flat, having dropped by 0.3pc earlier. The FTSE 250 is down 0.3pc.
03:40 PM BST
Dollar rises after US producer prices surge
The US dollar has risen as much as 0.4pc against a group of key rivals today as a result of higher-than-expected US inflation.
The hot measure of inflation at the wholesale level follows the release on Tuesday of a better-than-feared rise in consumer prices in July.
The latest data has raised worries that tariffs could still stir up inflation in coming months and change the course of interest rate cuts for the rest of the year.
Yesterday, US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent urged the Fed to make a half a percentage point rate cut next month.
“I think that [a half point cut] was never particularly likely, but presumably this [producer prices index] report quashes that,” said Matt Weller, global head of market research at StoneX.
The dollar is currently up 0.2pc against the pound.
03:12 PM BST
Bond markets hit by inflation fears
US stagflation fears have seeped into global markets after the surprisingly strong inflation data applied heavy pressure to US bonds.
Government bonds everywhere from Britain to Germany and Japan were sold after the unexpectedly large jump in producer prices.
Two-year Treasury yields, which track monetary policy expectations, leapt four basis points immediately after the data to 3.73pc as expectations for jumbo Fed rate cuts faded.
Money markets showed traders still almost unanimously expect the Federal Reserve to lower borrowing costs next month after keeping its main funds rate at 4.25pc-4.5pc since December.
But bets on a bigger half a point rate cut, encouraged by comments from US treasury secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday, quickly faded out of the market.
Russell Investments analyst Paul Eitelman said: “Inflation is starting to come through. It’s not massive yet but that could certainly continue in coming months.”

Congrats, you’re paying for tariffs, Americans warned
The latest jump in US wholesale inflation is proof that American consumers will soon begin “paying for tariffs”, according to Ritholtz Wealth Management analyst Callie Cox:

Wall Street falls back from record highs after inflation data
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq retreated from record highs after stronger-than-expected wholesale inflation raised concerns about whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 31.4 points, or 0.1pc, at the open to 44,890.84.
The S&P 500 fell 13.1 points, or 0.2pc, at the open to 6,453.46​, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 63.9 points, or 0.3pc, to 21,649.211 at the opening bell.

Borrowing costs rise as data indicates tariffs hitting US economy
The cost of government borrowing rose after US wholesale inflation was stronger than expected last month, raising doubts about the Federal Reserve’s ability to cut interest rates.
US producer prices – a measure of wholesale costs – rose 3.3pc annually in July, which was much higher than forecasts of 2.5pc.
Shortly afterwards, bond yields began to rise in debt markets in a sign that traders have doubts about the Fed’s ability to cut interest rates in September.
The yield on 10-year US treasury bonds rose one basis point to 4.25pc. UK 10-year gilt yields led rose by two basis points to 4.61pc following stronger-than-expected growth figures.
The rise in US wholesale inflation signals that tariffs may be beginning to push up prices in the American economy, which would make it harder for the Fed to reduce interest rates.
01:53 PM BST
US wholesale inflation jumps as tariffs take hold
Wholesale inflation in the US lurched higher in a sign Donald Trump’s tariff campaign is impacting the American economy.
US stocks fell in premarket trading after wholesale inflation was stronger than expected last month, dampening hopes for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in September.
US producer prices bounced by 0.9pc in July compared to June, government data showed, which was the highest in three years and well above the 0.2pc expected by analysts.
Data from the Labor Department showed the producer price index rose 3.3pc compared to the same month last year, compared to forecasts of 2.5pc.
Producer prices measure wholesale inflation and are often a precursor to rises in consumer prices. The data also serves as an early indicator of the impact of Donald Trump’s tariffs on the US economy.
In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.4pc while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 declined 0.6pc.

Britain’s economy poised to weaken further, says Morgan Stanley
Britain’s economy likely faces a further weakening in growth, a Wall Street bank has said, raising the chances of an interest rate cut by the Bank of England.
Morgan Stanley said it would stick with its forecast for 0.1pc quarterly growth in the second half of the year.
Chief UK economist Bruna Skarica said the Bank of England’s “reluctance to cut further and the Budget uncertainty, paired with the global growth slowdown” would hit the economy.
She said there was “a lot to like” from the Government’s efforts to reform planning and boost investment.
She said: “Cyclically, however, our message is simple – interest rates are too high for a sustained and broad-based growth uptick.”
She said “softer underlying details and the likely softening of the growth momentum from here” would keep in play the possibility of a November rate cut by the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).
She added: “If the Government ensures that the autumn Budget does not repeat the 2024 slew of inflation-boosting policies, and measured inflation falls through 2026, we think the MPC will acknowledge the need to cut rates amid the ongoing build-up of slack.
“If that is not the case, we will see more of the same stagflationary dynamics, we think.”
01:14 PM BST
Growth slowdown because of Reeves’s choices, say Tories
The shadow chancellor said the slowdown in Britain’s economic growth was “not by accident”.
Mel Stride said: “That’s because of the choices the chancellor has taken, whacking taxes on businesses, stoking inflation through borrowing and spending lots of money, keeping interest rates higher than they would otherwise have been.”
12:50 PM BST
US stocks muted ahead of wholesale inflation data
UK investors are not the only people examining economic data closely today.
Wall Street was muted in premarket trading ahead of wholesale inflation figures which could indicate whether tariffs are beginning to put pressure on prices in the US.
The benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq have hit record highs in the previous two sessions, and blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average is within striking distance of an all-time high amid hopes the Federal Reserve will cut rates in September.
Traders are fully pricing in a quarter-point rate cut by the central bank next month, with reductions also expected to follow in October and December.
The producer price index for July, measuring inflation on wholesale prices, could upend those expectations.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were little changed in premarket trading, while the Dow was down 0.1pc.
12:05 PM BST
FTSE 100 falls amid slump in economic growth
The FTSE 100 edged lower after the latest decline in economic growth.
The blue-chip index was down 0.1pc, after three consecutive sessions of gains, while the domestically focused FTSE 250 dropped also 0.1pc.
Britain’s economy slowed less than expected despite US trade tariffs and a weaker jobs market, prompting traders to reduce bets on cuts to interest rates this year.
George Brown, senior economist at Schroders, said much of the slowdown was due to manufacturers front-loading goods in the previous quarter to avoid tariffs.
He said: “This drag should ease in the third quarter, even against a tougher global trade backdrop.
“We expect the Bank of England to keep rates on hold for the remainder of the year.”
The energy sector was the main drag on the FTSE 100, which Harbour Energy falling 4.6pc and oil majors Shell and BP each dropping more than 1pc.
Among individual stocks, British Gas owner Centrica rose 2.9pc after announcing it will jointly buy Britain’s biggest gas import terminal from National Grid on the Isle of Grain in Kent for £1.5bn.
Insurer Aviva jumped 3.5pc to a 17-year high after raising its interim dividend and reporting a 22pc rise in half-year operating profit.
11:46 AM BST
Britain’s growth per head lags behind Italy
Whether Sir Keir Starmer has met his pledge to have the fastest growing economy in the G7 depends on how you cut the numbers.
After the 0.3pc expansion in the second quarter, Britain’s overall GDP growth during the first half of the year was the fastest in the group of advanced economies, rising by 1.1pc, ahead of the US and Canada at 0.6pc and France on 0.4pc.
However, when measuring on GDP per capita, Britain lags behind Japan, the US and even Italy.
A higher GDP per capita generally suggests a higher average income and a greater capacity for a country to provide for its citizens.
One accusation made against governments in recent years has been that GDP growth has been propped up by rising migration.
Pranesh Narayanan of the IPPR think tank said GDP per capita was a better way of measuring economic benefit but said it was hard to “project what is going to happen”, pointing to uncertainty in the US and Europe.
He said: “Population projections are set to go down and there will be a slowing down of migration flows in the data.
“That is also going to mean that those per capita growth figure does improve. If you have got higher growth rates also now through some of the policy initiatives that Labour have done, you can see how it is possible for GDP per capita to increase.
“But it is all uncertain how it plays out.”

Brexit benefit as UK growth outstrips EU
Britain’s growth more than halved in the second quarter but it remained ahead of the eurozone, latest figures show.
GDP in the single currency bloc rose by 0.1pc in the second quarter of the year.
Economist Julian Jessop said was an example of a “Brexit benefit” as the UK was less exposed to the impact of Donald Trump’s tariff war.
10:51 AM BST
The dangerous driver behind Britain’s growth
Britain has become dangerously reliant on public spending to fuel the economy.
Growth slowed in the three months to June, with the economy expanding by 0.3pc compared with 0.7pc in the first quarter of 2025.
However, it is still better than the 0.1pc expected by analysts and a figure that will be welcomed by Rachel Reeves, with GDP per person – a proxy for living standards – also seeing growth in the first half of this year.
However, scratch below the surface and it’s clear that the factors behind this growth are unsustainable.
10:34 AM BST
Consumers reluctant to open their wallets, warn economists
Consumers are showing signs of “reluctance”, economists have warned after the latest slowdown in UK growth.
The ONS said household spending growth was weak in the three months to June, up just 0.1pc. Meanwhile, business investment fell by 4pc from the first quarter.
Thomas Pugh, economist at accountants RSM UK, said: “The continued reluctance of consumers to open their wallets is concerning.
“We don’t expect growth to pick up much from here as continued consumer caution, weaker global demand and tax increases all continue to drag.”
10:10 AM BST
Starmer’s pre-election growth pledge under threat
Sir Keir Starmer’s pledge to make Britain the fastest-growing economy in the G7 has been put at risk by the latest slowdown in GDP.
The Prime Minister made the promise before the election last year but has since watered down the target to an “aim”.
Britain’s economy grew by 0.3pc in the second quarter of the year, according to the ONS, which was sharply lower than 0.7pc recorded in the first three months of 2025.
Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Liberum, said Britain was “middle of the pack” a year into the Labour government, with 0.7pc growth per capita.
He said the trend “has been on an improving profile in the first half of the year as population growth slows and aggregate GDP growth picked up”.
Sanjay Raja, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said Britain was “on course to become the second fastest growing economy in the G7 (after claiming the top prize in the first quarter of 2025)”, missing Sir Keir’s target.
09:45 AM BST
Debt-laden Italy now better for living standards than Britain
Britain’s living standards fell behind those in Italy for the first time since 2001 in a fresh blow to Rachel Reeves’s efforts to boost economic growth and renew the nation’s competitiveness.
Slow growth, rising worklessness and high inflation are all damaging Britain, raising fears that the UK is losing its status as a rich nation at the same as Italy shakes off its image as an economic basket case.
Once adjusted for the cost of living, GDP per capita – a critical measure of wellbeing, and a favoured target of Sir Keir Starmer’s Government – is now higher in Italy than Britain.
09:24 AM BST
Economic growth beat expectations, insists Reeves
Rachel Reeves has said that today’s GDP figures “show that the economy beat expectations in the second quarter of this year”.
Speaking at a construction site in Doncaster, the chancellor said “there’s still more to do to make sure that people in all parts of the country benefit” from growth.
She said: “We are the fastest-growing economy in the G7 for the first half of this year, with a GDP growth of 0.3pc this quarter, and that’s after GDP growth of 0.7pc the quarter before that.
“I recognise there’s still more to do to make sure that people in all parts of the country benefit from that growth, but since the general election, when I became chancellor, the economy has grown by 1.2pc and GDP per capita – so for every person in the country – GDP per capita is up by 0.7pc.
“So, encouraging numbers today but, of course, we need to build on that to make sure people in all parts of the country are better-off.”
09:09 AM BST
‘Stuttering’ economy has lost momentum, say analysts
Britain’s economy has “anaemic growth with little sign of improvement”, according to analysts.
Michael Brown of Pepperstone said the ONS figures “pointed to the economy having lost momentum once again in the three months to June”.
Samuel Edwards of payments firm Ebury said: “Today’s figures show an economy stuttering in the face of considerable uncertainty.”
Lindsay James, an analyst at Quilter, said the “encouraging growth seen in the first quarter was somewhat of a mirage and unlikely to be repeated anytime soon”.
He said: “GDP growth in the second quarter has dropped to 0.3pc, and the UK appears to be stuck back where it was – anaemic growth with little sign of improvement. Although today’s GDP data is slightly better than expected and June’s growth came in at 0.4pc, figures released earlier this week highlight where a lot of the issues lie.
“The labour market is weakening, the Government appears to be planning for additional tax hikes in the autumn and global factors make business planning difficult.
“None of these issues carry easy fixes and there are very few short-term solutions. With global growth set to slow at the same time as this slowdown in the UK, the picture is only becoming more challenging.
“Investors too continue to be fairly pessimistic on UK growth despite that stellar first quarter. In our own survey of global fund managers, expectations for real GDP growth in the UK for 2025 sit at 0.9pc, suggesting that very little growth will be eked out in the second half of this year.”
08:44 AM BST
Watch: Reeves admits economy ‘trapped in a cycle of low growth’
Rachel Reeves admitted Britain’s economy has “got stuck” in a video released after data showing growth more than halved in the second quarter of the year.
The chancellor said the economy had been “trapped in a cycle of low growth, repressed investment and stagnant incomes”.
She said there is “more to do” and nodded to her upcoming Budget in the autumn, insisting she does not “accept that decline is inevitable”.
She is expected to raise taxes at the fiscal event to steady the public finances.
08:33 AM BST
Britain faces tax rises as growth halves
Britain will face tax rises in the autumn following the latest growth figures, economists have warned.
GDP expanded by 0.3pc in the second quarter, which was better than than analysts had forecast, although less than half the growth of 0.7pc in the first three months of the year.
Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the “new-found momentum will soon fade”.
She said: “We doubt the economy will maintain this pace of growth in the third quarter.
“The weak global economy will remain a drag on UK GDP growth for a while yet.
“The full drag on business investment from April’s tax rises has yet to be felt. And the ongoing speculation about further tax rises in the Autumn Budget will probably keep consumers in a cautious mood.”
She added: “With policy choices and higher market rates eroding the Chancellor’s already-slim fiscal headroom, we doubt this will be enough to prevent tax rises in the Autumn Budget.”
08:18 AM BST
Government spending is main driver of economic growth
Government spending was the biggest contributor to Britain’s economic growth in the second quarter of the year
The Office for National Statistics said government spending rose by 1.2pc compared to the previous three months.
Deutsche Bank’s chief UK economist Sanjay Raja said “there’s much to be desired” from the underlying growth data.
He said: “Public consumption and investment shot up 2pc on the quarter and was the largest contributor to GDP (adding 0.5pp to quarterly GDP).
“We also saw a further build up of inventories in spring as President Trump’s trade war began – stocks added 0.2 percentage points to GDP growth.
“And most surprisingly, net trade was also a positive contributor to growth, outpacing almost all expectations.”
He added: “To be sure, the economy is growing. Positive momentum is brewing. But animal spirits remain tepid.
“While the chancellor is poised to focus her Budget on improving productivity – a very welcome focus for the UK – Number 11 should also prioritise lifting household and business confidence to sustain the UK’s outperformance.”
08:05 AM BST
UK stocks slump as growth halved
The FTSE 100 slipped at the open after Britain’s economic growth was cut in half in the second quarter of the year.
The UK’s flagship stock index dropped 0.3pc to 9,134.72 after the latest GDP figures, which were better than analysts had forecast.
The better-than-expected growth meant traders reduced bets on the Bank of England cutting interest rates.
The mid-cap FTSE 250 declined by 0.2pc to 21,816.44.
07:58 AM BST
Traders scale back bets on interest rate cuts
Money markets indicate there is less chance that the Bank of England will cut interest rates again before the end of the year after the latest UK growth figures.
Traders are betting that there is a 66pc chance that policymakers will lower borrowing costs again over the next three meetings, compared to odds of 79pc at the start of the week.
07:48 AM BST
Growth figures ‘not good enough’
Economists appeared divided on how to read the latest growth data from the ONS.
Simon French of Panmure Liberum said Britain had enjoyed “decent” growth in June, which deliver growth of 0.3pc for the second quarter.
Mohamed El-Erian of Allianz said the data was “relatively upbeat” but Julian Jessop of the Institute of Economic Affairs warned it was “good news, but not good enough”.
He said Britain’s economy remained “too weak to fix the public finances, and there are already signs that momentum is fading again as a tight Autumn Budget looms”.
07:38 AM BST
Pound rises as growth better than expected
The value of the pound rose after Britain’s economy performed better than expected in the second quarter of the year.
Although economic growth more than halved from the previous quarter to 0.3pc, this was better than the miserly 0.1pc that had been forecast by analysts.
Sterling rose 0.2pc against the dollar to $1.359 and gained 0.1pc versus the euro to €1.161 as the stronger growth made interest rate cuts by the Bank of England less likely.
ICAEW economics director Suren Thiru said: “While these stronger than expected figures may not ease concerns among rate-setters over the health of the UK economy, a September interest rate cut remains implausible given mounting concerns over rising inflation.”
He added: “The economy lost some momentum in the second quarter as several sectors weakened under pressure from ‘awful April’s’ surge in costs and the explosion of global trade turbulence, despite a robust return to growth in June.
“Following the bumper first three months of 2025, this second quarter slowdown offers a more authentic insight into the UK’s underlying growth path given persistent problems with anaemic productivity and poor public finances.
“The UK’s economic performance in the third quarter may be similarly modest with higher inflation and anxiety over more tax hikes in this Autumn’s Budget likely to mean more caution on spending, despite lower interest rates.”
07:29 AM BST
Britain avoids contraction after strong June
A strong June saved the chancellor was saved from an overall downturn in economic growth during the second quarter of the year.
UK GDP expanded by 0.4pc during the month, which was better than the 0.2pc projected by economists.
It came after the economy contracted by 0.1pc in May and by 0.1pc in April.
The April figure was revised higher from a previous estimate of a 0.3pc decline.
07:23 AM BST
Reeves says ‘more to do’ on economy
Rachel Reeves said there is “more to do” to boost the economy after growth more than halved in the second quarter of the year.
The chancellor said: “Today’s economic figures are positive with a strong start to the year and continued growth in the second quarter. But there is more to do to deliver an economy that works for working people.
“I know that the British economy has the key ingredients for success but has felt stuck for too long.
“That is why we’re investing to rebuild our national infrastructure, cutting back on red tape to get Britain building again and boosting the national minimum wage to make work pay. There’s more to do and today’s figures only fuel my ambition to deliver on our Plan for Change.”

Trump tariffs distorted prior growth figures, says ONS
Donald Trump’s tariff campaign artificially boosted growth in the first quarter of the year, the Office for National Statistics said, as the economy slowed down in the three months to June.
ONS director of economic statistics Liz McKeown said: “Growth slowed in the second quarter after a strong start to the year.
“The economy was weak across April and May, with some activity having been brought forward to February and March ahead of stamp duty and tariff changes, but then recovered strongly in June.
“Across the second quarter as a whole growth was led by services, with computer programming, health and vehicle leasing growing.
“Construction also increased while production fell back slightly.
“Growth for the quarter was also boosted by updated source data for April, which while still showing a contraction, was better than initially estimated.
“Services also drove growth in June with scientific R&D, engineering and car sales all having a strong month.
“Within production, which recovered, manufacture of electronics performed especially well.”

Good morning
Thanks for joining me. Britain’s economic growth was cut in half in the second quarter of the year, official figures show, as businesses grappled with the effects of Rachel Reeves’s tax raid.
Gross domestic product (GDP) – the closely watched measure of economic growth – weakened from 0.7pc in the first quarter to just 0.3pc in the three months to June, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
The performance was better than analyst projections of a decline to 0.1pc.
The slowdown in Britain’s economy comes after the chancellor imposed increases in national insurance contributions on employers in April, as well as rises in the national minimum wage.
Ms Reeves will use her upcoming Budget to try to raise Britain’s dire productivity growth, which has fallen sharply since the financial crisis and threatens to blow an even bigger hole in the public finances.
The decline in growth was also partially due to the unwinding of an economic surge in the three months to March as companies stockpiled goods and completed deals rapidly ahead of Donald Trump’s tariff tirade.
The US president promised to unleash a wave of “reciprocal” tariffs on trading partners from April, causing turmoil in financial markets before the levies were suspended. Here is what you need to know.

What happened overnight
Bitcoin hit a new peak during Asian trading hours as the yen surged after the US treasury secretary said he expects Japan to hike interest rates.
The cryptocurrency rose above its previous July record, briefly exceeding $124,500 before retreating.
Bitcoin’s value has recently soared, fuelled by US regulatory changes under Donald Trump, a strong backer of the crypto sector.
Japan’s currency rose significantly against the dollar, climbing to its highest level since late July after US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said he had told the Bank of Japan (BoJ) governor that it was “behind the curve” in its fight against inflation.
The Bank of Japan, which has long maintained a negative interest rate policy, began monetary tightening in 2024.
Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.4pc to 42,657.94 as investors sold to lock in recent gains that have taken the benchmark to all-time records.

Do not acquire or be acquired. Software must work.
These are the first three of the 10 commandments splashed across bathrooms and breakrooms at Epic Systems' sprawling 1,670-acre campus in Verona, Wisconsin, just southwest of Madison.
It's not the wackiest part of working at the health-care software giant. Once a month, most of the company's 14,000 employees pack into an underground auditorium called Deep Space for a mandatory staff meeting, which some jokingly refer to as ""work church."" Executives go over company news and objectives. They also lead a grammar lesson, such as whether it's OK to end sentences with a preposition and when to use ""who"" or ""whom.""
Epic's CEO is 82-year-old Judy Faulkner, who started the company in a Wisconsin basement in 1979 and has helmed the enterprise ever since. En route to building a business with $5.7 billion in annual revenue, Faulkner has kept significant distance from her tech peers, both physically and otherwise. Epic is about 2,000 miles east of both Seattle and Silicon Valley, and the company has never taken money from venture capitalists.
""I've described her as a female cross between Bill Gates and Willy Wonka,"" Dr. Eric Dickson, CEO of UMass Memorial Health, said in an interview. The hospital system is an Epic customer, Dickson said, adding that he's known Faulkner for around 20 years.
While Wonka is, of course, a fictional character, Gates for many years was the world's wealthiest person, thanks to his enormous stake in Microsoft, before donating his way to 14th on the Forbes billionaires list. At the top of the leaderboard is Tesla's Elon Musk, followed by Oracle's Larry Ellison, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos.
Faulkner ranks 430th, with an estimated net worth of $7.8 billion, based on what Forbes says is her 43% ownership of Epic. The publication lists Epic as among the five largest private U.S. tech software and services companies by revenue.
Epic is best known for its dominance in electronic health record, or EHR, software. An EHR is a digital version of a patient's medical history that's updated by doctors and nurses. About 42% of acute care hospitals in the U.S. use Epic, putting it way ahead of Oracle Health, which is in second place at 23%, according to an April report from Klas Research. Oracle acquired its way into the market with the $28 billion purchase of Cerner, a deal that closed in 2022.
Epic says its technology is used in 3,300 hospitals and 71,000 clinics and by 325 million patients worldwide. Starting Monday, thousands of health-care executives will descend on Epic's corporate headquarters for the company's Users Group Meeting, one of its largest annual on-campus events.
As ubiquitous as Epic's technology is across much of the health-care sector, doctors, hospital administrators, startups and patients have their share of complaints about the software's user experience and its interoperability, or ability to work with other tools.
""With half a million or so clinicians using Epic, there will be some who find it easy and some who find it difficult,"" an Epic spokesperson said in a statement.
Some folks might question Epic's commitment to its third commandment, but there's no doubting the company's allegiance to the first one.
From Epic's early days, Faulkner has been averse to the idea of running a public company and what she's called the ""tyranny of the quarter."" She said she came to that view after researching public companies and reading shareholder comments.
""They were vitriolic, in many cases, because the only thing they were looking at was return on their investment,"" Faulkner told CNBC. ""Sometimes, there's a lot more than that.""
Without the benefit of public stock, Faulkner's wealth doesn't multiply at the same rate as that of her fellow tech founders and CEOs. She's fine with that.
Faulkner, who rarely grants interviews, agreed to sit down for a half-hour chat with CNBC at Epic's headquarters, where office buildings are themed, with many inspired by fiction, including ""The Wizard of Oz,"" ""Alice in Wonderland"" and the Harry Potter stories.
The interview took place in the Andromeda building in a conference room called The Cottage, which is connected to her office. Two of the walls are plastered with quotes such as ""The geek shall inherit the Earth"" and ""All lasting business is built on friendship."" Faulkner's dog Tundra, a fluffy Samoyed, also made an appearance.
'The Trust Protector Committee'
Faulkner celebrated her 82nd birthday Monday. While she has yet to publicly disclose when she plans to step down from her role, Faulkner confirmed that she has a succession plan in place that ensures Epic will remain privately held and constructed firmly as she envisioned long after she's gone.
Faulkner has never sold any of her voting shares, and that stock will be transferred into a trust after her death, according to Faulkner and Epic. The plan for now is that the trust will be governed by a voting committee made up of Faulkner's husband, Dr. Gordon Faulkner, a retired pediatrician; her three children, and five longtime Epic employees, though Faulkner said she might include some additional staffers to make sure enough voices are represented.
Members of the committee can't vote for the company to go public or be acquired, among other rules, as she has previously disclosed. Some of the provisions are less consequential, such as a recommendation that the trust's telephone hold music should be classical.
""I like classical music,"" she said. ""I think when I was a child that it was played in our house a lot, just on the radio, just on the record player.""
For further safekeeping, Faulkner established an oversight board called ""The Trust Protector Committee,"" Epic said, consisting of three health-care leaders — all Epic users. Its job is to sue members of the trust's voting committee if they don't follow the rules.
The names of members of the voting committee and oversight board won't be released, Faulkner told CNBC, but she said she's identified who she would like to participate.
After running Epic for the past 46 years, Faulkner has amassed her fair share of admirers and critics, with some in the latter camp even taking Epic to court.
But Faulkner continues to flout conventional business practices and has built Epic, despite its flaws and complexities, into the most powerful technology company in U.S. health care.
Reflecting on her approach to leadership and decision-making, Faulkner said, ""Just have the guts to do what you know is the right thing to do.""
CNBC spoke with two dozen Epic customers, former Epic employees, industry experts and people close to Faulkner for this article, some of whom asked not to be named in order to speak freely. Details about Faulkner's personal, educational and professional history were obtained from Faulkner directly, her Epic website testimonials, Epic, obituaries, news reports and publicly available records.
Sometimes when I do something that's tough, I think of my mother, who went to jail in her 80s for protesting at a nuclear arms site, and I think, 'I'm my mother's daughter.'Judy FaulknerCEO of Epic
Faulkner and her two siblings grew up in Erlton, New Jersey, now a part of Cherry Hill. Her father, Louis Greenfield, was an independent pharmacist who ran his own store, complete with a soda fountain. Her mother, Del Greenfield, was a peace activist who was involved with the South Jersey Peace Center and the Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility, which shared in the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize for its work in preventing nuclear war.
""Sometimes when I do something that's tough, I think of my mother, who went to jail in her 80s for protesting at a nuclear arms site, and I think, 'I'm my mother's daughter,'"" Faulkner said.
Faulkner's parents, who both died in 2007, are honored at Epic's campus. Employees can get ice cream at Lou's Soda Fountain, while Del's Nobel Prize certificate hangs in the hallway across from The Cottage.
Faulkner discovered a love of math as a seventh grader, when her teacher would leave puzzles on the blackboard each day, she said in one of her testimonials, the short stories and anecdotes she shares once a month on Epic's website. She earned her undergraduate degree in math from Dickinson College in 1965.
After learning how to program during a summer job, Faulkner then enrolled in the University of Wisconsin–Madison's nascent computer science program and was in graduate school there until 1970.
At UW–Madison, Faulkner took a course about computing in medicine that was taught by a pioneering physician, Dr. Warner Slack, one of the first people to recognize the promise of the technology within health care.
Faulkner began working with Slack and his team, and she was tasked with developing a system that could keep track of patient information over time. She eventually built what would become the kernel for Epic, though it took years of urging from potential users before she would actually launch the company in 1979. In the interim, she taught college-level computer science.
When Faulkner finally opened Epic for business, she did so with a small amount of cash from some colleagues at an initial valuation of $70,000. Now the company is worth many billions of dollars, though estimates of its valuation differ.
Some of the original shareholders eventually sold their stock back to the company.
""They got very good returns,"" Faulkner wrote in a testimonial.
An accidental entrepreneur
Faulkner has publicly described herself as ""the accidental CEO.""
She told CNBC she read books and took daylong or multiday courses to learn more about management, business and leadership. But she didn't always follow their advice.
""I never got an MBA, which I think is a really good thing,"" Faulkner said. ""They would have taught me, 'Here's how you do venture capital.' We didn't do it. 'Here's how you go public.' We didn't do it. 'Here's how you do budgets.' We don't have budgets. We say, if you need it, buy it. If you don't need it, don't buy it.""
At the company's Users Group Meeting last year, Faulkner took the stage dressed as a swan, with a plume of feathers in her hair. Every UGM meeting has a theme — this one was ""storytime."" In costume, Faulkner told the thousands of health-care executives in attendance about her aversion to the public market.
""Why be owned by people whose interest is primarily return of equity?"" she said.
She's equally opposed to selling the business, which she makes clear in the company's second commandment.
That hasn't stopped other executives from trying to change her mind.
In 2017, at the Digital Healthcare Innovation Summit in Boston, former General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt revealed that he'd spoken with Faulkner about acquiring Epic.
Faulkner shut him down immediately.
""It was a five-minute meeting — perhaps the shortest in history,"" Immelt said, according to a report from Healthcare IT News. The report said he'd also considered buying Cerner.
Faulkner confirmed the encounter with CNBC.
""Others have asked to come and persuade us, and I've heard our staff say to them, 'Just leave your car running,'"" she said.
Faulkner has said in testimonials that she's avoided buyers in order to remain independent and preserve Epic's unique culture, and she doesn't make acquisitions, calling them a distraction.
But no matter how much she loves her company and her job, at some point, somebody else is going to have to run Epic.
Faulkner has remained mum about who will be her eventual successor, other than to say that the person will have to be a software developer and a longtime Epic employee.
The obvious choice, according to 10 former Epic employees who spoke with CNBC, is Sumit Rana, who was named president of the company last August. The 49-year-old joined Epic right out of college in 1998 and helped build the company's patient portal called MyChart.
Rana, who was a toddler when Faulkner founded Epic, has been participating in more high-profile speaking engagements of late, including representing the company during the opening panel at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Quality Conference in July.
Faulkner declined to say whether Rana is the top contender for the job.
""That's the company's business,"" she said. ""Sumit is a wonderful employee, and he would make a good CEO, but we're not publicly announcing anything.""
While Faulkner doesn't say much about the company's succession plans, she hasn't been shy about her plans for her personal wealth.
In 2015, she signed The Giving Pledge and agreed to donate 99% of her assets to charity, a decision that was inspired in part by a dinner she had with Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett that year.
Buffett created The Giving Pledge with Bill Gates and Gates' then wife, Melinda French Gates, in 2010, encouraging the world's richest people to give away the majority of their wealth.
Following Faulkner's pledge, she launched a family foundation called Roots & Wings with her husband in 2020. Roots & Wings provides grants to nonprofits that support low-income children and families. Faulkner's daughter, Shana Dall'Osto, serves as executive director of the organization.
Faulkner has been selling her nonvoting shares back to the company, giving the proceeds directly to Roots & Wings.
""I've never cashed a single share for myself,"" Faulkner told CNBC.
'Bet the ranch'
Installing an EHR is an extremely complicated and costly project for health systems. If it doesn't go well, it could ""blow up"" the whole business, Dr. Robert Grossman, CEO of NYU Langone Health, told CNBC in an interview.
""We bet the ranch on Epic, let's be very honest,"" he said.
Fans of Epic say the company is fully tuned in to its customers' needs.
""They don't just operate and dial in,"" said Michael Mayo, CEO of Baptist Health in northeast Florida. ""They visit our campus. They're immersed here. They know our teams across our IT [information technology] component and our caregivers. They are in our facilities. And when we went live, which is a pretty scary time, they were in full force here.""
Each health system that uses Epic has a point person called a ""BFF,"" or ""best friend forever,"" who is available to answer questions and help solve problems. Epic doesn't outsource any incoming calls to third parties, the company says, so staff members are responsible for picking up the phone 24/7.
Faulkner also makes herself easily accessible to customers, executives said.
Mike Slubowski, CEO of Trinity Health, which operates 93 hospitals across 26 states, said Faulkner always answers his emails within the day, if not the hour.
She holds recurring meetings with senior health-care executives by phone or video call to answer questions and talk through an organization's specific needs and ideas. Executives told CNBC that Faulkner takes copious notes and is receptive to feedback. If she doesn't have an answer, she promptly calls someone who does.
""She'll stop right there and say, 'Get so-and-so on the phone,'"" said Dickson, of UMass Memorial Health. ""I don't know what so-and-so was doing prior to getting the call, but it's clear that when Judy calls, you drop what you're doing.""
Pete Durlach, corporate vice president for health and life sciences at Microsoft, said he's been in meetings with Epic staffers who have gotten these impromptu calls. Microsoft and Epic have been close partners for around two decades, a relationship that's gotten tighter as cloud and artificial intelligence technologies have advanced, he said.
""People definitely answer the phone when Judy calls,"" Durlach said.
Epic doesn't advertise or have a traditional marketing department; the company has relied heavily on word of mouth. Faulkner has also proven to be an effective salesperson.
Ardent Health CEO Marty Bonick said that when he was debating whether to convert some of his hospitals to using Epic products, Faulkner ultimately helped sway him.
Ardent Health owns 30 hospitals and 280 outpatient care sites across six states. When Bonick joined Ardent in 2020, he said, roughly two-thirds of Ardent's hospitals were using Epic. Bonick said he'd never worked with Epic and wanted to make sure that switching over the remainder of Ardent's hospitals would be worthwhile.
Bonick said he told Faulkner that he'd heard Epic's product was expensive and difficult to implement.
""She came back with a presentation that she delivered personally, and spent probably over 90 minutes,"" said Bonick, who was ultimately sold on the conversion. ""I had to say, 'OK, time out. I've got another meeting to go to,' but she really was not watching the clock.""
Graveyard of competitors
Epic is used by all 20 of the top hospitals from the U.S. News & World Report rankings, and by the country's seven largest health plans, according to the company.
Its dominance has come with plenty of controversy.
Epic faces accusations of anticompetitive practices in two lawsuits from the past year. One was filed in September by data startup Particle Health, which alleges that Epic has used its EHR market power to ""snuff out"" competition in other emerging health-care markets.
Epic said in response it would ""vigorously defend itself against Particle's meritless claims.""
The second lawsuit was filed in May by CureIS Healthcare, a managed care services company that claims Epic has engaged in a ""multi-prong scheme to destroy"" CureIS' business. CureIS alleges Epic has interfered with its customer relationships, blocked access to necessary data and raised unfounded security concerns, according to a complaint.
An Epic spokesperson told CNBC at the time of the filing that the company ""believes in free and fair competition, and we also believe our customers are in the best position to choose the right solutions to meet their needs — whether with Epic or by adopting other products and services.""
Epic's competitors have also long accused the company of being territorial over its data and impeding efforts to share patient information between vendors.
In a blog post last year, Oracle Executive Vice President Ken Glueck wrote that ""everyone in the industry understands that Epic's CEO Judy Faulkner is the single biggest obstacle to EHR interoperability.""
Interoperability, in this case, refers to the exchange of electronic health data from one health-care organization to another. Since health data is siloed, stored across dozens of formats and protected by federal laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, it's a complex undertaking.
Over the years, startups such as Practice Fusion and DrChrono have tried to crack the EHR market with promises of greater openness and more user-friendly products, but they have never become more than niche offerings. Some failed completely.
Epic promotes its own interoperability tools such as Care Everywhere and EpicCare Link, which allows customers and their affiliates to exchange data with one another. Epic also participates in larger data exchange networks.
Attention to detail
One of Epic's biggest feats in its 46 years is managing to attract high-level tech talent far away from the nation's engineering and business hubs, especially given the harsh Midwestern winters in Wisconsin.
That's where Epic's headquarters comes into play. It's a campus that industry executives and former employees likened to a techie's Disney World.
All 28 office buildings are themed. They're clustered into mini-campuses, with names such as Prairie Campus, Wizards Academy Campus and Storybook Campus.
The offices are designed by architecture firm Cuningham, which has also worked on projects at Disney theme parks all over the world. John Cuningham, the founder of the firm, said he's worked with Faulkner for 30 years, and that she's always been very involved in the process.
Epic's first campus, for instance, has more than 80 bathrooms, and Faulkner wanted to know the details of all of them.
""Each one,"" he said. ""Light fixtures, faucets, mirrors, wallpaper, tile, sinks. I mean, I was thinking, 'Oh, she'll last for 10.' She did all 85, and she still does that,"" he said.
I went down the slide, like everybody.Warner ThomasCEO of Sutter Health
On Epic's grounds, a metal wizard stands in the courtyard of a castle, giant chocolate chips mark the entryway to a faux chocolate factory, and a hanging bridge leads to the company's very own treehouse.
Inside a building inspired by ""Alice in Wonderland,"" there's a slide that takes employees into a small room where everything is upside down. It's popular with visitors.
""I was kind of blown away,"" Warner Thomas, CEO of Sutter Health, a nonprofit health system in Northern California, told CNBC about his first trip to Epic's campus. ""I went down the slide, like everybody.""
The buildings are brimming with trinkets, ceramics, mosaics and paintings that Epic employees get to help source. Faulkner recruits a small group of volunteers to go with her to local art fairs and buy decorations for the campus. Some pieces cost thousands of dollars, according to former employees.
Faulkner said she had just returned from an art fair ahead of her interview with CNBC.
'Everybody knows Judy'
Despite the fantastical themes on-site, employees are tasked with very real responsibilities. Since Faulkner places such a strong emphasis on supporting her customers, she holds her staff to high standards.
Most employees work in person five days a week. Hours can be long and burnout is common, former employees say. In June, The Economist analyzed 900 companies across 19 industries, and found that Epic had the worst work-life balance in the software and IT services category. Several former employees told CNBC their work at Epic was all-consuming.
Epic said the average employee works between 44 and 45 hours a week, based on monthly time sheet submissions between June 2024 and June 2025. The company said its turnover rate last year was 7%.
""People at Epic are dedicated and work hard,"" an Epic spokesperson said in a statement.
Epic workers are entrusted with big projects, expected to interact directly with customers and generally take on a lot of responsibility. For some employees, that includes working alongside hospitals as they implement Epic's technology.
""Some of these implementations really sucked,"" said Brendan Keeler, a former Epic employee who frequently blogs about the company online. ""So much of the success of an implementation was just a function of the politics of the hospital.""
Epic recruits the vast majority of its employees straight out of college, so its staff is relatively young. All new staffers go through extensive training, including a five-hour corporate philosophy class where they're taught how to be a successful employee.
Faulkner said she used to teach the class by herself but that she now has help from one or two other people.
Faulkner's influence is present in every corner of Epic's campus, in its product and across much of the health-care industry.
""Everybody knows Judy Faulkner,"" said Thomas, of Sutter Health.
She's still got a lot to do. The health-care industry is reckoning with rising costs, staffing shortages, the impact of AI and the Trump administration's hefty cuts in the areas of medical science and research.
And Faulkner isn't ready to quit.
""It's interesting and it's challenging and it's worthwhile,"" Faulkner said.",23a3801612cd3dade2afa9aa9e5b4e7c,trafilatura,23357,0

Bitcoin's (BTC) flirt with a record high $124,000 on Thursday was followed by a drop that led to it closing last weekend's CME gap at $117,600 after hotter-than-expected PPI inflation data and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s apparent flip-flop on bitcoin purchases for a strategic reserve.
The gap occurs because CME hours for BTC futures don't match bitcoin's 24/7 trading. When the futures market is closed over the weekend, bitcoin's movements can create a discontinuity in prices on the CME chart. While filling the gap is a recurring pattern in market behavior, there's not guarantee it will take place.
Bitcoin has now set four all-time highs in 2025. Importantly, the magnitude of pullbacks following these peaks has been shrinking. After it hit $109,000 in January, BTC fell 30% to $76,000 by April. In May, the $112,000 high was followed by a 12% drop in June. July’s $123,000 peak led to a 9% decline. Most recently, August’s $124,000 high has so far seen only a 7% percent pullback, though we're only one day in.
Looking ahead, Friday’s U.S. retail sales report is forecast at 0.7% month-over-month, which would mark the strongest reading since March. A stronger-than-expected number could further undermine expectations for a September rate cut.
Further out, attention turns to the end of August when $12 billion in bitcoin options are set to expire on Deribit. The majority of open call options are concentrated between the $120,000 and $124,000 strike prices, suggesting that if bitcoin trades near these levels, it would align with the positioning of many derivatives traders.

The crypto market drop in the past 24 hours sparked around $1 billion worth of liquidations, with the majority occurring on ETH trading pairs, according to Coinglass data.
Ether is trading back at $4,630 while a number of altcoins like TIA, CRV and OP all lost more than 7%.
One asset, however, stood out: AERO rose 4.5% despite relentless waves of selling pressure and liquidations.
AERO is the native token of decentralized exchange Aerodrome, which recently benefited from integration with Coinbase, allowing the exchange's customer base to trade directly on the DEX via the Coinbase app.
Trading volume on Aerodrome jumped as a result, with $1.1 billion worth of crypto changing hands to mark the DEX's largest day since February, according to DefiLlama.
Aerodrome is the largest native part of the Base ecosystem, with $612 million in total value locked (TVL).
The only other protocols with a higher totals are Morpho and Aave, both of which are distributed across multiple blockchains while Aerodrome is on Base alone.
Derivatives Positioning
Open interest (OI) across top derivatives venues remains elevated, with bitcoin (BTC) sitting at $32.5 billion, just shy of its all-time high. Bitcoin OI is led by Binance ($13.8 billion) and Bybit ($9.3 billion).
The elevated open interest is supported by steady gains in BTC three-month annualized basis, currently 8%-9% across all exchanges, according to Velo data. Compared with fourth-quarter 2024 levels of 15%, there is still room to grow.
In options, implied volatility (IV) across different option maturities is upward sloping (contango), with near-term IV low at around 20% , Velo data show. The line rises toward 50% for maturities in mid 2026, a sign of increasing uncertainty further out.
Looking at the past day's flows for puts vs calls, the ratio is 50:50, implying no extreme directional bias at the moment.
Funding rate APRs across major perpetual swap venues are muted at around an annualized 5%-7%, pulling back from the elevated levels seen in the run up to bitcoin's record high on Thursday.
This pattern suggests that the rally was largely spot driven, with an influx of shorts helping offset long demand. With funding now relatively low, there is room for fresh leveraged longs to enter the market, potentially adding momentum to the next move.
Coinglass data shows $960 million in 24 hour liquidations, skewed 85% towards longs. ETH ($342 million), BTC ($162 million) and others ($116 million) were the leaders in terms of notional liquidations. Binance liquidation heatmap indicates $117,091 as a core liquidation level to monitor, in case of further price drops.

Technical Analysis
Bitcoin dominance recently fell below the key historical level of 60%.
In the past, such drops have often preceded significant altcoin rallies. However, given the current lack of a strong catalyst for a full-fledged altcoin season, the key question is the potential severity of the drop.
The current level suggests that a selective or minor 'alt season' is underway. It does not yet imply a major, market-wide shift in the way previous cycles have.

The total value locked (TVL) on yield-trading platform Pendle has surged past the $8 billion mark, representing a roughly 30% increase this month and positioning it as the ninth largest protocol by TVL.
The majority of the growth has taken place on the Ethereum blockchain.
A key factor driving growth is its close relationship with Ethena's stablecoin. Some 68% of Pendle's TVL is tied to USDe and sUSDe, making the protocol a direct proxy for the growth of Ethena's ecosystem and a bet on the continued expansion of high-yield, stablecoin-based strategies in the market.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released its Producer Price Index (PPI) on Thursday, revealing an unexpected 0.9 percent surge in July compared to the previous month. It was the biggest monthly increase since 2022, and well above the projected growth of 0.3 percent.
July’s increase pushed annual index growth to 3.3 percent, the most significant 12-month bump since the 3.4 percent announced in February.
What does it all mean? Well, compared to Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released Wednesday, the price index for the American manufacturing sector is up—way up. CPI data showed that inflation accelerated for shoppers from June to July at a rate of 0.2 percent, and an annualized rate of 2.7 percent. While consumers have indeed clocked higher prices at retail, inflation was cooler than analysts and economists expected.
The divergence between the CPI and the PPI suggests that until very recently, companies were largely eating the cost of President Donald Trump’s tariffs rather than passing them along to their clients. That may not be true for much longer.
“Tariff-exposed goods are rising at a rapid clip, indicating that the willingness and ability of businesses to absorb tariff costs may be waning,” Oxford Economics analysts wrote in a research note on Thursday, referencing the PPI. “We anticipate broader signs of tariff-driven inflation in the data over time as inventories roll over and firms adjust pricing under margin pressure.”
With the president’s “reciprocal” tariffs kicking in last week and producers feeling squeezed by higher import costs, American consumers may be in for much steeper prices in the months to come.
“As of now, we have absorbed the costs of the increased tariffs. We know this is not sustainable. We will be having a price increase soon to offset increase costs for trimmings, cloth, tariffs and labor,” Alexa Roberti, director of sales for Rochester, N.Y. custom suiting and apparel company Adrian Jules, told Sourcing Journal.
Adrian Jules brings in much of its fabrics and inputs from countries throughout Europe and Asia—now, all subject to double-digit duty increases. But there aren’t many onshore options to turn to.
“In the ‘70s much of the U.S.A. textile industry was offshored to keep labor costs down,” Roberti said. “Consequentially, the internal trimmings and exterior cloth was also made outside the U.S.A.,” and importing that arsenal of inputs is essential to business continuity.
Adding insult the injury of added tariff costs, some of Adrian Jules’ overseas suppliers began notifying the company this spring that the duties would make doing business cost-prohibitive—even suggesting that the factory source from other countries and producers with a lower tariff burden.
“They were looking out for our best interests, but where are we to go?” Roberti said. “Tariffs have been increased to most of our trading partners; changing suppliers would just mean we would pay tariffs to a different country.”
The firm, which sells private-label goods to New York City brick-and-mortars and runs its own custom suiting shops, is clinging to the upsides of the turmoil of the past eight months.
“There is a positive to this. We are seeing an increase in the demand for Made in U.S.A. garments. We just completed a strong Q2, and we are bullish on Q3,” Roberti said. “I am hopeful that once all the dust has settled, American manufacturing has a resurgence, and the U.S.A. is in a stronger, more prosperous position for citizens and businesses.”
Newark, N.J. manufacturer Unionwear, which crafts hats, bags, promotional products and military gear, is also contending with higher costs—and working hard not to shift the sting of bloated prices to its customers.
“We are definitely absorbing tariffs,” owner and president Mitch Cahn said.
Part of the struggle stems from the changeability of tariff rates, revised or threatened on a near-weekly basis by the White House.
Within the company’s business-to-business arm, “We are selling goods before we order them, but the tariffs are changing after we have received an order but before we are shipping,” Cahn said, illuminating the complexity of setting prices. “We are hedging a little bit and making sure we have alternative sources, but there really is no other way to do this.”
According to Cahn, the firm buys some of its fabric from India, which is slated to be hit with another round of 25 percent tariffs later this month, bringing the total reciprocal duty rate to a staggering 50 percent. “We are planning to absorb the cost increases if necessary, but most likely we will shift purchasing to Pakistan,” he said.
Down the road elsewhere in Newark, Mitch Gambert, CEO and owner of Gambert Shirtmakers, is fretting over the future of his business due to the upheaval caused by the administration’s ever-evolving trade policy.
“It’s become borderline unmanageable,” he said. “It’s been literally eight months of utter confusion.”
The custom and wholesale shirting supplier hasn’t been able to raise prices despite crippling increases to overhead costs (due predominantly to tariffs), along with compounding logistical challenges.
“The way that we work with our retail partners is that they set their [prices] for the season at the beginning of every season. So to go in and change pricing on them…it’s a real disruption to the flow of business,” he said.
Gambert is also ambivalent about raising prices when consumer confidence is in the doldrums. “I’m afraid that when the prices do go up, that people are going to be so sticker shocked that it’s just going to have an even deeper impact on sales,” he said, noting that Gambert Shirtmakers’ sales ledger is “hovering at 30 percent less than where we should be” at this time of year. That doesn’t bode well for fall or holiday, traditionally the manufacturer’s boom time.
Gambert has even had to reduce working hours due to the slowdown—a concession he’s making in order to avoid layoffs within his 90-worker facility.
“I have not had any surging American production because of tariffs, none whatsoever,” he said. That’s because of a simple truth that thus far, the administration has neglected to acknowledge.
“It would be different if raw material prices weren’t going up—then I could be more competitive with Asia,” he said. “But with raw material prices going up, my prices are just going up in perfect sequence with the Asian prices. There’s no competitive advantage for me.”
With steep new tariffs on trade partners across the globe compounding existing duties, something’s got to give, he said. Even countries subject to the 10 percent universal baseline tariff could still see prohibitively high rates on certain types of products.
Gambert Shirtmakers imports much of its woven cotton for shirting from Europe, and the company pays a variegated rate between 18 percent and 19 percent depending on the characteristics of the fabric. Those same products will see added duties of 15 percent under the new tariff regime.
“We’re also getting hit with the increases on our button supply,” which comes from China, he said. The manufacturer brought in a “huge shipment” of product before the tariffs took effect, but charged its customers, like Gambert Shirtmakers, for the added cost of transportation and warehousing in the U.S. “It forced me to put out a lot of cash up front to beat these tariffs before they hit, which absolutely kills cash flow. I mean, it’s like a death kiss,” he added.
It’s not just new costs that have thrown a wrench into the company’s value chain. Longtime mill partners in Europe that once offered low MOQs and flexible terms are seeking out safer bets, opting for bigger sales to prominent players with more robust cash flow. “I might do, let’s say, $400,000 of business with one mill in the course of a year. But now you have the big brands who are doing $2.5 million of business with the same mill. Who’s going to take priority?” he said.
Gambert is also facing a complex problem that many U.S. makers are contending with: their place in the market. At $280 or $350 a pop, the firm’s custom shirts are a carefully considered purchase, not an impulse buy. “For a lot of people who purchase my products, when they look at a gallon of milk at $11 and a full tank of gas at $90, those things are going to take precedence in their life,” he said.
For that reason, raising prices—however necessary—is a highly unpalatable prospect.
It’s not just East Coast manufacturers feeling the burn. Across the country in Los Angeles, Lalaland owner Alex Zar is taking creative license to his business model in a bid to mitigate costs.
The founder of L.A.’s largest leather goods factory said he’s seen increased demand for local production in recent months as the Trump trade agenda has taken hold. “However, it’s a double-edged sword—tariffs are impacting all our material imports, which in turn is driving up the cost of finished products,” he said.
The full-service manufacturer is pulling all the levers to make up for cost increases. “We are working closely with our clients to design products so that materials make up the largest portion of the finished product cost, while labor is minimized,” he said. “This helps absorb some of the increased costs from imported materials by reducing the labor share.”
In L.A., minimum wage is $17.87—far higher than most of country. Zar is uniquely positioned, having invested heavily in cutting-edge production technology and dabbling in automated processes that reduce the need for a high factory headcount.
The aim is to ensure that final product costs are aligned with overseas production—an objective the designer, merchandiser and factory collaborate to achieve during product development, he said. But it’s not easy, especially when domestic capacity for manufacturing of footwear and handbags is so limited.
“Many factories have shut down as production shifted overseas, which limits available resources for local manufacturing,” he said—ergo, the need to rely on foreign partners for the parts and pieces that make up his creations.
Another L.A. native and owner of Lefty Production Co., Marta Miller, co-signed the observation that raw material costs have risen “across the board” since the onset of the trade wars.
“Fabrics, trims, and certain imported components are all more expensive now, and machinery pricing is also increasing,” she said, attributing the increases to new duties and other supply chain constraints.
“China is by far the most impactful when it comes to tariffs,” Miller, who also owns Austin-based manufacturing body Stitch Texas, said. “Many of the fabrics, trims, and certain categories of apparel we source have traditionally come from China, and the duties there have had a significant impact on landed costs,” she added, noting that sourcing from Vietnam and India has also been challenging.
“I have tried to avoid raising prices dramatically for my clients,” the factory owner said. “My goal is to manage these cost increases in a way that softens the impact on their businesses, so they can continue to grow. That said, modest adjustments have been necessary in some cases, and I would expect to see some additional increases if tariffs and input costs remain high.”
Despite the intricacies of maintaining a balance sheet with ever-shifting line items, Miller maintains that tariffs have, on the whole, given her a leg up.
“Clients who previously defaulted to overseas production are now giving serious consideration to producing here at home, and I am leaning into that opportunity,” she said. Emphasizing speed-to-market, lower shipping costs and better quality control has indeed driven new business to California and Texas over the past eight months, Miller added.
“The increased cost of overseas production for certain categories has encouraged some brands to explore domestic manufacturing for the first time. We’ve seen new clients coming to Lefty Production Co. and Stitch Texas specifically because the tariff environment has tipped the scale toward U.S. production,” she explained. “It’s an unexpected win that’s helping offset some of the challenges.”",b725ac3bdf9ec91127f2d1520710d034,trafilatura,12214,0

In yesterday’s trading session, Wall Street’s major indices closed mixed. Tapestry (TPR) plunged over -15% and was the top percentage loser on the S&P 500 after the fashion-brand company issued below-consensus FY26 EPS guidance. Also, Deere & Company (DE) slumped more than -6% after the agricultural and construction equipment maker cut the upper end of its full-year net income guidance. In addition, Cisco Systems (CSCO) fell over -1% after the computer networking company gave a cautious full-year forecast. On the bullish side, Eli Lilly (LLY) rose over +3% after the drugmaker announced it would raise the list price of its Mounjaro weight-loss treatment in the U.K. by as much as 170%.
Economic data released on Thursday showed that the U.S. producer price index for final demand rose +0.9% m/m and +3.3% y/y in July, much stronger than expectations of +0.2% m/m and +2.5% y/y. Also, the core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose +0.9% m/m and +3.7% y/y in July, stronger than expectations of +0.2% m/m and +2.9% y/y. In addition, the number of Americans filing for initial jobless claims in the past week fell by -3K to 224K, compared with the 225K expected.
“This doesn’t slam the door on a September rate cut, but based on the market’s initial reaction, the opening may be a little smaller than it was a couple of days ago,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley.
St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said on Thursday that it is still too soon for him to determine whether to support an interest rate cut at next month’s meeting. Asked whether a 50 basis point cut could be warranted next month, Musalem said that, in his view, such a move would be “unsupported by the current state of the economy and the outlook for the economy.” Also, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that she is not in favor of a 50 basis point rate cut at the September meeting, saying that “would send off an urgency signal that I don’t feel about the strength of the labor market.”
U.S. rate futures have priced in a 92.6% probability of a 25 basis point rate cut and a 7.4% chance of no rate change at the next FOMC meeting in September.
Investors await a meeting later today in Alaska between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine. Trump cautioned there would be “very harsh consequences” if Putin failed to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine, while suggesting the possibility of a follow-up meeting that could include Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and some European leaders. Meanwhile, Putin looked to strengthen his relationship with Trump ahead of their summit, commending the U.S. leader’s attempts to mediate an end to the war in Ukraine and offering the prospect of economic cooperation along with a new arms control agreement.
On the economic data front, all eyes are focused on U.S. Retail Sales data, which is set to be released in a couple of hours. Economists, on average, forecast that Retail Sales will show a +0.6% m/m rise in July, the same as the previous month.
Investors will also focus on U.S. Core Retail Sales data, which rose +0.5% m/m in June. Economists expect the July figure to be +0.3% m/m.
The University of Michigan’s U.S. Consumer Sentiment Index will be closely monitored today. Economists forecast that the preliminary August figure will stand at 61.9, compared to 61.7 in July.
U.S. Industrial Production and Manufacturing Production data will be released today. Economists expect Industrial Production to be unchanged m/m and Manufacturing Production to drop -0.1% m/m in July, compared to the June figures of +0.3% m/m and +0.1% m/m, respectively.

U.S. Export and Import Price Indexes will be released today as well. Economists anticipate the export price index to rise +0.1% m/m and the import price index to rise +0.1% m/m in July, compared to the previous figures of +0.5% m/m and +0.1% m/m, respectively.
In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.289%, down -0.09%.
The Euro Stoxx 50 Index is up +0.61% this morning on optimism that the U.S.-Russia summit could serve as a first step toward brokering a peace deal in Ukraine. Mining and chemical stocks outperformed on Friday. The benchmark index is on track to post its second consecutive weekly gain, supported by a largely upbeat domestic earnings season and expectations for monetary easing in the U.S. U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are set to meet later today in Alaska for their first in-person talks since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Mohit Kumar, chief European strategist at Jefferies International, said, “We do expect some progress in today’s meeting and a path set for further discussions between Russia and the U.S.,” adding that “if we move towards a peace deal, it would be positive for the European markets.” In other news, the EU and U.S. are moving toward finalizing the trade deal that President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed to in July. In corporate news, NKT A/S (NKT.C.DX) climbed over +8% after updating its full-year guidance. At the same time, Pandora A/S (PNDOR.C.DX) tumbled over -12% after the Danish jewellery maker posted weaker-than-expected Q2 organic revenue.
The European economic data slate is mainly empty on Friday.
Asian stock markets today settled in the green. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed up +0.83%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed up +1.71%.
China’s Shanghai Composite Index ended higher today as weak economic data from the country bolstered expectations of new stimulus measures from Beijing to support growth. Real estate stocks climbed on Friday after Bloomberg News reported that China is planning to mobilize companies owned by the central government in Beijing to purchase unsold homes from struggling property developers. The benchmark index notched its biggest weekly gain in nine months. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics released on Friday showed that China’s economy weakened across the board in July, with factory activity, investment, and retail sales disappointing, indicating that Beijing’s crackdown on destructive price wars and the spillover effects of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs are weighing on the world’s second-largest economy. Also, the country’s prolonged housing market downturn continued to weigh on growth, with the latest figures showing declining home prices and property investment. In addition, unemployment inched higher in July as millions of new graduates entered a sluggish labor market. China’s top leaders refrained from introducing any major new stimulus measures in July, a cautious approach that economists say will need to be reconsidered to keep this year’s 5% growth target attainable. ING economist Lynn Song said on Friday that “the slump in July’s data was more pronounced than expected,” noting that China needs to roll out additional stimulus measures. In other news, the Financial Times reported on Thursday that China is cautioning Western companies against stockpiling rare earths, warning they could face even greater shortages. In corporate news, JD.com slid over -3% in Hong Kong after the e-commerce operator posted a 51% drop in Q2 net income.
The Chinese July Industrial Production rose +5.7% y/y, weaker than expectations of +6.0% y/y.
The Chinese July Retail Sales rose +3.7% y/y, weaker than expectations of +4.6% y/y.
The Chinese Fixed Asset Investment rose +1.6% y/y in the January-July period, weaker than expectations of +2.7% y/y.
The Chinese July Unemployment Rate was 5.2%, weaker than expectations of 5.1%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index closed sharply higher today, posting a new record high, after the nation’s economy expanded faster than expected last quarter. Financial stocks led the gains on Friday, supported by expectations that a Bank of Japan rate hike might come sooner rather than later. The benchmark index posted strong gains for the week. Preliminary government data released on Friday showed that Japan’s economy expanded far more than expected in the second quarter, driven by robust domestic demand, strengthening the case for the BOJ to raise its benchmark rate again this year and offering embattled Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba some rare good news. Separately, data showed that Japan’s June industrial production was unexpectedly revised upward. Meanwhile, Benjamin Shatil, an economist at JPMorgan Securities, said, “We continue to think that solid domestic demand data will necessitate a shift in the BOJ’s narrative that tariff-related uncertainty is weighing on activity,” adding that he expects the central bank to raise its policy rate in October. According to the latest Bloomberg survey of economists tracking the BOJ, about 42% of respondents said they anticipate a hike in October, while one-third expect a move in January. Governor Kazuo Ueda said last month that policymakers will continue to raise borrowing costs if they are confident domestic demand will remain stable. In other news, foreign investors bought a net 489.3 billion yen ($3.32 billion) worth of Japanese stocks in the week through August 9th, fueled by a series of strong earnings that propelled domestic equities to new record highs, according to data from Japan’s Ministry of Finance. The Nikkei Volatility Index, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed up +0.20% to 24.61.
The Japanese GDP has been reported at +0.3% q/q and +1.0% y/y in the second quarter, stronger than expectations of +0.1% q/q and +0.4% y/y.
The Japanese June Industrial Production rose +2.1% m/m, stronger than expectations of +1.7% m/m.

",2025-08-16 00:45:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"I joined Michelle Rook on AgWeb's Markets Now to break down the latest trends in the wheat, soybean, corn markets, interest rates, and the stock market. Watch the full interview here.
Michelle Rook: Welcome to Markets Now. I'm Michelle Rook with Darin Newsom, Senior Market Analyst with Barchart. Seeing a lot of red on the board in grain and livestock futures trade this morning. Darin, I want to start off talking about soybeans. We had a big three-day rally, 60, 65 cents of gains. Are we just seeing some profit-taking, you think here? Did we run up into some chart resistance?
Darin Newsom: Number one, I don't know the technicals really have anything to do with markets these days. My blink reaction to this is, maybe the reality of real fundamentals are sinking back in. We've seen soybeans spiked by, I'll be nice and just say a social media post on Monday or early Monday morning. Then that was followed up by this past Wednesday's USDA imaginary numbers with some very interesting figures for the soybean that really test the limits of someone's imagination. It is what it is. The design was-- the intention for both of those events was to trigger algorithm buying, and that's what happened.
Now here we are on Thursday morning, the buy orders have been filled, market was pushed higher, didn't really change anything on the charts, didn't really change anything. It certainly didn't change anything fundamentally. Thursday morning, a little bit of a vacuum underneath these things starting to sink lower again as we head towards the next weekend. The focus will be back on whether crop still looks good. What future spreads have been telling us all along, that the US is going to produce more soybeans than what it has demand for. That's the bottom line.
Michelle: Yes, especially if we don't get China back in the market and it looks like we've kicked the can down the road again here, huh?
Darin: Again, this gets so much attention, but China's not going to be back in the market. There were two stories out Monday from the same media company. The first one that came out around midnight just basically reiterated what we've known since 2018, that Chinese buyers have done the math to basically deal the US out of the global soybean game. That hasn't changed. The only thing is, the situation continues to go down that same path. China has a long-term view of anything that is called war. They take a long-term approach. The US has an attention span of 15 minutes.
Four hours later, the story came out of same media group, of what the US president posted to social media. Now, I understand that in the last decade, social media has become official policy. It doesn't have to go through Congress, doesn't have to go through the channels that we used to think were in place, the checks and balances, and so on. It's what is posted to social media. The reality is, again, and we can see in the futures, we can see-- excuse me, we can see in the spreads, we can see in the market in general, supply and demand situation hasn't changed.
China's not going to buy unless there is some sort of weather problem in Brazil. Then maybe that increases the attractiveness of US markets. Until then, I just don't see it changing.
Michelle: We also had cancellations of old crop soybean exports. We had cancellations of old crop corn exports. Corn right now, new crop looks pretty good. Overall, do you think that-- is demand even good enough to chew through as big a crop as we have on corn?
Darin: Let's look at what's happened in calculated full commercial carry. Both corn and soybean new crop spreads, new crop forward curves saw the percent of calculated full commercial carry increase during July and through the early part of August. That tells us right there that demand is not expected demand by the commercial side, not necessarily by the fund side. They just simply follow with the fundamentals. They will eventually follow the fundamentals. On the commercial side, those that actually matter, those who are, say, exporters or end users or large terminals or so on, the opinion is that expected supplies continue to gain on projected demand. That's what we see in both markets.
It doesn't matter if USDA comes out and says, US is going to produce 18 billion bushels or whatever it was of corn and 5 billion or 3 billion bushels of soybeans, whatever the numbers were. I don't even know. The bottom line is there's going to be more supplies in relation to demand. That hasn't changed. No, demand is not keeping up. The fact that we got some cancellations through the first part of August isn't overly surprising. We're into the last month of the marketing year for corn and soybeans. If it hasn't been shipped by now, it's probably not going to be, which makes USDA's move to, in its latest guesses, increase old crop export demand for both corn and soybeans that much more humorous.
Michelle: Weather, obviously, has been bearish for this market, and I can't remember an August where we've had better weather, at least to start off with.
Darin: Yes, this has been incredible across the Plains, across the Midwest. Love them or hate them, for what they're worth, US Drought Monitor comes out every week, every Thursday morning. This time around, again, similar to last week, you just don't see any hotspots really across all of the plains, from the northern border of North Dakota all the way down to the southwest border of Texas. There's a little bit in the far southwest edge of Texas, but you take it all the way across the Midwest over into Indiana, Ohio, and so on, and there just aren't any problem areas. Weather has been as close to ideal this time around, at a time when the US probably needed some weather problems.
Again, we can see in the market that, again, the commercial side just isn't overly concerned about what people still make up, still try to get people to trade these make-believe weather issues or growing issues that the crops just simply haven't had this year.
Michelle: The funds haven't had any weather threats to buy on either, but let's also talk a little bit about, we had CPI numbers out earlier last week. Actually, they looked fairly favorable, but PPI was out this morning, 0.9%, that was well above expectations. Does this take a rate cut in September off the table for the Fed?
Darin: I think it's an interesting discussion. I know there's dictates out there that says the Fed is going to have to cut rates, but the market isn't showing us that. As we watched the Fed fund futures forward curve, we saw that it was about a 50-50 chance that we would see a rate cut at the September meeting. This continues to get pushed back each month, almost as we approach the next meeting. Really, the meeting that's been in the spotlight for the last number of months has been the October get-together by the Federal Open Market Committee.
Do I think that the CPI and PPI numbers-- I know the economists watch this closely, but markets certainly didn't believe that we were going to see a cut, and I would still argue that there's a better chance for a rate hike before we get the next cut. Now, I'm going on a limb, I always talk about how I watch the market and let the market dictate my actions and these sorts of things, and the market certainly isn't indicating right now that we're going to see a rate hike, except for the fact that the US dollar technically turned bullish at the end of July. Again, can we believe what we see on charts anymore? I don't think so.
For now, I'm just going to stay on the sidelines and say we're not going to see a rate cut, at least from what I'm seeing in the markets at the September meeting.
Michelle: We're still not seeing the inflation show up in all of the data yet. There's a little bit of a lag effect from these tariffs. When does that show up here, Darin?
Darin: Again, these are government numbers and similar to the way USDA can change planted acres by two, three, four million, whatever it was, government inflation numbers don't necessarily have to be grounded in reality. Everyone that I hear from who goes to the store, and it doesn't matter if we're talking about a grocery store, retail store, implement dealer, tractor supply, whatever, prices are high. Inflation is real. We have seen increased inflation. The constant threat of tariffs and the ongoing trade wars have had an effect. They've continued to have an effect.
This is what sparked the initial flames of inflation between 2016 and 2018, and they've only gotten worse. Inflation is here. This is one of the reasons why I believe the Fed's still going to have to possibly raise rates before they cut rates, because that's the defense against inflation. That is to raise rates to hopefully strengthen the underlying currency, something that the US needs to see at this point.
Michelle: With what you just said and the fact that the stock market has continued to crack out new highs, does that keep the funds away from the grain market? Stock market still looks more attractive investment-wise, doesn't it?
Darin: It does for now. Yes. Markets that go to new highs have a hard time being considered bearish. We've seen new all-time highs posted in the S&P 500 and NASDAQ here through the midpoint of August. The Dow Jones, not yet. As you and I were talking about beforehand, the Dow Jones is our grandparents, I should say, stock index, more attention is now being paid to the S&P and NASDAQ as it should be. This comes down to the discussion of funds need a fundamental reason to get interested in the commodity sector. Again, this is where they can look for supply and demand. They could trade the weather. They can trade global crises and these sorts of things.
Outside of gold being a safe haven market and crude oil just fluctuating down near its lows in the low 60s, there's no fundamental reason for funds to get interested in the grains sector in general, particularly in the big three markets of corn, soybeans, and wheat. Until that changes, why go into grains when you've got the livestock sector sitting over there, a red-hot cattle market? Cash continues to go higher, continuing to tell us that supply and demand is way out of line in favor of demand over supply. If funds are going to move anywhere into commodities at this point, it's going to be into the livestock sector.
There's no fundamental reason for them to be interested in grains. Stock markets are doing well, livestock are hot. There are so many other markets that provide a better opportunity.
Michelle: No, not a good outlook for sure. All right. Thanks so much. Darin Newsom, Senior Market Analyst with Barchart. That is Markets Now.

Stock market value: $8.85 billion ($12.98 per share)
Activist: Engine Capital
Ownership: ~3%
Average Cost: n/a
Activist Commentary: Engine Capital is an experienced activist investor led by Managing Partner Arnaud Ajdler. He is a former partner and senior managing director at Crescendo Partners. Engine's history is to send letters and/or nominate directors but settle rather quickly.
What's happening
On Aug. 11, Engine sent a letter calling on Avantor's board to focus on commercial and operational excellence, demonstrate organic growth, reduce costs, optimize the portfolio, refresh the board and use free cash flow to repurchase stock. Engine noted that the company can alternatively consider a sale.
Behind the scenes
Avantor is a market leading distributor of life science tools and products for the life sciences and advanced technology industries. The company is comprised of two segments: laboratory solutions (LSS) (67% of revenue) and bioscience production (BPS) (33% of revenue). LSS is one of the three top life sciences distributors in the world (Thermo Fisher and Merck KGaA being the other two).
BPS is a supplier of high-purity materials and is the leading supplier of medical-grade silicones. Despite being one of the few scaled global life science tool distribution platforms, the company has vastly underperformed. At its 2021 investor day, management projected earnings per share above $2 for 2025; and at its 2023 investor day, management targeted an EBITDA margin exceeding 20%. Now in 2025, these currently stand at 96 cents per share and 11.8%, respectively. Consequently, Avantor's share price has declined 53.96%, 59.69%, and 43.41% over the past 1-, 3- and 5-year periods, as of Engine's announcement Monday.
Engine believes that Avantor's significant underperformance is a consequence of self-inflicted mistakes rooted in a flawed leadership team and framework. A complex matrix organizational structure and resultant lack of accountability have led to mass leadership turnover, including Avantor's CEO, CFO and both segment leaders within the past three years, contributing to a dysfunctional decision-making process and inefficient employee structure.
The biggest casualty of this rocky management team is LSS, which has lost significant profitability and market share to its peers. Specifically, poor capital allocation decisions have destroyed significant value. In 2020 and 2021, Avantor spent a total of $3.8 billion to acquire Ritter, Masterflex and RIM Bio – companies that were notably purchased during the peak of the pandemic when life sciences businesses were trading at exceptionally high multiples. Applying Avantor's next 12 months 10x multiple to the 28x average acquisition price implies over $2.4 billion in lost value on these acquisitions, contributing to the company's high leverage.
On top of that, despite LSS's ongoing underperformance and the need for strong leadership, from June 2024 to April 2025, LSS was left without a leader due to a non-compete lawsuit involving the hiring of its new segment leader, underscoring the operational dysfunction that has been taking place at the company.
But perhaps the nail in the coffin for this management team and board is that despite this cascading set of errors and the internal knowledge of these forecasted losses, they were still given a way out. In 2023, the company was approached by Ingersoll Rand to be acquired at an estimated $25-$28 per share, a 20%-35% premium of the share price at the time, yet the board inexplicably rebuffed this approach. Today, Avantor trades at just under $13 per share.
Enter Engine, who has announced an approximately 3% position in Avantor and is urging the board to focus the organization on commercial and operational excellence, demonstrate organic growth, reduce costs, optimize the portfolio, refresh the board and use free cash flow to repurchase its own stock.
Engine points out that Avantor's reported $6.8 billion in revenue was stretched across 6 million stock keeping units, while Thermo's peer segment achieves similar revenue with less than half the SKUs, indicating a large opportunity, specifically within LSS, to optimize the portfolio by concentrating purchases to improve inventory turns, rebates and margins.
Divesting non-core assets is another way to optimize the portfolio. For BPS, certain facilities operate in periods of extended downtime, limiting growth. For LSS, subscale facilities in smaller geographies may be more valuable to a competitor, and the same goes for some of the assets purchased under Avantor's aforementioned acquisition spree.
On the cost discipline side, Avantor's history of poor M&A and its low valuation should limit its accretive M&A opportunities, and while the company is on the path to reduce leverage below 3x, the market remains concerned that once this is achieved, they will simply resume this costly M&A strategy. Engine argues that free cash flow should instead be allocated evenly to share repurchases and debt reduction.
Additionally, executive compensation is also a concern. In 2024, despite organic revenue declining by 2% and a 7% share price decline, the board awarded CEO Michael Stubblefield 110% of his target annual bonus, underscoring the need to align these management incentives with shareholder value creation.
Engine believes that all of these changes would be best implemented with a comprehensive board refreshment. Adding directors with executive leadership, capital allocation, and distribution expertise to replace board members that have overseen years of value destruction, likely targeting chairman Jonathan Peacock specifically, should signal to the market the start of a new chapter. Engine believes that if these changes are properly implemented that Avantor shares would be worth between $22 and $26 per share by the end of 2027.
As a secondary option, Engine suggests that if a standalone path does not appear viable then the board should consider selling the entire company or splitting LSS and BPS into separate entities.
When Avantor acquired VWR, which is now the core of the LSS business, it was valued at about 12x EBITDA, or $6.5 billion, and BPS peers trade at a median of 17x EBITDA. Neither of these businesses' valuations correspond to what Avantor trades at, roughly 8x EBITDA, and it's possible that a strategic path could become the best way to unlock this value on a risk-adjusted basis. If this were to become the case, there is likely to be both private and strategic interest. New Mountain Capital previously owned Avantor prior to its IPO and still maintains an approximately 2% position. Strategics, like Ingersoll, would likely be interested as well, especially at a significant discount to what they once offered. Engine believes that Avantor could sell between $17 to $19 per share.
Overall, Engine makes not only a compelling case that major change is needed at Avantor, but also a clear multipath plan forward. While some of these changes are already underway: a new CEO is set to start next week and management announced a $400 million cost-cutting initiative, the sheer volume of change required here is unlikely to occur by Engine's 2027 estimate.
Engine's plan includes strengthening execution, instilling a culture of cost discipline, improving capital allocation, evaluating the company's portfolio, aligning executive compensation to shareholder value creation and refreshing the board. Engine's plan is the right one, but this is a company whose top line and operating margins have been in decline since 2022 and refreshing a board, instilling a new culture, reversing declining revenue and operating margins and evaluating and executing asset sales, many of which cannot be done simultaneously, is something that will likely take much longer than two years, particularly with the director nomination window not opening until Jan. 8. Moreover, the kind of change that Engine calls for here is generally not the kind of change that comes from an amicable settlement.

The Kansas City Fed’s annual Economic Policy Symposium kicks off Thursday evening in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Chair Jerome Powell in remarks on Friday is expected to unveil the Fed’s new policy framework — the strategy it’ll use to achieve its inflation and employment goals.
Powell may also drop some hints about the Fed’s thinking ahead of its September policy meeting. Officials have left interest rates on hold so far this year as they wait to see how the Trump administration’s tariffs impact the economy.
With inflation still above the Fed’s 2% goal and signs of a slowdown in the labor market, policymakers have become divided on when to resume rate cuts. Powell’s speech could give Fed watchers a fresh update on how much support there is to lower rates in September — at a time the Trump administration is piling on the pressure to start easing.
Data over the past week likely did little to shift opinions on inflation and the economy. The core consumer price index, which excludes food and fuel, rose in July by the most since the start of the year. Yet the cost of tariff-exposed goods didn’t rise as much as feared.
A separate report on wholesale inflation suggested price pressures on companies are mounting, however. And a fresh read on retail sales showed American consumers flexed a bit more muscle over the past two months, though a decline in sentiment pointed to anxiety about inflation and the job market.
What Bloomberg Economics Says:
“Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has the opportunity to settle the speculation with his speech at the annual Jackson Hole Symposium (Friday). Last year, he used the gathering of central bankers to telegraph that the Fed was ready to cut rates. But the circumstances are different, and we don’t think he’ll be as frank this year.”

The global nature of the Jackson Hole conference also offers an opportunity for Powell’s peers to express their support amid persistent criticism from President Donald Trump. Central bank independence is likely to be a topic on the sidelines of the confab.
A handful of economists will present new research papers during the meeting, and there’s usually a panel featuring heads of some of the world’s biggest central banks.
Elsewhere, central bankers in New Zealand are projected to cut rates in a bid to shore up the labor market. Inflation and retail sales data take top billing in the UK, while purchasing managers indexes for economies across the world will help shed light on the impact of US tariffs.
Click here for what happened in the past week, and below is our wrap of what’s coming up in the global economy.
US and Canada
The US economic calendar lightens up in the coming week and will include several reports on the housing market. Cheaper borrowing costs would stoke demand in a residential real estate sector that’s been bogged down by low affordability.
On Tuesday, economists expect government figures to show a decline in US housing starts. National Association of Realtors data out Thursday are projected to show sales of previously owned homes hovering near a 15-year low.
Tariff machinations remain top of mind. Trade talks between the US and India scheduled for late this month may be postponed at Washington’s request, Indian media reported.

Turning north, Statistics Canada will release inflation data for July, the first of two such reports before the Bank of Canada’s September rate decision.
The central bank is closely watching core measures and the share of components in the consumer price index basket that are rising, both of which accelerated in the previous month’s data. Signs of cooling would open the door to a rate cut.
Advance retail sales data for July will shed light on Canadian consumer health after June’s preliminary estimate surprisingly pointed to the strongest spending this year.
Asia
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is the focus on Wednesday, when authorities are expected to resume a monetary easing cycle. Economists forecast the RBNZ will trim its benchmark rate by a quarter-point, to 3%, as officials look to keep a sagging labor market from impeding growth.
Bank Indonesia is seen keeping its policy settings unchanged the same day. China will likely hold its 1- and 5-year loan prime rates steady.
Asia sees a slew of indicators that are expected to underscore the impact of US trade policies on the region’s manufacturers. South Korea publishes early trade statistics for August, while Japan, Singapore, New Zealand and Malaysia all release reports for July. Thursday brings manufacturing PMI data for Japan, Australia and India.
Thailand’s economic growth likely slowed a tad in the second quarter, data on Monday are expected to show, validating the Bank of Thailand’s recent move to to cut its benchmark rate.
Japan’s national CPI data, scheduled for release on Friday, are forecast to show consumer inflation stayed well above the Bank of Japan’s target in July, backing the case for the BOJ to remain on the path toward gradual rate hikes.
Hong Kong and Malaysia also release inflation figures in the coming week. Australia issues consumer confidence on Tuesday.

Europe, Middle East, Africa
July inflation from the UK is likely to be the week’s most-watched release, with the Bank of England seeing price gains creeping up to a 4% peak in September. Bloomberg Economics is looking for a slight uptick on the month, to 3.7% from 3.6%. Analysts at Bank of America see services inflation edging up.
The UK also reports retail sales at the end of the week, though before that it will join the region’s other major economies in getting an update on private-sector activity from S&P Global’s Purchasing Managers’ Index.
Like the euro zone, the UK’s reading has been a point or two above the 50 level that separates expansion from contraction. Analysts will look at how companies in Europe are reacting to the tariff deal between Brussels and Washington after investor confidence sank in Germany.
Swiss exports, due on Thursday, will shed light on that country’s trade dealings with the US, which ended up hitting Switzerland with the highest tariffs among developed countries.
Remarks on Wednesday in Geneva from European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde may offer more pointers on the continent’s outlook. Traders have pared bets on further ECB interest-rate cuts but will have an eye on negotiated-wage data due Friday to make sure moderation is continuing there.
Wednesday sees policymakers convene at Sweden’s Riksbank. They’re likely to keep the benchmark rate at 2%, looking past a temporary summer flare-up in inflation.
Beyond Europe, South Africa publishes inflation data on Wednesday, with price growth seen accelerating to 3.5% in July from 3%. Israel will set borrowing costs the same day, with analysts looking for rates to be held steady for a 13th consecutive meeting. Rwanda and Botswana set rate policy on Thursday.

Latin America
Chile kicks off the week with its second-quarter output report, central bank survey of traders, and quarterly current account data.
Growth may undershoot central bank forecasts, though the consensus calls for a second-half rebound supported by domestic demand, slowing inflation, and easing financial conditions.
Brazil’s central bank on Monday posts its usual weekly Focus market readout along with its June economic activity report. May’s month-on-month dip aside, indicators such as the output gap suggest that Latin America’s No. 1 economy is still running hot.
Argentina on Wednesday delivers June GDP-proxy data on the heels of a disappointing -0.1% month-on-month reading in May. Economists surveyed by the central bank forecast growth of 5% in 2025.
Closing out the week, Mexico publishes June economic activity data and its final output figures for the three months through June, likely coming in quite close to flash readings of 0.7% quarter-on-quarter and 0.1% year-on-year reported on July 30.
Uncertainty over Trump’s trade and tariff policies, along with scaled back public investment, are expected to drag on Latin America’s No. 2 economy in the second half and into 2026.
After consumer prices slowed more than expected in July — excluding services and core readings — mid-month inflation readings on Friday may have reversed course and ticked higher.

By analyzing millions of daily trades and grading every stock against proven performance factors, Smart Score distills the complexity into a simple 1-to-10 ranking. A ‘Perfect 10’ signals a stock with strong potential, and when that rating aligns with Wall Street’s own bullish outlook, it’s a combination worth paying attention to.
We dug into the TipRanks database to find just such opportunities – and uncovered two ‘Perfect 10’ stocks that analysts are also backing with conviction. Let’s take a closer look.
Regal Rexnord(RRX)
Regal Rexnord, the first Perfect 10 stock we’ll look at, is a manufacturing company that specializes in motion control. That is, the company designs and builds tools and solutions for power and transmission systems for moving systems. Regal Rexnord’s product lines include such items as AC drives and controls; electric motors; clutches and brakes; bearings; couplings; gearings; industrial chains and sprockets; mechanical power transmission components; and predictive maintenance systems – and that list is by no means exhaustive. Motion control is a vital aspect of modern industry, and Regal Rexnord is an expert at it.
The company’s products, as can be expected, have found application in a wide range of industrial fields, including the aerospace and automotive industries; quarrying; cement manufacturing; industrial fans; commercial laundries; farming and agriculture; again, the list is long, and this only touches some of it. The point here is that Regal Rexnord is a major player in American manufacturing.
That can be seen from some of the numbers involved. The company boasts a market cap of more than $9 billion. Last year, Regal Rexnord brought in some $6 billion in total sales. Zooming out for a macro view, we see that Regal Rexnord has over 30,000 employees worldwide, operating a network of manufacturing facilities and sales and service offices. The company has been in business since 1955, and keeps its headquarters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
In its last earnings report, released on August 5 and covering 2Q25, the company showed just under $1.5 billion in quarterly revenue. This represented a 3.2% decline year-over-year, but edged over the forecast by 10 million. The firm’s $2.48 non-GAAP EPS was 4 cents better than expected. In some other key points, the company reported an adjusted free cash flow of $493 million – and in early July, the company won a $35 million data center contract, and expects to see significant additional business with that customer going forward.
For Baird analyst Michael Halloran, this company’s sound pipeline for future orders outweighs the slow-moving second quarter. Halloran writes of RRX, “2Q orders were directionally sluggish, but underlying momentum is beginning to build as indicated by healthy July orders (+4%) including large data center wins with line of sight for more to come. Additionally, management sees ~+MSD% growth in orders in 2H (strong IPS/AMC, negative PES). Combined with cross-selling synergies, cost synergies, and debt paydown, cumulatively, we see an attractive 2025 exit rate/2026 earnings profile… Recognizing risk remains (primarily shipment timing) we continue to believe RRX will benefit meaningfully from a cyclical recovery, has more secular tailwinds than investors realize, and has a strong long-term opportunity approaching (dynamic earnings/FCF profile that remains undervalued). Combined, RRX remains a top idea.”
This ‘top idea’ gets an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating from Halloran, with a $180 price target that indicates potential for a 22% upside in the year ahead. (To watch Halloran’s track record, click here)
The 9 recent analyst reviews of RRX shares include 7 Buy and 2 Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is priced at $154.57, and its $176 average price target implies that the shares will appreciate by 14% in the next 12 months. (See RRX stock forecast)
FTAI Aviation (FTAI)
The second Perfect 10 stock we’ll look at is FTAI Aviation, another American industrial specialist. FTAI bills itself as ‘providing power for the aftermarket;’ in simpler terms, the company is known mainly for providing maintenance and upgrade services for both CFM56 and V2500 commercial airliner engines. That’s a highly niche role, but an important one – many airlines don’t own all of their flight equipment, but rather lease engines and maintenance plans from third-party providers. This arrangement allows the airline to focus on its core work of scheduling and flying, while FTAI and its peers provide and keep track of the engines.
In addition to airliner engines, FTAI will also purchase commercial airliners for leasing to airlines. The arrangement is similar to that for engines, and for the same reasons. FTAI is known as an important owner/provider of Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft. FTAI provides maintenance support for its leased aircraft and engines. Prominent among the company’s services are its module factory overhaul services and its engine piece parts and kits. These services are vital for maintaining or replacing engine fans and turbines, the beating hearts of modern jets.
The company’s largest facilities, capable of updating or repairing as many as 25 engines per month, are located in Canada. These are supplemented by modern facilities in the US, dedicated to light repair, module swaps, and field services. The company also has important facilities in Europe, where it conducts module maintenance and piece-part repair, and can turn out 150 engines each year. FTAI has global certifications, an important qualification in a worldwide business like commercial aviation.
In its 2Q25 financial release, FTAI reported quarterly revenues of $676.2 million, for an impressive 52% year-over-year increase and beating the forecast by $129.6 million. The company’s bottom line, of $1.57 per share, was 19 cents per share better than had been expected. The company finished Q2 with $301.9 million in cash and other liquid assets on hand.
5-star analyst Brian McKenna, of Citizens JMP, covers this stock, and he sees FTAI in an all-around solid position. Laying out the company’s situation, McKenna says, “We believe 2Q25 results represented another inflection for FTAI, specifically related to underlying cash flow and GAAP earnings as well as the capital structure. Based on the outlook for FCF in 2H25 as well as the firm’s $300M cash position, we think there is an increasing probability that FTAI will be in a position to accelerate the pace of capital return to shareholders in 2026 (i.e., dividend increase and/or buybacks), even after allocating a sizable portion of this excess capital to other strategic growth initiatives. The momentum in Aerospace Products is nothing short of impressive, and we see significant upside in this business over time, which will only be accelerated as SCI scales further from here (i.e., 2026 vintage, etc.).”
Looking ahead, the analyst describes an upbeat outlook, writing, “So, we believe the fundamental outlook for FTAI has never been better, and we remain buyers of the stock, specifically as we see idiosyncratic upside in both earnings and shares over the next several quarters.”
As a buyer of the stock, McKenna rates FTAI shares as Outperform (i.e., Buy), and he complements that with a $205 price target that implies a one-year upside potential of 40%. (To watch McKenna’s track record, click here)
This stock’s 9 recent analyst reviews break down to a lopsided 8 Buys and 1 Hold, supporting the Strong Buy consensus rating on the shares. FTAI has a current selling price of $146, and its average price target, $180.89, suggests that the shares will gain 24% on the one-year horizon. (See FTAI stock forecast)

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) fell -0.08%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) fell -0.24%.
Stocks recovered from modest early losses and closed narrowly mixed. Stocks saw downward pressure from Thursday's strong US PPI report and the +5 bp rise in the 10-year T-note yield. In addition, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and St Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem Thursday both threw cold water on the idea of a -50 bp rate cut at the September FOMC meeting. There continued to be uncertainty ahead of Friday's Trump-Putin summit, which will begin at 3:30 pm ET followed by a joint press conference, according to Politico.
Thursday's PPI report was much stronger than market expectations. The PPI report suggested that the markets might have been overly optimistic about Tuesday's CPI report and that companies are passing through tariffs at the wholesale level at a higher pace than earlier thought.
The July US final-demand PPI report of +0.9% m/m and +3.3% y/y was substantially stronger than market expectations of +0.2% m/m and +2.5% y/y. The July US core final-demand PPI report of +0.9% m/m and +3.7% y/y was substantially stronger than market expectations of +0.2% m/m and +3.0% y/y.
The markets dialed back expectations for Fed easing in the wake of the disappointing PPI report. The markets are no longer discounting any chance of a -50 bp rate cut at the September meeting and are now assigning a 93% chance of a -25 bp rate cut. After Treasury Secretary Bessent's dovish suggestions on Wednesday, the markets temporarily assigned an 11% chance of a -50 bp rate cut at the September meeting. Nevertheless, the current 93% chance of a -25 bp rate cut in September is still substantially more dovish than the 40% chance assigned before the news of the weak July payroll report on August 1 and the in-line CPI report this past Tuesday.
US weekly initial unemployment claims fell by -3,000 to 224,000, which was close to expectations for a slight decline to 225,000. US weekly continuing claims fell by -15,000 to 1.953 million, which showed a slightly stronger labor market than expectations of a dip to 1.967 million.
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told the WSJ that she does not support a -50 bp rate cut at the September meeting, saying that ""would send off an urgency signal that I don't feel about the strength of the labor market."" She said she still supports two rate cuts this year, but that three cuts could be warranted ""if we saw more signs that the labor market was more precarious.""
St Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said that a -50 bp rate cut at the September meeting would be ""unsupported by the current state of the economy and the outlook for the economy"" in his view. He said it is too early for him to make a decision on a rate cut at the September meeting.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday tried to backtrack a bit on his statements on Wednesday in which he said interest rates are ""too constrictive"" and that rates ""should probably be 150, 175 basis points lower."" He added, ""There's a very good chance of a 50 basis point cut. We could go into a series of rate cuts here, starting with a 50 basis point rate cut in September.""
In an interview with Fox Business Thursday, Mr. Bessent said he was not telling the Fed what to do and that he was not calling for a series of Fed rate cuts with his comments on Wednesday. He said he was merely trying to say that models show the neutral rate is lower, although he didn't specify which models he was referring to. Mr. Bessent said he supports transparency and the call to clean up investment conflicts among members of Congress.
In recent tariff news, President Trump early Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. Last Wednesday, Mr. Trump announced that he will impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. Still, companies would be eligible for exemptions if they demonstrate a commitment to building their products in the US. However, the US will levy a separate tax on imports of electronic products that employ semiconductors. Also, Mr. Trump announced last Wednesday that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil. Last Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced ""within the next week or so."" According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.
The market's focus during the remainder of this week is on any tariff-trade news and Friday's Trump-Putin summit. On Friday, July US retail sales are expected to climb +0.6% m/m and retail sales ex-autos are expected to rise +0.3% m/m. Also on Friday, the July industrial production and manufacturing production reports are both expected to remain unchanged m/m. Finally, the University of Michigan's Aug US consumer sentiment index is expected to climb by +0.3 to 62.0.
Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 93% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and at 53% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.
Earnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 82% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates.
Overseas stock markets on Thursday closed mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed up +0.86%. China's Shanghai Composite posted a 3.75-year high but then fell back and closed down -0.46%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -1.45% and fell back from Wednesday's record high.
Interest Rates
September 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) on Thursday fell by -10.5 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield rose +5.4 bp to 4.287%. T-note prices fell back on the strong PPI report, which resulted in reduced expectations for Fed rate cuts in the coming months. T-note prices were also undercut after Treasury Secretary Bessent backtracked a bit on his comments Wednesday, in which he called for aggressive Fed interest rate cuts. In a bearish factor, the 10-year breakeven inflation expectations rate on Thursday rose by +2.1 bp to 2.396%.
European government bond yields rose. The 10-year German bund yield rose +3.2 bp to 2.712%. The 10-year UK gilt yield rose +5.1 bp to 4.641%.
Swaps are discounting the chances at 7% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.
US Stock Movers
The Magnificent Seven closed mostly higher, with Amazon (AMZN) being the biggest gainer (+2.9%) and Tesla (TSLA) being the largest loser (-1.1%).
Chip stocks closed mixed, clawing back some early losses. Intel (INTL) rose by +7.4%, but Align Technologies (ALGN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and GlobalFoundries (GFS) closed with losses of more than -1%.
Bitcoin (^BTCUSD) fell nearly -4%, dragging crypto stocks lower. Strategy (MSTR) fell -4.4%, while Coinbase (COIN) and MARA Holdings (MARA) both closed down about -0.7%. However, Riot Platforms (RIOT) bucked the trend and closed up +5.7%.
Cisco Systems (CSCO) closed down -1.5% due to cautious management guidance for the current fiscal year.
Deere (DE) fell -6.8% on slightly lower management guidance for full-year net income as lower grain prices and tariff uncertainty are causing some farmers to pull back on equipment purchases.
Dow Inc (DOW) rose +2% on a rating hike to neutral from underperform from BofA Global Research due to its view that the stock is oversold.
NetEase (NTES) fell nearly -4% after a miss on Q2 sales and weaker-than-expected growth in its core gaming segment.
CVS Health (CVS) rose +2.4% on an upgrade from Baird to outperform from neutral due to ""growing confidence"" in the company's turnaround.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crude-oil-prices-going-much-190002145.html,46b5bec386fa56d3c8f2f791310ea089,Are Crude Oil Prices Going Much Lower ? ,Are Crude Oil Prices Going Much Lower ? ,2025-08-16 01:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"NYMEX WTI crude oil futures have traded in a range of $55.12 to $79.39 per barrel in 2025. At just above the $62 level in mid-August, the energy commodity is sitting below the midpoint of the 2025 trading range. In my Q2 Barchart report on the energy sector, I concluded with the following:
Meanwhile, OPEC+ has increased petroleum output, and the U.S. energy policy now favors a “drill-baby-drill” and “frack-baby-frack” approach to oil and gas. Increasing U.S. and OPEC+ output could put downward pressure on prices. The bottom line is that petroleum and product prices could be highly volatile over the second half of 2025.
Nearby NYMEX crude oil futures fell 8.91% in Q2, and were 9.22% lower over the first six months of 2025, settling at $65.11 per barrel on June 30, 2025. The NYMEX futures were lower in mid-August as the end of the 2025 peak driving season approaches, and the trend has turned lower since the late July high.
The short-term trend is lower
Bearish sentiment has crept into the NYMEX crude oil market, as the price has been trending lower since the most recent July 30, lower high of $70.51 per barrel on the September contract.
The daily chart highlights the pattern of lower highs and lower lows since the end of July, with crude oil posting mostly daily declines from July 31 through August 13.
OPEC+ and U.S. energy policy point lower
Crude oil fundamentals reflect increased production. While U.S. daily domestic crude oil production was at 13.327 million barrels per day as of the week ending on August 8, 2025, U.S. energy policy under the Trump administration favors a “drill-baby-drill” and “frack-baby-frack” approach to oil and gas production. In a reversal from the previous Biden administration, President Trump supports traditional energy production and consumption to achieve energy independence and self-sufficiency. Moreover, the current administration favors increasing U.S. traditional energy exports, creating revenues. Increased U.S. production, which weighs on oil prices, will help lower inflationary pressures, increasing the odds of falling U.S. interest rates, a key goal of the Trump administration.
Meanwhile, OPEC+ has increased production over the past months, adding further pressure to the oil price. While crude oil’s price remains higher than the 2025 low, the short-term trend has turned lower as the petroleum market shifts toward the end of the gasoline demand season, which typically concludes after summer.
Critical levels to watch in the NYMEX futures
The monthly chart shows that nearby NYMEX crude oil futures have traded on a $55.12 to $79.39 per barrel range in 2025. At around $62.25 per barrel on August 13, the energy commodity was around $5 below the midpoint of this year’s trading range.
The monthly chart highlights that the current downside technical support level is at the April 2025 low of $55.12 per barrel. Technical resistance levels are at the June 2025 high of $78.40 and the January 2025 peak of $79.39 per barrel. A break below the $60 level will likely cause crude oil prices to challenge the critical technical resistance at just above $55 per barrel, the lowest price since February 2021.
The Middle East and Russia remain potential issues
The Middle East is a critical factor in determining the path of least resistance for crude oil prices. Israel and the U.S. remain at odds with Iran despite the ceasefire of hostilities after the bombing of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. However, the theocracy remains firmly in control and has not backed off from inflammatory statements towards Israel, the United States, and other Western countries. Iran’s proxies in the region continue to pose a threat to peace.
The Straits of Hormuz remain a major chokepoint for worldwide petroleum exports, so any future conflicts could ignite an explosive crude oil rally due to supply concerns.
Meanwhile, Presidents Trump and Putin will meet in Alaska on Friday, August 15 to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine. Any peace deal could include Russian cooperation on energy policies that would lead to crude oil prices to declining toward the $50 per barrel level or lower, given President Trump’s desire to curb inflation and lower interest rates.
UCO and SCO turbocharge volatility in NYMEX crude oil but require careful risk-reward attention
Crude oil is one of the most politically charged commodities, and in a highly volatile world, the price of petroleum is likely to experience ongoing elevated volatility. Since the 2020 global pandemic, nearby NYMEX prices have traded as low as in negative territory to as high as $130.50 per barrel. While I do not expect any challenge of those lows or highs in 2025, the potential for sudden rallies above this year’s high or declines to new lows remains high in the current environment.
Trading crude oil could be a highly profitable strategy. The most direct route for a risk position in the energy commodity is through the WTI futures or futures options trading on the CME’s NYMEX division, or Brent futures or futures options traded on the Intercontinental Exchange.
The USO and BNO ETFs are unleveraged products that track the performance of WTI and Brent futures, respectively. UCO and SCO are twice-leveraged ETFs that track the NYMEX WTI crude oil prices.
At $21.83 per share, UCO, the bullish ETF, has over $386.4 million in assets under management. UCO trades an average of nearly 2.7 million shares daily and charges a 0.95% management fee. The most recent significant rally in September NYMEX crude oil futures took the price 39% higher, from the May 5 low of $54.66 to the June 23 high of $75.98 per barrel.
Over the same period, UCO rallied 54.88% from $18.35 to $28.42 per share, delivering a leveraged upside percentage return.
At $18.27 per share, the bearish SCO ETF had over $158.4 million in assets under management. SCO trades a daily average of over 2.955 million shares and charges the same 0.95% management fee. The most recent significant decline in WTI September futures took the price 18.2% lower from a high of $75.98 on June 23 to a low of $62.16 on August 13.
Over around the same period, the SCO ETF rose 25.5% from $14.57 to $18.29 per share, delivering a leveraged percentage return when crude oil prices moved to the downside.
UCO and SCO are leveraged trading tools that are only appropriate for short-term risk positions on the long or short side of the oil market. However, they provide market participants the opportunity to position in crude oil in standard brokerage accounts. The leveraged ETFs have drawbacks, including:
Leverage comes at a cost. If NYMEX crude oil prices move contrary to expectations, the leverage results in a greater percentage decline than the crude oil futures market.
If crude oil prices stabilize and remain within a trading range, UCO and SCO will experience time decay, which erodes their values and causes losses.
While the international crude oil markets, including NYMEX futures, trade around the clock, UCO and SCO are only available during the U.S. stock market’s trading hours. Therefore, the leveraged ETFs can miss highs or lows when the U.S. stock market is closed.
UCO and SCO’s leverage requires careful attention to risk-reward dynamics. Time decay means that price and time stops are required for risk positions, which are only appropriate for short-term horizons.
Crude oil is leaning lower in August 2025, with the odds of a challenge to the 2025 lows rising. However, the volatile Middle East could turn the bear into a bull in the blink of an eye. Trading in crude oil rather than investing, could be optimal over the coming weeks and months. The August 15 meeting between Presidents Trump and Putin could cause significant price volatility in the crude oil market.

From The Great Resignation to quiet quitting, there’s been no shortage of trends over the past few years that reflect growing dissatisfaction and disengagement in the workplace.
The newest trend, “quiet cracking,” coined by TalentLMS, describes ongoing burnout and stagnation leading to disengagement and poor performance. Their research shows 20% of employees experience it frequently, and 34% occasionally.
Unlike quiet quitting, quiet cracking isn’t immediately visible but is equally harmful. Disengaged employees cost the global economy $8.8 trillion annually, according to Gallup.
What is quiet cracking?
While quiet quitting refers to workers who purposely slack off at a job they no longer want, quiet cracking refers to those who “gradually become mired in feeling both unappreciated by managers and closed off from career advancement while doing work they otherwise like,” according to an article from Inc.
Or, as TalentLMS puts it, people who feel “some kind of workplace funk.”
It’s a deeper, harder-to-detect burnout where workers silently struggle under ongoing pressure. Those affected feel less valued and less confident about their future at work. Employees don’t always recognize the warning signs until they’re “spinning their wheels doing jobs they’re losing interest in yet stick with, fearing it will be too difficult to find a new one,” according to Inc.
The trends impacting quiet cracking, and how to mitigate them
The TalentLMS survey of 1,000 U.S. employees found that top concerns include:
Economic uncertainty
Workload and job expectations
Poor leadership or uncertain company direction
Layoffs or restructuring
Lack of career advancement opportunities
To address quiet cracking, the first step is recognizing its causes — feeling stuck, unheard or uncertain about the future.
According to Nikhil Arora, CEO of Epignosis, the solution is simple: Offer growth opportunities through learning, skill development, and open communication to re-engage employees.
But there are other possible solutions that can also be considered:
1. Uncertainty and overload
It’s important to set expectations and balance workloads, since 29% of employees say their workload is unmanageable. Employers can help by auditing task distribution, setting clear expectations, and offering stress management tools. This helps employees regain a sense of purpose and momentum.
2. Lack of recognition and growth
Employees experiencing quiet cracking are 152% more likely to feel undervalued, according to the TalentLMS survey. Regularly recognizing contributions is a simple yet powerful way to boost morale and engagement.
3. Few learning or career advancement opportunities
Employees who received training in the past year feel 140% more secure in their roles, according to HR Digest. To combat stagnation, employers should invest in structured learning paths, mentorship, and clear communication about growth opportunities — even when resources are limited.
TalentLMS recommends that employers “double down on learning and development, with structured, ongoing learning paths.”

What employees and employers can do
Employees noticing quiet cracking should discuss workload and expectations with their managers, suggest morale-boosting ideas and seek development opportunities. If improvements don’t happen, they may need to consider leaving.
Employers can combat disengagement by auditing engagement efforts, addressing gaps in support and recognition, and implementing regular feedback and learning programs.
Quiet cracking is a business risk that undermines productivity, creativity and loyalty — making it crucial to act early.
Create a financial cushion
To prepare for any career shift, employees need to build a financial safety cushion, including an emergency fund. Having such savings in place offers flexibility — whether to take time to plan your next career move, explore new opportunities or simply leave a toxic work environment without immediate financial stress.
There are a few ways to get started on sewing together you financial cushion. If your checking account is flush with cash, one option it to develop an emergency fund using a high yield savings account to take advantage of compound interest. It's also often a good idea to start investing as soon as possible so your money can develop in the market.
An easy way to get started is by automatically investing your spare change with Acorns.
How it works is simple: Acorns automatically rounds up your everyday purchases to the nearest dollar and invests the difference into a diversified portfolio of ETFs. In other words, each transaction, whether it’s your daily coffee or a trip to the grocery store, contributes to building your savings.
For example, if you grab a $9.62 slice of pizza late at night, Acorns will round it up to $10 and invest the 38-cent difference — all before your head even hits the pillow. These small amounts add up over time.
Acorns is also offering an extra $20 for those who sign up with a recurring deposit.
Another long-term strategy for developing wealth is to explore investing in real estate through assets such as the $34.9 trillion U.S. home equity market.
For accredited investors, Homeshares gives access to this massive real estate market segment — a space that’s historically been the exclusive playground of institutional investors.
With a minimum investment of $25,000, investors can gain direct exposure to hundreds of owner-occupied homes in top U.S. cities through their U.S. Home Equity Fund without the headaches of buying, owning or managing property.
With risk-adjusted target returns ranging from 14% to 17%, this approach can provide an effective, hands-off way to invest in owner-occupied residential properties across regional markets.
Once you’ve established your asset base, the next step is managing it to secure more financial flexibility. After all, quiet cracking can happen at all levels of the income spectrum, even in high-paying positions.
Making your wealth work for you can make it easier to exit a high-stress, low-fulfillment environment and prioritize your well-being, or allow you to take the time to find an alternative.
To do so, you’ll probably need expert guidance across all areas of your wealth — and that’s where the trusted team of financial planners at Range can come in.

Samsung was selling devices with large screens, and iPhone fans were demanding a response.
It took Apple some time, but the company finally released the iPhone 6, breaking with previous iterations and giving consumers a large-screen option. The iPhone won.
But more than a decade later, recent smartphone sales and shipment figures signal that the Apple-Samsung fight has returned. And once again, it's all about the screen.
In the second quarter, shipments from Samsung surged in the U.S., with its market share rising from 23% to 31% from the prior period, according to data from Canalys. Apple's market share during the quarter declined to 49% from 56%.
Apple remains on top of the U.S. smartphone market, taking the majority of new smartphone sales in the U.S. It's often in second place around the world, but the recent slips points to turbulence for Apple for the first time in well over a decade.
That's one reason investors have sent Apple shares down 7.5% this year, underperforming all of the U.S. megacap tech companies other than Tesla. Samsung's stock, meanwhile, is up about 35% in 2025.
Apple reported a 13% increase in year-over-year iPhone sales in its July earnings.
In July, Samsung introduced a pair of innovative new phones that feature foldable screens. One model, the Z Fold 7, can effectively turn into a tablet, while the Z Flip resembles an old-school flip phone with modern smartphone features. They were added to Samsung's catalog of phones released this spring under its Galaxy brand, including a thin-and-light phone called the Galaxy S25 Edge.
The devices are also getting a lot of traction on social media, particularly around durability tests.
One user posted a livestream that showed him bending the Z Fold 7 over 200,000 times in a row. The video has been clipped and shared widely on social media, with one version of the clip accumulating more than 15 million views on YouTube.
In the past month, Samsung's premium devices, including the Z Fold 7, were mentioned over 50,000 times on social media, and 83% of those mentions were positive or neutral, according to data from Sprout Social, a social media analytics company.
The market share numbers aren't just the result of user preferences. Much of the shift in shipment figures in the June quarter, analysts said, can be attributed to tariffs, which are causing ""disruption"" in the industry as smartphone makers use different strategies to minimize the impact on their business.
But Samsung's gains also reflect the company's ability to offer a much wider range of products at different prices compared to Apple. That includes low-end phones, which accounted for much of Samsung's second-quarter U.S. improvement, as well as high-end devices that cost more than any individual iPhone.
Samsung's Galaxy and Z phone lineup ""stretches from $650 up to $2,400. That is a massive span of devices,"" said Canalys analyst Runar Bjorhovde. ""There is an idea that you can target people at every single price point, and you can meet them at every spot.""
The iPhone has pretty much looked the same since 2017 — a rectangular piece of glass with a touchscreen on the front, and a few cameras on the back. These days, the company offers a series of four slates ranging from $829 to $1,599. Samsung and others are starting to go beyond the so-called candy bar shape and experimenting with new form factors.
Apple is expected to start doing the same — beginning with a potential launch next month of a slimmer iPhone that will compete with Samsung's Galaxy Edge.
""Apple is clearly betting that its 5.5mm Air model is going to lift its fortunes as testing suggests a strong desire for the new form factor,"" wrote Loop Capital managing director John Donovan in May.
JPMorgan Chase analyst Samik Chatterjee wrote in a report last month that Apple may release a folding phone next year to compete with Samsung's Z Fold.
""Investor focus has already turned to the 2026 fall launches with Apple expected to launch its first foldable iPhone as part of the iPhone 18 lineup in September 2026,"" Chatterjee wrote.
Trying new form factors offers Apple the opportunity to sell devices at higher prices, according to Bjorhovde.
Apple's most expensive phone, the iPhone 16 Pro Max, currently starts at $1,199 for 256GB of storage and can go up to $1,599 for a version with 1TB of storage. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, which was announced last week, starts at $1,999 for the 256GB version and tops out at $2,419 for the 1TB version.
Chatterjee said he thinks Apple's version of a folding phone could start at $1,999.
Folding phones finally mature
Samsung's first folding phone was released in 2019, but got off to a rocky start. The initial launch was delayed after reviewers — including CNBC — discovered that the early devices would break along their folding crease.
But Samsung says this time is different, and that folding phones are finally ready to go mainstream, especially with respect to durability.
""There really are no longer trade-offs towards owning a foldable device,"" said Drew Blackard, vice president of mobile product management at Samsung Electronics America.
The South Korean company doesn't provide sales numbers, but Blackard said the Galaxy Z Fold 7, the latest version, had 25% more preorders than any previous Samsung folding phone and that sales are outpacing the device's predecessor by nearly 50%.
""Samsung with the foldable is able to actually optimize for innovation,"" said Bjorhovde. ""Try to be ahead, show that something is different, and there's a certain halo effect from that.""
According to Counterpoint Research, a firm that estimates smartphone sales to customers, Samsung's sell-through increased 16% during the June quarter, thanks to demand for high-end devices, including a ""slight boost"" from the slim S25 Edge.
The rise of artificial intelligence is also heralding new form factors for consumer electronics that could one day replace the iPhone.
OpenAI in May acquired the startup of former Apple design guru Jony Ive for $6.5 billion. The AI startup plans to develop the next generation of hardware, and other AI startups have released pins, pendants and glasses that rely on users' voice to control the devices.
Samsung devices, as well as other Android phones, get access to Google's Gemini, which is widely considered to be one of the best AI models alongside OpenAI's ChatGPT. Gemini has several features that users can't get with Siri and Apple Intelligence.
Blackard said folding phones, with their larger displays, are well suited for AI. Google's circle-to-search feature, which allows a user to simply circle something on the screen that they'd like to learn more about, is an example, Blackard said.
On a Samsung folding phone, he said, users can still see the original screen with the content they circled, as well as another screen with supplementary information.
""It's much more productive being able to go back and forth,"" Blackard said.
Investors have worried that Apple's AI delays, including its next-generation Siri that's now scheduled to come out next year, could start hurting sales. But many analysts say that Apple's brand loyalty and lock-in will give it a period of years before iPhone customers start defecting for competitors.
Chatterjee told CNBC that Apple's strategy with devices is to wait until a technology is ready for the mainstream before embracing it. That time may be now for foldable devices.
Apple has ""never been about trying to be the first to market,"" Chatterjee said. ""It's about being watchful, seeing a technology mature, knowing that there are no big roadblocks to that technology adoption, and then moving ahead.""",0ff6aebcf834836ffa10f07c26b33ccd,trafilatura,7742,0

Wall Street economists are fixated on identifying tariff effects, yet stocks either celebrated or shrugged off three warm and sticky inflation readings this week, laboring to hold near record highs. The S & P 500 immediately processed a moderately elevated consumer price index report Tuesday as solidifying the chances for a September cut by the Fed into a still-steady economy, logging on that day slightly more than what would become a 0.9% gain for the week. Notably, over the next three days — through a hot but noisy producer price index reading and a messy University of Michigan consumer-sentiment survey — the benchmark treated Tuesday's closing level just under 6,450 as a floor, testing it repeatedly and finishing the week right on it. The index has now logged a total return of 10% year to date, having more than recovered the near-20% tariff-panic collapse in April. .SPX 3M bar SPX 3-month chart The divide between optimists and pessimists on the market entering the second half of August is whether this action seems judicious or oblivious. The starting point for determining such things should be in assuming the market has it roughly right and isn't overlooking much of the important stuff. Whether the Fed ""should"" look through potential tariff-driven inflation, the market is trying its best to do so. As Bespoke Investment Group summed things up at week's end: ""Price has trended steadily higher in a tight range over the last few months, representing rather sanguine action even though much of the news flow has been negative. While politics plays a big role in the going narrative about the market and the economy, price ultimately tells the real story. Whatever negativity there is out there hasn't been nearly enough to interrupt the uptrend that's been in place since we made new highs in early summer."" The latest push higher has not been terribly emphatic, or broadly inclusive, allowing skeptics to withhold style points from the rally. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the equal-weight S & P 500 tagged new highs this week before faltering a bit, a sign either of fatigue or late-summer indifference. Big rotations This week also saw some forced-seeming rotations, with the weakest laggards in the S & P 500 performing best and the Russell 2000 small-cap index making yet another lunge for its late-2021highs on all the anticipated-rate-cut energy. Neglected groups such as health care showed some life, the likes of Johnson & Johnson breaking higher from a long slumber, even before news of Berkshire Hathaway's second-quarter purchase of UnitedHealth shares jolted that name higher on Friday. These reinforcements allowed the overtaxed mega-cap AI glamour names to take a rest. Such rotations tend to support and refresh a rally while suppressing volatility, though eventually they can imply an exhaustion of leadership that may make the tape less stable than when the largest index weights are in firm control. From a certain angle, it could appear odd that the bond market is simultaneously assigning more than an 80% chance of a Fed rate cut in six weeks when equities are at records, valuations are full, crypto is melting higher, credit spreads are drum-tight and buzzy IPOs are rocketing out of the gate. Registering nominal appreciation for these flush conditions while still asking for monetary-policy help, Wall Street, in the words of the old Elvis Costello song, has ""a mouthful of 'Much obliged' and a handful of 'Gimme.'"" This is less a contradiction than it is nuance. The jarring monthly payrolls miss of two weeks ago came after the Fed had last called the risks ""balanced"" between labor weakness and revived inflation, and the latest inflation upticks weren't enough to offset the job-market softness. Not to mention the relentless White House campaign to browbeat Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower rates while auditioning dovish successors. And confidence on multiple rate cuts, after one in late September, is not as evident in market pricing. Perhaps the market is conveying comfort with its own ability to hang tough even in the absence of a Fed move next month, casting a 25 basis-point reduction in short-term rates as a ""Nice to have"" rather than a ""Need to get."" More tangibly, earnings forecasts for the remainder of the year are on the rise again, albeit with the AI-propelled tech players the largest contributors. When profits are growing, credit markets are calm and the next Fed move is a cut, stocks tend to have little trouble holding their valuations. Historically, when the Fed resumes an easing campaign after a pause of at least six months (December was the last cut), stocks have responded well over subsequent months, based on this study by Ned Davis Research. There's no doubt the market sometimes takes credit in advance for a hoped-for future that might never arrive. It could turn out this is one of those moments. Economists at Morgan Stanley argued Friday that Powell in the upcoming week's Jackson Hole symposium address is his last best chance to push against market pricing of a September cut, believing that ""the Fed would prefer to retain optionality and, if anything, we look for Powell's remarks at Jackson Hole to be similar to the message from July."" In other words, noncommittal and data dependent. One possible ""tell"" would come from the bond market's reaction to any data or rhetoric that makes a cut less likely. If the 10-year Treasury yield were to rush lower in the face of reduced perceived chances of a rate cut next week, it could be taken as bonds declaring a high risk of a policy mistake, with the Fed behind the curve. If not, equity markets should take heart. One answer to those confused by the strength of the equity indexes in the face of still-elevated policy flux and potential stagflationary forces: Maybe markets are still burning off the last of the relief that burst forth after a worst-case scenario was priced in during the spring sell-off. Similarities to 1998 and 2018? Around the time that downturn was underway, I repeatedly noted the rich history of sharp, severe corrections that result from a sudden shock, stop just short of a 20% decline and are not associated with a recession. Precedents include the 1998 hedge-fund blowup, the 2011 U.S. debt-downgrade scare and the late-2018 tariff/Fed-mistake tumble. Fidelity's head of global macro Jurrien Timmer tracks such patterns, and the current recovery is in synch with those of 1998 and 2018 so far. Clearly this is a small sample and these are close to best-case paths from here, but the echoes are pretty distinct. It's no longer possible to argue that most investors are still outright bearish or are fighting the market's four-month advance. Systematic and quantitative funds are back to very full equity exposures. But there remains a lack of aggressive participation by the broader group of professional investors, by some measures. Deutsche Bank's composite investor positioning gauge is up to the 71 st percentile over the past 15 years, not a very high reading when indexes are at a record. Saying that not all investors have pushed every chip they have into the market is not the same as arguing the market enjoys a wide margin of safety, of course. Seasonal factors remain challenging and the tape is probably due for a routine wobble of a few percent before long. But there's not much reason to argue if one arrived it would be the start of the ""Big One.""",211d28e62d51595fec2842c21e412b7c,trafilatura,7536,0

According to Federal Reserve Economic Data, the average American only manages to save 4.5% of their disposable income annually. With economic growth slowing and consumer prices going up, it's more important than ever to ensure your money is working harder for you.
That’s where a high-yield savings account (HYSA) comes to the rescue.
A HYSA leverages high interest rates to help you save more faster — which is perfect if you’re looking to set up an emergency fund or have a specific savings goal in mind.
Read on to find out what a HYSA is, the key benefits of high-yield accounts, and get some of the best HYSA deals in August 2025.
A high-yield savings account (HYSA) is a savings product that offers substantially higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts.
High-yield accounts work a lot like traditional savings products. You can link existing checking accounts, make deposits, and withdraw your cash when you need it.
But banks offer better annual percentage yield (APY) rates on HYSAs for a couple of reasons.
The best high-yield account providers tend to be online-only challenger banks. They don’t have physical branches, which means lower operating costs. To win business, those savings are then passed on to customers in the form of higher APYs.
High-yield accounts also tend to offer variable rates.
That means the rate you’re shown when opening an account may fluctuate when the Federal Reserve changes its base borrowing rate. Rates can also shift in line with demand and each bank’s respective growth strategy.
You should also bear in mind that some high-yield accounts have access limits.
For example, you might need to wait 1-2 working days to receive your funds after requesting a withdrawal. Many HYSA providers also impose monthly withdrawal limits.
If you’re debating whether to set up a HYSA, here’s what makes high-yield accounts stand out:
The core benefit of a HYSA account is higher levels of compound interest.
According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the average savings account yield in July 2025 was 0.38%. By contrast, some of the best high-yield accounts are paying over 4.00% APY.
That means you could earn up to seven times more on your deposit by placing it in a HYSA.
Because many HYSA providers are online banks with few overheads, they can afford to drop monthly maintenance fees.
That makes saving cheap and simple.
A HYSA is an easy way to accumulate interest without sacrificing liquidity.
Unlike other high-interest savings products, the cash you deposit in a high-yield account is still accessible. Some online HYSAs take a couple working days to process withdrawals, but there’s a growing range of accounts that offer instant 24/7 access.
There’s no such thing as a sure thing in markets. That’s one reason savers turn to HYSAs.
The FDIC insures all balances of up to $250,000. Even if your online bank goes bust, you’re not going to lose your deposit. That level of safety, paired with relatively high interest rates, makes high-yield accounts an attractive alternative to investing.
Opening a high-yield savings account is typically a fast and straightforward process.
Here’s how it works:
Start by shopping around. Create a shortlist of savings providers and products, then compare:
-
APY
-
Deposit requirements
-
Account fees
-
Access rules
Stack these features against your savings goals and access requirements. Then, go for the account that looks like the best fit.
Don’t be afraid to get in touch with providers to let them know you’re shopping around. They may pull out some extra incentives.
After selecting the high-yield account you’re after, it’s time to apply.
You’ll need to have documentation handy to complete the application. This will include your:
Most HYSA applications are online-only. They take a few minutes to complete, and approval is often instant.
After approval, you can immediately deposit money into your HYSA.
The easiest way to do this is by making an external bank transfer from an existing checking account. Some high-yield account providers will also offer ACH options.
After that, you can sit back, relax, and watch your savings build. Most HYSA providers compound interest and deposit interest payments on a monthly basis.
There are some attractive HYSA options available on the market in 2025.
To help you get started, here are some top picks that have no monthly fees:
-
Axos ONE® Savings: 4.46% APY with $1,500 minimum balance.
-
Peak Bank Envision Savings: 4.35% APY with $100 minimum balance.
-
EverBank Performance Savings: 4.30% APY with $0 minimum balance.
-
Bread Savings: 4.25% APY with $100 minimum balance.
-
Openbank High Yield Savings: 4.20% APY with $500 minimum balance.
-
CIT Bank Platinum Savings: 4.00% APY with $5,000 minimum balance.
-
Barclays Tiered Savings: 3.90% with $0 minimum balance.
Remember: These are the tip of the iceberg. There are loads of HYSAs to choose from, and the best fit for you will depend on a few factors.
Go for an account that offers a minimum balance you’re comfortable with and accessibility rules that work for you. It’s also important to look at fees. And if you’d like easy and regular contact with bank staff, you might need to trade in the highest possible APY that online-only banks offer.
Not sure if a HYSA is right for your savings strategy? Don’t worry. There are several popular alternatives worth exploring:
Certificates of Deposit (CDs) let you lock up your funds for a set term. This term can vary anywhere between three months and five years, and the rate is generally on par with a HYSA.
Unlike a high-yield account, a CD’s interest rate is fixed for the duration of your term.
The catch: your deposit is inaccessible. Early withdrawals often lead to large fees or account closure.
A money market account (MMA) essentially combines the features of a checking and savings account.
MMAs offer debit cards and can make transactions like a checking account. They also offer higher APY than a traditional savings account.
In exchange for added functionality, the APY on an MMA is normally lower than a HYSA or CD. Minimum balances and monthly maintenance fees are also common.
Treasury Bonds are another easy way to put idle cash to work without shouldering much risk.
As of August 2025, US Series I Savings Bonds (I Bonds) are posting an average rate of 4.24%. Returns are adjusted for inflation, which makes bonds a relatively safe investment. Just remember you can’t cash in a bond for 12 months — and if you cash in before the five-year mark, you’ll lose three months of interest.
At the end of the day, a high-yield account is an easy way to generate high levels of interest on your savings.
There’s a wide range of HYSA products available that offer varying rates, deposit requirements, and access rules. So you should be able to find a solution that aligns with your savings strategy.
But don’t forget to shop around. And if a high-yield savings account doesn’t quite work for you, be sure to check out alternatives like CDs or MMAs so you can start cashing in on higher interest rates.

Buckled in? 2025 has, by many accounts, been a wild, unpredictable ride for those working in corporate finance. Amid ongoing geopolitical conflicts and a U.S. president intent on reshaping global trade, CFOs have had much to grapple with over the last few months.
As we move past the halfway point, finance chiefs are being tapped, as always, to provide a sense of stability. But they’re also increasingly being asked to offer a forward-looking, strategic lens for their organizations.
Here are five ongoing trends that are likely to dominate boardroom conversations over the remainder of 2025.
The domain of the CFO is widening. Most in the profession agree that the days of simply reporting financial results after the fact are largely over; now, finance chiefs are being asked more and more to peer into the future and step into strategic roles.
“We’re definitely starting to leave behind traditional Excel sheets,” said Amy Dickerson, EVP, CFO and CHRO with environmental remediation firm Regenesis. “I don’t dabble in Excel every day anymore. I’m dealing with higher-level initiatives and strategies.”
That also means that CFOs are working more closely with other C-Suite peers. In some cases, like Dickerson’s, they’re filling multiple C-Suite roles themselves. CFO and COO hybrids, for example, are not uncommon. As one finance chief put it, it’s a trend that is likely to continue “on steroids” in the years ahead.
“A CFO is trained in regulation and financial metrics originally, but you have a lot of exposure across an organization,” added Dickerson, who also sits on the CFO Alliance’s global advisory board. “You’re probably sitting in the one seat where you have the most exposure to crossover.”
Kadidia Cooper, chief financial and operating officer at nonprofit scholarship provider 10,000 Degrees, noted CFOs are also “often the first ones who see certain trends happening because we have all the data in one place.”
“Forecasting has become much more important for businesses to remain competitive,” she added.
As President Donald Trump continues on-again, off-again levies on foreign-made goods, finance chiefs are doing what they can to respond. But their responses, of course, are hardly uniform.
“The size of the company, in some ways, dictates the response,” said Stephen Philipson, head of wealth, corporate, commercial and institutional banking at U.S. Bank. “A very large corporation has lots of leverage through liquidity. They oftentimes have pretty good room in their margins to absorb short-term tariff increases, and a lot more flexibility in terms of moving around supply chains. Middle-market clients tend to have a little less flexibility.”
Jeff Codd, VP of finance at Connecticut-based electrical supplier U.S. Electrical Services, said his company has, generally speaking, adjusted language in its terms and conditions to provide some protection from any tariff-related impacts. The business put those in place during Trump’s first term in office.
At the same time, Codd said he’s also been making quick inventory adjustments to guard against any potential disruptions.
“We are cautiously evaluating impact across specific categories on the amount of inventory we’re holding, while making sure we have inventory on the shelves for our customers,” Codd said.
For some finance chiefs, tariffs have some clear historical parallels.
“The whole situation with tariffs mimics, to me, what it felt like during COVID,” Dickerson says.
With a seemingly business-friendlier administration in the White House, many leaders expected 2025 to be a year of deals. And indeed, some reports have shown that M&A activity has increased marginally over the first half of the year. Codd with U.S. Electrical Services, for instance, noted his firm has completed three acquisitions over the last 12 months.
But there have also been some stumbling blocks due, in part, to an aggressive tariff regime that has paralyzed deals for some firms, especially middle-market ones.
Where do things go from here? Some observers see reason for M&A optimism over the rest of 2025. “It feels like there is a reemergence” in risk appetite among business leaders, U.S. Bank’s Philipson said.
“You’ve got a very attractive finance environment. You’ve got spreads at all-time tights. There’s the expectation that the Fed will resume cutting again starting next month, which again creates a positive risk appetite environment.”
In some cases, Philipson said, leaders are simply adjusting to a new normal. “Some of the worst-case scenarios have been taken off the table, whether that’s around the tax bill or how meaningful tariffs could be,” he said. “Inflation is still present, but it hasn’t spun out of control at this point.”
With the official blessing of AICPA and NASBA last month, the 120-hour CPA pathway may well see adoption by all 50 states. If not this year, it may come soon.
In the ninth edition of the Uniform Accountancy Act, the two organizations included a pathway that would require only a bachelor’s degree in accounting — the equivalent of 120 credit hours — as well as two years of experience and passage of the CPA exam. Notably, the traditional 150-hour pathway remains a valid option.
In a July interview, Jack Castonguay, associate professor of accounting at Hofstra University, predicted that it’s in every state’s best interest to adopt the change.
“If they don’t, they’d be putting themselves at a competitive disadvantage,” he said. “I don’t see any reason why all the jurisdictions won’t ultimately adopt this.”
That’s not to say that all finance leaders are fully on board with CPA licensure changes.
“It’s touchy,” said Dickerson. “The talent pipeline is a huge issue, and I know they’re trying to alleviate it” with these changes.
That being said, “I worry about lessening too much,” she added. “I know there’s still a lot of discussion” around it.
Evangelists of generative AI and agentic AI — types of artificial intelligence designed to operate with little or no human oversight — are betting big on more automation in the workforce. Big Tech firms are dumping billions of dollars into the emerging technology.
Finance leaders see potential, but many are moving forward with caution. Similar to tariff responses, an organization’s size plays a role in how its leaders think about AI. The risks, of course, have not totally gone away, and some large language models’ propensity for “hallucinations” — chatbots’ tendency to occasionally produce misleading or false responses — has given some business leaders pause.
As a result, finance leaders are looking for narrow, discrete use cases for the tech, with clear guardrails in place. That might mean a tailor-made large language model using only internal company data instead of dumping proprietary information into, say, ChatGPT.
“We’ve taken a slower approach to make sure our systems are ready,” Regenesis’ Dickerson said of AI tools.
For his part, U.S. Bank’s Philipson maintained AI is likely to drive productivity gains in the months and years ahead. “I think there is very real momentum to it,” he said.",68fbfd39d97b57f51c46717db9eb7e4e,trafilatura,7218,0

Opened by Wilson Shankweiler on April 15, 1934, Shankweiler's Drive-In Theatre in Orefield, PA is the oldest operating drive-in theater in the world.
To purchase the drive-in in 2022, McClanahan and McChesney emptied their life savings and took out a $1,000,000 loan. While the couple is determined to maintain the theater's vintage charm, they're running it with modern sensibilities.
""Shankweiler's was a quiet backyard theater,"" McClanahan, 35, says. ""It existed to play the movies for its neighborhood, and that was really it. We're trying to elevate that and bring it to another level.""
Today, 91 years after it opened, Shankweiler's is still drawing crowds with new releases, community events and ""the best popcorn in the Lehigh Valley,"" as McClanahan says in his preshow announcement.
Tickets cost approximately $9 for children and $13 for adults, and in classic drive-in style, Shankweiler's plays a double feature every night.
'If not us, who else?'
Shankweiler's has always had a special place in McClanahan's heart: ""It was a very personal connection, because I grew up coming here, so I had that drive to preserve a piece of my own childhood,"" he says.
A lifelong film buff, McClanahan previously co-managed another drive-in theater, and started a mobile movie exhibition company during the pandemic.
He met McChesney, 41, at the drive-in he used to manage.
""He took my ticket, and we started dating maybe a year after that,"" McChesney recalls. The couple is now engaged.
When a local newspaper reported that Shankweiler's could be sold, McClanahan knew it was time to make a move.
""It was kind of an 'if not us, who else?' situation,"" he says. ""I had the qualifications. We had the background, we had the blueprints to redefine the business. So who else was going to do it but us?""
At the time, Shankweiler's was listed for $1.2 million, but after talking to the couple, the former owners settled on a purchase price of $1.05 million.
McClanahan and McChesney took out a $1,000,000 SBA 7 (a) small business loan, which required a down payment of around $112,000.
The owners agreed to finance part of the down payment, and McClanahan and McChesney ""scrounged up"" the rest of the money from their personal savings, retirement accounts, and contributions from family and friends.
""Because it's historic, because it's so special, there is that added pressure that we have to be successful with this.""Lauren McChesney
After the purchase, McChesney quit her job in health care to focus on reviving the theater.
""I thought it was going to feel a lot scarier to give up my previous career,"" she says. ""But as soon as I made that shift, it all just fell into place and made sense to me.""
Just seven days after finalizing the purchase, McClanahan and McChesney re-opened Shankweiler's in November 2022.
For the couple, failure wasn't an option: ""Because it's historic, because it's so special, there is that added pressure that we have to be successful with this,"" McChesney says.
Making ""just enough"" to keep going
While most drive-ins operate seasonally, Shankweiler's is open 7 days a week between Memorial Day and Labor Day, and Thursday through Sunday the rest of the year.
""Since we had all these payments and we had to start paying our loan and we have bills, we had to be open year-round,"" McChesney says.
Making ends meet the first year was ""rough,"" McClanahan says.
Shankweiler's brought in around $300,000 in total revenue in 2023, and after covering all the theater's expenses, the couple paid themselves ""just enough to put groceries on the table.""
For most of the year, Shankweiler's operates at a loss. The theater is typically only profitable during the summer months, McClanahan says, and their summer revenue ""carries the theater for the entire rest of the year.""
July is usually their most successful month, with a total income of $122,602 last year.
Sometimes, a major hit will boost revenue during the off-season. Shankweiler's ordinarily loses money in the winter, but the success of ""Wicked"" in November 2024 netted the theater $36,264 in total income for the month.
According to McClanahan, the theater's main expense is film licensing: it comprises about a third of Shankweiler's entire operating expenses. Other major expenses include loan payments; utilities and power; food and supplies for the snack bar; and payroll.
""You have a ton of money going in, and then a ton of money going right back out,"" McClanahan says.
During the summer high season, McClanahan and McChesney hire part-time workers to operate the snack bar and ticket booth, but they still do most of the work themselves.
Shankweiler's became profitable for the first time in 2024, with a total revenue of nearly $550,000 and a net operating income of just over $50,000 after expenses.
McClanahan and McChesney were able to pay themselves a combined salary of around $36,000 for the year.
Putting the property to work
To boost attendance during the off-season, McClanahan and McChesney have had to get creative.
For Valentine's Day this year, Shankweiler's offered a special ""Date Night at the Drive-In"" event with a screening of ""The Notebook,"" charcuterie boards and cocktails.
The theater's annual Halloween trunk-or-treat event is a popular family outing with games, costume contests and sweet treats from local vendors.
""There's a lot of things in addition to the movies that customers have to look forward to when they come to our theater,"" McClanahan says. ""It's more than the movies. It's a whole night.""
The couple is working on expanding the theater's reach by hosting daytime events like craft fairs, local markets and even car shows on the four-acre property.
Running Shankweiler's is a ""high-risk, high-reward operation,"" according to McClanahan, but it's worth it to preserve the magic of the drive-in experience.
""When the movies are playing and you're watching hundreds of people share this amazing experience, and they're having a great time and everyone's happy, it's like that weight is just lifted and you realize this is why we're doing it,"" he says. ""The community is coming together in this space, and we're facilitating something really special.""

Palantir stock is surging thanks to the company's ability to consistently deliver record-breaking growth from its artificial intelligence (AI) products.
While it's tempting to follow momentum, Palantir is trading at valuations that eclipse even those seen during prior stock market bubbles.
Institutional investors appear to be reining in their buying activity.
As of the closing bell on Aug. 12, shares of data mining darling Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR) have skyrocketed by 147% year to date -- making it the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 for two years running.
The obvious talking point here is that Palantir has been on a monster run throughout the course of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Skeptics point to Palantir's lofty valuation as the cornerstone of the bear argument, as the stock trades at levels encroaching on dot-com-era bubble territory. While that's true, such concerns haven't stopped the stock from repeatedly notching new highs.
I think there is a far subtler detail surrounding Palantir stock that rarely gets discussed. If history is any guide, it could set the stage for an epic reversal.
Is now the time to sell Palantir stock? Read on to find out.
Valuation that redefines what it means to be ""expensive""
During the late 1990s, internet companies were often measured by non-financial metrics based on user engagement. Businesses such as Amazon, Cisco, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Yahoo! were valued based on eyeballs and clicks rather than sales and profits. At the peak of dot-com euphoria, many of these internet pioneers traded at price-to-sales (P/S) multiples between 30 and 40 -- considered unsustainably high at the time.
Palantir has completely redefined how next-generation technology businesses are valued, though. As of Aug. 12, Palantir boasts a market cap of nearly $444 billion -- larger than Salesforce, SAP, and Adobe, which are far more mature, diversified businesses. Perhaps even more striking is that Palantir's P/S of 137 exists in its own stratosphere -- completely outside the dimensions of its software-as-a-service (SaaS) peers.
Some argue that traditional valuation methodologies such as P/S or earnings multiples don't fully capture Palantir's true value or its full potential. Instead, they urge investors to focus on industry-specific and financially engineered metrics such as the Rule of 40 to see just how ""cheap"" Palantir stock really is.
I think this argument is flawed. There's a more telling metric -- and one that almost nobody talks about -- that makes me think Palantir stock could be on a collision course with history.
Is ""smart money"" trying to tell us something?
The chart below tracks buying activity in Palantir stock across institutional investors since its initial public offering (IPO) in late 2020.
Initially, there was a wave of ""smart money"" buying during early 2021, which was met with substantial selling during the latter half of that year. Palantir's institutional ownership picked up again following the company's splash into the AI realm a couple of years ago. It's this dynamic where I think the retail investing crowd is missing the bigger picture and buying into a mirage.
As the chart above illustrates, there is a convergence happening between the institutional buying and selling in Palantir stock. When net demand tightens -- meaning that buying is no longer materially higher than selling -- it takes less downside pressure to inspire a precipitous drop in share price. I see the dynamics illustrated in the chart above as an inflection point for Palantir stock.
In addition, banks, wealth management firms, mutual funds, and hedge funds all have different priorities. Many of these institutions are required to hold large-cap stocks for benchmarking purposes, not because they think the stock is undervalued or because they carry some ""diamond hands"" conviction that shares are going higher despite abnormal volatility in the present. When a stock becomes an abnormally high weight relative to the overall portfolio, institutional investors often trim their exposure. This is known as portfolio rebalancing.
This scenario can be perfectly explained in the video clip above in which mutual fund billionaire Ron Baron describes his fiduciary responsibility to take profits from time to time in even his highest-conviction positions, such as Tesla. If a stock becomes overinflated, institutions will use this market liquidity as a mechanism to sell their shares to retail at a premium. This dynamic is more colloquially referred to leaving retail ""holding the bag"" when the hype narrative fades.
While I can't say for certain where Palantir stock is headed, my thought is that fund investors are going to pressure portfolio managers to trim exposure to Palantir and take some money off the table, much like what Baron experienced. I think the pressure will be rooted in the anticipation of a valuation reset for Palantir given its frothy positioning relative to peers.
Will history repeat itself?
Although history is not always a perfect predictor, I think it's a strong barometer in this case. While it's virtually impossible to pick the perfect time to sell a stock, I think there are some compelling -- and overlooked -- details that suggest Palantir stock could be headed lower from current price points sooner than many bulls expect.

In addition, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and St Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem both threw cold water on the idea of a -50 bp rate cut at the September FOMC meeting. The dollar's interest rate differential improved with the 10-year T-note yield rising +5 bp and the 2-year T-note yield up +6 bp.
Thursday’s PPI report was much stronger than market expectations. The PPI report suggested that the markets might have been overly optimistic about Tuesday's CPI report and that companies are passing through tariffs at the wholesale level at a higher pace than earlier thought.
The July US final-demand PPI report of +0.9% m/m and +3.3% y/y was substantially stronger than market expectations of +0.2% m/m and +2.5% y/y. The July US core final-demand PPI report of +0.9% m/m and +3.7% y/y was substantially stronger than market expectations of +0.2% m/m and +3.0% y/y.
The markets dialed back expectations for Fed easing in the wake of Thursday's disappointing PPI report. The markets are no longer discounting any chance of a -50 bp rate cut at the September meeting and are now assigning a 93% chance of that rate cut. After Treasury Secretary Bessent's interest rate suggestion to the Fed on Wednesday, the markets temporarily assigned an 11% chance of a -50 bp rate cut at the September meeting. Nevertheless, the current 93% chance of a -25 bp rate cut in September is still substantially more dovish than the 40% chance assigned before the news of the weak July payroll report on August 1 and the in-line CPI report this past Tuesday.
US weekly initial unemployment claims fell by -3,000 to 224,000, which was close to expectations for a slight decline to 225,000. US weekly continuing claims fell by -15,000 to 1.953 million, which showed a slightly stronger labor market than expectations of a dip to 1.967 million.
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told the WSJ that she does not support a -50 bp rate cut at the September meeting, saying that ""would send off an urgency signal that I don't feel about the strength of the labor market."" Ms. Daly said she still supports two rate cuts this year, but that three cuts could be warranted ""if we saw more signs that the labor market was more precarious.""
St Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said that a -50 bp rate cut at the September meeting would be ""unsupported by the current state of the economy and the outlook for the economy"" in his view. He said it is too early for him to make a decision on a rate cut at the September meeting.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Thursday tried to backtrack a bit on his statements on Wednesday in which he said interest rates are ""too constrictive"" and that rates ""should probably be 150, 175 basis points lower."" He added, ""There's a very good chance of a 50 basis point cut. We could go into a series of rate cuts here, starting with a 50 basis point rate cut in September.""
In an interview with Fox Business Thursday, Mr. Bessent said he was not telling the Fed what to do and that he was not calling for a series of Fed rate cuts with his comments on Wednesday. He said he was merely trying to say that models show the neutral rate is lower, although he didn't specify which models he was referring to. Mr. Bessent said he supports transparency and the call to clean up investment conflicts among members of Congress.
The markets are awaiting this Friday's Trump-Putin summit in Alaska for any progress in ending the Russian-Ukrainian war. President Trump on Monday downplayed expectations of a breakthrough, saying the summit is a ""feel-out meeting"" to end the war in Ukraine. Also, recent comments from Ukrainian President Zelenskiy dampened hopes for a quick end to the war when he rejected any talk of Ukraine ceding territory to Russia.
In recent tariff news, President Trump early Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. Last Wednesday, Mr. Trump announced that he will impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. Still, companies would be eligible for exemptions if they demonstrate a commitment to building their products in the US. However, the US will levy a separate tax on imports of electronic products that employ semiconductors. Also, Mr. Trump announced last Wednesday that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil. Last Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced ""within the next week or so."" According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.
Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 93% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and at 53% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.
EUR/USD (^EURUSD) fell -0.49% due to dollar strength. Also, sentiment on the euro remains cautious due to the negative impact of US tariffs on the European economy. Meanwhile, market expectations are low for any significant progress at Friday's Trump-Putin summit in Alaska, which suggests that the Russia-Ukraine war is likely to drag on and continue to dampen sentiment in the Eurozone economy.
Swaps are pricing in a 7% chance of a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.
USD/JPY (^USDJPY) rose +0.27% due to strength in the dollar. The yen saw some underlying support after US Treasury Secretary Bessent said the Bank of Japan is falling behind the curve in addressing inflation and that he expects a rate hike. However, the yen continues to be undercut by concern that US tariff policies will harm the Japanese economy.
December gold (GCZ25) on Thursday closed down -25.10 (-0.74%), and September silver (SIU25) closed down -0.533 (-1.38%). Precious metals prices closed lower due to the higher dollar and the rise in T-note yields that accompanied Thursday’s hawkish US PPI report.
Gold continues to have safe-haven support related to US tariffs and geopolitical risks, including the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. Fund buying of precious metals continues to support prices after gold holdings in ETFs rose to a 2-year high on Tuesday, and silver holdings in ETFs reached a 3-year high last Friday.

“These megatrends are more like tectonic plates,” he writes, “grinding against each other rather than a seesaw balancing itself.”
Davis reaffirms the wisdom of Vanguard’s founder, Jack Bogle, and explains why it still resonates a half-century later.
Here are edited excerpts of our conversation:
Kerry Hannon: Can you tick off what you view as the megatrends?
Joe Davis: Technology and how it improves our work and raises growth. Deficits and debt levels of governments, which can affect the bond markets and economic growth and inflation. The third is globalization. That's in the headlines for tariffs, but there are other aspects of globalization, such as where good ideas come from, an underrated part of globalization. The fourth is the two dimensions of demographics. It’s population growth, which includes immigration, as well as the aging of society.
Even if AI delivers extraordinary breakthroughs, there is still the real possibility that technology will not rescue us from the headwinds the economy faces.
How does someone build a resilient retirement portfolio taking all that into account?
There's a lot of change (coming) in the years ahead from the economic perspective. Focus on the things that you can control.
Create clear, realistic investment goals for your portfolio, incorporating your time horizon and an honest assessment of your tolerance for risk. And stick with a research-based investment plan through good times and bad. Investing evokes strong emotions that can lead to impulsive decisions.
Max out your savings and stay invested in the market. There's going to be a lot of concern in terms of what interest rates may do and what the stock market may do. But in virtually all scenarios, everyone will heavily benefit from compounding and staying invested in the markets.
Maintain a diversified mix of broad investments across different kinds of investments to reduce a portfolio’s exposure to the risk common to an entire asset class, such as stocks and bonds.
Minimizing cost and fees was perhaps Bogle’s greatest contribution to investors and the financial services industry, and it’s not going away. As Bogle often said, “in investing, you get what you don’t pay for.” Assume an annual return of 6%. With annual costs equal to 0.1% of assets, a $100,000 investment will grow to $557,383 after 30 years. If annual costs are 2.0%, the total will be just $317,081, some $240,000 less. When higher costs compound, the differences in your wealth can be staggering.
How will Bogle’s mantra 'stay the course' hold up?
As someone who has spent over 20 years at Vanguard, I firmly believe in the power of “staying the course” when navigating economic and financial uncertainty, but it doesn't mean that you never adjust your portfolio.
It has been misinterpreted as ""I should ignore all headlines and not care about risks that may emerge.""
Staying the course by being continually invested in the markets is correct, but be prudent. There's always risk in tilting your portfolio too far in one way or the other. Everything in moderation is good. Jack was clearly of that mind, and I try to channel that.
You write that an aging society can be productive. Could you elaborate?
Older consumers do not spend less as they age, although what they spend on changes — for instance, healthcare.
Academic research and our analysis both show that over the past 20 years, as we moved more jobs in the United States to service-based ones — finance, education, healthcare, business services, where there's somewhat less of a physical demand — it opens the door to working longer for people. And that’s a positive. Experience matters a lot, what economists call human capital. It’s very valuable.
For those choosing to work longer, it's a good thing for the economy. Economists are underestimating this aspect of the US labor force, which is its fastest growing segment at this very moment.
Should alternative investments be held in retirement plans over the next decade? There's so much buzz with the president signing the executive order recently encouraging the use of these investments in our 401(k)s.
Costs will have to be reduced to improve the odds of success investing in them. And secondly, I cannot index all private investments. I don't get the full pool. I can only buy individual strategies. Unlike the public markets, I can't buy all of the investments and diversify my risk. I have to put my eggs in a few managers, and that's going to be much like if I was just picking individual stocks.
So these types of investments are not a great idea for the typical retirement saver?
I’m not saying you shouldn't do it. What does this mean for investors? Eyes wide open. It's who you pick as the manager that determines your success along the way. Investors have to understand that.
These can clearly add value, but not all boats rise in the ocean. If you select a manager that's not among the best, your investments are going to trail the public markets.
Manager selection is really critical, and why we view these kinds of investments as an extension of active management. The good news is some private investments, based upon skill of the managers, can do exceptionally well in outperforming the broad public markets.
That has been true for 20 years. It'll be true in the next 20 years.
When you consider that the top 20 stocks make up half of the market cap of the S&P 500 Index, what should investors like me be thinking? Should I be diversifying out of this index fund?
If someone has only been invested in the S&P 500 in their retirement account, congratulations. It has done exceptionally well.
I would not urge anyone to do drastic selling. This is where I say ""stay the course,"" but start thinking about diversifying. It could be smaller-cap companies in the United States, which have trailed over the past 10 or 15 years, as well as non-US investments. Every market has trailed the United States almost without exception.
Some of the next great companies may be small today, or may be located outside the US. That has not been the case in the past 10 or 15 years, but I don't think investing should be looked at through the rearview mirror.
Parting thoughts?
My goal is to demystify these trends and how they relate to investing, not sugarcoat it.",754e861931e7b3ddbef5d71d56c9abf2,trafilatura,6696,0
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-words-palantir-ceo-alex-190000586.html,e11389f067389ccda7091d5193ed0055,4 Words From Palantir CEO Alex Karp That BigBear . ai Investors Cant Ignore,4 Words From Palantir CEO Alex Karp That BigBear . ai Investors Cant Ignore,2025-08-16 20:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Palantir has an established reputation for working closely with the U.S. military.
BigBear.ai is seeking to compete with Palantir in the world of artificial intelligence (AI) defense operations.
Following second-quarter earnings from both companies earlier this month, the Department of Defense's (DOD) preferred vendor between Palantir and BigBear.ai couldn't be any more clear.
Dr. Alex Karp isn't your typical corporate executive. He doesn't hold an MBA, and his public remarks often come in the form of unscripted, philosophical musings. Yet as CEO of data analytics powerhouse Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR), Karp has led the company's transformation from a secretive government contractor into a leading force in artificial intelligence (AI) adoption across the enterprise software landscape.
What many investors once viewed as a niche corridor, the intersection of defense operations and AI has swiftly become fertile ground supporting Palantir's generational run. The company has secured some of the Department of Defense's (DOD) most complex, mission-critical contracts, worth billions of dollars, cementing its role as a trusted partner in national security.
Following Palantir's monster Q2 earnings report earlier this month, Karp's confidence was on full display. During an interview on financial news program CNBC, he delivered a blunt message to Palantir's rivals: ""read 'em and weep.""
Let's unpack what Karp really meant and assess why investors in competing platforms such as BigBear.ai(NYSE: BBAI) can no longer afford to ignore Palantir's commanding lead in the AI defense arena.
Palantir is setting the pace to become the AI backbone for military operations
During the second quarter, Palantir's revenue surged 48% year over year to $1.0 billion. While that growth is impressive on its own, the finer details reveal just how deeply Palantir has embedded itself in the military operations pocket of the AI landscape.
The company's government segment grew 49% year over year, slightly outpacing overall growth. Drilling down further, Palantir's U.S. government revenue rose by an even stronger 53% -- reaching $426 million in the quarter. This momentum is supported by a string of high-profile Pentagon deals.
In March, Palantir partnered with defense contractorsNorthrop Grumman and L3Harris Technologies, along with autonomous systems specialist Anduril, in a $178 million U.S. Army deal to help build the Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node (TITAN) ground transportation system.
Just months later, the Army extended its relationship with Palantir, awarding a $795 million extension to continue using the company's Maven Smart System(MSS) platform -- bringing the total deal value above $1.2 billion.
More recently, Palantir further strengthened its public sector footprint with two additional contracts: a multiyear contract with the Army worth up to $10 billion, as well as a separate award to help develop a surveillance system for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
Why is this important for BigBear.ai investors?
During BigBear.ai's second-quarter earnings call, CEO Kevin McAleenan acknowledged that the company has ""seen disruptions in federal contracts from efficiency efforts this quarter, most notably in programs that support the U.S. Army, as they seek to consolidate and modernize their data architecture.""
Given the details outlined above, there's a strong possibility that the ""disruptions"" McAleenan referenced reflect Palantir winning these contracts. While BigBear.ai operates in some of the same broad fields as Palantir, such as AI analytics and machine learning, I think the comparison between the two companies is increasingly lopsided.
Each new government contract awarded to Palantir deepens its competitive moat. The company's Foundry and Gotham platforms are evolving into a comprehensive, integrated ecosystem for the public sector -- supporting a range of mission-critical needs.
Rather than true ""network effects,"" Palantir is enjoying a cumulative competitive edge that's compounding with each deployment of its software -- ultimately broadening the company's footprint, strengthening its relationships, and making the cost of switching to competing platforms more costly.
These dynamics have effectively given Palantir a mini-monopoly on certain pockets of public sector deal flow, beyond the capacities of traditional defense contractors specializing in manufacturing hardware or equipment.
Is BigBear.ai stock a buy?
Karp's soundbite wasn't just swagger, nor was it merely aimed at short-sellers who have been betting against Palantir for years. It was a direct shot at every competing platform.
The 2025 stock chart reflecting Palantir and BigBear.ai tells a very different story.
Palantir has built steady momentum on the back of rising deal flow, translating directly into accelerating revenue and profitability. BigBear.ai, by contrast, has seen far more volatile price swings, with its moves often driven by hype and the hopeful narrative that it could one day become the ""next Palantir.""
That outcome appears increasingly improbable. Each new government contract Palantir secures widens the gap between it and smaller rivals struggling to keep pace.
For investors seeking exposure to AI's role in military operations, Palantir offers a proven track record over speculative counterparts such as BigBear.ai, whose traction remains more aspirational than tangible.

Two million of the shares will be issued by the company, while a hefty 8 million will come from existing shareholders. The offering also includes a greenshoe option for an additional 1.5 million shares, potentially amplifying dilution for current holders.
Circle expects to raise roughly $309.4 million from its portion of the offering, or as much as $542.6 million if underwriters exercise their greenshoe option in full. The company says the proceeds will fuel working capital needs, cover payment obligations, and support business investments and potential acquisitions, giving it more firepower to expand its stablecoin footprint. Of course, Circle will not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by existing stockholders.
With 80% of the secondary offering coming from existing stakeholders, the move signals clear profit-taking by insiders, including the company’s CEO, Jeremy Allaire. Moreover, coming just two months after the IPO, the secondary offering has raised questions about the company’s outlook, sparked concerns over short-term dilution and has momentarily eclipsed its strong top-line growth in the latest earnings report, as well as its ongoing efforts to advance stablecoin infrastructure.
About Circle Stock
New York-based Circle is a global fintech firm that helps businesses of all sizes use digital currencies and public blockchains for payments, commerce, and other financial applications. Through its regulated affiliates, it issues USDC and EURC, fully backed stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar and euro respectively, and runs one of the most widely used stablecoin networks.
Circle, which made its public debut on June 5, is quickly emerging as a rising star in the stablecoin world and the crypto industry. The momentum grew even stronger after the GENIUS Act passed in July, setting clear rules and protections for asset-backed digital tokens like those tied to the U.S. dollar. A big chunk of Circle’s revenue comes from interest earned on short-term U.S. Treasury bills that back its dollar-based stablecoin, USDC.
Valued at roughly $38.1 billion by market capitalization, this stablecoin issuer’s stock has been feeling the heat lately following a mixed earnings report and uncertainty surrounding a planned 10 million-share secondary sale. After an eye-popping triple-digit surge since its market debut, the rally has lost steam, sliding nearly 47% from its July high of $262.97. Over the past five days, shares have dipped 9%, signaling a cooling-off period after its explosive run.
Despite its recent selloff, Circle still trades at 16.46 times sales, far above the industry average of 3.29x. This sizable premium reflects the strong confidence investors have in the company’s growth prospects, while also highlighting that much of the anticipated success may already be priced into the stock.
Inside Circle’s Q2 Earnings Report
Circle dropped its first earnings report since its blockbuster public debut on Aug. 12, which gave investors plenty to digest. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, total revenue came in at $658.1 million, up a hefty 53% from a year ago and topping Wall Street’s $644.7 million estimate. The jump was powered by an 86% surge in average USDC in circulation. By the quarter’s end, USDC supply had swelled 90% year-over-year (YOY) to $61.3 billion and has since grown another 6.4% to $65.2 billion as of Aug. 10.
Adjusted EBITDA also climbed 52% YOY to $126 million, reflecting the stablecoin’s rapid adoption. The headline numbers, however, were overshadowed by a steep bottom-line hit. Circle posted a net loss of $482.1 million, or $4.48 per share, compared to a $32.9 million profit, or breakeven per share, in the year-ago period. The loss was largely the result of $591 million in non-cash charges tied to the company’s June IPO. Moreover, adjusted operating expenses shot up 22% annually to $128.2 million.
On the growth front, Circle unveiled “Arc,” its own proprietary blockchain aimed at powering stablecoin payments, foreign exchange, and capital markets applications. Arc will be built into the company’s broader platform and is expected to start developer testing this fall. The company also rolled out a slate of new strategic partnerships with Binance, Corpay (CPAY), FIS (FIS), Fiserv (FI), and OKX, strengthening its global reach.
Looking forward to fiscal 2025, Circle is guiding for $75 million to $85 million in other revenue, with adjusted operating expenses between $475 million and $490 million. The crypto company also sees USDC circulation expanding at a 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the cycle, underscoring its bullish outlook for the stablecoin market.
What do Analysts Think About Circle Stock?
After the company’s latest earnings report, US Tiger Securities analyst Bo Pei has dialed back his optimism, cutting Circle’s price target from $200 to $180. While acknowledging the company’s strong foothold in regulated stablecoins and the upcoming Arc blockchain, the analyst flagged mounting risks, shrinking profit margins, rising operating costs, and heavy reliance on interest income from reserves. With 96% of revenue still tied to interest-sensitive assets, a Fed rate cut could sting. Plus, the stock’s steep valuation leaves little room for error.
Overall, Wall Street appears divided on Circle’s outlook, with the stock carrying a consensus “Hold” rating that reflects a tug-of-war between bullish optimism and bearish caution. Of the 14 analysts tracking the company, five are firmly in the “Strong Buy” camp, while one takes a softer stance with a “Moderate Buy.”
On the flip side, four analysts are content to sit on the sidelines with a “Hold,” and another four are decidedly bearish, labeling it a “Strong Sell.” CRCL’s average analyst price target of $183.54 indicates 19.8% potential upside from current levels, while the Street high price target of $280 suggests that the stock can climb as much as 82.8% from here.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dear-marvell-stock-fans-mark-184819195.html,38db039f2290426886bc0877aadd09dc,"Dear Marvell Stock Fans , Mark Your Calendars for August 28","Dear Marvell Stock Fans , Mark Your Calendars for August 28",2025-08-16 17:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"While Nvidia (NVDA) may hog the artificial intelligence (AI) spotlight, Marvell Technology (MRVL) has been quietly scripting its own chapter in the semiconductor boom. The Wilmington-based chipmaker builds the backbone of our digital age, designing semiconductors that power everything from hyperscale data centers to 5G networks and advanced automotive systems.
The year began with fireworks, as Marvell delivered record revenue and earnings in Q1, propelled by AI’s insatiable appetite and Marvell’s surging custom silicon business. Now, all eyes are on Aug. 28, when the infrastructure semiconductor solutions leader unveils its Q2 results. Management is projecting robust growth, with investors eager for updates on AI momentum, new product rollouts, and market expansion plans.
Though MRVL stock sits nearly 40% below its 52-week high of $127.48, its 21% rally over the past three months signals that momentum is building, and Aug. 28 could mark another defining chapter in Marvell’s climb.
About Marvell Stock
Marvell, founded in 1995, set out to accelerate how the world moves and processes data. This Delaware-based company, valued at $67.2 billion by market capitalization, designs semiconductor solutions that reach from the heart of the data center to the farthest edge of the network. Today, with AI demand surging, Marvell’s technology powers high-speed networking, advanced storage, and 5G connectivity, quietly driving the backbone of our digital world.
Marvell’s shares have been on a roller coaster worthy of Wall Street’s highlight reel. Over the past 52 weeks, MRVL stock climbed 23.8%, peaking at $127.48 earlier this year before tumbling to a bruising year-to-date (YTD) low of $47.08 in April. Down 28.2% in 2025, the chipmaker became a short-seller’s darling, until momentum flipped.
Over the past three months, MRVL has surged 21.2%, up 9.1% in the last month alone, and now sits nearly 70% above its lows. Meanwhile, the 14-day RSI is just above 60, signaling healthy buying interest. This rebound is not just technical – bullish management guidance, upbeat analyst calls, and Marvell’s ambitious goal of seizing 20% of the custom AI chip market by 2028 are fueling the rally.
Marvell’s pullback in 2025 has opened a rare lane in the crowded chip space. Priced at approximately 36 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and 11.58 times sales - well below its historical averages - this AI-driven chipmaker is priced like it is on clearance, despite heavyweight growth prospects.
Fueled by booming demand in custom chips, high-speed memory, and optical tech, Marvell’s data center momentum and hyperscaler alliances make its valuation look primed for takeoff.
A Closer Look at Marvell’s Mixed Q1 Earnings Report
Marvell’s fiscal 2026 Q1 earnings results, released on May 29, was the kind of report that keeps investors leaning forward in their seats. The chipmaker’s top and bottom lines beat Wall Street’s projections, with revenue surging 63% year over year (YoY) to $1.9 billion, well above its own guidance midpoint. Adjusted EPS came in at $0.62, rocketing 158% annually.
The primary growth driver was the Data Center segment, which generated $1.44 billion, 76% of total revenue, reflecting a 76% annual increase and 5% sequential growth. This momentum was fueled by high-volume production of custom AI silicon programs and strong electro-optics shipments supporting AI and cloud infrastructure. Enterprise Networking and Carrier Infrastructure each advanced 14% sequentially, continuing their post-pandemic recovery.
However, other areas softened. Consumer revenue declined 29% sequentially, though management anticipates a 50% rebound in Q2, supported by seasonal gaming demand. Automotive and industrial revenue fell 12% sequentially, with a flat outlook for Q2.
The balance sheet is looking healthy, with Marvell ending Q1 with $885.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and a conservative debt-to-equity ratio of 0.3x. Shareholder returns remained a priority, with $52 million paid in dividends and a sharp increase in stock buybacks to $340 million, up from $200 million in the prior quarter.
AI All the Way
Building on its strong Q1 results, Marvell is doubling down on its AI-led growth strategy. CEO Matt Murphy says AI now drives most of its data center revenue, with bigger gains ahead. As part of a broader strategic realignment, Marvell is selling its Automotive Ethernet business to Infineon (IFX.D.DX) for $2.5 billion, the deal is expected to close later this year.
On the innovation side, Marvell bolstered its custom silicon platform through a new collaboration with Nvidia, integrating NVLink Fusion into its XPU roadmap to enable more scalable AI architectures. It also rolled out a multi-die packaging platform, already in production, using its interposer technology for faster, cheaper system designs.
CEO Murphy sees Marvell at the heart of the custom AI infrastructure boom, with its silicon business set to fuel growth in Q2 and beyond. While the company is all set for the Q2 report on Aug. 28, after the bell, the management expects $2 billion in revenue (plus or minus 5%), up 57% YoY, fueled by AI momentum, expanded custom silicon programs, and stronger networking infrastructure. Additionally, adjusted EPS is estimated to land somewhere around $0.67 (plus or minus $0.05) per share, more than doubling last year’s figure.
Analysts tracking Marvell anticipate its Q2 revenue to rise to $2 billion, with adjusted EPS rising 325% YoY to $0.51. Looking further ahead, fiscal 2026 EPS is anticipated to surge by 133.7% YoY to $2.15, before rising by another 31.6% annually to $2.83 in fiscal 2027.
What Do Analysts Expect for Marvell Stock?
Analysts maintain a decidedly favorable view of this chip stock, assigning it an overall “Strong Buy” rating. Of the 32 analysts covering the stock, 24 recommend a “Strong Buy,” two stick to a “Moderate Buy,” and the remaining six are staying on the sidelines with a “Hold” rating.
MRVL stock’s mean price target of $92.17 hints at a 16.2% upside potential from where it’s trading now. The Street-high target of $149 implies the stock could rally as much as 87.8%.

Payoneer this week added technology from Citi to enhance treasury transfers by using Citi's Token Services, the bank's blockchain unit. This follows JPMorganChase's launch of its deposit token, an alternative to stablecoins that also uses distributed ledger technology to speed transaction processing.
The banks' moves position them to leverage their giant payment businesses to offer a range of digital asset services, including stablecoins, placing pressure on other banks to prepare for a range of new products.
""Banks, regardless of size, need a stablecoin strategy now,"" said James Wester, director of crypto for Javelin Strategy & Research. ""That doesn't mean they need every technical answer, but they do need a clear vision of where they fit and how they will connect their customers, partners, and developers into the next generation of money movement.""
Citi's Payoneer collaboration
Payoneer, a New York-based company that processes B2B and consumer-to-business transfers, will use Citi's blockchain to move money across Payoneer-owned accounts, reducing the need for traditional payment methods.
""Money movements in legacy systems have cut-off times,"" Derek Green, treasurer at Payoneer, told American Banker. ""Addressing that is a powerful first step in the value of blockchain.""
By using Citi Token Services, Payoneer avoids restricted bank hours and closures on weekends and holidays. Payoneer hopes the collaboration will ensure ""instant liquidity"" through 24/7 transfers between Payoneer users in the U.S., U.K. and Singapore. Using a blockchain reduces cash management and foreign exchange risk; and an application programming interface enables integration with a business's existing treasury and payment systems, avoiding infrastructure updates, according to Payoneer. The Citi deal helps Payoneer accelerate its ongoing geographic and product expansion. Payoneer's 2020 acquisition of German payment firm Optile allowed it to integrate payments orchestration with cloud-based technology to power international business payments while adding more countries to its network.
""Given our geographic reach [Citi] is a way to make transfers less complex,"" Green said.
While Payoneer's partnership with Citi uses tokenized deposits, the use of stablecoins for transactions is a possibility, according to Green.
""The blockchain is really the fundamental technology here,"" Green said. ""The stablecoins would be the mechanism that would facilitate the outcome.""
Like most banks and payment companies, Payoneer is still examining how stablecoins would best suit its business. Getting on board with blockchain-powered payment processing is a way to lay a foundation for greater uses in the future, according to Green. ""Citi is a partner of ours and it makes sense to lean in and get this technology live,"" Green said.
Big bank plans
Citi referred questions to recent statements the bank has made on digital assets. In an early interview with American Banker, Debopama Sen, head of payments for Citi's Services business, said the bank has focused on supporting 24/7/365 clearing for Citi's clients. ""Something we've learned over the last few years, we didn't sort of imagine or dream this up — is that co-creating with some of the largest category leaders has helped us create products that actually work for everyone as long as we simplify the access of the channel, depending on the client,"" Sen said.
Citi's Token Services uses a distributed ledger, database and embedded business logic to power services such as intraday lending, cross-border payments and funds transfers, designed for supply chain financing, trade settlement and other functions. Stablecoins are also part of the bank's strategy, with Citi CEO Jane Fraser saying the bank is planning a stablecoin and will support conversions from traditional currency to crypto. These services are value-adds for the bank's large payments business. Citi's payments business processes $5 trillion across more than 90 countries and jurisdictions on a daily basis, including 11 million daily instant transactions. Among other large banks, JPMorgan also plans to issue a stablecoin and in June said it plans to issue a USD deposit token, JPMD.
A deposit token is a digital asset that is a claim on a deposit at a licensed depository institution, such as a bank. Deposit tokens are issued on a distributed ledger. That makes deposit tokens easier to transfer between consumers or businesses, particularly in different countries.
JPMorgan's payments business manages $18 billion in yearly revenue, and is the world's largest merchant acquirer and the largest card issuer in the U.S. And it has more than 30,000 staffers. The size of JPMorgan and Citi will influence blockchain, digital asset and stablecoin strategies at other banks, according to Wester.
""The connections and partnerships are being established today, so the choice for banks is whether they view this as an opportunity to stake their position and actively shape the ecosystem or wait until the rules are written by others,"" Wester said. ""For some banks, it may make sense to take a wait-and-see approach, but the decision should be intentional and not simply inaction dressed up as caution.""
Scale becomes a challenge when banks expand the use of blockchain-powered transactions from intrabank to interbank. Two major models are emerging among banks to use distributed ledger technology to improve transaction processing for treasury management, Duane Block, managing director of digital assets at Accenture, told American Banker. Deposit tokens are a better fit for intrabank payments, or transactions between different accounts at the same bank; while stablecoins are more suited to interbank payments, Block said, due to the stablecoins' ability to act as a bridge between payment processing systems at different organizations.
""When banks move from tokenized deposits to stablecoins, distribution can be a challenge,"" Block said. ""And partnerships are one way to accelerate that.""",ed1a2e8e4f3bce7b7132722998c977d6,trafilatura,6209,0

Shares of AMD fell by more than 6% in the session that followed, even though the company reported a terrific increase in revenue.
Even its guidance was better than analysts were expecting. Investors, however, appeared to be more concerned about the performance of AMD's data center business, where slower-than-expected growth led investors to hit the panic button.
However, a closer look at AMD's financial results and guidance reveals that the company has a solid artificial intelligence (AI)-fueled catalyst beyond the data center business that should help it sustain its impressive performance for years to come.
AI-powered personal computers (PCs) are driving solid growth for AMD
AMD's quarterly revenue increased by an impressive 32% year over year in Q2 to $7.7 billion. The company's client PC processor and gaming segment played a key role in driving this solid growth: Revenue from the segment jumped by 69% to $3.6 billion.
AMD says that it witnessed record revenue from sales of its desktop and notebook processors last quarter, while sales of its client graphics processing units (GPUs) improved as well. Its Ryzen 9000 series processors are in hot demand, and that's not surprising considering the in-built AI processing capabilities that they pack.
AMD says that its latest processors are powerful enough to run applications such as generative AI assistants, accelerate content creation with the help of AI tools, and enhance productivity by running applications such as Copilot seamlessly. The company's focus on churning AI-capable PC processors is clearly paying off, and that should remain a long-term tailwind for AMD.
That's because shipments of AI-enabled PCs are projected to increase at a compound annual rate of 42% through 2028, according to market research firm IDC. Based on that, IDC expects that by 2028, PCs equipped with a neural processing unit (NPU) to tackle AI workloads will account for almost 95% of the overall market.
AMD is already capitalizing on this trend by integrating NPUs into its client processors. On the other hand, the company's client graphics card business also has a secular growth opportunity. By 2028, annual shipments of GPUs capable of supporting AI workloads are expected to be almost 60% higher than 2023 levels. AMD has already launched client graphics cards that accelerate AI workloads locally on PCs.
In all, the company's client segment seems well-placed to keep growing at healthy rates for years to come. Importantly, this segment's growth should be complemented by the ongoing expansion of the data center GPU market.
The data center business seems primed for stronger growth
There's no question that AMD's data center revenue growth of 14% year over year in Q2 wasn't all that great. After all, Nvidia reported 73% year-over-year growth in this segment to $39.1 billion last quarter. AMD's revenue was way lower at $3.2 billion.
However, AMD had to write down $800 million worth of its data center GPU inventory last quarter because of federal restrictions on the export of its chips to China. This headwind tempered AMD's data center growth, offsetting the solid demand for its Epyc server processors, which are increasingly being adopted by cloud computing giants such as Oracle and Google.
Investors, however, will do well to note that AMD's data center revenue could clock a faster growth rate from here, as it expects to resume shipments to China following recent developments in Washington. The company will have to pay the U.S. government 15% of its revenue from AI chip sales to China, but that's better than being completely locked out of the Chinese market.
The good part is that the company is expecting shipments to non-Chinese customers to increase as well in the second half with help from its MI350 AI accelerators. These chips are on track for a ""steep production ramp in the second half of the year to support large-scale production deployments with multiple customers,"" said CEO Lisa Su on the Q2 earnings call.
AMD is forecasting a 28% year-over-year increase in revenue in the current quarter, and that excludes any potential revenue from China. It could end up delivering stronger growth than that, thanks to the opportunity in AI-powered PCs as well as the ramp-up of its data center GPU sales in the second half.
That's why investors should consider buying AMD, as it is now trading at 9.5 times sales, which is almost in line with the U.S. technology sector's average price-to-sales ratio. The AI stock's ability to grow revenues at a faster pace in the second half of the year could lead the market to reward it with a higher multiple, and that could pave the way to more share price upside.

""It instantly clicked. I was like, 'This is your home. This is where you're supposed to be in the world and this is where you will always be. I knew I had to move to Paris,"" Sanders tells CNBC Make It.
Sanders returned to Paris several times while continuing to work as a general counsel for a publicly traded company in Washington, D.C. At the time, she was earning $286,656 a year and lived in a studio apartment where she paid approximately $3,000 a month in rent, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.
""I didn't enjoy the work and the expectation to work all the time and I will probably be one of the only attorneys who says it, but I don't think it's that intellectually stimulating,"" Sanders says. ""I was deeply and truly miserable at the very depths of my little heart and little soul. I knew that it was not sustainable.""
Three years after that initial trip to Paris, Sanders quit her job, broke her lease and started the process of obtaining a French visa. She landed in the city the day before France closed its borders due to the covid-19 pandemic.
""The slowness of the world meant that France sped up. We were all operating from the same level of confusion, so the good thing is that I was confused by what was happening, but so was everyone else,"" Sanders says. ""I arrived the day before the lockdown, so there was no one and it was a complete dystopia.""
When Sanders first moved, she lived in a few short-term rentals before signing a lease for a one-bedroom apartment. She paid 1,550 euros or $1,815 USD and lived in it for two years. Since moving out of that apartment, Sanders has been living in a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment where she pays $2,540 USD a month in rent.
Since Sanders signed a lease for what is called an ""unfurnished apartment,"" it meant that she had to spend money buying her own kitchen cabinets, stove and washing machine. She estimates that she spent about $5,000 on the kitchen and close to another $10,000 to make the place really feel like home.
In addition to rent, Sanders spends, on average, about 933 euros or $1,093 USD on expenses, which include household bills like cable, internet, renter's insurance, dry cleaning, electricity and gas, private health insurance, groceries, and a Navigo transportation card.
She also has an annual subscription to the Louvre, which costs 95 euros a year and a second museum card that can add an extra 50-100 euros a year to her expenses. Sanders also pays 1,069.20 euros, or approximately $1,252, annually to a guarantor service, which allows her to continue renting in France.
Now that Sanders has been living in her apartment for over three years, she plans to revisit her search for a home to buy. She started looking two years ago, but stopped after touring many places that she felt were overpriced.
""With the advice of friends who have recently purchased in Paris, I am determined again. Finding the right place will be a grind, but I am tired of renting in Paris,"" Sanders says. I desperately need more space and I want to get a dog.""
While Sanders wants to set down roots in Paris, she also hopes to eventually buy a home in the countryside too.
""I don't think it would be nice to put a dog like a golden retriever in central Paris, where he doesn't have a backyard, so that is my dream,"" she says.
Living in France has also inspired Sanders to finally pursue her real dreams of starting her own fashion brand, Adriel Felise. Sanders says she's taking $200,000 from her business account and $70,000 from her personal savings and putting that towards her new business venture. That money and her income from content creation is helping fund her dreams.
""I love fashion and I'm so happy that I can now just say that and be upfront about it because for so long it was treated as something that made me less serious,"" she says.
Sanders is self-funding the production of her initial samples and prototypes, but hopes to raise at least $2 million and have her 10-piece collection ready for launch in 2026.
When Sanders was working as a lawyer, she used to take walks around her office building and dream about starting a fashion line, and now seeing it come to life still doesn't feel real.
""There's still a part of me that strives and pushes for more so I don't know if I'm fully ready to say I'm proud but I feel like I'm actually happy, which I wasn't for so long and that's huge for me,"" she says.
""My goal and desire is to inspire women — particularly black and brown women — to just pursue their dreams and goals. When they do it does not matter. The most important thing is that they be bold, move wisely, and just go for it.""
Since Sanders has been in France for about five years now, she says she doesn't think she'll ever go back to living in the United States.
""I can't live there. I can't function like that. I can't go back to corporate America and holding my tongue every five seconds every day,"" she says. ""I wish I had had the courage to move sooner. I wish I had the courage to do it after my first semester of law school to either drop out or enroll in business school and do something different that would have given me more options.""

Government Is Actively Backing in 2025,2025-08-16 23:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"When it comes to artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, chances are investors' thoughts may turn to semiconductors, massive data centers, or cloud computing infrastructure. This is great news for chip powerhouses and hyperscalers like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Broadcom, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Microsoft, Amazon, or Alphabet, but investors could be overlooking emerging opportunities beyond the usual suspects.
Enterprise-grade software will become an increasingly vital layer atop the hardware stack. The commercial angle is to market AI-powered software to large corporations with complex needs spanning data analytics, logistics, human resources, cybersecurity, and more.
But there is another opportunity outside of the private sector: how AI is redefining one of the largest and most sophisticated enterprises of all, the U.S. government. Earlier this year, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a plan to allocate more spending toward the Software Acquisition Pathway (SWP), a strategy first deployed in 2020. Its stated aim is to ""provide for the efficient and effective acquisition, development, integration, and timely delivery of secure software.""
Let's explore how Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR) and BigBear.ai(NYSE: BBAI) are capitalizing on AI's shift from hardware to software and how each company is approaching the opportunity with SWP.
1. Palantir Technologies: The AI darling of the U.S. government
Palantir has been at the center of several notable deals with the federal government throughout 2025. In late May, it deepened its relationship with the Department of Defense (DOD) through a $795 million extension featuring its Maven Smart System (MSS). This brought the total value of the MSS program to $1.28 billion, making it a long-term revenue driver. More recently, the company won a deal with the Army reportedly worth up to $10 billion over the next 10 years.
Palantir's wins extend beyond the U.S. military as well. The company is building the Immigration Lifecycle Operating System -- often referred to as ImmigrationOS -- for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
Signing multiyear billion-dollar deals provides Palantir with high revenue visibility, keeps its customer base sticky, and opens the door to upsell or cross-sell added services down the road.
The ability to parlay its defense expertise into other government functions also expands Palantir's public sector footprint and reinforces the breadth of its capabilities -- solidifying its role as a ubiquitous AI backbone for the U.S. government.
2. BigBear.ai: A niche player helping the public sector
Another AI software developer that has signed deals with the U.S. government this year is BigBear.ai. In February, it won a contract with the DOD to design a system to assist national security decision-making by analyzing trends and patterns in foreign media.
Shortly thereafter, the company won a $13.2 million deal spread over three and a half years to support the Joint Chiefs of Staff's force management and data analytics capabilities.
In May, the company partnered with Hardy Dynamics to advance the Army's use of machine learning and AI for autonomous drones.
Lastly, BigBear.ai has a deal with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to deploy its biometric AI infrastructure system, called Pangiam, at a dozen major airports across North America to help streamline arrivals and improve security protocols.
Which is the better stock: Palantir or BigBear.ai?
Between the two stocks, I see Palantir as the clear choice. BigBear.ai has proved it can win meaningful government contracts, but its work is more niche-focused and smaller in scale compared to Palantir's multibillion-dollar deals across multiple platforms.
In my view, BigBear.ai's popularity is largely with retail investors who are hoping that it becomes the ""next Palantir."" Smart investors know that hope is not a real strategy. Prudent valuation analysis -- and not speculation -- is required to know which stock is truly worth buying.
While some on Wall Street may argue that Palantir stock is cheap based on software-specific metrics such as the Rule of 40, I'm not entirely bought into such a narrative.
Traditional approaches to valuation, such as the price-to-sales ratio (P/S), show that Palantir is the priciest software-as-a-service stock among the businesses in the chart above -- and its valuation expansion means that shares are becoming even more expensive as the stock continues to rally.
Palantir is an impressive company that has proved it can deliver on crucial applications, but the stock is historically expensive. I think that investors are better off waiting for a more reasonable entry point and paying a more appropriate price down the road.

Referencing Amazon.com’s massive product selection, and plans for the company to more closely integrate groceries into its main online shopping experience, Amazon VP Anand Varadarajan boasted that the tech giant was building a version of a “supercenter that’s actually super to shop at,”—a not-so-subtle dig at Walmart, inventor of the U.S. supercenter model and a force in the online grocery market as well.
“The average consumer visits between four and five different retailers for groceries every single month,” the executive said in front of a smaller group of reporters later that day. What Amazon was doing, the executive claimed, was creating a one-stop shop that all customers crave. The obvious implication was that Walmart, the historical one-stop retail option, was not delivering on the promise.
On Wednesday, Amazon announced progress on what it believes is one important leg in that mission: the rollout to 1,000 U.S. cities of a same-day shopping capability where customers can buy fresh, perishable groceries, alongside regular non-grocery merchandise in a single order. The company says the service should be available in 2,300 U.S. cities by the end of 2025, making it possible for Amazon customers to order milk and fruit alongside, say, batteries or a camera—in a single delivery that arrives that very same day. Such an order wouldn’t carry a delivery fee for Prime members as long as it totaled at least $25 in “most cities,” the company said. Orders below that threshold will carry a $2.99 delivery fee. Amazon customers who aren’t Prime members will pay a $12.99 delivery fee regardless of the order size.
Walmart’s stock dropped more than 2% on the news, and shed more than $15 billion from its market cap. The stock price of grocery delivery firm Instacart plummeted 11%.
“The reason this announcement is so significant,” Wedbush Securities’ Scott Devitt wrote in a research note on Wednesday, “is that Amazon has yet to displace incumbents in the grocery category, at least for perishables. Grocery is the biggest retail category and still relatively untouched by the internet.”
Indeed.
In an interview for my book, Winner Sells All, about the Amazon/Walmart rivalry, the current CEO of Amazon’s core consumer business, Doug Herrington, explained the appeal of the grocery category. “Selling a book or a TV is great and super helpful, [but] how many times do I buy a book or TV each week versus how many times do I buy a packaged goods item, or some toilet paper or some food?”
In short, if Amazon can start making a real dent in the grocery delivery market, customers will likely shop even more frequently at the internet giant. In fact, the company previously said that was the behavior it witnessed among customers in test markets last year.
“This deepens AMZN’s customer engagement by strengthening a high-frequency purchase category into the Prime ecosystem, increasing stickiness and customer lifetime value,” Evercore’s Mark Mahaney wrote of the same-day grocery rollout in a research note to clients on Wednesday. He said the service could pose a threat to Instacart as well as Walmart’s same-day delivery membership program, Walmart+.
A history of launches, pivots, and setbacks
The path to the grocery aisle has been a long and sometimes bumpy one for Amazon, with this week’s announcement marking the latest in a string of grocery-related launches, failures, and pivots over the past two decades. For those who’ve closely followed the company’s efforts in this area, Wednesday’s announcement might even feel like déjà vu. Amazon once ran a service called Prime Now that offered two-hour delivery on a limited selection of general merchandise, along with fresh and frozen groceries in around 100 U.S. metro areas. It was discontinued in 2021, with the company saying at the time that it was being folded into the main Amazon shopping platform.
Amazon also offers the Amazon Fresh grocery delivery service, geared toward larger grocery orders, which it actually began testing all the way back in 2007. The service has gone through countless business model tweaks over the years as leadership has attempted to strike a balance between a price that’s attractive to enough customers while still supporting a cost structure that is economically sustainable. Amazon also runs a chain of dozens of Amazon Fresh grocery stores, which has a gone through phases of retrenchment and expansion itself.
And of course, Amazon made its biggest grocery splash in 2017 when it spent nearly $14 billion to acquire the brick-and-mortar grocer Whole Foods, which now counts more than 500 locations.
Amazon offers unlimited grocery delivery from both Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods grocery chains at a cost of $9.99 a month on top of the core Prime membership fee.
Along the way, Amazon has seemed intent in recent years on dispelling the notion that it has failed in the grocery space. At the press event in the fall, an Amazon executive said, “What most people don’t realize is we already have a huge established grocery business online … Most of the selection today are things like pantry items and household goods or what we call everyday essentials.”
And on recent earnings calls, Amazon executives including CEO Andy Jassy have hammered home the messaging that this “everyday essentials” business is already a major player in the nonperishable grocery space. Company leaders recently disclosed that Amazon sold more than $100 billion in groceries and household, or everyday, essentials in 2024, not counting what sold through its Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods divisions.
Now, with this latest initiative, Amazon is moving on to the type of fresh, perishable foods that customers really think of when they hear the word “grocery.” And it’s doing it in a way, thanks to years of cost-cutting under Jassy, that it believes is finally sustainable.",f6fbd75e375013be428e91619f1a4c23,trafilatura,6025,0

From graphics processing unit (GPU) leader Nvidia to hyperscalers like CoreWeave and Nebius, it's unsurprising when investors focused on AI stocks find certain names popping up again and again -- and again.
But the lack of popularity with respect to other AI-focused companies doesn't mean that their stocks are any less desirable. In fact, it's possible that those names that are less familiar have the potential to provide market-beating returns.
Look beyond the hype with these hyperscaler names
AI investors may not be able to speak to the super-specific, technical aspects of AI technology, but one thing they're likely familiar with is the importance of data centers. Providing the capability for AI computing to occur, data centers -- the sources of massive investments from AI companies -- have emerged as a critical aspect of AI development. Nvidia reported in its first quarter 2026 that data center revenue totaled $39.1 billion, climbing 73% year over year, and it announced it's building factories to produce its AI supercomputers in the U.S. in support of data center development.
Some data centers, however, are hyperscalers -- specifically designed to support the high computing demands of AI. Recognizing their importance, AI investors have leapt at the opportunity to load up on hyperscaler stocks like CoreWeave and Nebius to broaden their AI exposure.
Say ""hi"" to this hyperscaler helper
While savvy investors recognize the value of hyperscalers, they may be missing a related opportunity that's less discussed. Brandishing itself as the world's largest IT infrastructure services provider, Kyndryl(NYSE: KD) stands to benefit from the growth of hyperscalers.
With respect to its cloud services business, Kyndryl identifies in a recent filing that it helps businesses to improve the effectiveness of their work with hyperscale cloud providers in a ""unified environment by seamlessly integrating services delivered by independent software vendors (ISVs), large public cloud providers, internal platforms, and other technologies."" In other words, Kyndryl adds value in helping companies to bring everything together, including the smooth combination of services from different software companies, big cloud providers, their own systems, and other technologies.
Although it generates revenue from a variety of sources, hyperscaler-related revenue is providing a major engine of growth for the company. In June 2025, Kyndryl generated $1.4 billion in revenue over the previous 12-month period, a 119% increase over the 12-month period that preceded June 2024.
At the same time its hyperscaler-related revenue is soaring, Kyndryl's total revenue has been on the decline, sliding to $15.1 billion in 2025 from $16.1 billion in 2024 and $15 billion in 2023. While this may be disconcerting, it illustrates how the company is pivoting to seize the growing opportunity that its hyperscaler business presents.
Kyndryl's AI expertise extends beyond hyperscalers
Those speculating that Kyndryl is a Silicon Valley start-up with little experience may be surprised to find that the company has a much richer legacy. Operating as an independent company for nearly four years, Kyndryl is the result of a spinoff from its former parent company, International Business Machines.
Over the past few years, Kyndryl has succeeded in forging partnerships with leading AI companies. In May 2024, for example, Kyndryl announced a partnership with Nvidia wherein the two companies will collaborate to provide ""customers looking to rapidly scale generative AI solutions to remain competitive in their respective industries."" For example, with Nvidia's help, Kyndryl will add generative AI capabilities to its Kyndryl Bridge platform, which helps customers integrate data across their enterprise.
Demonstrating how its cloud prowess transcends hyperscalers, Kyndryl is working with Amazon to expedite the modernization of mainframe applications and data for Amazon Web Services (AWS). Plus, it partners with leading cybersecurity companies like Rubrik to help protect customers from cyberattacks in several ways, such as reducing the amount of downtime that customers suffer from a cyber incident.
Is now a good time to pick up Kyndryl stock?
Whether Kyndryl has the ability to reproduce the incredible performances of leading AI stocks like Nvidia is questionable. However, there's certainly a conceivable path forward for Kyndryl stock to provide a market-beating performance as the AI industry develops thanks to its ample hyperscaler exposure and other AI-related businesses.
With shares of Kyndryl currently trading at only 13.7 times forward earnings, today certainly seems like a good time for patient investors to click the buy button on Kyndryl stock.

It has reshaped our understanding of what cars can be.
Archer Aviation (ACHR), valued at $5.5 billion, is developing electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, which are essentially air taxis intended for short-distance urban and regional travel. Archer Aviation stock has gained just 2.3% in the year to date, underperforming the S&P 500 Index ($SPX), despite its massive 167% gain over the past 52 weeks. For this under-the-radar aerospace company to become “the Tesla of the skies,” it must do more than just make air taxis viable. It must also make them desirable and indispensable for daily travel.
Let us find out how Archer Aviation is working on this, and if the stock is a buy now.
An Industry Moving From Ambition to Execution
The eVTOL industry was once considered futuristic. But it is rapidly becoming a reality. Archer’s flagship product is the Midnight aircraft. The company currently has six additional Midnight units in production, with three in final assembly, bringing the fleet to eight aircraft. These models have a production-ready four-bladed rear propeller design and are ready for certification flight testing or early commercial deployment.
Archer is rapidly approaching the commercialization of its Midnight aircraft, signaling a critical period of progress in both civil and defense programs. In the second half of 2025, Archer intends to accelerate pilot and flight testing, expand performance parameters, and begin full eVTOL operations. Because the company has no revenue yet, it reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $119 million and an adjusted net loss of $114 million in the second quarter.
Perhaps the most notable achievement for Archer is the U.S. government’s decision to showcase air taxis at the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics. It is the official exclusive air taxi provider for the event.
Archer is not waiting for FAA approval to start monetizing Midnight. Through its Launch Edition Program, the company is delivering early aircraft to countries with more favorable regulatory environments, including the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, and Indonesia. These partnerships not only diversify Archer’s revenue streams, but also help to establish the business case for eVTOLs. In the UAE, the Midnight aircraft has already been delivered and is awaiting commercial flight authorization. This will help the company generate revenue. Analysts expect Archer to report revenue of $1.42 million in 2025, rising to $103.4 million by 2026.
The Challenges
Archer ended the second quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, following a capital raise of $850 million in June. Despite strategic investments in manufacturing, certification, and defense programs, Archer maintained disciplined capital allocation. Furthermore, a growing multibillion-dollar order book from both government and commercial customers helps to strengthen the company’s position. Early launch deals abroad offer significant revenue potential before the full U.S. rollout.
Without a doubt, Archer is following Tesla’s leadto dominance by controlling manufacturing, developing proprietary technology, and pursuing both consumer and government markets. However, the challenges to eVTOL adoption differ. Infrastructure development, public trust, air traffic integration, and safety certification are challenges that Tesla has never encountered in the automotive industry.
If Archer can overcome these challenges, it will have established an industry with potentially fewer direct competitors than the crowded EV car market that Tesla is currently facing.
What Is Wall Street Saying About Archer Aviation Stock?
Recently, Canaccord Genuity analyst Austin Moeller reiterated his “Buy” rating on Archer Aviation stock with a price target of $13, citing the company’s strong production momentum and solid financial position. Moeller believes that by focusing on refining manufacturing processes and increasing efficiency, Archer is well-positioned to expand operations. Early revenue opportunities from Launch Edition customer evaluations strengthen Moeller’s belief in the company’s growth prospects.
Separately, H.C. Wainwright analyst Amit Dayal reiterated his “Buy” rating on the stock. Dayal stated that, in addition to its urban air mobility plans, Archer is expanding into the defense market through recent acquisitions and the development of a hybrid electric aircraft for long-range and military applications. With catalysts ahead, such as certification completion and the first passenger flights, Dayal believes the company is well-positioned to create meaningful value in the years to come.
Overall, Archer Aviation stock is a “Moderate Buy” on Wall Street. Among the 10 analysts covering the stock, five rate it a “Strong Buy,” two say it is a “Moderate Buy,” and three rate it a “Hold.” The average target price of $12.39 is 25% above current levels. Plus, its Street-high estimate of $18 suggests the stock can rally around 82% over the next 12 months.
The Bottom Line
If Archer follows through on its promises, such as launching Olympic-scale air taxi operations, expanding its Launch Edition footprint, and entering defense markets, it has the potential to define the first generation of practical, profitable urban air mobility. If the company succeeds, flying cars will no longer be considered science fiction. Archer Aviation would have made this happen. Early investors who believe in the company’s potential and are willing to take on the short-term risk may profit handsomely once it reaches its full potential.

The problem? They're concentrated in just a handful of countries, with the lion's share of processing capacity in China. It's a concentration of power that has governments and companies alike scrambling to secure non-Chinese sources before a trade dispute or export ban turns supply chains into choke points.
Enter, The Metals Company(NASDAQ: TMC), an early-stage mining company with a plan to scoop billions of tons of metal-rich rocks from the deep Pacific. If it works, these rocks (called ""nodules"") could feed the clean-energy supply chain for decades, not to mention give the U.S. and allies a rare chance to loosen China's hold on critical minerals.
But with the company yet to secure mining permits, and potentially years away from turning a profit, the gap between vision and reality is about as wide as the ocean the company is trying to mine. All things considered, can this metal stock generate $1 million from today's share price?
Why deep-sea mining has investors talking
First, let's talk opportunity.
The Clarion-Clipperton Zone, where The Metals Company plans to operate, contains trillions of potato-sized polymetallic nodules. These small, metal-rich rocks contain nickel, manganese, copper, zinc, cobalt, and other minerals. In other words, they hold the building blocks for EV batteries, renewable power grids, advanced defense systems, and dozens of other uses.
The U.S. still imports roughly 80% of rare earths, and more than three-quarters of that comes from China. After leaping into the rare-metal business before most of the rest of the world, Beijing now controls about 70% of global rare-earth mining and nearly 90% of processing. Recent export restrictions on certain rare earths and magnets have only underscored the need for alternative sources.
But big hurdles remain
TMC's pitch is that deep-sea mining could deliver rare earths at scale without relying on land-based mines. The plan seems simple enough: With vacuum-like machinery, it'll pump nodules to the surface, process them in a seawater slurry, then discharge sediment back to the sea.
Locating nodules isn't a problem. The company has mapped and secured exploration rights to two massive swaths of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone. Its biggest hurdle, however, is getting permission to start mining. The key gatekeeper is the International Seabed Authority (ISA), a U.N.-linked body that sets the rules for mining in international waters. Currently, the ISA is still finalizing its rulebook, and, until it's finished, nobody's getting a commercial license.
For TMC, that could mean waiting months, maybe years, before the ISA gives it the green light. Any longer than a few years, and the company could burn through its cash reserves long before the first nodules surface.
That said, there is an unusual wrinkle with the ISA: The U.S. never ratified the treaty that created it. That could open the door -- narrowly -- for a U.S.-based company to bypass the ISA entirely if national interest is at stake.
TMC is currently trying to wedge its way though that gap. Earlier this year, it filed for a mining permit under an old U.S. offshore minerals law just days after a White House order revived political interest in rare earths. If it works, the company could have a head start that no other deep-sea miner currently has, effectively turning years of regulatory waiting into an open lane toward production.
Is The Metals Company a millionaire maker?
Let's do the math.
If you bought 1,000 shares of TMC at today's price ($5.32), your initial position would be worth about $5,320. For that to grow to $1 million, you would need a 188-fold gain from today's price, or a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 68.8% over a decade. That's extremely rare in public markets.
True, TMC has massive potential. But the company is still pre-revenue. Despite the fact that its market cap sits around $2.1 billion, it isn't generating commercial revenue, at least not meaningfully.
It's also burning cash. In the first quarter of this year, it reported a net loss of $20.6 million, or $0.06 per share. Although it claims to have about $43.8 million in total liquidity -- with $2.3 in cash -- that cushion could evaporate quick without a breakthrough on the permit front.
Don't get me wrong: TMC can disrupt the global supply of rare earths, if it can get its business off the ground and into the sea. But since its business model is still unproven, sentiment and expectations will drive the stock in the short term, which could make it volatile. It's one to keep on the radar, but without clear steps toward production, I'm not ready to anchor a large position here.

Or Does It ? ,2025-08-16 11:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR) has been on a tear lately. The data analytics company has captured investor attention with record results, surging demand for its AI-driven platforms, and a stock price that's been on an impressive run.
For many, the bullish case seems obvious: strong growth, expanding margins, and a technology stack that appears well positioned for the AI era.
But as any seasoned investor knows, there's a difference between a great business and an excellent stock. Palantir may have the first part nailed -- but the second is where the story gets complicated. Let's unpack both sides of the argument.
Palantir is firing on all cylinders
Palantir's latest results blew past expectations. In the second quarter of 2025, revenue rose 48% year over year to $1 billion -- the highest in its history -- while adjusted operating income rose 24% to $464 million.
What's driving this surge? One is that Palantir's commercial business is expanding rapidly as enterprises adopt its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) for their AI transformation. For perspective, the AI company closed a record $803 million in U.S. commercial total contract value (TCV), representing a 134% year-over-year improvement in the latest quarter.
But that's just part of the story. Palantir's traditional public sector business also delivered improvements, as U.S. government revenue increased 45% year over year in the same quarter. These twin engines of growth position the tech company well to sustain its momentum in the coming quarters, if not years, riding on the massive AI transformation wave.
Momentum could keep the rally going
Beyond fundamentals, Palantir is benefiting from a powerful momentum wave. The stock has gained more than 500% over the past year, and such rapid appreciation often attracts momentum traders and algorithmic funds. These investors aren't necessarily buying because they've done a deep dive into Palantir's financials -- they're buying because the trend is up.
Momentum can be a powerful short-term force. In Palantir's case, several factors are aligning to keep investor enthusiasm high:
A strong narrative around AI leadership.
Expanding adoption across both commercial and government sectors.
Upwardly revised guidance often keeps analysts and traders optimistic.
This dynamic doesn't guarantee further gains, but it does mean that sentiment may continue to act as a tailwind in the coming month, especially if Palantir continues to deliver quarterly upside surprises.
However, momentum is notoriously fickle. When it turns, the same traders who piled in can exit just as quickly, amplifying the downside. That's why long-term investors should be careful not to confuse a price surge with a permanent shift in value.
The other side of the coin: valuation risk
While the business story is compelling, the investment case becomes more complex when we factor in valuation. Palantir currently trades at over 132 times sales -- a premium multiple that incorporates a significant amount of future success, among other factors.
History shows that even great companies can deliver mediocre returns if bought at overly optimistic valuations. Microsoft, for example, was a phenomenal business in the late 1990s -- yet investors who bought at the height of the dot-com boom had to wait more than a decade to break even, despite Microsoft's continued operational success.
That's the risk here: Palantir could continue to win new contracts, expand margins, and deepen its AI moat -- yet still deliver underwhelming stock returns if today's valuation already incorporates too much optimism.
Besides, paying a high premium for a stock leaves little margin for error. Just one quarter of weaker-than-expected performance can lead to a stock being rerated to a more reasonable valuation. Great for investors looking to buy, but a disaster for those who have purchased the stock at high prices.
What does it mean for investors?
Palantir's latest quarter showed record revenue and growing profits -- the kind of financial performance any growth investor would love to see. Furthermore, the company's AI platform is gaining traction, lending it a credible claim to being one of the most significant players in applied artificial intelligence.
In the near term, momentum and investor enthusiasm could push the stock higher. But over the longer term, the most significant risk may not be the business itself -- it's the price investors are willing to pay for it today.
While traders may be happy to ride the momentum, long-term investors, however, should think twice before making a bet. It will be prudent to wait for a more reasonable entry point.

Despite this, retail sales rebounded 0.6% in June following a mild dip in May, though spending habits are marked by greater caution.
The housing market shows another side of this complex picture. Home sales fell to an annual rate of 3.89 million units while the median home price climbed to a record $426,000, tightening affordability and cooling buyer demand.
This convergence of rising inflation, resilient but watchful shoppers, and a strained real estate sector puts next week’s earnings from Home Depot (HD), Lowe’s (LOW), Target (TGT), BJ’s Wholesale Club (BJ), and Walmart (WMT), firmly in the spotlight. These reports are worth watching. Let’s find out more about these stocks.
Home Depot (HD)
Home Depot (HD) is one of the biggest home improvement stores in the world, worth about $405 billion. The company’s next earnings update comes out on Aug. 19, 2025, and most experts think it will show profits of $4.71 per share for the quarter and $15.03 for the year.
In April, Home Depot shared it made $39.86 billion in sales and ended up with $3.43 billion in net income. The results were just under what analysts guessed, off by $0.03 a share. Shares are up about 3% for the year to date and 12.7% over the past 52 weeks.
Among 35 analysts, the consensus for Home Depot is a “Strong Buy,” with an average target price of $423.67, suggesting a possible 6% gain from where shares are now.
Lowe’s Companies (LOW)
Lowe’s Companies (LOW) is a big name in home improvement, and has a market capitalization of $143 billion. Its next earnings update comes out on Aug. 20, 2025, and most experts expect profits of $4.24 per share for the quarter and $12.29 for the year, each up 2%-3% year over year.
In April, Lowe’s brought in $20.93 billion in sales and made $1.64 billion in net income, with earnings per share of $2.92, slightly better than what the experts expected. Shares are up 2% so far in the year to date and are up 6.1% over the past 52 weeks.
The average analyst rating is “Moderate Buy” and the average target price is $267.55, also implying about 6% upside potential from here.
Target (TGT)
Target (TGT) is one of the largest big-box retailers in the U.S. Its next earnings update is set for Aug. 20, 2025, and experts think Target will earn $2.05 a share this quarter and $7.54 for the year, down 20% and 15% year over year.
In its last earnings update for April 2025, Target recorded $23.85 billion in sales and made $1.04 billion in net income, or $1.30 per share, coming in about 20% below what analysts predicted. Shares are down 23% in the year to date and over the past 52 weeks.
Earlier this year, Target announced its plans to add $5 billion in gross merchandise volume by 2030, expand its advertising business, and significantly increase the size of its Target Plus marketplace by five times. These initiatives aim to revitalize the company’s performance and steer the business in the right direction.
Each year, Target pays a dividend of $4.56 per share, which is a 4.4% yield. Target has a market capitalization of about $47.9 billion.
Most analysts rate Target as a “Hold,” with an average target price of $107.90, meaning they see a 4% gain from here.
BJ’s Wholesale Club (BJ)
BJ’s Wholesale Club (BJ) is a membership warehouse chain worth about $13.7 billion. The company’s next earnings report comes out Aug. 22, 2025, and analysts think BJ’s will make $1.10 per share this quarter and $4.29 for the year.
In its last earnings report for the first quarter, released in May, BJ’s said it made $5.15 billion in sales and brought in nearly $150 million in net income, or $1.14 per share, which beat what experts were expecting by a wide margin of 25%. Shares are up about 15% in the year to date and up 25% over the past 52 weeks.
Most analysts are upbeat about BJ’s, with 18 calling it a consensus “Moderate Buy” and giving it an average price target of $125.44, a possible 21% climb from current prices.
Walmart (WMT)
Walmart (WMT) is one of the biggest retailers in the world, worth about $805 billion, with stores and online shopping everywhere. The company pays a yearly dividend of $0.94 per share, giving investors a 0.93% yield.
Its next earnings update is coming up on Aug. 21, 2025, and most experts think Walmart will show profits of $0.72 a share for the quarter and $2.60 for the whole year. That would be a healthy jump of over 7% and 3% compared to last year.
For its April earnings report, Walmart reported $165.61 billion in sales and $4.49 billion in net income, or $0.61 a share, beating what analysts predicted by more than 7%. Shares are up 11.9% in the year to date and up 47% over the past year.
The consensus is very optimistic, with 35 analysts saying Walmart is a consensus “Strong Buy.” Their average price target is $111.85, suggesting the stock could go up another 10%.
Conclusion
Earnings season for these five giants is packed with signals about where Main Street and Wall Street head next. With inflation still pressing wallets and the housing market tight, retailers showing growth and defensive strength look well-positioned to keep leading, while others may have to fight just to hold ground.
Chances are, we could see more positive surprises from value-focused names, while those relying on discretionary spending may face extra pressure. Either way, next week’s results are set to shake things up.

Importantly, it looks like this cloud infrastructure provider has room for more upside even after its phenomenal rally.
Nebius is a Dutch company that provides artificial intelligence (AI) cloud computing infrastructure. It operates AI data centers with large-scale graphics processing unit (GPU) clusters and provides tools and software solutions that customers can use to train AI models and run inference applications.
The AI cloud infrastructure market that Nebius serves is growing at a breathtaking pace. Let's take a closer look at Nebius and see why this red-hot growth stock has room for more upside.
Nebius' eye-popping growth is here to stay
Nebius has built its business by accumulating powerful AI GPUs from Nvidia and renting them out to customers. Developers can access a range of Nvidia GPUs such as the H100, the H200, and B200 at hourly rates from Nebius and run various AI models from Microsoft, Meta Platforms, DeepSeek, and others.
Nebius' full-stack AI infrastructure allows customers to train and fine-tune AI models, develop custom AI applications, and run inference tasks. Importantly, customers can increase or decrease the usage of Nebius' platform according to their needs. The company's latest quarterly results make it clear that its business model is a hit with customers.
Its revenue in the second quarter of 2025 jumped by more than 7x year over year to $105 million. Nebius also reduced its net loss by 49% owing to its focus on lowering the operating costs of data centers. Management points out that Nebius lowered its total cost of ownership by 20% by improving the hardware design of its data centers and investing in energy-saving solutions.
Looking ahead, Nebius is focused on aggressively expanding its data center capacity so that it can corner a bigger share of the fast-growing cloud AI infrastructure market. The company aims to boost its data center capacity to 220 megawatts by the end of 2025 before ramping it up to 1 gigawatt by the end of next year.
Nebius was sitting on $1.68 billion worth of cash at the end of the previous quarter, which it will use for capacity expansion. The company says that the demand for its solutions is outpacing supply, which is why it is important for it to keep investing in more capacity. Also, higher data center capacity will translate into more business for Nebius, which explains why the company has increased its annualized run-rate revenue (ARR) for 2025.
It now expects ARR to land between $900 million and $1.1 billion this year as compared to the earlier estimate of $750 million to $1 billion. Analysts, meanwhile, are expecting Nebius' top line to jump by over 5x in 2025, followed by robust growth over the next couple of years as well.
However, don't be surprised to see Nebius blowing past analysts' expectations in the current year and beyond. The company was originally guiding for $500 million to $700 million in revenue for 2025, and the increased ARR guidance indicates that it could exceed the midpoint of its original guidance range. So, a stronger-than-expected performance going forward should set Nebius up for more gains.
The valuation is expensive, but investors should look at the bigger picture
Nebius' remarkable rally this year has brought the stock's price-to-sales ratio to 66. That's well above the U.S. technology sector's average sales multiple of 8.7. However, Nebius' outstanding growth explains why it is richly valued. The company is growing at an eye-popping pace and is relatively cheaper than some other AI stocks.
What's more, the outstanding sales growth that the company is expected to deliver in the future is the reason why its forward sales multiples are much lower.
Finally, investors shouldn't forget that Nebius is operating in a market that's expected to grow rapidly in the long run. Fortune Business Insights estimates that the cloud infrastructure-as-a-service market could clock an annual growth rate of almost 21% through 2032, generating more than $712 billion in annual revenue at the end of the forecast period.
Nebius is currently growing at a much faster pace than the end market, and its capacity expansion efforts should allow it to become a key player in this space. All this makes Nebius a top AI stock to buy right now as its phenomenal growth is likely to result in more upside.

Currently trading for just $3.08 (as of Aug. 14), XRP is up more than 400% since November. The positive growth catalysts for XRP just keep on coming.
All this makes XRP the highest-upside cryptocurrency you can buy with $1,000. Let's take a closer look.
Price targets for XRP
One way to see just how much higher XRP might go this year is by looking at online prediction markets, where people are making daily trades based on where they think the prices of cryptocurrencies such as XRP might be headed.
Right now, online prediction markets are giving XRP a 65% chance of hitting $4 this year, and a 29% chance of hitting $5. Considering that XRP hit a 52-week high of $3.65 earlier this summer, both of these price targets appear to be within reach.
Moreover, in April, Standard Chartered predicted that XRP might soar as high as $5.50 this year, based on strong underlying fundamentals and a number of emerging growth catalysts.
So, based on XRP's current price of a bit more than $3, there is a reasonably good chance that it might increase in value by as much as 80% this year. Aside from perhaps Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC), it's hard to think of a higher-upside cryptocurrency for 2025.
Potential growth catalysts
The good news for crypto investors is that XRP has a number of potential growth catalysts in play. Being able to deliver on just one of them might be enough to push XRP higher.
According to Bloomberg, XRP now has a 95% chance of getting new spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission this year. These spot ETFs would make it much easier for institutional investors to get exposure to XRP. By some estimates, this could result in $8 billion in new money flowing into XRP. That would almost certainly help to push up the price of XRP.
Moreover, the SEC recently wrapped up its long-running case against Ripple, the company behind the XRP token. This case, which dates back to December 2020, alleged that XRP was a security, and that the sale of XRP represented a sale of unregistered securities. With this legal battle in the rear view mirror, Ripple is able to go back to business in the U.S. market, and that likely means new growth for the XRP blockchain ecosystem.
Ripple has already explored a number of alternatives to boost the value of XRP. These include the launch of a stablecoin in December 2024, and the embrace of new real world asset (RWA) tokenization initiatives. According to top consulting firms, RWA tokenization is a potential multi-trillion-dollar market opportunity. So if XRP gains even a tiny market share of this market, there is even more potential for XRP to soar.
But is XRP overvalued?
Just keep in mind: There has always been an enormous amount of buzz, hype, and speculation surrounding XRP, and it has rarely played out as expected. In more than a decade, XRP has never traded higher than $3.84. Its reputation as a high-upside cryptocurrency dates back to 2018, when there were significantly fewer cryptocurrencies to choose from. Until recently, XRP has fizzled, primarily due to all the regulatory uncertainty surrounding its SEC litigation.
Moreover, an often-used market signal is flashing red right now. If you compare the total market cap of XRP ($190 billion) to the amount of total value locked (TVL) on the XRP blockchain ($88 million), there is a serious mismatch. This multiple for XRP is 2,159. By way of comparison, the multiple for Ethereum(CRYPTO: ETH) is just 5.7, and the multiple for Solana(CRYPTO: SOL) is 9.6.
If anything, this shows that XRP has been hyped up to incredible levels, with little real activity actually taking place on the blockchain to support such a high valuation.
A key date on the calendar
An important moment for XRP is coming soon. The SEC is scheduled to rule on the new spot XRP ETFs by mid-October, and some analysts think a decision might come as soon as September. Wrapping up the SEC case in August was absolutely critical in that regard. Until all the legal and regulatory matters were resolved, the SEC was unlikely to approve new ETFs.
An investment in XRP is hardly without risk. But with high risk also comes high upside reward. If you have $1,000, and are looking for a high-upside cryptocurrency with the potential to double in value within an incredibly short period of time, XRP is an enticing option.

Sure, high yields are attractive, but a company that has high yields and the ability to sustain them is worth its weight in gold. Even better if such companies have a good track record of increasing dividends, preferably consecutively.
Now, there are groups of companies like Dividend Aristocrats and Kings that already offer the qualities I like. But that doesn't mean we need to limit ourselves to those top-shelf companies. Sometimes, there are dividend-paying gems exhibiting high growth, low payout ratios, and decent yields that are waiting on the sidelines.
Today, I’ll be reviewing my list of notable dividend stocks to see which ones meet my stringent criteria for high yields and high growth.
How I Came Up With The Following Stocks
As usual, I fired up Barchart’s Stock Screener tool and used the following filters:
Annual Dividend Yield: Left blank so I can sort the list using this criterion.
Current Analyst Rating & Number of Analysts: 3.5 (Moderate Buy) to 5 (Strong Buy), and 16 or above. This combination ensures I get companies that have Wall Street’s (generally) positive regard.
5-Year Dividend Growth: 50% and above. This filter compares the company’s payouts from five years ago to the current ones. On average, a 50% growth rate represents a 10% growth annually, which is considered strong and sustainable for many mature businesses.
Dividend Payout Ratio: 65% or less. The payout ratio shows how much the company uses of its earnings to pay dividends. 65% is on the high end of what many consider the “healthy” range.
Watchlists: As someone who loves dividend stocks, I maintain several dividend-centric watchlists that I now use for this search. These include the Dividend Contenders, Aristocrats, Kings, high-yield stocks, growth stocks, and monthly dividend stocks.
I ran the screen and got 28 companies, which I then arranged from highest to lowest yields:
Now, I’ll take the top three and discuss each one, starting with number one:
Best Buy Company (BBY)
First up is Best Buy Company (NYSE:BBY), a multinational consumer electronics retailer that sells a wide range of products, including computers, smartphones, televisions, home appliances, video games, and related accessories. The company has over 1000 stores in the US and Canada alone, and now operates an online platform that offers the same extensive product selection, along with convenient delivery, pickup, and customer support services.
Best Buy currently pays 95 cents per share quarterly, which works out to $3.80 per year and around a 5.29% yield. Aside from the high yield, the company also boasts a relatively healthy dividend payout ratio of 59.14% and an 88% 5-year dividend growth rate. Even more impressive, the company has increased dividends since 2004, for 22 straight years. Three more years of increases, and Best Buy will become a Dividend Aristocrat!
Analysts also rate BBY stock a Moderate Buy.
Comcast Corp A (CMCSA)
ComcastCorporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is one of the biggest global media and technology companies in the United States, offering services that range from cable television and high-speed internet to wireless communications and home phone solutions. In the last few decades, it also started acquiring large-scale networks and communications providers, including NBCUniversal, Sky, and various regional sports and entertainment networks.
The company pays $1.32 in dividends annually, translating to around a 4% yield based on the stock's last closing price. Dividends have increased 93.65% in the last five years, while Comcast currently has an impressive 28.15% payout ratio despite its relatively high yield. It also has an 18-year dividend increase streak, and today, CMCAS stock has a Moderate Buy rating.
Regions Financial Corp (RF)
Last but not least is Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF), a banking and financial services company that operates primarily in the Southern and Midwestern United States. It offers a full range of services, including personal and business banking, mortgage and lending products, wealth management, and insurance solutions.
Regions Financial has a long and storied history of paying dividends - since 1989. The company increased its payouts until it went stagnant between 2000 and 2004 at 33 cents quarterly, around the time when the dot-com bubble burst and the markets were recovering. It picked up the pace after that, but then the global financial crisis hit, and it was forced to cut dividends to 1 cent a share quarterly.
Since 2013, however, the company has continued increasing its dividends, with the most recent one being $1.00 per share per year, which reflects around a 3.8% yield. Regions Financial has increased its dividend by 66.10% over the last five years, and its current dividend payout ratio is a healthy 41.16%. Meanwhile, analysts rate RF stock a Moderate Buy.
Final Thoughts
Looking for long-term dividend stocks is not just about yields.

The reams of research that banks such as Goldman produce are used by institutional investors, such as hedge funds and asset managers, in deciding how to allocate capital.
Trump's comments — in which he lambasted Goldman, its economics team and CEO David Solomon and accused them of making ""a bad prediction"" — have triggered a debate on Wall Street about the possible fallout, according to interviews with banking industry sources and investors.
At one Wall Street bank, Trump's comments spurred informal conversations among staff, a source familiar with the matter said. The source said they also discussed how to incorporate government data in the wake of Trump's decision to fire the head of BLS, claiming — without evidence — that its data had been politicized. Still, the bank was not considering changing the way research operates.
""This is going to come down to a person’s ability to withstand a barrage of criticism from the Oval Office, and the extent to which these banks provide support for their chief economists,"" said Dave Rosenberg of Rosenberg Research, who has worked in the economics departments at several banks. ""If we notice that research is being watered down ... then we’ll know that this has had an effect.""
Jack Ablin, chief investment strategist at Cresset Capital, said if banks do start self-censoring, smaller investors who do not have the resources to do their own analysis are likely to suffer most.
Trump's criticism is his latest attack on corporate America and other institutions, and is a break from historical norms, where presidents have typically avoided calling out private companies and executives for things they do not like.
Some companies that have considered passing on tariff costs to customers have faced public criticism, and Trump, who came to politics after running businesses, has intervened directly in private business decisions by making a deal with Nvidia (NVDA) to give a portion of its revenues from sales to China of AI chips to the government.
Trump “certainly is taking a number of steps that diverge from the traditional view of the respective roles of the government and private industry,” said Henry Hu, a securities law professor at the University of Texas.
In a social media post earlier this week, Trump said foreign companies and governments were mostly absorbing the cost of his tariffs, counter to Goldman's research.
""Given that sell-side Wall Street analyst predictions have been about as accurate as random guessing, small investors will do just fine with the president exercising his First Amendment right about flawed Wall Street research,"" a White House official told Reuters.
On Wednesday, Goldman's U.S. head economist David Mericle defended its research on CNBC, vowing to ""keep doing"" what the bank considers informative research.
Goldman declined requests for further comment.
Other major banks, including Wells Fargo, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America and Citigroup, declined to comment.
REPUTATIONAL RISKS
There has already been evidence of self-censorship. A senior JPMorgan Asset Management investment strategist, Michael Cembalest, earlier this year said during a webinar that he refrained from voicing some of his thoughts on U.S. tariffs publicly. Shortly after Cembalest's comments, Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's CEO, said that he expects analysts to speak their minds. Both Cembalest and the bank declined to comment for this story.
Hu said there is a risk involved in even appearing to give way to political pressure.
“Goldman’s reputational capital is at stake here,” he said. “If their views on the economy become biased, and they are shown to be wrong, why would anyone choose Goldman to advise them on anything?”
Mike Mayo, banking analyst at Wells Fargo, said independent research is critical for investment bank's reputation. ""Investment banks live and die by their reputation and independence. That transcends all other considerations.""
Wall Street research has long been tightly overseen, one source said, with supervisory analysts reviewing research reports to ensure that language is not inflammatory, emotive or partisan and that reports are objective and cite sources.
That person said that if analysts feel unable to speak openly then investors will pay more or take greater risk. Liquidity will suffer and there will be less foreign participation in U.S. markets, the person said.
It was large losses by smaller investors that triggered the first major probe of Wall Street research in the aftermath of the dot com stock bubble of the late 1990s. Eliot Spitzer, then New York Attorney General, found that Wall Street analysts had swapped their honest opinions for unwarranted ""buy"" ratings on companies to help their banks win underwriting and advisory business. The result: a $1.5 billion global settlement payout by Wall Street and lifetime bans for some analysts.
It remains to be seen whether the current kerfuffle will have an outsized impact on Wall Street or if it is a storm in a teacup, said Steve Sosnick, market strategist at IBKR.
""It does raise a lot of questions,"" he added.

He was telling the business world that some of the most enduring competitive advantages are forged not in corporate boardrooms, but in grit, frugality, and an obsession with customer value.
It’s a tale that remains as relevant to modern investors and entrepreneurs as it was four decades ago. The story exemplifies just what it is that Buffett looks for in an acquisition and in a business leader, and can help investors understand what they should look for when investing in a company.
In 1917, at just 23 years old, Rose Blumkin talked her way past a border guard to escape Russia and start a new life in America. She had no formal education, didn’t speak English, and began with nothing.
By 1937, after years of selling used clothing, she saved $500 — enough to open her dream business: Nebraska Furniture Mart. Facing entrenched, well-capitalized competitors, she relied on unconventional tactics: radical frugality, relentless price competition, and legal resilience. When cash ran out early on, she sold furniture and appliances from her own home to pay creditors in full.
Rose constantly undercut competitors so dramatically that they tried to block her supply lines, pressuring manufacturers not to sell to her. When she was dragged into court for allegedly “violating Fair Trade laws,” she won every case, and even sold the judge $1,400 worth of carpet after proving her pricing worked.
By the early 1980s, her single store was generating over $100 million in annual sales — outselling all competitors in Omaha combined.
Why Buffett Couldn’t Resist
Buffett famously said, “I’d rather wrestle grizzlies than compete with Mrs. B.” From his perspective, Nebraska Furniture Mart had the trifecta of business excellence:
Savvy purchasing: sourcing inventory better and cheaper than competitors.
Lean operations: expense ratios so low that rivals couldn’t imagine them.
Customer loyalty: passing on savings instead of padding margins.
It was, in Buffett’s words, “the ideal business — one built upon exceptional value to the customer that in turn translates into exceptional economics for its owners.”
Buffett purchased 90% of the business in 1983, leaving family members in key management roles. Mrs. B, then 90 years old, kept showing up seven days a week to personally sell carpet.
Lessons for Modern-Day Entrepreneurs
While the business world has shifted from brick-and-mortar showrooms to e-commerce platforms and digital-first marketing, Mrs. B’s principles remain timeless:
Obsess over value, not hype: In an era of viral brands and influencer marketing, sustainable growth still depends on giving customers more than they expect for the price they pay.
Operate lean: Venture-backed startups often burn through capital chasing scale, but Mrs. B’s model shows how low overhead and disciplined purchasing can create enduring competitive moats.
Play the long game: Mrs. B fought legal battles, endured supplier pushback, and navigated multiple economic downturns, yet never compromised on her value proposition.
Lead from the floor: Even as an owner, she remained deeply involved in sales, reinforcing company culture through example.
Lessons for Modern-Day Investors
Mrs. B’s story also speaks to investors looking for the next great compounder. Buffett didn’t buy Nebraska Furniture Mart for its short-term profits; he bought it for its unbeatable market position and operational culture. The story is the moat. They grew because people loved the business, and people loved the business because they always strived to do right by their customers. Integrity, discipline, and customer-first thinking matter as much as — if not more than — the financial statements.
Buffett notes that capital allocation in a bad industry is like “struggling in quicksand.” In other words, even a great operator can be dragged down if the sector is fundamentally flawed. People need furniture now just as much as they needed it 100 years ago, and just as much as they will need it in 100 years.
Recognizing a moat is crucial. The store’s cost advantages and buying power made it difficult, if not impossible, for competitors to win customers without losing money. This means Mrs. B was going to be the leader in the area, and nobody around could change that.
Why the Story Still Matters in 2025
In a global economy dominated by online retail giants like Amazon (AMZN) and fast-scaling disruptors in every sector, Mrs. B’s example is a reminder that moats are built in the details: buying better, spending less, and treating customers better than anyone else.
Whether you’re a startup founder in fintech or a private equity investor looking for durable businesses, the lesson is clear: find — or build — the Mrs. B of your industry, and you’ll have a business worth owning for decades.
Buffett bought into Nebraska Furniture Mart for one reason: he recognized a business so good that price almost didn’t matter. For modern investors and entrepreneurs, the challenge — and opportunity — is to recognize the next Mrs. B before everyone else does

Palantir stock plummeted earlier this year following fears that budget cuts at the Pentagon may hurt its business.
Despite the noise, Palantir has proven throughout 2025 that customers across the private and public sectors are continuing to purchase its AI software platforms.
Although Palantir stock has rebounded considerably since its intra-year lows, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities is calling for even more upside.
Last year, shares of data mining specialist Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR) skyrocketed by 340%, making it the top performer in the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index. The momentum continued into 2025 as Palantir shares got off to a sizzling start to begin the year.
Not long after, data published by Capitol Trades showed that U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene loaded up on Palantir stock. Since Greene's trades were reported between April 7 and 8, shares of Palantir have soared by 130% as of this writing (Aug. 8). In hindsight, buying the dip in Palantir stock earlier this year looks like an incredibly savvy move.
While some investors may think they've missed the boat, fear not! Wedbush Securities technology research analyst Dan Ives recently raised his price target on Palantir to $200 following the company's astonishing blowout second-quarter earnings report.
Let's dig into the catalysts fueling Palantir's business right now and explore whether Ives' new price forecast is feasible.
Palantir is dominating the AI software agenda
At its core, Palantir develops a host of AI-powered software suites -- Foundry, Gotham, and Apollo -- each designed to solve complex data-driven challenges. These platforms are stitched together to form a broader fabric, integrating services across data analytics, real-time simulated modeling, and decision-making tools. Together, they form an AI backbone for both large corporate enterprises and government agencies around the world.
During the second quarter, Palantir generated growth of 47% and 49% across its commercial and public sector businesses, respectively. To understand just how impressive this is, consider that Palantir's Rule of 40 score now sits at 94% -- materially higher than any of its software-as-a-service (SaaS) peers and trails only Nvidia when benchmarked against the 25 largest companies by market cap.
Can Palantir stock reach $200?
As of this writing, Palantir stock trades for $180 per share -- implying only an 11% move to reach Ives' $200 target. Ives has been celebrating Palantir's ""hyper growth demand,"" citing the ""use case era of the AI Revolution"" as Palantir's key differentiator -- suggesting that Palantir is uniquely positioned relative to its software peers.
The steepening curves in both revenue and profitability imply a strong unit economics across Palantir's operation. Much of this momentum can be attributed to notable upsells with existing customers, as well as the company's leading position for emerging use cases at the intersection of defense and technology -- just as Ives implies.
Is Palantir stock a buy right now?
The chart below benchmarks Palantir against a peer set of leading enterprise software stocks on a price-to-sales (P/S) basis. With a P/S ratio of 132, Palantir is the clear outlier in this cohort.
To me, Palantir's continued valuation expansion suggests that growth investors are looking beyond traditional metrics and increasingly buying into a greater narrative -- one that positions Palantir in a league of its own as a company on the cusp of prolonged periods of accelerating revenue, profitability, and outright domination in the AI software realm.
As a longtime Palantir bull, I'm both excited and optimistic about the company's future. While I do think Ives' forecast of $200 per share is achievable, it's also worth pointing out that Palantir stock now trades at a historically high valuation -- similar to levels seen during prior stock market bubbles.
For these reasons, buying Palantir stock today comes down to individual risk tolerances. If you are an investor with a long-term time horizon, the payoff from Palantir could be enormous as the AI narrative continues to unfold. But like most growth stocks, owning Palantir will not come without periods of extreme volatility.

Ethereum,2025-08-16 13:15:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Although the cryptocurrency market is rarely -- if ever -- boring, this year has been a particularly wild ride for investors. Bitcoin has more than doubled since last August and reached a new all-time high well above the six-figure mark.
While Bitcoin remains the top dog, two of the most popular and well-established altcoins -- Ethereum(CRYPTO: ETH) and XRP(CRYPTO: XRP) -- have grabbed headlines of their own with big gains. Though in many ways they are very different, their futures are both heavily tied to the legacy financial system. Both will also be affected significantly if there's mass adoption of stablecoins, and with the recent passage of the Genius Act, that looks entirely possible.
So, which is the better long-term pick? I believe that if you look past the hype, there's a clear answer.
Mass adoption could drive XRP's price
The technology underpinning legacy banking's settlements (how banks actually send and receive funds) is extremely useful and secure, but it has some pretty significant shortcomings. Transactions can take days or even weeks to finalize. The process -- especially when sending money across borders -- often involves several intermediaries, and the fees can stack up quickly.
Ripple, the company behind XRP, set out to solve those problems. It created the XRP blockchain and its native token to make financial transactions faster, cheaper, and more secure.
The basic investment thesis for XRP has always been that as banks adopt Ripple's technology, demand for XRP will rise and its price will follow. The more widespread the adoption, the higher XRP's value.
Here's the thing: Banks can use Ripple's blockchain with little or no exposure to XRP at all. In fact, that's how most banks -- especially the largest ones -- choose to interact with the technology. They can capture most of the time and cost savings without taking on the risk of holding a volatile asset like XRP.
Ripple's on-demand liquidity (ODL) product is the exception. ODL helps institutions that face liquidity issues in cross-border payments by eliminating the need for pre-funded accounts in foreign currencies. Instead, banks use XRP as a bridge asset. This is where the popular investment case holds up.
The problem is, most major financial institutions don't face liquidity issues -- at least not to the extent that holding a risky asset like XRP would justify -- and I believe ODL is unlikely to be adopted at scale.
Adding another wrinkle, Ripple just bought Rail, a stablecoin payment platform, and looks to be trying to position itself as a leader in stablecoins as the market takes off. This could further reduce demand for XRP, offering another payment system that doesn't require direct XRP exposure, and even potentially replacing XRP as the asset needed for ODL. The success of stablecoins could actually hurt XRP's value.
Ethereum is the backbone of the stablecoin market
That isn't the case for Ethereum. The pioneer of smart contracts underpins a large portion of stablecoin usage. By far, the most USDC transactions happen on its blockchain. As stablecoins grow in adoption, demand for Ethereum is likely to grow, not diminish.
Every stablecoin transaction on the Ethereum network requires a small payment in Ether (ETH) -- the actual coin investors hold -- for gas, or transaction fees. Part of that fee is automatically burned, meaning that the ETH is permanently destroyed and removed from circulation. The more activity on Ethereum, the more ETH is burned.
But wait, XRP works the same way, correct? XRP has to be burned for every transaction on its network. Why is this different? The mechanisms are similar, but the economics are very different. A minuscule amount of XRP is burned for each transaction; it has very little effect on price. In contrast, enough ETH is burned in each transaction to meaningfully affect the price.
The better long-term bet
Stablecoins could define the next wave of crypto adoption. For XRP, that's more risk than reward, and it's just the opposite for Ethereum. Stablecoin growth directly boosts activity on its network, burns ETH, and reduces supply.
Beyond stablecoins, the possibilities offered by Ethereum's smart contracts in finance, the tokenization of stocks, and more make it the clear answer. It is the better crypto buy.

Consumer sentiment has changed since Noodles & Company rolled out its new menu on March 12. Restaurant goers are even more price sensitive than before, and that has meant the fast-casual chain has needed to readjust its brand positioning and introduce a value-oriented combo meal.
Outgoing chief executive officer Drew Madsen said that, although same-store sales were up by 1.5% for the quarter ended July 1 — perfectly respectable in the current climate — he was disappointed in the results and is taking measures to improve traffic and sales which appear to be bearing fruit.
“While we delivered positive same-store sales in a choppy consumer environment for our segment, overall results were below our expectations going into the quarter,” he told investors during a conference call after market on Wednesday.
Although comps were up, that was due in part to the higher prices tied to new menu items: Average checks were up by 4%, but traffic was down by 2.5%
“We have identified what we believe drove the traffic shortfall versus our expectations and have been working quickly to address it,” said Madsen, who last week announced his resignation as CEO effective Aug. 31. He will be succeeded by current chief operating officer Joe Christina.
Madsen said the decline in traffic was due to “unexpected decline in guest value perception following our menu launch in March, something we did not see during our test market phase last year.
“This is due in part to a change in the consumer environment over the past 12 months and the growing consumer demand for increased value and affordability, which is evidenced by the heightened discounting and promotions across the QSR, fast-casual, and casual dining segments of our industry,” he said.
Noodles & Company responded with the July 30 introduction of its Delicious Duos value offering of a small entrée and side starting at $9.95.
It seems to have worked, at least in the first two weeks of its existence. Since the launch of Delicious Duos, same-store sales jumped by 5%. Traffic also improved to flat, and in the past few days leading up to the earnings call was actually up by between 1% and 2%.
And the menu rolled out on March 12 has had positive results, Madsen said, with a J-curve in guest satisfaction, meaning it went down at first but then bounced back to higher than before the menu launch.
All of the chain’s four mac & cheese items — its top sellers — score above average in terms of taste and value perception, especially the new Garlic Bacon Crunch and Buffalo Ranch options.
But there were some operational challenges, and one new dish, the Green Goddess Salad, was ultimately pulled from the menu “because the recipe complexity made it difficult to execute consistently and too often left our guests dissatisfied,” Madsen said.
Noodles & Company also reworked some of the new recipes to replace higher-cost secondary ingredients with less expensive ones, though still premium compared to the ingredients used before the relaunch. The changes so far have “had no perceived impact on taste or overall guest satisfaction,” Madsen said.
The chain has rolled out a new coaching program to improve operations and is working on creating six “operations excellence” coaches who will work with general managers and their teams “to continually improve the guest experience.”
Looking forward, the next limited-time offer, to be launched early in the fourth quarter of this year is a chile-garlic ramen for which the noodles will be sautéed in butter chile garlic soy sauce and tossed with Napa and red cabbage and spinach and topped with scallions, Parmesan cheese and Asian spices for $8.95.
During the second quarter the company opened one restaurant and closed six restaurants and franchisees closed two restaurants.
All told, nine company-owned restaurants were closed so far this year and more closures are to come, according to chief financial officer Michael Hynes.
During last quarter’s earnings call, he said the company would close up to 21 underperforming restaurants, and that number has since grown to 49.
“We recently expanded our efforts to close underperforming restaurants and now expect to close a total of 28 to 32 company-owned restaurants in 2025. In addition, we expect to close 12 to 17 company owned restaurants in 2026.”
Looking ahead, Hynes projected total revenue for the year at between $487 million and $495 million with same-store sales growth between 2.5% and 4%.
Incoming CEO Christina, who will assume that role at the end of the month, said in the conference call, “I am honored to lead Noodles & Company in this next chapter as we welcome 30 years of brand strength and connection.
“I am focused on enhancing the guest experience, strengthening operational execution, driving increased traffic, and expanding unit-level margins.
“Backed by our dedicated teams, franchisees and partners, we will strive to deliver meaningful value to our guests and stakeholders.
“I look forward to working with Drew during this transition period in August and speaking with you all next quarter.”
Noodles & Company Q2 by the numbers:
• Revenue decreased 0.7% to $126.4 million
• Same-store sales increased 1.5%
• Net income was -$17.6 million, or a loss of 38 cents per share, compared to -13.6 million or -30 cents per share in the same quarter last year
• Restaurant margin was down 270 basis points to 12.8% from 15.5% in Q2 2024.",172ea8804dd2e1462fe740bd6d6963e7,trafilatura,5494,0

Especially when stocks are swinging in volatile times, reliable income is a rare anchor.
Right now, I like the following three dividend stocks because they're steady, well-positioned, and proven in every economic weather pattern you can name. That's a trifecta you can rarely go wrong with, whether you're investing $100, $1,000, $10,000, or $50,000.
1. Coca-Cola
Not many brands are as well-known globally as Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO). Its flagship soda is one of the most recognized products on the planet, and the company's portfolio stretches far beyond colas (think Dasani water, Minute Maid juice, and Topo Chico sparkling water).
Although Coca-Cola's stock has outperformed the market through Aug. 13 (compared to the S&P 500), the appeal of its stock has long been its dividend. Indeed, Coca-Cola has raised its dividend for 63 consecutive years, making it a Dividend King. Today's yield sits just below 3%, with a payout ratio that leaves room for steady increases. That means investors get a dependable income stream that's not tied to market swings.
The headwinds? Currency fluctuations can bite into earnings, and global health trends could pressure sugary beverage sales over time. But Coca-Cola's ability to adapt, whether through zero-sugar drinks or premium hydration brands, keeps it well-anchored in the ""reliable"" category.
2. Realty Income
When Realty Income(NYSE: O) calls itself ""The Monthly Dividend Company,"" it's not bluffing. This real estate investment trust (REIT) has paid dividends for 661 consecutive months, or roughly 55 years.
That kind of track record comes from a simple but effective business model: Long-term, net lease agreements with single tenants in stable, non-discretionary industries. Think Lowes, 7-Eleven, and Chipotle, among others. Today, Realty Income owns more than 15,600 commercial properties leased to over 1,600 clients across 91 separate industries, achieving a portfolio occupancy of 98.5%.
Even when the economy cools, those tenants still pay rent, and Realty Income's contract structure shifts maintenance and insurance costs to them. That keeps cash flow predictable, which in turn supports the monthly dividend. The yield, currently around 5.6%, ranks it as a top dividend REIT.
Elevated interest rates have weighed on the share price, but that's more of a short-term sentiment hit than a problem with its fundamentals. As borrowing costs normalize, Realty Income stands to regain some ground, while delivering monthly payments while you wait.
3. Johnson & Johnson
Like Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson(NYSE: JNJ) is a Dividend King, a company that has increased its annual dividend for at least 50 consecutive years. Johnson & Johnson has done so for 63 years, putting it firmly within this elite group.
Johnson & Johnson is a household name, and you've probably purchased or used one of its products at some point in your life. Its operations cover two main areas: Pharmaceuticals and medical devices. The pharmaceutical segment brings in the largest share of revenue, anchored by blockbuster drugs, while medical devices benefit from steady demand for surgical and orthopedic products.
One of Johnson & Johnson's strengths is that, even in downturns, people don't usually postpone essential treatments. True, there are litigation risks (around talc and opioids), so the company isn't completely shielded from volatility. But with a strong balance sheet and a payout ratio just over 50%, the dividend looks well supported and has room to grow from here.
It currently offers a dividend yield of about 3%. That's not flashy, but it's steady enough to keep paying you while you hold the stock for the long haul.
Three dividend stocks built to last
Dividends aren't about income as much as they are about discipline. Coca-Cola, Realty Income, and Johnson & Johnson have spent decades proving they can reward shareholders through every cycle. That doesn't mean share prices won't fluctuate -- they will -- but these dividends don't flinch easily. That's the kind of steady footing that makes it a little easier to hang on when the market feels anything but steady.

Buying on the dip is even better, provided, of course, they have the means to bounce back.
Investors looking for companies that fit this profile should strongly consider Pfizer(NYSE: PFE) and Merck(NYSE: MRK). These two market leaders have lagged broader equities over the trailing-12-month period, but for those focused on the long game, they still look attractive. Here's the rundown.
1. Pfizer
Over the past few years, Pfizer has dealt with worsening financial results and stiff competition for some products. It also faces the prospect of losing patent protection for others; these include Eliquis, an anticoagulant that is one of its top-selling drugs, and Xtandi, a cancer treatment. Both will lose their patents in the U.S. within the next few years.
These challenges have led to terrible stock-market performance. However, the sell-off may have gone too far. At current levels, Pfizer's shares look attractive.
One reason the company should bounce back and continue to deliver strong returns over the long run is its deep pipeline, particularly in oncology, one of the largest therapeutic areas in the industry. Pfizer currently has five blockbuster cancer medicines, and plans to raise that number to eight by 2030.
Pfizer has exciting candidates in other areas as well, and in recent years has earned approval for several new products. Though these aren't yet meaningfully contributing to its top-line growth, they should do so eventually as they earn label expansion.
The company's vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Abrysvo, generated $143 million in sales in the second quarter, which isn't bad for a product approved in 2023. It also recently earned a label expansion in Europe for adults age 18 to 59 (it was previously indicated for those 60 and older). Pfizer should make progress with Abrysvo and other newer launches.
The company has also been reducing expenses. These initiatives were likely partly responsible for Pfizer's earnings beat during the second quarter. Management intends to achieve $4.5 billion in net cost savings this year and pursue further reductions in the years ahead, efforts that should help improve profitability.
Pfizer is a solid dividend stock. Its forward yield currently tops 7%, and the company has increased its payouts by 19.5% in the past five years. While the stock may take some time to recover, Pfizer could be an excellent long-term investment for income-seeking investors.
2. Merck
Merck is facing several issues, none more important than increased competition for its best-selling drug, cancer medicine Keytruda, and an upcoming patent cliff in 2028 for the medicine. Also, the company's second-quarter results were not strong: Revenue declined by 2% year over year to $15.8 billion, while adjusted earnings per share declined by 7% to $2.13.
However, there were some bright spots for the company. Most notably, Winrevair -- one of its newest launches, which earned approval last year -- reported sales of $336 million. Winrevair is a therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension with a new mechanism of action. It should become a blockbuster relatively soon.
Merck's business in animal health -- where it's one of the leaders -- also performed well, with sales from that segment rising by 11% year over year to $1.6 billion in the second quarter.
Meanwhile, Merck has some exciting pipeline candidates that should help it overcome Keytruda-related challenges. One of them is a subcutaneous version of Keytruda, which has already aced phase 3 studies and will help extend the medicine's patent protection. Merck has also significantly improved its pipeline in recent years thanks to licensing agreements. Its candidates include promising cancer products and weight loss medicines.
Just as Winrevair appears to be a major success, Merck is also likely to develop innovative therapies that will mitigate potential Keytruda-related revenue losses. So, despite recent setbacks, the business could bounce back given Merck's history of innovation.
Turning to Merck's dividend program, the company now offers a forward yield of 4.1%, with its dividends increasing by 39% over the past five years. The stock remains a good pick for dividend seekers.

AI is changing how people do nearly everything, speeding up processes and making many actions cheaper and easier.
Many popular AI stocks continue to climb, including Nvidia and Palantir Technologies, up 36% and 147% respectively. But there are also smaller stocks that offer incredible opportunities, perhaps even more compelling than the stocks that have already caught market attention.
Consider Upstart Holdings(NASDAQ: UPST). The AI-based lending platform was a market favorite before its business seemed to implode, and investors have lost interest in it. It's up only 4% year to date, despite an outstanding second-quarter report. But as the business rebounds, Upstart stock could soar a lot higher.
A better way to lend money
Upstart's platform uses AI and machine learning to evaluate credit risk. It uses millions of data points and many different criteria and offers nearly instant approvals -- a modern version of the traditional credit score, which has a limited scope. It says that its model approves more loans without adding risk to the lender, which puts more money to work for lenders and gives borrowers greater financial freedom.
Although it was growing by leaps and bounds when interest rates were at zero, the good times came to an end when interest rates were raised, since it was more challenging to identify good borrowers when default rates were climbing.
Although interest rates have started to come down, management says its return to growth is unrelated to the decline. It's leaned into its business over the past few years, rolling out new products, expanding the platform, and improving its algorithms.
There was major progress in the second quarter. Revenue more than doubled from last year, and transaction volume was up 159%. It also returned to positive net income on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis a quarter earlier than expected, with $5.4 million in the second quarter.
A huge opportunity
The credit evaluation industry is huge, but it's been dominated by a small number of leaders for several decades. Upstart says that $25 trillion is originated in loans globally among all categories, including personal, home, credit card, and more. It claims that at least $1 trillion goes to whoever originates and services the credit.
Upstart offers a better and cheaper experience for everyone involved along the service line, which is how it has entered this space and captured market share. Since it started, customer acquisition costs have been halved despite sales growing fivefold, it has reduced its workforce by 66%, and it approves loans at 36% lower rates.
As it continues to train its models with more data points, they're improving, offering an even better value proposition. And as it continues to enter new categories, the opportunity expands. Originations from its newest product, a home equity line of credit, increased ninefold from last year in the second quarter.
A better entry point
Upstart stock had risen to astronomical valuations before it plunged, but the price is looking reasonable today. It trades at a forward, 1-year P/E ratio of 25 and a price-to-sales ratio of 7. That gives it room to expand as the market gains more confidence in its chances.
The market found what to worry about in the second quarter update despite the strong performance, including Upstart holding too many loans on its books, the health of its funding pipeline, and an outlook that included a lowering of full-year net interest income. But if you can zoom out and focus on the bigger picture, Upstart could be a lot bigger and more profitable over the next three years.
It's hard to come up with a potential growth rate over the next three years because the business is in flux. Last year at this time, revenue decreased 6% from the year before. But interest rates are likely to keep coming down, and Upstart's improvements make it likely that it will get more business as they do. If it can manage a compound annual growth rate of 30% over the next three years, revenue would more than double, and keeping the price-to-sales ratio constant, so would the stock.

Last year, Tinder’s payer count dropped by 7% annually.
The company recently reported robust results for the second quarter, which led to MTCH stock rising more than 10% intraday. Should you consider investing in Match Group stock now?
Based in Dallas, Texas, Match Group is a leading provider of digital technologies that help people make connections online. The company owns and operates some of the most popular dating apps and websites worldwide, including Tinder, Match.com, OkCupid, Hinge, Plenty of Fish, and BLK. Match Group has grown over the years through organic innovation as well as through acquisitions.
Moreover, the company’s suite of apps operates in over 40 languages, offering users a range of platforms across different geographies, demographics, and dating preferences. Match Group’s revenue model primarily revolves around subscription plans, in-app purchases, and advertising, with additional efficiency provided through product development and artificial intelligence (AI) driven matchmaking.
Its flagship dating app, Tinder, is the most downloaded dating app worldwide. Match Group has a market capitalization of $9.7 billion.
MTCH stock has posted modest gains as its payer growth has been under pressure for quite some time now. Over the past 52 weeks, MTCH stock has gained 12%, while the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has gained 18% over the same period.
On the other hand, the company is currently undergoing a turnaround. Last year, activist investors Starboard Value and Elliott Management acquired stakes in the company, prompting it to reduce costs and enhance profitability. The stock is up 17% year-to-date (YTD), and popped more than 10% on Aug. 6 after the company reported robust Q2 results. MTCH stock also recently reached a 52-week high of $38.85 on Aug. 13.
Match Group’s valuation is currently at an attractive level. Its price sits at 14 times forward earnings, which is lower than the current industry average.
Match Group Reported Solid Q2 Earnings
On Aug. 5, Match Group reported its second-quarter results for fiscal 2025, which showed that the company is on a recovery path. While total revenues remained flat year-over-year (YOY), the revenue figure of $864 million was higher than the $854 million that analysts were expecting.
While payer count declined by 5% from the prior-year period, revenue per payer (RPP) increased by 5% annually to $20. EPS stood at $0.49, up 2% YOY and aligning with analyst estimates.
The company highlighted its three-phase turnaround strategy. Match Group reported that the “Reset” phase — which included installing a new management team, downsizing, and improving the product roadmap — has been completed. It has now entered the “Revitalize” phase, focusing on product acceleration at Tinder and maintaining strong momentum at Hinge.
Match Group expects to enter the “Resurgence” phase in 2026 and 2027, creating a conducive environment in Tinder to attract more Gen Z customers and Hinge to become a dating industry leader with AI-based capabilities.
The company expects Q3 revenue to be in the range of $910 million to $920 million, indicating 2% to 3% YOY growth and higher than the $890 million that analysts expect.
Wall Street analysts are optimistic about Match Group’s future earnings. They expect EPS to climb by 45% YOY to $0.74 for the third quarter. For the current fiscal year, EPS is projected to surge 16.5% annually to $2.60, followed by another 16.5% bump to $3.03 in the next fiscal year.
What Do Analysts Think About Match Group Stock?
Following Match Group's robust Q2 results, the company received multiple notable price target upgrades.
JPMorgan raised its price target from $28 to $33, while maintaining a “Neutral” rating. Analysts at the firm showed optimism about the company’s initial progress in its turnaround strategy. Citing the improvement in metrics and solid financial health, analysts at Evercore ISI also raised their price target from $32 to $38, while maintaining an “In Line” rating on MTCH stock.
Match Group remains soundly favored by Wall Street analysts with a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating overall. Of the 21 analysts rating the stock, seven rate it a “Strong Buy,"" one analyst suggests a “Moderate Buy,” and a majority of 13 analysts play it safe with a “Hold” rating. The consensus price target of $38.31 matches current levels. However, the Street-high price target of $49 indicates 28% potential upside from here.
Key Takeaways
Match Group’s turnaround is well underway, positioning the company for accelerated growth in the future. Moreover, the company remains robustly profitable. Therefore, while some analysts recommend caution, it may be prudent to keep the stock under consideration.

The Canadian pipeline and utility giant has paid dividends for over 70 years and has increased its payment for the past 30 consecutive years. Its earnings are so predictable that the company has achieved its annual financial guidance for 19 straight years and is on track to extend that to 20.
The company has again demonstrated its reliability this year. The pipeline operator has delivered strong earnings and continued enhancing its long-term growth profile. These factors reinforce why the energy stock deserves a place in your portfolio.
On track for another solid year
Enbridge enjoyed a strong first half, posting record second-quarter results with adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) up 7% despite significant market volatility from tariffs. High utilization across its systems and stable commercial frameworks contributed to its predictable results. The company also benefited from last year's acquisition of three U.S. natural gas utilities.
That strong start has the company on track to deliver results at or above the mid-point of its 2025 financial guidance range. It also expects to get some incremental income in the second half from its recent purchase of a 10% interest in the Matterhorn Express Pipeline.
Enbridge's strong performance despite volatile market conditions during Q2 highlights its low-risk business model. About 98% of its earnings come from predictable revenue frameworks with no commodity price exposure and minimal volume risk. Over 95% of these are with investment-grade customers, and 80% of its revenue arrangements shield earnings from inflation.
More growth secured
The Canadian energy infrastructure giant also continues to secure new growth opportunities. The most notable new addition to its backlog is Clear Fork, a 600-megawatt solar energy facility designed to support the data center operations of Meta Platforms. The company expects to complete the $900 million project by 2027.
Enbridge also approved the $100 million Line 31 expansion of its Texas Eastern Transmission system to meet the growing demand from industrial and power customers in the region. Additionally, the company approved a 300 million Canadian dollar ($217.4 million) project to expand its Aitken Creek gas storage facility, providing enhanced flexibility to LNG customers in Western Canada. These new projects increased the company's secured backlog to CA$32 billion ($23.2 billion) of expansions through the end of the decade.
This backlog supports Enbridge's long-term outlook. The company expects 7% to 9% compound annual adjusted EBITDA growth through 2026 and about 3% annual distributable cash-flow per-share growth. Growth rates are projected to stabilize at around 5% annually after 2026, supporting dividend growth of up to 5% per year.
Backed by a fortress financial profile
Enbridge supports its growth and dividend with a strong financial position. At the end of Q2, the company had a leverage ratio -- a measure of debt compared to earnings -- of 4.7 times, safely within its target range of 4.5 to 5.0 times. This ratio improved from 5.0 times at the end of last year thanks to higher earnings and the sale of a 12.5% share in its West Coast natural gas pipeline system for CA$700 million ($507.3 million). The company also maintains a conservative approach to paying dividends, distributing only 60% to 70% of its steady cash flow.
Enbridge estimates it has about CA$9 billion to CA$10 billion ($6.5 billion to $7.3 billion) in annual investment capacity from its post-dividend free cash flow and balance sheet availability while staying within its targeted leverage ratio. This is enough to fund its current backlog and provide room for more expansion projects and bolt-on acquisitions as opportunities arise. The company is currently pursuing CA$50 billion ($36.2 billion) in longer-term investment opportunities to further strengthen its outlook.
Enbridge checks all the boxes
Enbridge stands out for its low-risk model and resilient financials. These attributes allow it to consistently expand operations and steadily grow its dividend. As CEO Greg Ebel noted in the Q2 earnings report, the company's visible earnings and dividend growth ""position Enbridge as a first-choice investment opportunity.""

Consider how much money you'd have today if you'd invested $10,000 in Apple stock 20 years ago vs. in the S&P 500; the difference gets wider as you go back in time.
It has outperformed the market over the past five years, too, but only by a hair's breadth. That's largely due to its performance this year, which has been dismal.
However, there have been many times in the past when Apple stock plunged, and there were times it remained low even for several years before rebounding in a big way. For example, it hit a high in 2007 before the mortgage crisis and didn't reach it again until 2009. Let's see what's happening at Apple and where it might be in five years.
Tariffs, iPhones, and AI
There are several factors working together against Apple stock these days, as there usually are when there's a drastic change from the norm. They are mostly concentrated in tariff uncertainty, iPhone sales, and artificial intelligence (AI).
Tariff uncertainty is weighing on it
The market has been worried about how Apple will be impacted by tariffs, considering its reliance on getting its products made in China. It has already diversified its supply chain to include India to a large degree, but tariffs went there, too, and seem to have chased it into a corner where it recently announced that it would invest $600 billion in manufacturing in the U.S.
The tariff issue is stabilizing, and should be a blip five years from now. However, there could be large-scale aftereffects as it changes its supply chain. Having more operations domestically could lead it in many different directions that are unforeseeable today, such as having a more expensive workforce but a lower tariff rate.
iPhones account for a large part of sales
There's also been concern that it has too few products, which means that any change in one of them could impact the business in a big way. iPhones account for nearly half of total sales, and as artificial intelligence changes how people engage with technology, the iPhone business is vulnerable to innovation in new areas from competitors.
Apple still has a tight ecosystem with users who are loyal to its products, so it's not a near-term worry. But in five years, the landscape could look a lot different, with other kinds of devices taking the place of smartphones for many actions. I don't see iPhones becoming obsolete even in five years, but Apple would need to make some major changes to its premier products to keep customers buying new ones.
Slow progress in AI
CEO Tim Cook gave an upbeat outlook about Apple Intelligence on the fiscal third-quarter earnings call (for the period ended June 28), but so far, it hasn't suitably impressed investors, who feel it's falling behind the competition.
However, as Cook noted, ""In everything we do, we're driven by transformative innovation, delivering the most exceptional products and services we've ever created, and we're especially excited about what's ahead."" I think that sums up Apple's approach to its consumer goods business. It's not, for example, like Amazon, which tries to be everything to everyone. Many users still remember its ""Think Different"" campaign, which still defines its model, and investors shouldn't expect it to do things the same way as other companies. It wouldn't be Apple if it did.
Things could get better, but how much?
That said, Apple is now the third-largest company in the world by market cap, and it's questionable whether it can continue beating the market at this size. It still offers value and is likely to keep growing, but there's a cap on how much it can gain. For example, if we surmise it can grow its revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 8% over the next five years, which is a generous estimate considering its recent performance, and assume the price-to-sales ratio remains constant, revenue and the stock price would increase 47%. That's one possibility of many, and a new product or advances in AI could boost revenue growth.
Considering its recent drop, I would expect it to recoup the loss and go on to be bigger and better sooner rather than later. But over the next five years, I wouldn't count on Apple gaining as quickly as it has in the past.

They are at the top of my list right now, and I think buying shares with the mindset of holding for the next decade is a wise investment strategy.
Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor are providing AI computing power
All five of these stocks are benefiting in various ways from the AI race.
Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which are currently the most popular computing hardware for running and training AI models. It owns this market, and its dominance has allowed it to become the world's largest company.
There's still a huge AI computing demand that hasn't been met, which bodes well for Nvidia's future. Because of this, it remains one of the best stocks to buy and hold over the next decade.
Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC for short) is a manufacturer that produces chips for many of the major players in AI, including Nvidia. These companies don't have chip production capabilities, so they farm that work out to TSMC, which has earned its reputation for being the best foundry in the world through continuous innovation and impressive yields. There are few challengers to its supremacy, and this position will help it continue to be a market-crushing stock for the foreseeable future.
Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor are seeing huge growth right now because they're providing the computing power necessary for AI. The next three are also benefiting and will likely see even more success over the next decade.
More AI applications will rise over the next few years
At first glance, Amazon doesn't seem like much of an AI company. However, it has large exposure through its cloud computing wing, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is the largest cloud computing provider.
It's seeing strong demand for increased computing capacity for AI workloads. With this demand expected to rapidly increase over the next decade, this bodes well for AWS, which makes up the majority of Amazon's profits, helping drive the stock to new heights.
Meta Platforms is developing its own in-house generative AI model, Llama. It has several uses for it, but the biggest is maintaining its role at the top of the social media world.
Meta owns two of the biggest social media platforms, Facebook and Instagram, which generate most of their money through ad revenue. The company has integrated AI tools into its ad services and has already seen an uptick in interaction and conversion rates. This effect will become even greater as generative AI technologies improve, making Meta a strong stock pick for the next decade.
Lastly is Alphabet. Many think Alphabet will be displaced by AI because it gets the majority of its revenue through Google Search, which is seen as a target for AI disruption. However, that hasn't happened yet, and Google Search continues to get larger, with revenue rising 12% in the second quarter.
Part of its success can be attributed to the rise of its Search Overviews, which are a hybrid between a traditional search engine and generative AI. This feature has become popular and could be enough to keep Google on top in search, allowing it to achieve new heights over the next decade.

The largest private-equity firms and other asset managers are salivating at the opportunity to pitch this untapped market of retirement savers.
Private assets encompass a range of investments that do not trade on a public exchange. Examples include hedge funds, private equity, private credit and infrastructure.
The case for private assets is they can provide a buffer against inflation — plus steady returns. The downsides include high fees, illiquidity and complexity.
The nation’s biggest asset managers welcome the executive order. They want to develop funds that make private assets easier for people to buy, and argue that the added diversification serves savers’ best interests.
Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock BLK, says retirement savers should replace the traditional 60% stocks/40% bonds asset-allocation model with a 50/30/20 split: 50% stocks, 30% bonds and 20% private assets.
Should you be excited about this widening menu of investment choices? It depends on whom you ask.
Some investment professionals like the idea of making private assets more available to more people.
“Historically, a number of private-market strategies have produced higher performance and additional diversification in defined-benefit pensions,” says Peter von Lehe, head of investment solutions and strategy at Neuberger Berman. “It’s appropriate that a broader range of investors have access to private assets in their defined-contribution plans because of the potential for return and diversification that these long-term investments can provide.”
However, von Lehe cautions that these investments are illiquid and “have a higher degree of complexity.” He says his “most appropriate use case” for private-market investments is through professionally managed target-date funds or other funds that allocate a percentage of defined-contribution money to these complex but potentially more lucrative alternatives.
Financial advisers have differing views on the role of private assets in client portfolios. Steven Roge, a certified financial planner in Bohemia, N.Y., says private markets are not for everyone.
“It’s for people in the wealth-accumulation phase, say 40 to 50 years old, who have a long time horizon and a high risk tolerance,” Roge says. “And they have to be sophisticated enough to understand it. We know if they don’t understand it, they may not stick with it.”
Of the firm’s 300 clients, he says that “only about a dozen” fit the bill for adding private-market assets to their retirement accounts.
Even with the expanded investment options that may result from the White House’s action, Roge remains a fan of passive strategies for most investors. “Indexing is how they will win over the long run,” he says. “But some clients want something that’s special and different” as they seek market-beating returns.
Given the illiquidity of private assets, Roge anticipates setting expectations for those clients who tend to monitor their portfolio daily — and who engage in frequent trading. “These private investments may only price four times a year,” Roge says. “That’s not enough action for certain clients who track their portfolio like a hawk.”
In his personal portfolio, Roge uses private markets — especially private equity — to diversify his holdings. He says he allocates about 25% to alternative assets. “It helps me sleep at night knowing my portfolio isn’t being pushed around by the volatility of public markets,” he says.
Roge adds that he is not concerned about the current high valuations of private-equity funds. “The valuations [of private-equity funds] are more realistic than the erratic valuations we see in public markets on a daily basis,” he says.
Other advisers are more skeptical of the White House executive order.
“It’s less being done out of interest for the general public and more for private industry lobbying the [Trump] administration,” says Alex Ruda, an adviser in Silver Spring, Md.
The executive order undoubtedly pleases asset managers and private-equity firms. For years, they’ve wanted to attract retirement savers’ money. These savers bear primary responsibility for managing their 401(k) compared with today’s older retirees, many of whom receive employer-funded defined-benefit pensions. While some younger savers enjoy picking their investments, others dread it.
“The average American worker isn’t equipped to navigate these complex [private-market] investments,” Ruda says. “And they may fall prey to a little performance chasing given where we are in the market cycle” — as private markets have outperformed publicly traded stocks since 2000.
Ruda feels so strongly about not incorporating private assets into client portfolios that he’s willing to forgo newcomers who express such interest.
“If I wanted to broaden my client base, I’d have to play to what they want,” he says. “But I don’t have to do that. So I’d say to them, ‘I’m not the best fit.’”",22cb991d63149aa85c5d3938ad09534c,trafilatura,5024,0

However, the July Producer Price Index, which measures wholesale goods prices, has called that thinking into question.
While consumer-level inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index and Personal Consumption Expenditures Index, has ticked only marginally higher, PPI inflation soared in July far more than economists expected.
Pricing pressure at factory gates is often viewed as a precursor to consumer inflation, suggesting that CPI and PCE data could worsen in the next month or two.
If so, it wouldn't be great news for stocks, which perform best when households and businesses feel flush rather than cash-strapped.
Price increases may spell bad news for stocks
The Federal Reserve doesn't directly control how much your bank will charge you for a credit card, mortgage or auto loans, or whether stocks go up or down.
However, the Federal Funds Rate determines how much banks charge each other when they lend reserves overnight. So, changes (and expected changes) to Fed interest rates, and the resulting impact on the prime rate and Treasury yields, influence how much shoppers and businesses pay in interest and have left over to spend.
That affects economic activity, which in turn affects corporate revenue and earnings growth, which are the lifeblood of higher stock prices.
As a result, investors closely watch the Fed's monetary policy.
The central bank decides its monetary policy based on economic data, specifically data on jobs and prices, which enable it to balance its dual mandate to foster low unemployment and inflation.
So far, the data have led the Fed to sit on its hands in 2025, leaving rates unchanged because of concern that the tariffs would cause inflation to spike.
But investors have increasingly modeled for eventual rate cuts, hoping trade negotiations would lower effective tariffs by more than expected this spring, thus supporting stock prices and, eventually, lower rates.
Those hopes strengthened following recent weak jobs data, leading most to predict that the Fed will lower rates in September, driving higher GDP, sales and earnings.
Unfortunately, the July PPI report may have tossed a monkey wrench into that optimism.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produces the inflation report, PPI increased 0.9% in July, the most significant jump since June 2022. Economists expected a 0.2% increase.
Overall, headline PPI inflation rose 3.3% in July year-over-year. The index for final demand minus volatile foods, energy, and trade services was up 2.8% in the past year, ""increasing 0.6% in July, the largest increase since rising 0.9% in March 2022,"" according to the BLS's statement.
""July PPI explodes to the upside leaving Powell in a bind and expected rate cuts in question,"" wrote longtime Wall Street analyst Stephen Guilfoyle in a TheStreet Pro post.
""In what can only be termed as a kick in the pants for anyone hoping for (or betting on) a series of aggressive rate cuts to kick off with the Sept. 17 Federal Open Market Committee policy decision, this was a rude awakening.""
What PPI means for the stock market and the Fed
The average annual return for the S&P 500 since the 1950s is about 10%, yet the benchmark index has rallied 28% since April 9's reciprocal tariff pause.
The gains have been unrelenting, locking many investors out of the market. As a result, the S&P 500's valuation has arguably become stretched and may be pricing stocks for perfection.
The S&P 500's price-to-earnings multiple, a key valuation measure investors use to determine whether stocks are cheap or pricey, has climbed above 22. That's flirting with levels last seen near the highs in February before stocks fell sharply on tariff announcements.
Historically, high p/e multiples haven't translated into significant gains one year later, suggesting that earnings will have to grow faster than prices if stocks are to continue moving up.
Any delay to rate cuts that could fuel GDP and profit growth would be unwelcome.
""July producer prices simply exploded to the upside. There's no way to sugarcoat this,"" said Guilfoyle. ""Unless this is reversed or revised in a more frigid direction with the early September release of the August data, the Fed has all the ammo it needs to be more cautious, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell looks a lot less foolish than I thought he had.""
Currently, the CME's FedWatch tool, which tracks rate-cut probabilities based on the futures markets, still shows a likely cut in September and October. However, the chances for a third cut in 2025 fell dramatically.
""That third rate cut of a quarter point that had been priced in for December ahead of this release has now been pushed out to April. That's a big deal,"" said Guilfoyle.",18711b3a9abbf5ec4abd95bf35353f12,trafilatura,4885,0

The S & P 500 is back at all-time highs as the bull case on Wall Street plays out. The artificial intelligence buildout is ramping up. Corporate earnings are topping expectations. Interest rate cuts seem inevitable, likely coming next month. On top of all that, the One Big Beautiful Bill will be stimulative for an economy where consumers are still spending. But the market's ascent at a time of seasonal weakness and ongoing inflation concerns has many investors worried. They fear that a stock market priced for perfection, with the S & P 500 currently trading at a 12-month forward multiple of 22, is vulnerable to some sort of setback. And that could come from anywhere. ""What's going to happen, I think, is some shock will occur. I don't know what shock, but some shock will occur, which undercuts the thesis of continued economic growth,"" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. ""And when that happens, I think you'll see a selloff in markets, and that'll probably be concentrated in those areas that look most overvalued right now."" ""So, I think investors ought to be pretty cautious here, because what's going on is the market slowly getting more and more overvalued,"" Kelly said. Top-heavy market More than anything, it's the top-heavy nature of the market raises concern. Goldman Sachs pointed out this week that the top 20% of quality companies in the S & P 500 — those with massive cash piles and fortress balance sheets — are trading at a 57% price-to-earnings premium to the lowest quality stocks — a gap in the 94th percentile going back to 1995. In practice, that means that the megacaps — which already benefit from AI tailwinds — get a further boost from investors seeking safety from economic uncertainty. Yet, the influence the tech giants wield on the market is troubling in the event of a pullback. AI superstar Nvidia alone now accounts for roughly 8% of the S & P 500, the biggest weighting of any individual stock in the cap weighted benchmark going back to 1981, according to Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. The stock is easily a key reason for the bull market, after rallying more than 36% this year, surging more than 170% in 2024, and soaring more than 200% in 2023. But, if the bull case for the beloved stock falters, that could spell trouble for the broader benchmark. China, for example, is a key weak point for the stock, as any curbs on Nvidia's sales of its graphics processing units to Beijing will likely hurt the stock — and also the market. An incoming reversal? The top stocks look especially bloated when you consider this: While the S & P 500 has gained more than 10% in 2025, the median stock has only risen 3%, and remains 12% off its recent high, according to a note from Goldman Sachs this week. To be sure, that could set up the market for big rotations. Small-cap stocks outperformed their large-cap counterparts this week. Value-factor stocks also outpaced growth, while Nvidia slid and Apple advanced. Health care, a recent laggard, led the S & P 500. If the dovish outlook for Fed policy holds, or the macroeconomic picture improves, then the rotation trade could continue to work for investors. And yet, even optimistic investors continue to remain cautious, and are diversifying their holdings. JPMorgan's Kelly said he prefers assets with limited downside in the event of a pullback. The strategist prefers U.S. value stocks over growth, and said he's looking abroad to Europe, which he expects has further to run even after its gains this year. Some alternatives such as real estate could also add value to a portfolio, he said. Eventually, Kelly expects some ""violent"" reaction — a sustained bear market of 20% or more — is overdue for the stock market, whether it comes within a week or in the next three years. ""It's just imperative that investors diversify some of that risk into other industries and other regions in particular,"" said Nanette Abuhoff Jacobson, global investment strategist at Hartford Funds. Reversal beneficiaries This past week, Goldman Sachs identified some lower quality stocks with weak balance sheets that could benefit from a reversal trade, if macroeconomic conditions improve or if the Fed turns dovish. Here are five of them. Estee Lauder was one lower quality stock identified. The stock is higher by more than 21% in 2025 but is in the midst of a multiyear turnaround plan that could cost between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion. Paramount Skydance surged 33% this week alone, after it became a ""play for momentum goons"" after Paramount Global's merger with Skydance Media finalized. — CNBC's Sean Conlon and Gabriel Cortes contributed to this story.",c155b8c1fb64fa53a827f9513a95856a,trafilatura,4846,0

""Yes, but that said, the firm is transitioning into something bigger and potentially far more consequential than that.""
Guilfoyle said TeraWulf has pivoted toward providing infrastructure to so-called hyperscalers, the large cloud service providers offering massive computing power and storage capacity, with a focus on AI-related workloads.
""In short, the firm is likely trying to position itself as a competitor to CoreWeave (CRWV) ,"" he said, referring to the AI cloud-computing startup.
Founded in 2021, TeraWulf said on its website that it provided “domestically produced bitcoin by using more than 90% zero carbon energy today.”
Wall Street trader cites TeraWulf deals
Guilfoyle, whose career dates back to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in the 1980s, said Terawulf reached two 10-year agreements with AI cloud platform company Fluidstack to supply high-performance computing clusters to large cloud providers.
Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) has agreed to provide funding of $1.8 billion to help finance this project. In return, Alphabet received warrants to acquire roughly 41 million shares of TeraWulf that would amount to an 8% stake when exercised.
""These are truly a game changer for TeraWulf,"" Chief Financial Officer Patrick Fleury told analysts during the second-quarter earnings call. ""The Fluid Stack lease and Google support agreement are carefully structured to enhance our credit profile and position us to scale quickly.""
TeraWulf's stock has surged 55.4% this year and skyrocketed 144% from this time in 2024.
TeraWulf beat Wall Street's quarterly earnings expectations, with revenue increasing 34% year-over-year to $47.6 million.
The company cited a higher average bitcoin price and expanded mining capacity, offset partly by expected headwinds from increased network difficulty and the April 2024 halving, where bitcoin reduced the block reward by 50%.
""My target price is around $9.50,"" Guilfoyle said. ""This is a trade, not an investment, and I expect to be flat the name by the closing bell should short-term traders take profits en masse on Friday.""
Clear Street analyst Brian Dobson raised the investment firm's price target on TeraWulf to $12 from $9 and affirmed a buy rating on the shares, according to The Fly.
The colocation agreements with Fluidstack, supported by Google's $1.8 billion lease backstop and equity stake, and 80-year ground lease at the Cayuga site in New York, ""materially enhance"" TeraWulf's long-term growth profile, the analyst said.
The firm upped its 2027 Ebitda estimate to reflect TeraWulf's expanding high performance computing portfolio. It sees potential upside to its outlook as it does not consider new business wins.
Adding Fluidstack as a client, along with Google's commitment, ""will create significant momentum and increase the likelihood of additional contract wins going forward,"" Dobson contended.
Analyst says TeraWulf likely to exit mining
Citizens JMP analyst Greg Miller raised the firm's price target on TeraWulf to $13 from $7 and maintained an outperform rating on the shares.
TeraWulf reported solid Q2 results, underscoring progress in its strategic pivot toward high-performance computing hosting, the analyst said.
The company is likely to exit mining by the next halving event, and it retains the flexibility to redeploy mining capacity toward HPC, aligning with customer demand trends, the firm says.
Analysts have noted a shift from bitcoin mining to AI data centers, as both require huge amounts of electricity.
A report by the International Energy Association said that electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030 to around 945 terawatt-hours, slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today.
""Hyperscalers with generative AI needs are particularly interested in converting to bitcoin mining data centers due to the substantial power requirements and the urgency of deployment timelines,"" Prakash Vijayan, a senior analyst with Driehaus Capital Management, wrote in November.
Vijayan said generative AI applications demand immense computational power and energy, often 10 times more than standard operations.
""Bitcoin mining data centers are equipped with advanced cooling systems and have access to cheap, substantial energy sources,"" he said. ""This presents an ideal solution for these needs.""
By repurposing existing bitcoin mining facilities, Vijayan said, hyperscalers can significantly reduce timelines and meet the growing demand for AI services more efficiently.
""Given these trends, bitcoin miners are increasingly transitioning to AI data centers as a strategic move to diversify their revenue streams and leverage their existing infrastructure,"" he added.",6f339be5d6c2c1e4908288f96ffe3251,trafilatura,4791,0

As part of an agreement struck Friday between attorneys from the Department of Justice and D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb's office, Drug Enforcement Administration Chief Terry Cole will now be considered Bondi's ""designee,"" instead of the emergency police chief, a position Bondi sought in her original order that claimed federal control of the department.
The agreement allows Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith to maintain control of the day-to-day operations of her department, while taking orders from Mayor Muriel Bowser.
In a new order Bondi issued Friday evening, the Department of Justice directed Bowser to order the police department to assist in immigration enforcement operations and to comply with database inquiries and requests for information from any federal law enforcement entity.
More from NBC News:
This effectively strips Washington, D.C., of its ""sanctuary city"" status.
But in a news conference after Friday's hearing in federal court, Schwalb, who had filed a lawsuit challenging the administration's police takeover, took a victory lap.
""The key for today is to know that our effort to avoid a hostile takeover of our police force is not going to happen,"" he told reporters. ""Chief Smith remains in control of the police department under the supervision of our mayor.""
Schwalb's office argued in its lawsuit, which also challenges President Donald Trump's order from Monday, that the initial orders exceed the limits on requesting services from D.C., which it says can be done on a temporary basis only under emergency circumstances.
The office sought a temporary restraining order to enjoin the Trump administration from taking over the police department, saying that D.C. would ""suffer devastating and irreparable harms"" if the Trump administration's efforts succeeded.
""The Administration's unlawful actions are an affront to the dignity and autonomy of the 700,000 Americans who call DC home,"" Schwalb said in a statement. ""This is the gravest threat to Home Rule that the District has ever faced, and we are fighting to stop it.""
The suit said that implementing Bondi's order would ""upend the entire command structure of MPD and sow chaos among the more than 3,100 officers serving the District, endangering the safety of the public and law enforcement officers alike.""
Smith said in a sworn declaration in support of Schwalb's suit that she had ""never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive.""
""If effectuated, the Bondi Order would upend the command structure of MPD, endangering the safety of the public and law enforcement officers alike,"" Smith said.
Schwalb's office said Trump only had authority to request services for ""federal purposes,"" and that Congress didn't grant the authority to replace D.C.'s police chief.
Bowser, who had been complying with Trump's earlier directive, said in a post on social media that she agreed the initial Bondi order had gone too far.
""Let us be clear about what the law requires during a Presidential declared emergency: it requires the mayor of Washington, DC to provide the services of the Metropolitan Police Department for federal purposes at the request of the President. We have followed the law,"" Bowser wrote on X. ""In reference to the U.S. Attorney General's order, there is no statute that conveys the District's personnel authority to a federal official,"" she added.
In his order on Monday, Trump cited several high-profile violent acts to justify his decision to deploy National Guard troops into the capital and take control of the D.C. police.
Bowser pushed back on Trump's claims of out-of-control crime in Washington, saying statistics show it's substantially dropped. According to federal data released in January, violent crime in the district for 2024 was at its lowest level in more than three decades, and down 35% from the previous year.
The mayor characterized Trump's moves as ""unprecedented"" and an ""authoritarian push"" earlier this week, but conceded he had the authority to issue the order.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called Trump's order the ""first step in stopping the violent crime that has been plaguing the streets of Washington, DC.""
Under the Home Rule Act, Trump has the power to federalize the D.C. police for only 30 days unless Congress approves an extension. He said on Wednesday that he plans to ask Congress for a long-term extension — but that would need support from some Democrats to pass.",97de1f8a1876c8def7215195a36c8e40,trafilatura,4744,0

But she’s not a passive investor. She frequently adjusts her positions, buying more when stock prices fall and trimming when they rally, balancing short-term gains and her long-term vision.
That’s what she just did, buying shares of a popular tech stock that has tumbled 36% after earnings.
Wood’s funds have experienced a volatile ride this year, swinging from sharp losses to strong gains.
In January and February, the Ark funds rallied as investors bet on the Trump administration's potential deregulation that could benefit Wood’s tech bets. But the momentum faded in March and April, with the funds trailing the market as top holdings — especially Tesla, Wood’s biggest position — slid amid growing concerns over the macroeconomy and trade policies.
Now, the Ark funds are making a strong comeback. As of Aug. 15, the flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up 33.7% year-to-date, far outpacing the S&P 500’s 9.7% gain.
Wood's remarkable return of 153% in 2020 helped build her reputation and attract loyal investors. Her strategy can lead to sharp gains during bull markets but also painful losses, like in 2022, when ARKK dropped more than 60%.
Those swings have weighed on her long-term results. As of Aug. 15, the Ark Innovation ETF has delivered a five-year annualized return of negative 1.4%, while the S&P 500 has an annualized return of 15.6% over the same period.
Cathie Wood’s investment strategy explained
Wood’s investment strategy is straightforward: Her Ark ETFs typically buy shares in emerging high-tech companies in fields such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, biomedical technology, and robotics.
She says these companies have the potential to reshape industries, but their volatility leads to major fluctuations in Ark funds' values.
Over the 10 years ending in 2024, the Ark Innovation ETF wiped out $7 billion in investor wealth, according to an analysis by Morningstar’s analyst Amy Arnott. That made it the third-biggest wealth destroyer among mutual funds and ETFs in Arnott’s ranking.
Still, Wood has been bullish on the market. In a letter to investors published in late April, she dismissed predictions of a recession dragging into 2026 and struck an optimistic tone for tech stocks.
""During the current turbulent transition in the U.S., we think consumers and businesses are likely to accelerate the shift to technologically enabled innovation platforms including artificial intelligence, robotics, energy storage, blockchain technology, and multiomics sequencing,"" she said.
Many investors share this optimism. Over the past five days through Aug. 14, the Ark Innovation ETF attracted $5.52 billion in net inflows, according to data from ETF research firm VettaFi. That’s almost 70% of the fund’s $8 billion assets at the end of July.
Cathie Wood buys $12 million of CoreWeave stock
On Aug. 15, Wood’s Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) bought 120,229 shares of CoreWeave Inc. (CRWV) worth roughly $12 million.
The purchase came after CoreWeave tumbled 20.8% on Aug. 13 and another 15.5% on Aug. 14, following earnings that showed a larger-than-expected loss as the company increased spending to meet surging demand.
CoreWeave is a cloud infrastructure company specializing in GPU-accelerated computing for artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads. The company is backed by Nvidia (NVDA) , now the AI chipmaker’s largest holding.
On Aug. 12, CoreWeave posted a second-quarter loss of 60 cents per share, much wider than Wall Street analysts' forecast of a loss of 45 cents. Still, revenue jumped 207% from a year earlier to $1.21 billion, topping estimates.
Operating expenses in Q2 nearly quadrupled, rising 276% to $1.19 billion. “We are scaling rapidly as we look to meet the unprecedented demand for AI,” said Michael Intrator, co-founder and CEO of CoreWeave.
CFO Nitin Agrawal said during the earnings call that the company is ""still operating in a structurally supply-constrained environment, where demand far outstrips supply for our products and services.""
In Q2, CoreWeave’s operating margin fell to 2% from 20% a year ago. Agrawal cautioned that the company will ""incur some costs prior to revenue generation,"" which will have a short-term impact on margins.
For the current quarter, the company expects revenue between $1.26 billion and $1.30 billion, slightly above the $1.25 billion analysts had forecast.
Despite the recent drop, CoreWeave stock is still up 156% since its March debut.
While Wood is buying, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, and Goldman Sachs are arranging sales of up to $10 billion of CoreWeave stock as the IPO lock-up ends.",046b1eb977ca13345a3e50e55e003c4d,trafilatura,4738,0

Weathering the tough moments that build resilience is less glamorous.
Developing emotional endurance, or the ability to withstand stress or discomfort without letting negative emotions overtake you, can help that process feel less grueling and more like an opportunity to learn and grow, Columbia University-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy tells CNBC Make It.
""The more we understand that the frustration and struggle is actually a sign we're [learning], not a sign we're doing something wrong, it becomes a lot easier to tolerate,"" says Kennedy, a New York-based clinical psychologist and host of the ""Good Inside"" podcast.
You can get to this state of understanding by following these three steps, she says:
Keep a visual handy
In a February Instagram Reel, Kennedy explained that learning happens between the space of knowing and not knowing something.
You don't always instantly gain knowledge where you previously had none, and the process of getting from Point A to Point B can feel frustrating, says Kennedy. When you start a new job, for example, you'll likely have to learn some new skills, make some mistakes and foster some new connections before you start to feel comfortable in the role.
The path between knowing and not knowing something is much more like a winding line than a straight and narrow one, Kennedy says — so when you feel frustrated, remind yourself that learning takes time. You can do this by drawing or looking at a simple diagram of the scenario, like this one:
""Having some type of visual for yourself is very, very helpful,"" says Kennedy. ""Every time you're trying to do something new, when your voice starts to say, 'Oh, this is too hard. I can't figure it out,' the visual gives you a different story. 'I'm in the learning space. I'm kind of exactly where I'm supposed to be. It just happens to be tricky.'""
Engage in positive self-talk
If you constantly tell yourself ""this is too hard"" or ""I'm never going to get there,"" you start to believe it. Shift your internal dialogue to something more positive, supportive and understanding, advises Kennedy.
Try telling yourself something like this, she says: ""This feels hard because it is hard. I haven't figured it out yet, and I can keep trying. I can take a breath and take a break and come back when I'm ready.""
Even if you don't believe what you're telling yourself, going through the motions — essentially, faking it until you make it — will help, because the practice will help you feel more confident over time, she says.
""Self-talk is very powerful. How we end up feeling about something is a combination of the feeling and how we talk to ourselves about the feeling, and we can't change our feelings, but we can change how we talk to ourselves about our feelings,"" says Kennedy.
Positive self-talk can improve your coping skills and build your mental strength, allowing you to put in more effort than you think you're capable of, according to a 2020 study published in the Journal of Sports Science and Management. It can increase your internal motivation and even help you enjoy learning more, the study found.
Take on a small experiment
Start with small goals instead of expecting yourself to quickly reach your long-term vision, says Kennedy.
If you set a huge goal and fall short of it, you're unlikely to try again anytime soon, she says. If you want to be more active, commit to taking a 20 minute walk three times per week instead of trying to hit the gym for an hour every day, for example.
""Take on a small experiment that feels uncomfortable for you: I am going to talk to my boss about those things that's upsetting. I am going to have that conversation with my friend,"" Kennedy says. ""Those are small experiments that tell your body, 'I am someone who can be in the learning space and tolerate discomfort.' The more our body learns that we can tolerate that space, the more we're able to tolerate it in other areas as well.""

Covrig Analytics said last Friday that reports of reduced cane yields from Brazil's sugar farmers may knock Brazil's 2025/26 sugarcane production below 600 MMT, much lower than Brazilian government crop forecasting agency Conab's forecast of 663.4 MMT.
An excessive short position by funds could exacerbate any short-covering rally in sugar futures. Last Friday's weekly Commitment of Traders (COT) report showed funds increased their net-short positions in NY sugar futures by +25,923 positions to 151,004 short positions in the week ending August 5, the most in almost 6 years.
Last Tuesday, sugar prices fell to 5-week lows on signs of stronger sugar production in Brazil. On July 31, Unica reported Brazil's Center-South sugar output in the first half of July rose +15% y/y to 3.4 MMT. Also, the amount of sugarcane being crushed for sugar by Brazil's sugar mills has increased to 54% from 50% the same time last year.
The outlook for higher sugar exports from India is negative for sugar prices after Bloomberg reported that India may permit local sugar mills to export sugar in the next season, which starts in October, as abundant monsoon rains may produce a bumper sugar crop. India's Meteorological Department reported Tuesday that cumulative monsoon rain in India was 500.8 mm as of August 4, or 4% above normal. Also, the Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association said last Thursday that it will seek permission to export 2 MMT of sugar in 2025/26.
The outlook for higher sugar production in India, the world's second-largest producer, is bearish for prices. On June 2, India's National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories projected that India's 2025/26 sugar production would climb +19% y/y to 35 MMT, citing larger planted cane acreage. That would follow a -17.5% y/y decline in India's sugar production in 2024/25 to a 5-year low of 26.2 MMT, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).
Sugar prices retreated through early July, with NY sugar falling to a 4.25-year low and London sugar sliding to a 4-year low, driven by expectations of a sugar surplus in the 2025/26 season. On June 30, commodities trader Czarnikow projected a 7.5 MMT global sugar surplus for the 2025/26 season, the largest surplus in 8 years. On May 22, the USDA, in its biannual report, projected that global 2025/26 sugar production would increase by +4.7% y/y to a record 189.318 MMT, with global sugar ending stocks at 41.188 MMT, up 7.5% y/y.
Sugar prices also have support from reduced sugar production in Brazil. Unica reported last Thursday that the cumulative 2025/26 Brazil Center-South sugar output through mid-July fell by -9.2% y/y to 15.655 MMT. Last month, Conab, Brazil's government crop forecasting agency, said 2024/25 Brazil sugar production fell by -3.4% y/y to 44.118 MMT, citing lower sugarcane yields due to drought and excessive heat.
The outlook for higher sugar production in Thailand is bearish for sugar prices. On May 2, Thailand's Office of the Cane and Sugar Board reported that Thailand's 2024/25 sugar production rose +14% y/y to 10.00 MMT. Thailand is the world's third-largest sugar producer and the second-largest exporter of sugar.
The International Sugar Organization (ISO) raised its 2024/25 global sugar deficit forecast to a 9-year high of -5.47 MMT on May 15, up from a February forecast of -4.88 MMT. This indicates a tightening market following the 2023/24 global sugar surplus of 1.31 MMT. ISO also cut its 2024/25 global sugar production forecast to 174.8 MMT from a February forecast of 175.5 MMT.
The USDA, in its bi-annual report released May 22, projected that global 2025/26 sugar production would climb +4.7% y/y to a record 189.318 MMT and that global 2025/26 human sugar consumption would increase +1.4% y/y to a record 177.921 MMT. The USDA also forecasted that 2025/26 global sugar ending stocks would climb +7.5% y/y to 41.188 MMT. The USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) predicted that Brazil's 2025/26 sugar production would rise +2.3% y/y to a record 44.7 MMT FAS predicted that India's 2025/26 sugar production would rise +25% y/y to 35.3 MMT due to favorable monsoon rains and increased sugar acreage. FAS predicted that Thailand's 2025/26 sugar production will climb +2% y/y to 10.3 MMT.

Perhaps there's no more glaring example of the conflict of interest in Washington than elected members' ability to actively buy and sell shares in publicly traded companies that could be sent soaring or reeling by legislative and spending decisions.
Many believe that elected officials should be barred from trading stocks. Others have started using publicly released information on their trading to influence their own investing decisions.
Nancy Pelosi is perhaps the most followed active investor in Washington, but she's far from the only person buying and selling individual stocks. The list crisscrosses political parties.
This week Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent delivered a strong message on members of Congress owning individual stocks, explicitly calling out Representative and former Speaker of the House Pelosi and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon).
Congress has a big stock trading problem
This is far from the first time that owning stocks or other investments has raised eyebrows among voters.
Concern over Congress members trading stocks was so high that it passed the STOCK Act in 2012, which explicitly prohibits insider trading and forces members to report transactions publicly within 45 days.
The STOCK Act is an improvement, but it hasn't stopped Representatives and Senators from investing in stocks.
A study of the 117th Congress in 2021 found that 53% of Congress members owned individual stocks and only 7% didn't own any stocks or widely held investment funds, such as mutual funds, according to the Campaign Legal Center.
Only 2% used a qualified blind trust, which creates a firewall between investments and members of Congress, preventing them from knowing their investments.
Stock ownership is widespread across both political parties, with 54% of Republicans and 46% of Democrats owning stocks as of 2021.
Those findings include trades by Congress members, spouses, and dependent children, including buys and sells made by Pelosi's husband, who she says handles their investing.
While Pelosi's trading disclosures are closely watched, partly because of her husband's prescient options investments in high-tech stocks, her portfolio was far from the best-performing in Congress last year.
Congress members generated juicy returns in 2024
Unusual Whales tracks buys and sells by members of Congress via periodic transaction reports filed within 45 days of any investment exceeding $1,000.
In 2024, the S&P 500 returned nearly 25%, including dividends. However, according to Unusual Whales estimates, Democrats returned 31% on average, due mainly to tech stocks, while Republicans gained 26% on average, thanks largely to financials and commodities.
Since periodic transaction report filings aren't provided in real time, Unusual Whales has to make assumptions, which could mean their estimates are off the mark.
Still, according to its calculations, its estimated returns for the top 10 members of Congress in 2024 are pretty eye-popping and likely to make many investors jealous:
Rep. David Rouzer, Republican, North Carolina: 149%.
Secretary Bessent supports banning Congress from trading stocks
On Aug. 13, the Office of Government Ethics reported that Treasury Secretary Bessent, a Wall Street veteran trained under the legendary hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller, had yet to fully divest holdings as promised in an ethics agreement signed in January.
Bessent responded by saying that he's liquidated more than 90% of the $1 billion holdings and that the remaining holdings are illiquid farmland that will be liquidated by year's end.
The disclosure renewed debate about what politicians and executive-branch members should be allowed to own as investments.
Bessent delivered a blunt take on the matter.
""I am pushing for a ban on single-stock trading in Congress,"" wrote Bessent in a post on X.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, given his role in the Trump administration, he specifically called out Democrats Pelosi and Wyden.
""The American people deserve better than politicians like @RonWyden and @SpeakerPelosi with hedge-fund level returns,"" wrote Bessent. ""Public service should be about serving the people, not getting rich.""
""If any private citizen traded this way, the SEC would be knocking on their door,"" said Bessent.
Whether Bessent's support for a ban results in actionable legislation remains to be seen, given that proposals have won mixed support in Congress over the past few years. None of them have become law.",fa87a2dd3ea7bc77a531ae50b6eaab0e,trafilatura,4591,0

Now, his eyes are set on MicroStrategy, a Virginia-based software company that has lately changed its name to ""Strategy.""
The company is well known for its corporate Bitcoin vault. But Chanos is clear in his criticism: the company's business model is ""financial nonsense,"" and its shares are worth a lot more than the Bitcoin they represent.
Chanos's main point is based on a single number: market net asset value, or mNAV. This represents the value of the company's Bitcoin holdings per share, minus its debts and preferred equity, relative to the actual stock price.
Strategy now has around $77.2 billion worth of Bitcoin. However, the price of its shares suggests that each share is worth significantly more than the coins themselves. Traders call that extra gap the ""premium,"" and Chanos thinks it's not fair.
Strategy's premium has been under both scrutiny and praise. The corporation doesn't just use cash reserves or issue traditional debt to get money. It also sells perpetual preferred shares, such as its STRD (""Stride"") and STRC (""Stretch"") offerings.
Investors in these preferreds receive regular dividends, typically ranging from 9% to 12%, which Strategy uses to purchase additional Bitcoin.
The method gives investors more power: when the market is strong, the extra Bitcoin raises returns for regular stockholders. But in poor markets, those fixed dividend obligations stay in place, which might lower value and force Strategy to keep raising money.
In favor of MSTR
Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of Strategy and the person who came up with this plan, says the extra money is well worth it. He talks about it in terms of four main benefits.
The first is ""credit amplification,"" which means that the company can raise more money than its equity base would normally allow, which increases its exposure to Bitcoin.
The second is an ""options advantage."" Strategy's common stock, which still trades under the MSTR ticker, has one of the most active options markets tied to the price of Bitcoin. This allows investors to set up trades using calls, options, and spreads in ways that aren't easily possible with direct Bitcoin holdings.
""Passive flows"" is the third pillar. MSTR is included in index funds and other investment products that follow regulations. These funds automatically acquire the stock, regardless of its cost, which keeps the demand consistent.
Lastly, there is ""institutional access."" Many big pools of money, such as pension funds and endowments, can't acquire Bitcoin directly. By holding MSTR shares, they can still acquire exposure to Bitcoin's price swings.
""Believe it or not, there are a lot of people who …don't want the Bitcoin return. They want 100% return. So MicroStrategy, the equity, or strategy,..We actually aim to generate 2x the Bitcoin return and 2x the volatility.""
Analysis by Ryan (@ryQuant) highlights that the perpetual preferred model could drive 51% annual growth and a $1,960 fair value, allowing Strategy to keep adding Bitcoin indefinitely by paying dividends.
Chanos and other skeptics are uncertain whether the benefits outweigh the costs.
First of all, ""credit amplification"" costs money. Chanos says that preferred dividends must be paid no matter how well Bitcoin does, and that individual investors can often borrow money at lower rates than Strategy does.
Skeptics also disagree with the ""passive flows"" thesis, arguing that index inclusions can alter the market and that the buying pressure they create is not permanent.
Critics argue that the restrictions preventing large investors from buying Bitcoin directly are diminishing, particularly with the introduction of U.S.-listed spot ETFs.
Further, holding Bitcoin through a corporate wrapper introduces ""double taxation,"" where profits could be taxed at both the corporate and shareholder level, as per reports.
Chanos says that the biggest risk is that the premium itself might fall apart. If investors are less inclined to pay more than mNAV, MSTR's shares could drop a lot even if the price of Bitcoin stays the same.
Some traders take a short position in MSTR and a long position in Bitcoin at the same time, anticipating that the premium would go down over time.
At press time, Strategy's mNAV stands at up by 0.62%. Interestingly, MSTR has been 91% volatile among all assets over the last year — even more extreme than Tesla or Bitcoin.",d04f59c53242ed8ab9cc9a90858b3d35,trafilatura,4526,0

The company's shares tumbled nearly 20% and Chief Financial Officer Tricia Toliver discussed the current economy during the earnings call.
""We’re operating in a fluid macroeconomic environment, and it’s one that sort of creates a fog for consumers where things are changing constantly,"" Toliver told analysts. ""It’s hard to see the clear. And those during those times they tend to step off of the gas.""
It seems that the fog is getting pretty thick out there, and many consumers have been hitting the brakes when it comes to dining out.
In the first half of 2025, US restaurants and bars saw one of the weakest six-month periods of sales growth in the past decade, according to a CNN analysis of U.S. Commerce Department data.
Veteran trader: Cava balance sheet a work of art
This year has shown weaker growth than even during the Covid-19 pandemic, when restaurants and bars closed due to lockdown orders, CNN reported,
And in June Campbell’s Co. (CPB) said it saw stronger quarterly sales of broth and condensed soup as more Americans cooked their meals at home.
""The team’s done an outstanding job navigating tariffs both on the supply chain construction side so that we’re not anticipating material changes at all in our ability to grow and continue to leverage those robust new restaurant openings that we’ve been experiencing,"" Toliver said.
TheStreet Pro's Stephen Guilfoyle pulled up a chair at Cava Group's table and reviewed the company's financials.
The firm has hit a bump, the veteran trader said. ""Still, cash flows are positive, margins are holding up. Same-store sales are pressured. That said, the balance sheet is a work of art. In theory, I find this company investable as long as a decent entry point can be found.""
Guilfoyle, whose career dates back to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in the 1980s, pointed to the stock's simple moving average, which is used to calculate the average price of a stock over a specific period, and exponential moving average, which unlike the SMA places more emphasis on recent price data.
""The stock has now lost its 50-day SMA after losing its 21-day EMA,"" he said. ""This will force portfolio managers to either exit the stock or reduce exposure as the 200-day SMA is nothing but a distant memory.""
Cava Group's stock is down 40% in 2025 and has tumbled 29% from a year ago.
Analyst sees buying opportunity
Investment firms issued research reports following Cava Group's earnings report.
While ""disappointed"" by Cava's Q2 same-restaurant sales growth of 2.1%, Stifel analyst Chris O'Cull said that doesn't justify a $2 billion hit to its market value. He sees the sharp pullback in shares as a buying opportunity, according to The Fly.
Despite the comparables miss, Cava beat Ebitda estimates and new stores are ramping quickly, said O'Cull, who views the recent weakness as ""a temporary setback, not a change in the fundamental outlook.""
Stifel affirmed a buy rating and $125 price target on Cava shares.
KeyBanc analyst Christopher Carril lowered the firm's price target on Cava Group to $85 from $100 and maintained an overweight rating on the shares.
The investment firm noted that Q2 same-store-sales trends missed consensus and likely fell short of buy-side expectations.
That said, earnings per share and Ebitda exceeded Wall Street's estimates as store-level margins fell in line with the analyst consensus, and general and administrative expense largely offset most of the revenue shortfall. G&A expense in the current quarter was 11.4% of revenue compared with 12.1% a year earlier.
Same-store-sales growth improved in July and in the quarter-to-date, but trends likely remain short of the mid-single-digit-percent range Wall Street expected in the second half, the analyst said.
Bank of America Securities lowered its price target on Cava Group to $100 from $121 and reiterated a buy rating on the shares.
A ""modest"" revenue miss, despite a ""more meaningful"" miss on same-store-sales growth, is a function of an evolving restaurant maturity curve, the firm said.
While the tailwind to comparisons from maturing stores has moderated, the investment firm said it was encouraged by new unit-volume strength across markets of widely disparate sizes.",6d3e3d67395b88b690e778396bf9d3c6,trafilatura,4428,0

Projects Due to Trump Actions,2025-08-16 17:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"A Germany-headquartered company involved in the global hydrogen industry said it plans to abandon some of its projects in the U.S. due to actions from the Trump administration. Werner Ponikwar, chief executive of Thyssenkrupp Nucera, on August 13 said the company has been in discussions with stakeholders in its U.S. hydrogen projects and would cancel any that are no longer deemed viable due to tax and spending changes from the U.S. government. Ponikwar noted that global demand for green hydrogen, which is produced using renewable energy resources, has been curtailed as governments sort out what President Trump's policies, including elimination of tax credits for low-carbon energy sources, mean for the hydrogen industry. ""We have sorted out all projects that have less chance of being realized due to the new framework conditions in the U.S.,"" Ponikwar said in a media call Wednesday after the company's earnings call with investors. Ponikwar noted that the administration's tax and spending rules are making it more difficult to develop clean energy projects in the U.S., particularly by phasing out renewable energy tax credits after 2026 if projects have not started construction. Ponikwar did say, though, that a revision in the deadline to year-end 2027 for projects to start construction could keep some U.S. projects in development, particularly those already in advanced stages. ""We are convinced that the hydrogen electrolysis market continues to offer enormous potential,"" Ponikwar said. The executive said Thyssenkrupp Nucera will continue to be active in the U.S., though it will use resources ""for other purposes"" if hydrogen projects are canceled. Thyssenkrupp Nucera is the world's leading provider of electrolysis technology, the process used to produce hydrogen. The company said it has improved its revenue and profit year-over-year through the first nine months of its fiscal year, and is on track to achieve its financial targets for the full fiscal year. “Thanks to its business model and strict cost management, Thyssenkrupp Nucera continues to generate positive free cash flow even in this difficult market for hydrogen solutions. This underscores our stable financial position,"" said Dr. Stefan Hahn, chief financial officer of Thyssenkrupp Nucera. The company in June of this year strengthened its strategic technology portfolio with the acquisition of a modular high-pressure electrolysis solution from Danish company Green Hydrogen Systems (GHS). The high-pressure electrolysis developed by GHS operates highly efficiently at up to 35 bar operating pressure, which is considered advantageous for certain industrial applications where hydrogen is required in compressed form. Thyssenkrupp Nucera previously has entered into a strategic collaboration with Germany's Fraunhofer IKTS on high-temperature electrolysis technology, known as SOEC. A pilot production plant for SOEC stacks was opened in Arnstadt, Germany, in May. ""By further expanding our strategic technology portfolio, we at Thyssenkrupp Nucera are enabling hydrogen solutions with optimized levelized cost of hydrogen. This makes green hydrogen more attractive,” said Klaus Ohlig, the company's chief technology officer. Officials said Thyssenkrupp Nucera provided technology for about 1.5 GW of hydrogen production last year, with similar or better growth expected this year. ""Europe is currently the most promising market. We are currently working on engineering orders totaling 1.5 gigawatts of electrolysis capacity,"" said Ponikwar. ""This clearly shows that thyssenkrupp nucera's pipeline of green hydrogen projects is maturing and industrial projects are progressing. We are therefore looking ahead with confidence."" Said Ponikwar: ""Green hydrogen, a climate-friendly energy source, is and will remain the central pillar of the decarbonization strategies required by industry worldwide.

The complaint was filed on Wednesday with the Unified Patent Court in Munich by Fast IP, LLC, the intellectual property holding company of Hands Free. While the disputed amount is stated as having a preliminary estimate of 1 million euros, or nearly $1.2 million at current exchange, that number is more likely a “holding” tally just to get the lawsuit filed and before the German patent court. Also named in the patent infringement suit were the German, Swiss, Belgian, Italian and French arms of Skechers operations across Europe.

Essentially, the complaint follows similar patent infringement claims in the U.S. Kizik lawsuit filed last month regarding the slip-in shoe technology. Hands Free is also seeking an order barring Skechers from selling its alleged infringing shoes across 18 European countries: Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Finland, France, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, and/or Sweden. The complaint is also seeking a recall of products already placed on the market since July 9, 2025. And there are requests for provisional damages in the amount of 200,000 euros ($232,694), as well as a penalty payment to the court in other amounts under certain circumstances.
“As the holder of more than 200 patents and applications worldwide, HandsFree Labs is committed to protecting our hands-free footwear technology from those who seek to profit from our intellectual property and duplicate our cutting-edge products,” said Hands Free CEO Gareth Hosford.
While Hosford is making a show that his company is bent on protecting its patents, whether it can win on the merits of its claims here and abroad remains to be seen.
The Kizik parent’s U.S. patent infringement suit was filed on July 24 in a federal district court for the Eastern District of Texas. It also alleged that the Skechers Hands Free Slip-in debuted a few years ago, fueling “astonishing growth” that fueled a “windfall $9.42 billion acquisition announcement.” That announcement that Skechers would be acquired by 3G Capital is now the largest buyout in the shoe industry.
Skechers said on July 28 that the hands-free concept is a “century-old idea” and that it has developed its own “unique Slip-ins technology.” The company also said in a statement that it has obtained more than 140 utility and design patents worldwide and will vigilantly enforce its patent rights.
Skechers president Michael Greenberg also noted that the company has been advertising and selling its slip-in shoes since December 2021, without any contract from Kizik. He suggested that the recent angst by Hands Free amounts to nothing more than a money grab as it follows the $9.42 billion merger agreement with 3G Capital.
“We believe that, after all these years of silence, the true motivation for this lawsuit might be found right on the face of Kizik’s complaint, where they state that they are looking for a share of the $9.42 billion being paid for Skechers, money Kizik did not earn and does not deserve,” Greenberg said. He added that the company has become the market leaders in the hands-free footwear space by innovating and not imitating the idea of hands-free fit using its own technology.
Greenberg said the company is “undeterred by transparent litigation efforts to thwart competition,” adding that Skechers “will aggressively challenge both the validity of the patents and the infringement claims.”
As for the overseas complaint, a Skechers spokeswoman said the company will have “no further comment beyond” its July 28th statement.

The Wall Street investment bank says stocks like Sunrun are compelling. Other overweight-rated companies the bank is bullish on include: RealReal, Spotify , Williams Companies and Nextracker. Spotify Technology Analyst Steven Cahall says he's standing by the streaming music stock following its late July earnings report. Wells Fargo admitted the quarterly results weren't overly exciting, but said Spotify remains a top pick with too many attractive catalysts to ignore. ""[Estimates] are coming down and there is nothing particularly incremental to get excited about,"" Cahall wrote. Nonetheless, the analyst said investors should remain calm. Cahall is particularly bullish on Spotify's latest subscription tier, Super Fan. ""We think the next several years will see product and feature innovations, such as Super Fan, increase in videos, education, etc,"" he said. Shares of Spotify are up 64% this year with more room to run, Cahall went on to say. Williams Companies The natural gas and oil pipeline company is firing on all cylinders, according to Wells Fargo. Analyst Praneeth Satish raised his price target to $70 per share from $67 after Williams' mixed earnings report earlier this month. ""WMB underperformed post-Q2, likely due to high expectations around new project FIDs,"" he wrote. FID's are final investment decision projects that involve moving from the project planning to execution. Despite the quarterly report, Wells Fargo says it's sticking with the stock thanks to several looming tailwinds. Satish called Williams' growth ""sector leading,"" and said the company is likely to see a lower cash burden under President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill. Williams shares are up 6.2% this year, excluding its 3.5% dividend yield, and the stock remains a top idea at Wells Fargo. RealReal ""We continue to like what we see from REAL,"" analyst Ike Boruchow said following the resale clothing company's latest earnings report. RealReal's earnings and revenue both topped Wall Street estimates, and Boruchow says it remains a top pick. ""At a high level, the model has course corrected, margin structure has shifted and top line is back to [plus double digit] growth,"" he said. And that growth still has room to run, he added. ""Resale is a clear winner in today's macro, and we remain bullish,"" he went on. Shares are up 47% in August alone. Spotify ""[Estimates] are coming down and there is nothing particularly incremental to get excited about.

Chipotle and Cava are hurting too
Chipotle, Cava, and Sweetgreen are all confronting a marked consumer spending slowdown in 2025, evident in disappointing sales, flat or declining customer traffic, and lowered forecasts.
This reflects a broader malaise in the fast-casual sector, where value-driven diners are pulling back, and macroeconomic headwinds are pressuring even the strongest brands.
Chipotle
-
Q2 same-store sales dropped 4%, steered by a 4.9% fall in transactions despite modest check averages ticking up.
-
CEO Scott Boatwright directly linked the decline to consumer caution.
“I think the underlying trend … is really tied to the consumer sitting on the sideline,” he said, citing increased price sensitivity, an uncertain economic climate, and the challenge of lapping last year’s promotional successes. “Many are preserving cash because of the unknown, or potential consequences, downstream consequences, intended or unintended from the current administration. And so you’re seeing a pullback, a market pullback, at present.”
Economic trends prompted Chipotle to lower its full-year projections.
Leadership is focusing on new marketing initiatives and menu innovation to recapture traffic, but remains cautious about the economic environment.
Cava
-
Q2 same-restaurant sales rose just 2.1%, a steep fall from prior years, with traffic essentially flat and growth driven mainly by pricing and menu mix.
-
CFO Tricia Tolivar said macro volatility and consumer reticence weighed on traffic.
In interviews around their earnings call, company leaders emphasized the “fog and uncertainty” facing customers and cited weakened confidence and comparisons to a very strong prior year as primary factors behind the guidance cuts.
Sweetgreen
-
Q2 same-store sales sank 7.6%; traffic was down 10.1%. Despite menu pricing moves, revenue barely grew and losses widened. Full-year outlooks were lowered again, now projecting a 4%–6% decline in same store sales.
-
CEO Jonathan Neman said: “I think it’s pretty obvious the consumer is not in a great place overall” and the poor results reflect “the convergence of several external headwinds and internal actions” including a “more cautious consumer environment.”
-
Company leaders also pointed to slumping office lunch demand in urban cores and consumer desire for deeper value at higher prices.
What’s driving this?
Major drivers of the slowdown across these chains:
-
Economic uncertainty, value hunger: Consumers are cautious. Price sensitivity is widespread, including among higher-income diners, while economists cite recession risks and tariff concerns as pressuring discretionary spending.
-
Persistent inflation and elevated costs: Many customers “feel the pinch” of inflation, resisting frequent dining out and gravitating toward deals or groceries.
-
Workplace shift: Chains heavily reliant on urban office lunches (notably Sweetgreen) struggle as hybrid work persists, shrinking prime business for those locations.
-
Tough comparisons: Last year’s popular menu launches created unusually difficult sales benchmarks for Chipotle and Cava this year.
-
Tariffs & consumer headwinds: New tariffs and related cost pass-throughs have intensified price pressures, with several company execs noting it as a material macro threat.",3cce48dee971a666216c5cfaf9ef749c,trafilatura,3370,0

Mark Zuckerberg goes to great lengths to protect himself. It makes sense: Critics say his social networks are bad for your mental health; he’s aggressively hiring people across Silicon Valley to staff up his ambitious AI projects (which are, unto themselves, polarizing); and he owns wide swaths of land in Hawaii, which has rankled residents and activists alike. It makes sense that he might want to shield his livelihood, considering he’s almost certainly the target of public ire.
According to a new Financial Times analysis, security budgets for the chief executives of 10 major tech companies climbed above $45 million in 2024—but still, nobody protects their boss more than Meta does for Zuckerberg.
Across the board, companies like Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, and Palantir all increased protection budgets by more than 10% year over year, driven by heightened threats and a worsening security environment for public-facing business leaders. But Meta’s security allocation for Zuckerberg reached more than $27 million in 2024, up from $24 million the previous year.
This dwarfs the amount spent by peers: In 2024, Nvidia spent $3.5 million to secure CEO Jensen Huang, an increase from $2.2 million the previous year. Amazon allocated $1.1 million for CEO Andy Jassy, while former CEO Jeff Bezos continued to receive $1.6 million annually toward his personal security. Apple spent $1.4 million to protect Tim Cook in 2024, which was actually lower than the $2.4 million spent in 2023. Alphabet’s security spending for Sundar Pichai reached $6.8 million, according to public data, and Tesla disclosed it spent just $500,000 to protect Elon Musk, although industry experts emphasize that this sum represents only a small portion of his actual security expenses as the world’s richest man has his own security companies like Foundation Security.
Notably, if you add up how much Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Palo Alto Networks spent protecting their CEOs in 2024, it’s still about $7 million—26%—less than what Meta spent to guard Zuckerberg.
Security in Silicon Valley
For what it’s worth, Meta’s security program is a bit different from the others as it covers Zuckerberg’s residences, family, and travel, since Zuckerberg is synonymous with Meta, né Facebook. As both CEO and cofounder, he also holds majority voting power—and a lot of people have strong feelings about Zuckerberg given his very public role in society, layoffs, and consumer privacy.
Security in Silicon Valley is often managed by private security firms, many of which are staffed by former law enforcement and military professionals. Hamilton Security, founded by former FBI agent James Hamilton, provides comprehensive assessments and risk mitigation services. Gavin de Becker & Associates and LaSorsa & Associates are also considered major players, protecting executives like Musk and Bezos, respectively. Their services include risk assessment, intelligence monitoring, residential security with hardened features (e.g., Amazon’s bulletproof panels), 24/7 personal protective details, secure transportation, cybersecurity, anti-stalking measures, as well as preparation for assassination attempts, kidnap attempts, and digital threats such as deepfakes.",051a0c40010d2c425e684b8b89c0b198,trafilatura,3370,0

The letter — signed by Senators Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.; Mark Warner, D-Va.; Jack Reed, D-R.I.; Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H.; Christopher Coons, D-Del.; and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. — was in response to an Aug. 11 announcement by Trump that Nvidia and AMD would pay the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses.
""Our national security and military readiness relies upon American innovators inventing and producing the best technology in the world, and in maintaining that qualitative advantage in sensitive domains. The United States has historically been successful in maintaining and building that advantage because of, in part, our ability to deny adversaries access to those technologies,"" the letter states.
""The willingness displayed in this arrangement to 'negotiate' away America's competitive edge that is key to our national security in exchange for what is, in effect, a commission on a sale of AI-enabling technology to our main global competitor, is cause for serious alarm,"" the letter continues.
Senators also warned that selling advanced AI chips — specifically Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 chips — to China could help strengthen its military systems, a claim that Nvidia denies.
In a statement to CNBC, a Nvidia spokesperson said: ""The H20 would not enhance anyone's military capabilities, but would have helped America attract the support of developers worldwide and win the AI race. Banning the H20 cost American taxpayers billions of dollars, without any benefit.""
A request for comment on the letter from AMD was not immediately returned.
The Senate Democrats also requested a detailed response from the administration by Friday, Aug. 22, regarding the current deal involving Nvidia and AMD, as well as any similar arrangements being made with other companies.
""We again urge your administration to quickly reverse course and abandon this reckless plan to trade away U.S. technology leadership,"" the letter states.
In response, the Trump administration appeared to brush aside the legislators' national security concerns.
""It's quite rich to see Democrats and irrelevant 'experts', who were totally MIA when Joe Biden's autopen administration let H20 chips and other advanced technologies freely flow to China, now pretend to care about our national and economic security,"" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CNBC.
Despite Trump allowing chip sales to resume, it has already become clear that China isn't welcoming Nvidia back with open arms, instead urging tech companies to avoid buying U.S. companies' chips, according to a Bloomberg report.
""We're hearing that this is a hard mandate, and that [authorities are actually] stopping additional orders of H20s for some companies,"" Qingyuan Lin, a senior analyst covering China semiconductors at Bernstein, told CNBC.
In a separate report, The Information said regulators in China have ordered major tech companies, including ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent, to suspend Nvidia chip purchases until a national security review is complete.

Berkshire’s latest Form 13-F, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, was made public Thursday after markets closed. It revealed a handful of new companies Berkshire has invested in, including stakes it sought to keep confidential earlier this year.

In Full Form
Berkshire’s 10Q filings this year suggested the holdings giant had added a sizable stake or stakes to its “commercial, industrial and other” investment categories. But Buffett’s firm also requested to keep at least one first-quarter investment confidential: This is a common strategy when building up stakes, one Buffett used in the past to accumulate holdings in Chubb, Chevron and Verizon. But when you’re the most famous investor on earth, even your quietest maneuvers garner Super Bowl-level viewership on trading floors, not to mention the sort of speculative guessing that comes in advance of the big game.
Given Buffett’s well-known investment philosophy, in which companies with reliable cash flows and a deep moat are king, speculative guesses ranged from defense contractor Lockheed Martin to construction equipment-maker Caterpillar and shipping giant United Parcel Service. Berkshire went in another direction and dropped a second-quarter surprise to boot:
-
The mystery stocks that Berkshire started accumulating in the first quarter were homebuilders Lennar and DR Horton, as well as Nucor, America’s biggest steelmaker. That suggests, in particular, that Berkshire is going long on housing. Interest-rate cuts are coming, after all, aren’t they? Aren’t they?
-
The big surprise, however, was a brand new, $1.6 billion stake in UnitedHealth, accumulated entirely during the second quarter. Berkshire steps in as the healthcare and insurance giant is reeling from soaring medical costs, facing a federal criminal fraud probe, and is warning its profits will drag for quarters to come.
Other companies Berkshire added in the second quarter were home security firm Allegion and billboard and outdoor advertising operator Lamar. It also pared its holdings in Bank of America and made further cuts to its remaining Apple shares, while divesting from T-Mobile, continuing a trend of moving money out of tech and financials.
Doubling Up: What Berkshire might see in UNH is value: The world’s largest healthcare company by revenue, it pays dividends (a quality shared by more than half the stocks Berkshire owns), and its shares have tumbled 46% this year. A turnaround would net a tidy sum, while the $1.6 billion position is but a fraction of Berkshire’s $300 billion portfolio, limiting risk. Of note, Scion, the investment firm of Big Short investor Michael Burry, also disclosed a new position in UNH on Thursday, meaning two “oracle” investors are making the same bet.

Key Points
-
Shopify is growing quickly as it expands its commerce tools around the globe.
-
It keeps adding new tools for customers, such as cryptocurrency payments and artificial intelligence (AI).
-
Even though the business is great, the stock trades at an expensive valuation.
Shopify (NASDAQ: SHOP) is still in the middle of its 2021 hangover, as shares are down 15% from all-time highs set during the COVID-19 pandemic stock market bubble. The stock is up over 100% in the last 12 months, but still has not eclipsed previous highs after going through a brutal drawdown in 2022. At the same time, business performance has been rock-solid if not stellar, as management keeps adding new commerce tools and attracting new businesses to join the platform.
With Shopify stock still down from all-time highs, should you buy shares in 2025 for your portfolio? Here's what the numbers say.
Steady global expansion
As a software and payments provider for online businesses, Shopify has grown to dominate the North American market. Now, it is moving internationally.
Last quarter, growth in payments volume for its European division was 42%, outpacing overall growth. The company has built up a best-in-class set of tools for entrepreneurs and businesses of all sizes to sell and process payments online. Last quarter, even Starbucks signed a deal with Shopify, which shows the capabilities of the platform for online shopping.
Overall revenue grew 31% year over year in the quarter, with strong growth expected for the rest of the year. Profit margins remain strong, with free cash flow margins of 16% in the quarter. This combination of growth and profitability is impressive and the key reason why Shopify's stock has soared in the last 12 months.
As more and more businesses sign up for Shopify's software tools and payment processing, the more growth Shopify will achieve. Add new features such as advertising and the Shop Pay application for consumers, and it looks like growth will continue for many years into the future.
AI, crypto, and new products
Shopify is embracing new technologies as a way to leverage more usage from its business customers. It now has two artificial intelligence (AI) services called Sidekick and Magic that help analyze trends for a business, create content, and marketing products. Providing more value for enterprises will help customers stay entrenched within the Shopify ecosystem, leading to revenue growth and pricing power.
What's more, Shopify is now beginning to expand and accept more forms of payment, such as Circle's stablecoin USDC. This should help with cross-border transactions and make it easier for shoppers who want to pay in different ways on Shopify's e-commerce storefronts. It will not only help drive new payment growth (which directly translates to revenue for Shopify), but also adoption of shopping across borders.",6b6c8e62611b666fccf458f631564318,trafilatura,2981,0

When Nicolas Kopp led German digital bank N26's U.S. operations, he learned that world-class finance teams were often slowed by outdated systems, forcing them to wait weeks for critical metrics despite working at high speed. That frustration planted the seed for Rillet, an AI-native enterprise resource planning platform built by accountants to modernize how companies handle their books.
Now, Rillet said it secured $70 million in Series B funding co-led by Andreessen Horowitz and ICONIQ, bringing total funding to over $100 million in less than a year.

After soaring in price during the summer, XRP is once again trading for $3.
-
Several key growth catalysts for XRP appear to already be priced in.
-
While XRP still has strong upside potential, concerns are mounting over the gap between hype and reality.
The huge summer rally for XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) could be coming to an end soon. On June 21, XRP was trading for just $2. Just 30 days later, it hit a 52-week high of $3.65. Since then, however, it has pulled back to the $3 level.
Typically, this would be a buy-the-dip opportunity for XRP investors. But a number of warning signals are now flashing red, and investors are understandably concerned.
What's priced into XRP right now?
In many ways, crypto prices are similar to stock prices. They should reflect investor expectations, based on all publicly available data. Right now, it looks like the market has already priced in many of the growth catalysts that were supposed to send XRP higher this year.
For example, consider the recent settlement of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) case involving Ripple, the company behind the XRP token. The final settlement of the case took place on Aug. 7. Since then, the price of XRP has slipped. On Aug. 7, the price of XRP was $3.30. Today, it is $3.08 (as of Aug. 14).
So it is safe to say that the SEC legal settlement has already been priced in. The market has known about it for a long time -- ever since the U.S. presidential election, in fact. That's because the election of the pro-crypto Trump administration was widely viewed as a clear signal that many of the legal and regulatory issues that dogged the crypto industry (and Ripple specifically) would soon be resolved.
The arrival of new XRP spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is also likely priced in. Right now, Bloomberg gives these spot XRP ETFs a 95% chance of approval. Ever since January, there has been constant debate about their potential effect on the price of XRP. So, again, it's safe to say that approval of these ETFs has already been priced in. When they're finally approved, most likely sometime between now and October, don't expect a big bump in XRP's price.
What's not priced into XRP right now?
Things get interesting when you start to consider what has not been priced into XRP. The market, for example, seems to be finally coming to grips with just how comcentrated ownership of XRP really is. According to some estimates, just 20 XRP blockchain wallets hold 50% of all XRP in circulation.
Thus, when one of these big wallets decides to sell XRP on the market, it can have a very big effect on XRP's price. This is exactly what happened in mid-July, when a top Ripple insider dumped 50 million XRP worth a combined $175 million. So the new concern is that this pattern of profit-taking might hold back any future gains for XRP. Any time XRP nears a new all-time high, insiders might sell to lock in their gains.",b79c17557289ff2bd632c962e60bd383,trafilatura,2915,0

Robinhood has been soaring during the past year due to strong financial results.
-
The company has a growing list of products and an expanding ecosystem.
-
Valuation is a concern, but Robinhood could still beat the market over the long run.
Cathie Wood is a famous name on Wall Street and the chief executive officerof Ark Invest, an investment management firm with a particular focus on disruptive innovation. One company that Wood and her team have been bullish on for a while is Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ: HOOD), a stock trading app. Ark Invest first bought shares of Robinhood in 2021, and although it faced significant volatility at the time, things have improved significantly since then. Robinhood's shares have skyrocketed by almost 500% during the past year, but there might still be plenty of upside left for long-term investors. Here's what investors need to know.
Why Robinhood is flying high
While Robinhood's performance during the past year might seem surprising -- and perhaps unwarranted -- it's important to point out that the company faced some challenges back in 2021 for its role in the meme stock phenomenon. Many critics argued that the company's gamified trading platform made it easy for inexperienced investors to engage in high-risk trades. Robinhood also had to deal with a regulatory probe regarding some of its practices. On top of all that, Robinhood still wasn't profitable. All that has changed.
During the past few years, Robinhood has established itself as a serious financial services provider. Consider the company's second quarter update. Robinhood's revenue increased by 45% year over year to $989 million. Most of Robinhood's key metrics moved in the right direction during the period, including total platform assets, net deposits, and subscribers to the company's Gold premium option, as well as average revenue per user. And on the bottom line, Robinhood's net income more than doubled to $386 million. Robinhood has been routinely posting results of this kind during the past few quarters. That's why the stock has soared as much as it has.
Think long-term
Following its success over the past year, Robinhood's shares appear expensive, to say the least. The company's forward price-to-earnings ratio is well above the average for financial stocks of 16.3, while its forward price-to-sales ratio is significantly higher than the undervalued range of 2 and below.
Can the stock still have some upside at these levels? In my view, there is a good chance of a pullback. However, for those willing to hold onto the stock for more than five years, there could still be significant upside. First, high-growth companies often command steep premiums, especially when they are profitable, as is the case with Robinhood. Second, Robinhood's long-term prospects appear attractive. One key reason Robinhood's outlook is bright is its popularity among younger generations.",e985218019b2fc77068fc106284a422c,trafilatura,2915,0

-
Steven Wang, the 23-year-old CEO of Dub, a copy-trading platform, has been an investor almost all his life. Fueled by get-rich-quick aspirations, Wang told Fortune he’s seen how viral moments like rare meme-stock success stories have inflated his peers’ investment expectations and diminished their risk considerations. He hopes to change this.
When Steven Wang was in second grade, he convinced his parents to open a custodial stock account. Now 23 years old, he’s running Dub, a copy-trading platform aimed at solving the financial literacy gap among his peers.
A recent Harris Poll survey commissioned by Dub highlights the contradiction: While 60% of Gen Z and 66% of millennials are investing in the stock market outside of their 401(k)s, just 17% of Americans feel “very confident” in their understanding of how markets actually work. Most believe investing, rather than a traditional nine-to-five career, offers the fastest path to wealth—a dream increasingly shaped by viral TikTok finance videos or meme-stock success stories rather than grounded investment knowledge, Wang told Fortune.
Copy trading, the concept underpinning Dub, allows everyday investors to automatically replicate the trades of more skilled market participants in real time. Instead of picking their own stocks, users can select vetted traders, hedge fund veterans, and other experienced investors to follow. Whenever those investors make a move, the same trade is executed in the user’s account, mirroring strategies and outcomes.
“The ultrawealthy are already betting on smart people to deploy their capital,” Wang told Fortune. “We’re bringing that experience to regular Americans.”
Wang grew up 20 minutes outside Detroit, the child of poor Asian immigrants who both worked in the auto industry. He watched the city’s decline after the Great Financial Crisis and the auto industry’s blows to blue-collar families, an experience that shaped his desire to build a more stable financial future for himself.
A self-described “hustler,” Wang sold Pokémon cards on the playground and flipped Air Jordans in grade school. Growing up, he nerded out on Warren Buffett books and Howard Marks memos, fueled by a self-professed “childish” vision to get rich through stock market investments.
“I really learned the hard way,” Wang said. “I’m competing against hundreds of thousands of people on Wall Street trading for a living…[who] have decades of investing experience over me.”
By the pandemic, he was day-trading from his Harvard dorm room—watching waves of new investors enter the market and lose big to “hype, misinformation, and bad timing.” Wang said that’s when he decided the tools of professional investors should be accessible to everyone.",aa36a98f8694ea1191e2104505928720,trafilatura,2875,0

Ramsey hosts respond
When Ami drove her newly purchased used car off the lot, she thought she was set. Instead, she ended up with a blown engine, a $30,000 loan and a $6,000 warranty that won’t pay up — and now she’s fighting to keep her life from stalling out.
When everything went south, the Tampa resident took it to a mechanic. She was shocked to discover that the warranty company wouldn’t cover repairs to the engine.

Want an extra $1,300,000 when you retire? Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it
“They’re trying to get out of it,” said Ami.
Instead, the company told her she’d have to pay for the teardown to determine the cause of the problem — an out-of-pocket expense she can’t afford.
“Basically, I have no car and I’m stuck with this,” Ami said.
After going back and forth with the dealership and warranty company, she ran out of ideas and turned to The Ramsey Show for advice.
Exploding engine? Not covered by her car warranty
“Does it not cover exploding engines?” asked co-hot John Delony.
The details matter when it comes to car warranties. Depending on the fine print, Ami might have to cover the teardown costs before the warranty pays for certain repairs.
“That is insane,” fellow co-host George Kamel said. “I’ve never heard where you have to pay and then maybe the warranty company will reimburse you later.”
It’s rare for a warranty to cover everything that could go wrong with your vehicle. But many do cover engine problems.
Since Ami paid $6,000 for an extended warranty, you’d think it would. But she may have overpaid. The average extended warranty costs about $1,300 a year, according to MarketWatch. Unless hers lasted at least four and a half years, she paid more than most.
“If you bought that warranty through that dealer, then there may be some liability on their part, that they’re pushing a bad product on you,” Delony said.
A key detail: Ami signed an as-is agreement when purchasing the car. Essentially, this legalese means that she purchased the car in its existing condition.
She’s not alone. Other customers of the same dealership have complained about similar warranty issues. The Better Business Bureau’s shows mixed reviews for the business, but many complaints share the same story. In its responses, the dealership often points to the as-is agreement, saying it doesn’t owe help to customers — even those who bought extended warranties.",27a2e2f421bb065afd59718eb1f982af,trafilatura,2871,0

In the face of a nearly 4% price drop in the past week, Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) investors have demonstrated unwavering interest, pouring over 15 billion DOGE, or approximately $3.42 billion, into the derivatives market in the last 24 hours.
What Happened: A significant open interest in Dogecoin, pointing to a bullish sentiment among investors. Open interest is a measure of the total value of outstanding active futures contracts that investors have committed to Dogecoin.
Data from CoinGlass shows that Gate investors were at the forefront, with a total open interest of 3.29 billion DOGE, valued at $750.20 million.
This accounts for 21.92% of the total open interest. Binance was a close second with 20.13%, as investors committed 3.03 billion DOGE worth approximately $688.92 million.
Bybit, OKX, and Bitget rounded out the top five, with respective commitments of 2.05 billion DOGE, 1.71 billion DOGE, and 1.58 billion DOGE. These commitments are valued at $467.01 million, $388.56 million, and $358.71 million in fiat currency.
Also Read: Dogecoin Set To Soar 2,600% and Hit $1 Trillion Market Cap, Says This Crypto Analyst
Alongside the rise in open interest, there has been an increase in whale activity, with a large holder transferring 400 million DOGE from Robinhood, indicating potential accumulation moves in anticipation of a bullish rally.
Despite the recent dip in price, the open interest figures ignite hopes for a potential recovery. Should Dogecoin bounce back, market participants are likely to set their sights on the $0.30 price level, as previously hinted by its technical indicator.
Why It Matters: The surge in open interest and whale activity in Dogecoin, despite its recent price decline, indicates a strong belief among investors in the cryptocurrency’s potential for recovery.
This bullish sentiment, coupled with the significant amount of capital committed to the derivatives market, suggests that investors are positioning themselves for a potential rally in the near future.
The movement of a large amount of DOGE from Robinhood further fuels this speculation, hinting at possible accumulation moves in anticipation of a price surge.

Dive Brief:
-
Lyft co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer have stepped down from the company’s board of directors effective Aug. 14, the ride-hailing company announced in a press release.
-
Green and Zimmer will also convert all of their shares of Lyft Class B common stock to Lyft Class A common stock on Aug. 15. The two co-founders will collectively own 9.69 million shares of Class A stock once the transaction is complete. The move was part of a two-year transition plan, according to the release.
-
“Logan and John had the courage to do something monumental when they started Lyft,” said CEO David Risher, in a statement. “Today, they are taking another bold step by entrusting our team to continue their legacy and propel Lyft forward.”
Dive Insight:
With the co-founders departing, Sean Aggarwal, a Lyft board member since 2016, was elected to serve as the company’s board chair. Aggarwal previously served as Lyft’s board chair from 2019 to 2023 and was appointed lead independent director in 2023.
Aggarwal was former CFO of real estate company Trulia, which Zillow acquired for $2.5 billion in 2015.
Lyft’s board will be reduced to seven members, six of which are independent.
Lyft announced in March 2023 that Green and Zimmer would transition into non-executive roles as chair and vice chair of the Lyft board. Following the announcement, Risher was named as new CEO on April 17, 2023.
By cashing out their Class B shares, Green and Zimmer have effectively given up their enhanced voting rights and control of the company’s future direction. The Class B shares they once held gave the two executives ""super-voting"" power of 20 votes per share. This dual-class structure gave them significant influence on any business decisions requiring stockholder approval.
Following the conversion, all holders of Lyft common stock will hold Class A common stock with equal voting rights, per the release.
Green and Zimmer launched Lyft in 2012 as a peer-to-peer marketplace for on-demand ride-sharing, according to its S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company, which is headquartered in San Francisco, has since grown into a global mobility platform that includes electric scooters and e-bikes.
Lyft launched its IPO on March 28, 2019, at $72 a share to raise capital and scale its operations. Its shares are listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol “LYFT.”
But the company has struggled to remain profitable in a highly competitive ride-share market that now includes the addition of autonomous vehicles by two of Lyft’s two biggest rivals, Uber and Waymo. Although Lyft’s stock price is up 14.5% since Jan. 1, its shares have lost 80% of their value since the IPO.",ca0991ee0e5574279a2152d4d9563ef9,trafilatura,2840,0

Expanded Child Tax Credit
One of the standout features of the bill is the expanded child tax credit, which Orman highlights as a vital lifeline for parents raising children under 17.
""Right now, the child tax credit gives you up to $2,200 per child,"" she explains. Even if you owe no taxes, up to $1,700 of that amount is refundable — meaning if your tax bill is zero, the IRS will still send you a check for that portion, rather than just reducing what you owe.
The credit phases out for higher earners — starting at $200,000 modified adjusted gross income for singles and $400,000 for married couples filing jointly. Importantly, the child must be a U.S. citizen living with you for more than half the year.
""Do not leave money on the table,"" Orman advises, encouraging parents to claim this benefit if eligible.

Up to $10,000 Deductible on Personal Car Loans
Another notable perk is the new deduction for interest on personal auto loans. ""You can now deduct up to $10,000 per year in interest on a personal auto loan as long as – there's always a catch, isn't there — the car is assembled in the United States,"" Suze notes.
This deduction applies only if the loan is in your name and the vehicle isn't leased or used for business purposes.
This benefit is good through 2028, giving car buyers a significant tax break if they finance a qualifying vehicle. Orman cautions, ""Just ask, does this car qualify or not,"" to make sure you're taking advantage of this opportunity.
Tax-Free Tips: Up to $25,000 Exempt From Federal Income Tax
For workers relying on tips, such as servers or hairdressers, the bill offers a new exemption on tip income. Up to $25,000 in tips can now be excluded from federal income taxes annually. Orman calls this ""one of the biggest tax breaks you're gonna ever see,"" but stresses the importance of accurate record-keeping.",38a6c4acb22de4ace64f14bede6bee08,trafilatura,2820,0

Bitcoin changed hands around $118,000 on Thursday, a 2.9% decrease over the past day, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Ethereum also fell 2.9% to $4,560, while Solana and XRP dropped 2.4% to $194 and 5.7% to $3.07, respectively.
The PPI report snapped a strong trading week for Bitcoin, with the asset’s price setting a new all-time high above $124,000 on Wednesday, while Ethereum surged toward record levels.
The Producer Price Index (PPI), which tracks price changes across a broad range of goods and services for producers, jumped 0.9% in July, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Thursday. Economists expected the index to rise 0.2% on a monthly basis.
Representing the largest monthly increase since May 2022, Thursday’s hotter-than-expected PPI reading showed an increase in the index's trade component, a worrying sign for the Federal Reserve, according to Liz Thomas, head of investment strategy at personal finance firm SoFi.
“The Fed will not like this report,” she said on X.
The central bank has held interest rates steady so far this year, fearing that U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs could make it harder to achieve its 2% inflation goal. As some officials have pointed to signs of fragility in the labor market recently, however, traders have grown increasingly confident that the Fed will cut rates at the conclusion of its September meeting.
US Will Not Be Purchasing Any Bitcoin, Treasury Secretary Bessent Says
Traders took a slight step back on Thursday, penciling in a 92.8% chance of a quarter-percentage-point rate cut at the conclusion of the Fed’s next meeting compared to a 94.3% a day before, according to CME FedWatch.
Citing large downward revisions for employment figures for May and June, Bessent advocated for a 50-basis-point rate cut on Tuesday. The odds of a jumbo-sized rate cut in September evaporated on Thursday, falling to 0.0% from 5.7% a day before.
Although Bessent’s comments may have worked in Bitcoin’s favor earlier this week, with risk assets like stocks and crypto historically benefiting from lower interest rates, his latest comments appeared to dampen enthusiasm towards the coin on Thursday.
The official said that the government is “not going to be buying” Bitcoin to supplement its existing holdings of confiscated assets. Previously, the White House had teased purchasing Bitcoin to add to the nation’s stockpile in a budget-neutral way.
“We are going to use confiscated assets and continue to build that up,” Bessent said of the Bitcoin reserve. “We’re going to stop selling that.”",ca2306aca23386ef005c0f5e12042e22,trafilatura,2809,0

Berkshire Hathaway bought around 5 million shares of UnitedHealth last quarter, according to a regulatory filing. The stake was valued at about $1.57 billion.
Buffett plans to retire as CEO at the end of the year after six decades of building Berkshire Hathaway. Many investors comb through Berkshire’s filings every quarter because they like to follow Buffett’s moves.
The filing doesn’t make clear who at Berkshire handled the investment. Besides Buffett, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs also pick stocks, but they generally handle smaller portfolios and Combs also serves as Geico’s CEO.
Besides stocks, Berkshire owns dozens of companies in a variety of industries including Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an assortment of manufacturing and retail companies. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company’s holdings include many well-known brands like See’s Candy and Dairy Queen.
UnitedHealth has been dealing with a series of difficulties. Last month the company said that it was cooperating with federal criminal and civil investigations involving its market-leading Medicare business.
The health care giant said at the time that it had contacted the Department of Justice after reviewing media reports about investigations into certain elements of its business.
Earlier this year, The Wall Street Journal said federal officials had launched a civil fraud investigation into how the company records diagnoses that lead to extra payments for its Medicare Advantage, or MA, plans. Those are privately run versions of the government’s Medicare coverage program mostly for people ages 65 and over.
The company’s UnitedHealthcare business covers more than 8 million people as the nation’s largest provider of Medicare Advantage plans. The business has been under pressure in recent quarters due to rising care use and rate cuts.
The Journal said in February, citing anonymous sources, that the probe focused on billing practices in recent months.
The paper has since said that a federal criminal health care-fraud unit was investigating how the company used doctors and nurses to gather diagnoses that bolster payments.
UnitedHealth Group Inc. runs one of the nation’s largest health insurance and pharmacy benefits management businesses. It also operates a growing Optum business that provides care and technology support.
UnitedHealth's stock has mostly shed value since December, when UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was fatally shot in midtown Manhattan on his way to the company’s annual investor meeting. A suspect, Luigi Mangione, has been charged in connection with the shooting.",57ac85c8eff6fdab7df1eea284bd54ea,trafilatura,2809,0

The New York brokerage and investment bank was run for three decades by US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a key figure in the nation’s trade policy, and is now led by his son Brandon. The younger Lutnick was asked in a letter from Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden released Thursday to disclose transactions or agreements the firm has made relating to products that would let institutions effectively bet on the legality of President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

Cantor received a client inquiry about possibly facilitating such trades, which are done by larger Wall Street banks, and some staff discussed with potential clients about arranging them before the idea was rejected, said the people, who requested anonymity to describe internal deliberations. The firm takes no directional position on brokered trades, and only takes commission when it matches a buyer and a seller.
“We have not facilitated or executed any trades in that market,” Cantor spokesperson Erica Chase told Bloomberg by phone.
Warren and Wyden had cited a late July report by Wired that alleged the financial services company created a “litigation finance” product that brokers bets that the courts will strike down the tariffs. In theory, such trades would connect a company vulnerable to US tariffs with a fund willing to bet that such tariffs might be reversed.
“Public reporting indicates that Cantor has offered companies the opportunity to trade their legal claim to a future tariff refund in exchange for 20 to 30% of the duties the company paid,” the letter said. “In this scenario, if the courts determine that the tariffs are illegal, the company stands to recover hundreds of millions of dollars.”
In reference to the cited story from July, Chase, the Cantor spokesperson, said “what is being reported about our business is absolutely false.”
Cantor’s dealings have been a key area of focus for ethics watchdogs who are on alert for conflicts of interest, given Lutnick is a prominent figure in shaping Trump’s policies and other potentially market-moving matters. Brandon Lutnick has said he wants the firm “to be sitting at the heart of crypto,” an industry that has boomed under the current administration.",ddc4b1e7e6482108a36056dbecdebac6,trafilatura,2805,0

-
Producer Price Index (PPI) inflation in July was much higher than economists had anticipated.
-
Accelerating PPI inflation could cause the Federal Reserve to take a far more cautious approach to cutting interest rates this year.
-
The outlook on interest-rate policy is one of the most important performance drivers for Dogecoin's token price right now.
Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) is getting hit with bearish pressures Thursday. The meme coin's token price was down 8.4% over the previous 24 hours of trading as of 4 p.m. ET. Over the same period, Bitcoin was down 3.8%, and Ethereum was down 4%.
Dogecoin's valuation is slipping today after the Bureau of Labor Statistics published its Producer Price Index (PPI) report for July. The report showed PPI inflation came in at 3.7% last month -- up 0.9% from June's level. July's PPI inflation came in far higher than the broadly forecasted 3% level for the period, and the cryptocurrency market is seeing sell-offs in response.
Inflation data is dragging Dogecoin lower
After July's jobs report arrived with much weaker-than-anticipated growth and huge downward revisions for estimated jobs added in May and June, it seemed virtually certain that the Federal Reserve would issue a rate cut at its meeting next month in order to stimulate activity in the economy. Following today's PPI report, the broader outlook on the interest rate front has become a lot more complicated.
The July uptick in sequential PPI inflation represented the highest increase since 2022, and investors are worried that the data could cause the Fed to hold off on cutting rates at its September meeting. The anticipation of rate cuts have been central to rallies for Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies in recent months, and investors are reducing exposure to the space today in response to the shifting outlook on interest rates.
What's next for Dogecoin?
While investors and analysts still think it's likely that the Fed will cut rates next month, the PPI data published by the BLS today could play a significant role in shaping the interest rate schedule. The report suggests that the inflationary impacts of new tariffs are still working their way through the economy. Along those lines, consumer prices could see accelerated increases in the near term -- or companies could wind up seeing significantly reduced margins on sales.
If key inflation data continues to come in at higher-than-expected levels, the Fed may bring rates down by a relatively small amount this year, or continue to take a wait-and-see approach. While interest rate policy won't change anything about Dogecoin's fundamentals, it does play a huge role in shaping investors' appetite for speculative investments -- so it's one of the most important performance drivers for the coin right now.",a946e84a2d7bc5d4a7850b62cc5b89d7,trafilatura,2800,0

Crypto company initial public offerings are coming hard and fast right now.
On Wednesday, Peter Thiel-backed crypto exchange Bullish made its market debut by securing $1.1 billion after the stock surged 228% to $118, giving it a $10 billion market cap on the first day of trading.
It joined other crypto companies, including Galaxy Digital and Circle, that have gone public this year.
The IPO made up the bulk of the $1.2 billion raised by crypto companies since August 8, according to DefiLlama. That brings the total raised by industry players in 2025 to $14.4 billion, 51% more than they did in 2024.
And more could come, partially thanks to successful IPOs like Bullish’s.
“Having seen these public IPOs or acquisitions at higher valuations, people now have the proof points to invest with a level of confidence in early-stage, real-world blockchain companies that they may not otherwise have had in the past,” Michael Martin, director at Ava Labs’ incubator Codebase, told DL News earlier in August.
Martin and other investors have said that they expect the industry to raise $25 billion in 2025.
The wave of public listings comes amid growing optimism in the crypto industry.
They have reason to be hopeful.
This year has seen Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies hit new records, the Trump administration push through new crypto-friendly regulations, and Wall Street embrace blockchain-based projects like never before.
In short, the market conditions couldn’t be better for crypto companies to go public.
Investors have an incentive for them to go public, as it would enable the backers to cash in on their investments.
“Many VCs and private equity firms have held these positions for years,” Kat Liu, vice president at IPO research firm IPOX, told Reuters.
And it’s not just crypto companies that are going public. There have been over 200 IPOs on US exchanges so far this year, according to StockAnalysis data.
Here’s a small sample of crypto companies that have either announced or are reported to go public in the near future.
Gemini
In June, the Winklevii finally filed to go public.
Gemini, the crypto exchange run by Bitcoin billionaires Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, announced on June 6 that it had confidentially filed to go public with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It’s one of the initial steps many companies take before they go public.
So far, the details of the IPO — the when and for how much — remain non-public.
Still, the announcement capped years of hints that Gemini would go public, stretching as far back as 2021.
BitGo
In July, BitGo, one of the industry’s largest crypto custodians, said it planned to go public in the US in a filing with regulators.",8ae404a2d769df2643a3ac6e38626875,trafilatura,2796,0

The second quarter was a tough period for some of America's favorite office lunch spots.
Cava (CAVA) stock fell 16% on Wednesday after the company reported a larger-than-expected growth slowdown in the second quarter. Peers like Sweetgreen (SG) and Chipotle (CMG) both reported a second straight quarter of same-store sales declines in Q2 as demand for the trusty lunch bowls of choice for America's white-collar workforce waned.
""We do see what I would classify as a macroeconomic fog around the consumer that they're trying to navigate through, and that has the consumer less front-footed, less ebullient, less forward-leaning than they were, say, this time last year,"" Cava CEO Brett Schulman told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday.
Same-store sales at Cava rose 2.1% in the second quarter, a deceleration from the double-digit growth in each of the prior three quarters. Analysts expected the company to post same-store sales closer to 6%.
At Chipotle, same-store sales fell 4% in the second quarter, a larger drop than the 2.3% fall seen in the year's first quarter.
CEO Scott Boatwright told investors it was due to ""ongoing volatility in our trends in the consumer environment,"" which prompted the company to cut its full-year same-store sales forecast.
Sweetgreen posted the steepest decline among the three, with same-store sales falling 7.6% in the quarter.
Co-founder and CEO Jonathan Neman said it was ""pretty obvious that the consumer is not in a great place overall"" on a call with investors.
The ""pressure on consumer spending for many of our consumers has persisted longer than we expected,"" he added. Shares of the salad chain fell more than 20% on the news.
Shares of Chipotle are down more than 25% this year, while Cava stock has lost over 35%. Sweetgreen stock has fallen nearly 70%.
A challenge for these chains, in part, is lapping a strong 2024.
""The backdrop of the restaurant environment has not changed that dramatically since last year,"" Bank of America analyst Sara Senatore said, noting these fast-casual players ""can't take massive share every year.""
At Cava, Schulman said the current quarter has shown signs of a pickup in sales and that the company is ""encouraged by what we're seeing in the exit rate of the quarter.""
Still, all three brands are considering a mix of more carefully curated menus and emphasizing value in an effort to win back sales at a time when consumers seem keen to scrutinize their budgets more closely.
Cava, for instance, is introducing chicken shawarma in September and cinnamon sugar pita chips later on this year, and is testing salmon. Sweetgreen announced plans to stop selling the ripple fries it rolled out just five months ago.",213d3dc32c3addefa4091d4f00c395c3,trafilatura,2796,0

But he's not convinced that the recent Ethereum surge will continue.
The BTC prediction comes as crypto markets flirt with record highs and institutional investors pile into exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $124,128 on Wednesday.
“There’s a greater than 50% chance that Bitcoin goes to the $140,000 to $150,000 range this year before we see another bear market next year,” McClurg said in a Friday interview with CNBC.
McClurg attributed the rally to rising demand from ETFs and an expanding base of institutional buyers, including sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporate treasuries.
“These inflows are creating a higher price in Bitcoin,” he said.
The forecast comes as Canary Capital has filed ETF applications tied to several altcoins, including XRP, Sui, Cronus (CRO), Hedera (HBAR), and President Trump’s official meme coin on Solana.
The firm has not filed an ETF application related to Ethereum, which McClurg criticized as an outdated network—though ETH has been the biggest gainer in recent weeks among major cryptocurrencies, nearing an all-time high on Thursday before cooling off alongside the broader market.
“I’m not a big fan of Ethereum, only because it is an older technology,” he said. “There’s a lot of other protocols that are faster, cheaper to transact, and fundamentally more secure.”
What's Driving Ethereum's Surge—And Can It Last?
McClurg credited Ethereum with “a great run over about a five-year period,” but said newer blockchains like Solana and Sui have eclipsed it. “I do expect it to wane and not see all-time highs,” he added.
One analyst that Decrypt spoke with questioned McClurg’s skepticism toward Ethereum.
“Ethereum will be extremely hard to compete with despite what some call ‘older tech,’ because Ethereum owns the developer ecosystem,” Amberdata Director of Derivatives Greg Magadini told Decrypt. “It’s like the iPhone platform that enables developers to build apps directly on its infrastructure. Those network effects only compound over time.”
Magadini predicts Ethereum will catch up to Bitcoin on a relative basis, with ETH/BTC reaching 7%—implying an ETH price between $8,000 and $10,000.
Despite this, Magadini agreed that Bitcoin could exceed $150,000 in 2025, driven by inflation hedging and investor appetite for risk.
“Given the combination of an equity market rally and political pressure on the Fed to cut rates while inflation remains high, we have the perfect context for higher Bitcoin prices,” he said. “Bitcoin moves like a mix of digital gold and a risk-on asset—and right now, both those sentiments are helping prices move higher.”",dea969b0431a7cedf54b273cff72ed36,trafilatura,2796,0

Crude Oil Falls on Bearish Weekly Inventory Report and IEA Oil Surplus Forecast
Thursday's weekly EIA nat gas inventory report of +56 bcf was slightly bearish compared with the consensus of +54 bcf.
Nat-gas prices continue to be undercut by forecasts for cooler US temps and Tuesday's EIA forecast of higher US gas production. Atmospheric G2 said Thursday that forecasts shifted slightly cooler across the upper Midwest and Northeast for Aug 14-18.
Nat-gas prices were undercut Tuesday when the EIA raised its forecast for 2025 US nat-gas production by +0.5% to 106.44 bcf/day from July's estimate of 105.9 bcf/day. The EIA raised its forecast for 2026 US nat-gas production by +0.7% to 106.09 from July's 105.4 bcf/day forecast. US nat-gas production is currently near a record high, with active US nat-gas rigs recently posting a 2-year high.
US (lower-48) dry gas production on Thursday was 109.4 bcf/day (+6.7% y/y), according to BNEF. Lower-48 state gas demand on Thursday was 81.4 bcf/day (+4.3% y/y), according to BNEF. Estimated LNG net flows to US LNG export terminals on Thursday were 15.8 bcf/day (+0.4% w/w), according to BNEF.
In a bearish factor, the Edison Electric Institute reported Wednesday that US (lower-48) electricity output in the week ended August 9 fell -1.9% y/y to 93,293 GWh (gigawatt hours), although US electricity output in the 52-week period ending August 9 rose +2.6% y/y to 4,257,529 GWh.
Thursday's weekly EIA report was slightly bearish for nat-gas prices since nat-gas inventories for the week ended August 1 rose +56 bcf, slightly above the consensus of +54 bcf and well above the 5-year weekly average of +33 bcf. As of August 8, nat-gas inventories were down -2.4% y/y, but were +6.6% above their 5-year seasonal average, signaling adequate nat-gas supplies. As of August 9, gas storage in Europe was 72% full, compared to the 5-year seasonal average of 79% full for this time of year.
Baker Hughes reported last Friday that the number of active US nat-gas drilling rigs in the week ending August 8 fell by -1 to 123 rigs, slipping from the 2-year high of 124 rigs posted on August 1. In the past ten months, the number of gas rigs has risen from the 4-year low of 94 rigs reported in September 2024.

Maybe you were planning to buy a house this year but haven’t found anything yet — and panic is starting to set in because you’re worried you’ve missed the housing market season.
It’s common you’ll find a higher number of listed properties in late spring and summer. That means, if you’re in the market for a new home, you have more options to choose from, but you also face stiffer competition.
Traditionally, fall and winter are quieter, but if you find a place you like, you may be able to get a better deal on it.

Potential homebuyers, however, may be able to take some comfort from the picture being painted by recent data that suggests this fall may be a great time to buy a new home.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty out there, and some buyers are just waiting to see what happens,” Zillow senior economist Kara Ng said in an article published July 20. “So, if you’re able to buy, fall could be a sweet spot since you won’t be competing against the pool of buyers waiting on the sidelines.”
US housing inventory at a multiyear high
One of the main reasons this fall is shaping up to be a good one for homebuyers is that, according to Zillow data, the inventory of homes for sale is the highest it’s been since July 2020, with the number of listed homes up 20% from last year.
At the same time, for the past two years, October has seen the highest inventory of the year as homes listed earlier remain unsold. Zillow anticipates this seasonal pattern will repeat this year after a “lackluster spring” during which buyers didn’t show up.
A fall with high inventory and fewer buyers means that if you’re in the market for a new home, “you’re likely to have more time to decide on your options,” Ng said. “You have time to really consider if that home is the right fit for you.”
With fewer buyers, you’re also less likely to endure a bidding war for the home you want and you may have more negotiating power.
Some sellers are lowering prices
In some markets, prices aren’t rising as quickly as they have been over the past few years.
Home values across the U.S. grew by 45.3% between February 2020 to 2025, Zillow reported earlier this year — a rate that’s more than double the historic rate of increase.",bf1a0f291e0bf708b2de754cbcc988b8,trafilatura,2786,0

The White House had played down the talks — initially seen as an attempt at securing a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine — with spokesperson Karoline Leavitt calling the summit, ""a listening exercise for the president.""
Following the Friday meeting Trump said, ""There's no deal until there's a deal.""
Ukraine was not part of the discussions, stoking concerns that a potential deal could have compromised the country's sovereignty. ""Ukraine is ready to work as productively as possible to bring the war to an end, and we count on a strong position from America … A meeting of leaders is needed – at the very least, Ukraine, America, and the Russian side,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on X prior to the summit.
This was Putin's first visit to the U.S. in about a decade, with the Russian president stressing that it was a ""hard time"" for bilateral relations. The meeting was held in Alaska, which was once Russian territory.
""There were many, many points that we agreed on … I would say a couple of big ones that we haven't quite got there, but we've made some headway,"" Trump said at a joint press conference with Putin. The leaders did not take any questions from the press.
Putin called the talks a ""starting point,"" both for the resolution of the conflict with Kyiv as well as for improving relations with Washington, which he said had ""fallen to the lowest point since the Cold War.""
Trump said Putin's observations were ""profound,"" and added that he would talk to NATO and Zelenskyy to update them about the discussions with Russia. ""It's ultimately up to them,"" he said.
""Many points were agreed to. There are just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant. One is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there,"" Trump said, without elaborating.
Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, multiple rounds of peace negotiations have taken place, but there has not been a breakthrough on ending hostilities.
In an interview with Fox News following the Friday summit, Trump asked Zelenskyy to make a deal to end the war in Ukraine. ""Gotta make a deal. Yeah. Look, Russia is a very big power, and they're not. They're great soldiers,"" he said.
Russian media outlets were upbeat Friday ahead of Putin's meeting with Trump, with the summit being seen as a win for Moscow. Commentary across Russian state news sites characterized the talks as a positive for Russia.

In Q2 2025 alone, Arrived's portfolio of vacation rentals generated more than $723,000 in gross booking revenue, all without a single investor having to worry about late checkouts or replacing broken coffee makers. And the best part? You can get started with as little as $100.
A Hands-Off Way to Earn from Vacation Rentals
Arrived's vacation rental strategy is designed to open the door to an asset class that has historically been out of reach for everyday investors. The platform currently operates vacation rentals across 26 high-demand U.S. markets, from sunny beach towns to mountain destinations that stay booked year-round. In Q2, 39 active properties fueled the impressive revenue haul, all managed by professional operators tasked with maximizing occupancy, nightly rates, and guest satisfaction.
Instead of dealing with the operational headaches of running an Airbnb or Vrbo listing, investors on Arrived own fractional shares of these properties and simply collect their portion of the returns. The average guest rating across the portfolio sits at 4.95 out of 5 stars, a level of consistency that drives repeat bookings and strong visibility on booking platforms. That kind of performance shows why short-term rentals remain a powerful income generator even in a crowded hospitality market.
Why This Matters for Investors
Short-term rentals can deliver strong income, but they're also notoriously time-consuming. Between the cleaning schedules, pricing algorithms, and constant communication with guests, many would-be hosts never actually take the leap. Arrived solves this problem by pooling investor capital to purchase and manage vacation rentals at scale. That means you're not running a business — you're collecting your share of the income while professionals do the work.
It's worth noting that the $723,000 figure is gross booking revenue, which comes before expenses like property management, cleaning, and maintenance. But even with deductions, the numbers illustrate the power of vacation rentals as part of a diversified real estate portfolio. And unlike trying to buy and operate one property on your own, investing through Arrived means you're spreading your money across multiple homes, locations, and guest bases — reducing your risk while keeping your upside.",8c8126dde357cc7e2d57d5cbb4099829,trafilatura,2771,0

As Bitcoin made a new all-time high this week, predictors are rushing to make their thoughts known about where the prices of Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Solana (SOL) are going next in this week’s top markets.
ETH to hit $5K in 2025?
Market Open: July 31
Market Close: December 31
Volume: $7.69K
Link: See the latest odds on the “ETH to hit $5K in 2025?” market on Myriad
Ethereum has been the talk of the town among cryptocurrency enthusiasts recently, jumping more than 53% in the last month and closing in on new all-time highs in the process.
The second-largest crypto asset is now trading at $4,544–just 6.6% off the all-time high price of $4,878 it set in 2021. And it got within $100 overnight before the broader crypto market cooled.
But will it create a new all-time high and jump even higher to $5,000 before the year ends?
Myriad predictors believe so, giving odds of ETH surpassing $5,000 at 82% as of Thursday. Those odds stand despite ETH rejecting a push towards the all-time high price on Wednesday, and falling back after a hotter-than-expected PPI report landed Thursday morning.
That optimism likely stems from the relentless ETF inflows and the Ethereum treasury race, which has prominent publicly traded firms like SharpLink Gaming and BitMine Immersion Technologies battling against each other to accumulate ETH at every turn.
One analyst told Decrypt on Thursday that when you combine those factors, “the result is deep structural demand meeting finite supply.” Enough demand for a push to $5K before 2025 ends? Time will tell.
What’s Next? The next major catalyst for crypto prices could be the Federal Reserve’s September actions and potential rate cut.
XRP’s next hit: Moon to $4 or dip to $2?

Ripple-linked cryptocurrency XRP reached a new all-time high price in July, but has since slipped 16% to $3.06 as of Thursday.
That leaves it $0.94 short of the benchmark in Myriad’s market, which asks predictors whether XRP will “moon or dip” next, finding itself at $4 or $2 first.
Predictors are leaning toward $4, with 68% of users siding with the higher mark as of Thursday morning. That position has jumped nearly 18% in the last week as XPR gained ground, now sitting just around a 31% gain away from $4.00.",aad3dde3c1da99a8cc01ce1af2fca0cb,trafilatura,2760,0

The CNBC TV host believes the firm’s vast depository of user data will serve it well in today’s AI era, where firms are hungry for training data. Reddit, Inc. (NYSE:RDDT)’s shares have gained 35% year-to-date, primarily due to a 55% surge since late July. The stock rose after the firm’s second quarter revenue of $500 million and earnings per share of $0.45 beat analyst estimates of $426 million and $0.19 by a wide margin. Despite the share price gains, Cramer believes Reddit, Inc. (NYSE:RDDT) is still undervalued:

Here are his earlier comments about Reddit, Inc. (NYSE:RDDT):
“Let me start with Reddit. I use Reddit pretty aggressively. It’s a terrific product. My wife uses it to sell… her mezcal brand because Reddit has an entire mezcal forum. So I like it. The advertiser likes it. That’s where I start. I then try to find out what other people… whether they feel like I do. Rob (Rob Pace, founder and CEO of HundredX) has told me that Reddit customers are planning to increase future use because people love crowdsourced information, seems to be able to be independent… Reddit demonstrates the increasing value of human intelligence, increasing value of human intelligence, I like that. In fact, he’s betting that as the future of search evolves from finding things to figuring things out, Reddit could be a major winner. Now you take your own use as I have… You then take data from HundredX to see if your experience lines up with reality. Only then you go to the web, you look up articles, check out websites to see things like the piece we ran on Reddit a couple of days ago, which said it was great to buy. Wow, that’s been terrific. To me, that produced a terrific, really special reason to buy the stock, and I’m sticking with it. I just wish I had bought it for my Charitable Trust when I first got the hunch, but I hadn’t done the homework. Can’t jump that.”

The average rate on the most common mortgage durations reached their lowest point of 2025 this week, per data released Thursday by Freddie Mac (FMCC) .
Per the government enterprise, the 30-year mortgage rate was 6.58% (down from 6.63% last week). The less-popular 15-year mortgage came in at 5.71% (down from 6.63% last week).
These rates represent the lowest point that we've seen since Oct. 20. At this point, they are just a little higher than their historical average since 1991. And they're likely to go lower.
Why are mortgage rates falling now?
Per Fannie Mae, mortgage rates are ""determined by adding a spread to the benchmark 10-year Treasury note."" The 10-year Treasury is a common kind of government bond, which is sold and guaranteed by the U.S. government.
The aforementioned spread is a premium collected by a financial institution in exchange for the risk of lending you money. Those risks consider your background, the state of the mortgage market, and the broader economy. As a result, spreads may vary from borrower to borrower.
However, the real factor influencing America's recent mortgage rates has been the 10-year. Despite the Federal Reserve, America's central bank, cutting interest rates twice last year, the 10-year remained elevated into 2025. As of today at 1:49 p.m. ET, the 10-year stood at 4.287%. (Compare that with the Fed Funds Rate (FFR) of 4.25% to 4.50%.)
The higher yield reflects bond investors' persistent worries about inflation and the U.S. government's debt. These worries have worsened since September, when the 10-year was under 4%, reflecting investor expectations for the Fed to cut interest rates.
Only recently has optimism about rate cuts returned, due to the slowing rate of inflation and a more tepid economic environment. In September, the Fed is said to weigh a 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut, which could affect the 10-year.
Where are interest rates going from here?
The Fed is expected to entertain up to a half dozen rate cuts between now and the end of 2026, contingent on the state of economy. The central bank's 'dual-mandate' emphasizes maximizing employment, while maintaining low inflation. If either of those things are threatened, it could change the track of the Fed's cuts. And with that, the 10-year.
Lower interest rates are expected to revive the housing market, which has stagnated in the face of still-high rates and sky-high home valuations. Some right-sizing has happened in recent quarters, reflecting the weaker homebuying demand. Per data from FRED, median sales price for homes are down from an all-time high of $442,600 (in Q4 2022). In Q2 2025, median sales prices were $410,800. That's a 7.2% decline.",741459ef4054e19477027533d656c04a,trafilatura,2753,0

Shiba Inu is falling today after an inflation report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics this morning.
-
Producer Price Index (PPI) inflation in July was much higher than anticipated, and the data is hurting cryptocurrency valuations.
-
Shiba Inu's valuation could face more pressure if inflation continues to run hotter than expected.
Shiba Inu (CRYPTO: SHIB) is moving lower on Thursday. The cryptocurrency was down 7.3% over the past 24 hours of trading as of 5:15 p.m. ET -- a stretch that also saw Bitcoin fall 3.9% and Ethereum fall 4.4%.
Shiba Inu is seeing a valuation contraction today as a result of the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). PPI tracking showed inflation of 3.7% in July -- a level that came in substantially higher than the 3% range that economists had been expecting. Core PPI, which backs out the food and energy categories, increased at a 0.9% sequential monthly rate, the highest jump seen since 2022.
The latest inflation report is making investors think that the Federal Reserve could deliver fewer interest rate cuts this year than previously anticipated. And that's prompting some significant pullbacks for Shiba Inu and other cryptocurrencies.
Is Shiba Inu a buy right now?
While Shiba Inu does have some development network and metaverse projects that could help strengthen its valuation case, the cryptocurrency is still a meme coin first and foremost. Along those lines, momentum for the broader cryptocurrency space and investor appetite for risky, speculative investments are two of the biggest factors that drive its valuation moves. Interest rate policy has historically been one of the biggest catalysts in that regard, with lower rates typically being far better for the crypto market.
Investors are still betting that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its meeting next month, but a cut could come in lower than some investors are hoping, even if one does arrive. Additionally, rising inflation raises the possibility that other rate cuts may be pushed further out. With some signs that inflationary pressures caused by tariffs may be arriving after taking longer than expected to show up in the economy, investors may want to hold off on buying Shiba Inu right now and focus instead on backing cryptocurrencies and stocks with more solid fundamental valuation cases.
Should you invest $1,000 in Shiba Inu right now?
Before you buy stock in Shiba Inu, consider this:
The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Shiba Inu wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.",d9714a79268be7658a09283372cd4fce,trafilatura,2734,0

(Reuters) -Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed on Thursday a new investment in UnitedHealth Group after the insurer became a target for many Americans upset over the direction of the nation's healthcare.
Berkshire said it owned 5.04 million UnitedHealth shares worth about $1.57 billion as of June 30.
The disclosure came in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing detailing Berkshire's U.S.-listed common stock holdings as of June 30.
UnitedHealth shares soared 8.5% in after-hours trading.
Buffett's conglomerate also said it sold 20 million shares of iPhone maker Apple in the second quarter, reducing its largest stock holding to 280 million shares, and cut back another major holding, Bank of America.
Berkshire also boosted its bet on home builders, revealing a new stake in DR Horton and significantly larger stake in Lennar.
The filing also disclosed new Berkshire investments in security products provider Allegion, outdoor advertiser Lamar Advertising and steel maker Nucor
It is not clear whether Buffett, his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, or future Chief Executive Greg Abel are behind individual purchases and sales.
But stock prices often rise when Berkshire makes purchases because investors view them as a seal of approval from Buffett.
DR Horton, Lennar, Allegion, Lamar and Nucor also rose in after-hours trading.
TAPEWORM
Shares of UnitedHealth, part of the Dow Jones industrial average, had through Thursday fallen 46% this year amid rising costs, a U.S. Department of Justice probe related to its billing practices, a cyberattack, and the shooting death of former top executive Brian Thompson last December.
Buffett has called high health care costs a ""tapeworm"" that limits economic growth, and with JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon and Amazon.com's Jeff Bezos tried unsuccessfully to improve healthcare for their companies' employees.
Their joint venture, Haven, shut down after three years in 2021.
UnitedHealth did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Berkshire's investment.
The Apple sales, Berkshire's first since the third quarter of 2024, further reduced what was once a 905 million share stake, but do not signal a full-blown retreat from the stock.
Apple shares were little changed after hours.
Despite the new purchases, Berkshire sold $3 billion more stocks than it bought between April and June, the 11th straight quarter it was a net seller of stocks. It ended June with $344.1 billion of cash and equivalents.
Other changes in Thursday's filing included larger stakes in oil company Chevron, alcoholic beverages maker Constellation Brands and Domino's Pizza, and exiting a stake in wireless network operator T-Mobile.",6fab7aa7d26d13952fb1ab04e4951c80,trafilatura,2721,0

Shares closed at $30.74 each on Thursday, versus an IPO price of $23. MIAX, as the company is known, raised $345 million in a heavily oversubscribed deal that priced above the marketed range of $19 to $21 apiece. The trading gives MIAX a market value of $2.4 billion based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings.

MIAX operates nine securities and derivatives exchanges, and has a 16% market share of the US-listed options market. Options trading has exploded since the Covid-19 pandemic and the meme-stock craze of 2021. Options in the US trade on exchanges, meaning MIAX and its competitors, such as Cboe Global Markets Inc., Nasdaq Inc. and Intercontinental Exchange Inc. have benefited from the rise in retail trading.
“The retail presence since the pandemic has fueled our growth,” MIAX Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thomas Gallagher told Bloomberg in an interview from the New York Stock Exchange, where he rang the opening bell.
MIAX investors include Warburg Pincus, Citadel Securities and Susquehanna International Group. Around a third of its shares are owned by executives and directors, with a fifth of the company’s shares owned by market making firms.
Instead of dealing with retail traders directly, exchanges serve the market makers who buy retail order flow, allowing brokers like Robinhood Markets Inc. and Charles Schwab Corp. to offer free trading to small investors.
Gallagher said MIAX’s main focus was serving its market makers.
“We are laser beam focused on the experiences of the Citadel’s, the Susquehanna’s, the IMCs, the Optivers of the world, the true market makers,” he said, referring to the world’s largest options trading firms.
MIAX is planning to list futures and options on the Bloomberg 500 Index, a competitor to the S&P 500 Index. Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, offers index products for various asset classes through Bloomberg Index Services Ltd.
Last year, MIAX launched a new options exchange, known as MIAX Sapphire. MIAX is setting up a new open outcry trading floor in Miami. The company is confident that the better weather and lower taxes will be able to lure floor traders from other parts of the country.",b6f101e4db2ac3ffb098df9c93af05a5,trafilatura,2711,0

The company joins the ranks of other organizations working to bring agentic AI, which is meant to take care of specific tasks autonomously or with little human intervention, to their customers.
Agentic applications have become increasingly popular points of discussion in 2025, both for consumer-facing functions like agentic shopping and for backend business tasks like supply chain visibility and sourcing.

Alibaba noted in the announcement that Accio has particular potential for small-to-medium enterprises, which often have limited human capital to devote to sourcing activities. Still, these businesses work to maintain complex supply chains with multiple suppliers, which is both time consuming and highly manual. Alibaba developed Accio Agent in an effort to streamline some of the most time-consuming pieces of the sourcing equation for its clients.
Alibaba said it trained Accio Agent on 1 billion product listings and 50 million suppliers’ offerings and information. That, in turn, provides users with a wide breadth of options when sourcing products via the automated system. The company said its agent has the power to axe weeks’ worth of work from the sourcing process, consolidating the same tasks into minutes.
Users start by giving Accio Agent a task to research. While the query can be pointed at a specific product or category, the agent can also handle multi-faceted requests, researching various categories and suppliers simultaneously.
So, for instance, while one user might tell Accio, “Find me a supplier based in Vietnam who can make small batches of high-quality T-shirts with a six-week turnaround,” another user might tell Accio, “Find suppliers that can support a pop-up brand event in New York City. I need a supplier that can provide 150 staff T-shirts, a supplier that can quickly ship tents and coffee cups, a supplier that can produce tote bags for swag bags and items to put in the swag bags. The event will be ‘70s themed, and I need all products by October 1.”
Based on the unique task it has been given, Accio Agent pores over available suppliers, then provides a list of qualified suppliers for each subset of the task it has been given.
“Each supplier is carefully evaluated based on crucial factors, like operational history, international experience, production capacity, local market, track record and certifications,” a promotional video for Accio stated.",68ee52323b1a8f2e23e113ee3d42b1eb,trafilatura,2697,0

Retail sales in July rose 0.5% from the prior month, a rise that was slightly below Wall Street forecasts but a sign the consumer continues to steady the ship after a dramatic drop in spending this spring.
Economists had expected retail sales to rise 0.6% from the prior month in July, according to data from Bloomberg. Excluding autos and gas, retail sales rose 0.2% last month.
Friday's report marks the second straight month retail sales rose after two months of declines in May and April, with May's 0.9% heightening fears over the health of the US consumer. June's retail sales were also revised higher on Friday, with new data showing sales jumped 0.9% from the prior month, more than the 0.6% rise initially reported.
Notable sales gains in July came from home furnishings, where sales rose 1.4% last month. Non-store retailers, which capture e-commerce spending, saw sales rise 0.8% in July.
The headline gain in July's retail sales figures was still flatter in some underlying categories, suggesting consumers remain cautious.
Sales at food and drinking places fell 0.4%, a notable drop given July is one of the year's peak months for vacations. Building and garden supply stores also saw a 1% drop in sales last month, with sales for these retailers also falling 2.6% from the same month last year.
""Retail sales do not give the economy a complete bill of health, but at least the consumer is not in headlong retreat and the outlook for continued moderate economic growth this quarter is positive,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS.
Friday's data follows what's been a mixed week on the economic data front, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Tuesday showing inflation pressures for consumers remain manageable for now, while the Producer Price Index (PPI) Thursday morning suggested pressures are building for future inflation.
""Consumers maintain a moderate rate of spending and even picked up the pace in the past two months as the tariff-price pass-through has been limited thus far,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, Nationwide's chief economist.
""However, despite the improvement in consumer spending the past few months, the pace remains well below the 2.8% rate in 2024 and consumer spending. Furthermore, as more tariff-induced price increases pass through to the consumer and the labor market continues to soften, we see household spending to continue to face headwinds in the coming months.""

The U.S. Treasury secretary told Fox Business that the government would not be in the business of buying added Bitcoin for its planned strategic reserve.
-
Many crypto investors had hoped the government would go beyond holding its already seized assets.
-
The decline for Dogecoin and other more speculative cryptos was sharper than for Bitcoin or Ethereum.
The cryptocurrency Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) is moving lower today, down 7.9% in the last 24 hours as of 1:13 p.m. ET Thursday. The drop comes as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both fell slightly.
Dogecoin is falling today along with the rest of the crypto market after comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent sent Bitcoin lower.
The U.S. won't buy Bitcoin
Bessent appeared on Mornings with Maria on Fox Business, saying that the federal government has no plans to purchase more Bitcoin to add to its strategic reserve, instead relying on what has already been confiscated through law enforcement actions.
Bessent said: ""We've also started to get into the 21st century, a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. We're not going to be buying that, but we're going to use confiscated assets and continue to build that up. We're going to stop selling that.""
While the fact that the government won't be off-loading its substantial Bitcoin assets onto the market is good news for the crypto's price, investors had been speculating that the Trump administration would pursue a reserve strategy that included the purchase of more tokens. The confirmation that this wouldn't happen sent the crypto lower, along with altcoins across the market, Dogecoin included.
Dogecoin is risky
While Dogecoin has outlasted most meme coins, it remains an inflationary asset with no fundamental utility. I would steer investors interested in crypto investing toward more proven projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

From cloud computing to artificial intelligence (AI), these companies often deliver the kind of scale, recurring revenue, and innovation that Wall Street loves. One such giant is Oracle (ORCL), a software and cloud infrastructure leader that’s steadily carving out a bigger role in the AI-driven enterprise landscape.
Recently, billionaire Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management made a bold move by acquiring roughly 3.86 million shares of Oracle, worth about $843.3 million. This sizable bet signals strong confidence in Oracle’s growth trajectory, as the company expands its cloud and AI offerings to compete with industry heavyweights like Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN).

Let’s take a closer look at whether Oracle’s momentum and strategic moves make it a stock worth holding now.
About ORCL Stock
Based in Austin, Texas, Oracle is a tech company and a global leader in enterprise software and cloud solutions, steadily building its position in 2025. Its push into AI, growing cloud infrastructure, and partnerships have fueled strong demand. Oracle hit an all-time high this year, driven by major AI projects and a key cloud deal, putting it among the top cloud providers. With its powerful Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), database, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) offerings, Oracle is well-positioned for AI-driven growth.
Valued at $690 billion by market cap, Oracle has been one of the top performers in 2025, climbing about 47% year-to-date. The rally has been fueled by surging demand for cloud computing and AI services, with cloud sales posting sharp gains. Strong growth in future bookings, record annual revenue, and aggressive multi-cloud partnerships have further strengthened investor confidence.
Oracle Supercharges Cloud & AI Growth
Oracle is rapidly expanding its cloud business, which now has the biggest part of its revenue. Demand for its cloud services, like OCI (infrastructure) and SaaS (Fusion/NetSuite), is also rising thanks to partnerships with AWS, Microsoft (MSFT) Azure, and Google (GOOGL) Cloud. CEO Larry Ellison said Oracle now has dozens of OCI regions running on Azure and Google, plus a new AWS deal using its Exadata hardware. The company is also investing heavily in AI, building a huge Nvidia (NVDA) powered data center and signing $3 billion worth of new cloud-GPU contracts.",7427b2ff201cd4097bb85cefe72f0dae,trafilatura,2680,0

The two leaders did not reach a ceasefire agreement following the talks, which Trump had repeatedly emphasized in the lead-up to their meeting.
Instead, Trump wrote on social media: ""It was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up.""
Trump's comments put him at odds with officials in Ukraine and European leaders who are urgently seeking a lasting ceasefire in the ongoing war.
A joint statement from European leaders said that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was not invited to the summit, should be present during any future talks, and that ""it will be up to Ukraine to make decisions on its territory.""
Ukraine's allies in Europe also expressed concern that Trump was moving closer to Putin's position following his meeting. The lack of an immediate ceasefire allows Russia to continue its fighting in Ukraine without the threat of punishment from the United States or its allies.
""As long as the killing in Ukraine continues, we stand ready to uphold the pressure on Russia,"" according to the statement from European leaders. ""We will continue to strengthen sanctions and wider economic measures to put pressure on Russia's war economy until there is a just and lasting peace.""
Zelenskyy said he plans to meet with Trump to ""discuss all [of] the details regarding ending the killings and the war,"" according to a post on Telegram.
Trump, who said he spoke with Zelenskyy and other European leaders overnight, is poised to meet with the Ukrainian leader in the Oval Office on Monday afternoon, he said in a Truth Social post.
""If all works out, we will then schedule a meeting with President Putin,"" Trump also said.
White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said Saturday on Fox News that during the president's meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump is going to find ""that pathway for a comprehensive peace deal, working as well with our European partners in the hopes that we can forge peace.""
Putin said in a statement on Saturday that his meeting with Trump was ""very frank, meaningful and, in my opinion, this brings us closer to the necessary decisions.""
Despite the lack of a resolution, Russian officials signaled victory following the talks.
""A new European and international security architecture is on the agenda and everyone must accept it,"" Andrei Klishas, a Russian senator, said, according to the Washington Post.",b51f317618a2f755e3908a4a56542884,trafilatura,2680,0

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Global stocks were flat but still traded near record highs on Friday as U.S. President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin held high-stakes talks in Alaska over Ukraine.
U.S. Treasury bond prices fell across the board with markets anticipating a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.
The Dow hit an intra-day record high during the session, becoming the last of Wall Street's main indexes to climb to a new peak this week. The benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq dropped, dragged down mainly by technology, financials, industrials and utilities stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.08%, the S&P 500 fell 0.29% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.40%.
""This market continues to move higher and the story is just earnings and margins,"" said Talley Leger, chief market strategist at The Wealth Consulting Group in New Jersey.
""The inflation numbers that we saw this week were mostly services and in a services-based economy like ours, this is good for profit margins.""
Data showed that U.S. retail sales increased solidly in July, rising 0.5% from the prior month, after an unexpected spike in producer price data on Thursday renewed inflation concerns and pared market expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts this year.
European shares touched a near five-month high before pulling back, as investors drew encouragement from a largely positive earnings season. The pan-European STOXX 600 index finished flat at 0.06%.
The MSCI All Country World Index consolidated recent gains. It was last flat at 951.70, just shy of the record level of 954.21 set on Wednesday.
Trump and Putin met face to face in Alaska in a high-stakes meeting that could determine whether a ceasefire can be reached in the deadliest war in Europe since World War Two.
Trump has said a second summit involving Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy could follow if the talks with Putin go well.
Details and the longevity of any agreement will be key, and for now investors are on standby. Ukraine's government bonds - key indicators of the mood - have largely stalled in recent days at a still-distressed 55 cents on the dollar.
""There's still a small degree of risk premium in European markets because of the war. Any type of resolution will ultimately pare that back,"" said Shaniel Ramjee, co-head of multi-asset at Pictet Asset Management, adding that oil and other commodity prices could also react.
""But I think that the market has learnt not to expect too much from these negotiations. Ultimately, Zelenskiy and the Europeans are not invited. They will need to be involved in any final negotiation,"" Ramjee added.",4a8302089c18741a4a47fc1ed0fb0f21,trafilatura,2673,0

During the week ending Aug. 14, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.58% nationwide, Freddie Mac reported. That’s the lowest in 10 months. The 30-year-fixed moves in line with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which has been lurching lower since mid-July.
Bond yields – rates – fall when prices rise, and vice versa. As investors dial back their expectations about inflation and up their forecasts for Fed rate cuts, bonds become more attractive.
On Aug. 13, a measure of trader expectations for rate cuts showed near universal consensus that the central bank would deliver one 25-basis cut at its September meeting – though that was trimmed to about 90% on Aug. 14, when a fresh report showed wholesale inflation was hotter than expected.
Freddie’s weekly data was collected before the producer price index release Aug. 14, however, and it can take a little more time for mortgage rates to respond to market conditions.
Lower borrowing costs have helped boost the housing market over the past few weeks. Mortgage applications were about 11% higher in the most recent week, with applications to refinance up 23%, the Mortgage Bankers Association said. And applications for home purchases were 22% higher than at the same time last year.
The bigger question is what happens next. Fed officials are caught between responding to news about a slowing job market and the unknowns about inflation as tariff effects take hold.
And even if the central bank does decide to cut rates this fall, that doesn’t necessarily mean that Treasury yields will follow. An analysis out Aug. 14 before the producer price index found that when rate cuts take place outside of recessions, like in 1995-1996, 2019 and 2024, 10-year yields move very little – and may even increase.
""This makes sense to us,"" wrote Nicholas Colas, co-founder of the financial-markets analytics company DataTrek Research. ""When the Fed is fine-tuning policy rates rather than responding to recession, the market can read that as either a sign that inflation is under control or that lower rates might spark an increase in aggregate demand that pushes prices higher.""
Just last fall, the Fed lowered its benchmark rate a full percentage point, but mortgage rates ended the year higher than they did in September.
The Fed is lowering interest rates. So why are mortgage rates going up?
Still, the housing market remains pricey, and many buyers are skittish about their own finances, pointed out Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist for Bright MLS.",d5c72f3db929f89307104316d7557b7d,trafilatura,2670,0

Robinhood is attracting new customers at a rapid clip.
-
Revenue grew 45% in Q2, yet Robinhood still offers a limited range of services compared to big brokers.
-
As it continues to roll out new features, Robinhood could see an avalanche of asset growth.
Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ: HOOD) is breaking a new mold in the fintech market. The stock has rocketed 490% higher over the past year, sending its market cap toward $100 billion.
While the stock might look overbought after such a steep rally, its customer assets are still very small compared to other leading financial service companies, which leaves plenty of room for the company (and stock) to grow in value over the long term.
The more services Robinhood brings customers, the more it grows
Robinhood's platform assets have increased from $89 billion in the second quarter of 2023 to $279 billion in Q2 2025. With fee-generating services like Robinhood Gold continuing to gain traction, revenue grew 45% year over year in the second quarter to $989 million.
This is why the stock is still a buy at these highs. Robinhood is seeing this much growth while offering limited services compared to big brokers like Schwab. As it catches up, Robinhood could grow into a multitrillion-dollar financial services company.
Robinhood's pace of new announcements has been remarkable. In the first quarter, it rolled out index options to all customers, and it followed that up in the second quarter with the launch of stock tokens in Europe, allowing those customers to trade over 200 U.S. stocks in the form of tokenized contracts on a blockchain.
By the end of the third quarter, Robinhood plans to launch its new banking service too. These are just a few of the many announcements the company has made recently. As it continues to launch new trading products, including its Cortex AI-powered trading tool later this year, its platform assets will likely continue to grow.
There are several products, including fixed-income securities, that Robinhood can eventually tap into to further support its growth. For perspective, Schwab has over $10 trillion in client assets. I wouldn't bet against Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev's ability to grow Robinhood into one of country's largest brokerage services. The stock still offers tremendous long-term upside.

Artificial intelligence is rapidly reshaping how major companies run their operations, with some executives saying it's already transforming the workforce. ServiceNow Inc.

AI Steps Into Support Roles
""We're slowing down the hiring in jobs that are, quite frankly, soul-crushing jobs,"" McDermott said in a recent interview with Bloomberg, pointing to IT support as an example. He said 97% of standard software is now generated by AI, and 80% of customer inquiries are fully managed by AI agents. Security and risk management tasks, patchwork, and change management are also handled by these systems.

""They work hard 24 by seven. You don't have to pay them and they don't need any lunch and they don't have any health care benefits,"" McDermott said. ""AI is affordable and complements our workforce.""
While ServiceNow is still hiring, it's adding fewer people to these support roles. McDermott predicts other well-run companies will follow the same path, reorganizing around AI and moving away from traditional 20th-century corporate structures.

-
Potential homebuyers and President Donald Trump have wanted the Federal Reserve to cut its influential interest rate in the hope that mortgage rates would fall in response.
-
However, economists and analysts say that mortgage rates are unlikely to fall meaningfully below 6.5% in the near future because of the bond market's influence.
-
Bond traders would likely help bring long-term rates down if they felt the economy was in danger of a downturn.
Softer economic data make Federal Reserve interest rate cuts more likely, but that doesn’t mean mortgage rates will follow them down.
Homebuyers and those looking to refinance may have to wait longer for interest rates on 30-year mortgages to fall meaningfully below 6.5%, according to economists and market analysts.
The bond market is propping up mortgage rates, as traders are betting the Fed may only lower rates a few times rather than undertake an aggressive cycle of rate cuts. If there were signs that tariff impacts would significantly damage the economy, the Fed would have more wiggle room to cut interest rates aggressively, and bond traders would likely help bring long-term rates down.
Right now, analysts say, the economy doesn’t seem to be weakening enough to warrant that type of action—if it even gets to that point at all in the coming months.
“For the foreseeable future, it really does feel like mortgage rates are going to be staying pretty close to where we are,” said Chen Zhao, head of economics research at Redfin.
Mortgage rates could even rise if tariffs end up pushing up inflation substantially, Zhao said.
If so, markets’ expectations of Fed cuts would diminish, keeping rates elevated. One potential harbinger of that scenario came on Thursday, when new data on inflation for producers rose far more than expected, raising the prospect that businesses will pass on price increases to consumers.
Fed Actions Only Have Indirect Impact
Fed cuts would immediately make borrowing cheaper on credit cards and auto loans, since those products are based on the short-term interest rates the central bank heavily influences. Mortgages are a different story, however.
Rates on a 30-year mortgage are based heavily on investors' expectations of the economy and inflation over the next decade, not on the Fed’s near-term actions.
While mortgage rates include other costs to process each loan, they rely heavily on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield—the interest rate that the U.S. government pays to issue debt over 10 years. A complex mix of factors helps determine 10-year yields, including economic growth forecasts, inflation, demographics, and U.S. fiscal deficits.",10118aa5b4f48928e221b030ff777e2b,trafilatura,2663,0

A sharp upside surprise in U.S. producer price inflation triggered a $420 million wipeout in crypto markets on Wednesday, exposing lingering vulnerabilities in market leverage during macroeconomic data shocks.
What Happened: The U.S. July Producer Price Index rose 3.3% year-on-year, exceeding forecasts of 2.5% and marking its highest level since February. On a monthly basis, prices jumped 0.9%, the largest increase since June 2022.
Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.
The report came alongside a revision of June's annual rate from 2.3% to 2.4%, reinforcing the picture of sustained cost pressures in the production pipeline.
Within 20 minutes of the release, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) plunged from $121,193 to $117,550, according to TradingView data. Ethereum plunged below $4,500 from above $4,700.
The rapid decline coincided with widespread liquidations in leveraged positions, with derivatives markets bearing the brunt of the impact.
Market analysts point to this episode as a reminder that despite maturing infrastructure and growing institutional participation, crypto remains acutely sensitive to high-impact macro events when leverage is elevated.
While the sector has demonstrated improved post-shock recovery, the speed and scale of such liquidations underscore structural fragilities in liquidity depth and risk management practices.

What Experts Are Saying: Stella Zlatareva, editor at Nexo Dispatch, told Benzinga that the hotter-than-expected PPI print ""introduces a degree of short-term uncertainty into the Fed's policy outlook"" and could delay immediate rate cuts.
However, she emphasized that this does not derail the longer-term easing trajectory, with medium-term drivers such as ETF inflows and treasury participation continuing to shape market structure.
On the impact to leveraged trading, Zlatareva said the rapid unwinding ""points to the residual sensitivity of crypto derivatives markets, especially during macro event windows,"" while also highlighting that the market ""was able to absorb the shock and stabilize within hours, a marked improvement from previous cycles.""
Mike Cahill, an initial contributor to the Pyth Network, said the $420 million liquidation ""underscores how thin liquidity and high leverage in crypto can amplify macro shocks, revealing structural fragilities that remain despite market maturation.""",b5db36a88a4115e2ab1d4bbc68b814da,trafilatura,2661,0

Pfizer's revenue rose by 10% last quarter, exceeding market expectations.
-
The drugmaker has been cutting costs, which has paid off at the bottom line.
-
However, the industry is feeling government pressure to bring drug prices down.
Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) was a hot stock during the pandemic, but it has been crashing in recent years. The company's COVID vaccine resulted in the business posting record sales and profits in 2022. But then, as things went back to normal and demand diminished for its vaccine, so too did interest in Pfizer's stock.
What's startling, however, is the stock hasn't simply gone back to the levels it was at back before the pandemic -- it has been on a full-blown crash. Since 2023, the healthcare stock has lost more than half of its value. This year, it's reached levels it hasn't seen in 13 years. It seems like a steal of a deal. Except, no one is in a rush to buy Pfizer's stock. Investors are concerned about what lies ahead for the business and there are many question marks about its future growth.
Recently, the company released some positive earnings numbers. Could they mark a turning point for this struggling stock, and could now be a good time to invest in Pfizer?
Pfizer posts strong Q2 numbers and boosts guidance
On Aug. 5, Pfizer released its second-quarter earnings for 2025. Revenue for the June quarter totaled $14.7 billion, rising 10% year over year. And it easily came in above analyst estimates of $13.6 billion. On the bottom line, its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.78, also smashing expectations of $0.58. It also raised its guidance, now projecting adjusted EPS between $2.90 and $3.10 for the full year (versus its previous guidance of $2.80 to $3.00).
With a result like that, you might have expected shares of Pfizer to take off. Not only did it beat expectations, it performed the highly coveted beat-and-raise combo. And yet, the stock has barely moved since releasing its quarterly numbers.
The stock is now being weighed down by other factors
Pfizer can't catch a break. Its strong earnings performance comes at a time when the U.S. government is threatening tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals and is trying to get pharma companies to reduce drug prices. This doesn't bode well for the company, as these types of developments could lead to shrinking numbers on both its top and bottom lines.
The good news is that this isn't a Pfizer-specific problem. These are industry headwinds weighing down healthcare stocks as a whole. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund has declined by 13% in the past 12 months, which is similar to how Pfizer has performed over that stretch.",6fd17520690c4ce391b4d2714d988d83,trafilatura,2657,0

Alibaba's stock is outperforming Amazon's this year, but Amazon's revenue and earnings growth are stronger.
-
Both Amazon and Alibaba should have strong growth prospects.
-
Alibaba is the clear winner when it comes to valuation.
When a company is compared to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), it's usually a compliment. I suspect, therefore, that the executives running Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE: BABA) don't mind it too much when their company is called the ""Amazon of China.""
Amazon's and Alibaba's businesses are remarkably similar. Both operate e-commerce platforms that dominate their target markets. Both are leading cloud service providers and have invested heavily in artificial intelligence (AI). Each of the two companies has expanded into digital entertainment and healthcare as well.
The comparisons don't hold up as well when it comes to stock performance, though. Amazon has delivered a jaw-dropping return of over 226,000% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1997. Since Alibaba's IPO in 2014, its stock has risen by only around 30%.
But which of these two growth stocks is the better pick right now? Here's how Amazon and Alibaba stack up against each other.
Current growth
While Amazon's stock performance has trounced Alibaba's over the long term, it's a different story more recently. So far in 2025, Alibaba's American depositary receipts have soared close to 50% while Amazon is barely in positive territory.
However, Amazon is growing faster than Alibaba in at least one way. In the second quarter of 2025, Amazon's net sales jumped 13% year over year. Alibaba's revenue in its latest reported quarter increased by 7% year over year.
It was a similar story on the two companies' bottom lines. Amazon's net income soared 35% year over year, while Alibaba's adjusted earnings grew by 22%. Granted, Alibaba's earnings based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) skyrocketed by 13 times. However, this increase was primarily due to mark-to-market changes from its equity investments.
Growth prospects
The more important question is how much Amazon and Alibaba will continue to grow in the future. What is Wall Street's take? The consensus revenue growth estimate for Amazon next year is nearly 10%, compared to 8.3% for Alibaba, according to LSEG.
But analysts are more optimistic about Alibaba's earnings growth.

Michael Burry warmed to stocks last quarter, switching out bearish put options for bullish calls.
-
The ""Big Short"" investor bet on the likes of Meta, Alibaba, and UnitedHealth.
-
Burry's Scion fund owned calls on nine stocks worth a notional $522 million at the end of June.
Michael Burry bet big on stocks in the second quarter, swapping out bearish put options for bullish call options and adding several fresh holdings to his portfolio.
The investor of ""The Big Short"" fame revealed in a quarterly filing on Thursday that he purchased calls on Alibaba, ASML, JD.com, Estee Lauder, Lululemon, Meta, Regeneron, UnitedHealth, and VF last quarter.
Burry's Scion Asset Management also built direct stakes in Bruker, Lululemon, Regeneron, UnitedHealth, and MercadoLibre, while cutting his direct wager on Estee Lauder from 200,000 shares to 150,000.
The UnitedHealth wager is notable as Warren Buffett, one of Burry's key influences, also invested in the health insurer last quarter via his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate.
Call options give investors the right to buy a certain number of a company's shares at a fixed price within a set period, allowing them to lock in a purchase price that may be lower than the market price. Similarly, investors can use put options to lock in a selling price, allowing them to profit from if the stock price declines.
Scion is known for making big changes to its portfolio between quarters, but this was a particularly striking overhaul. At the end of March, it owned puts on Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com, Nvidia, PDD, and Trip.com worth a notional $186 million, plus a roughly $13 million stake in Estee Lauder. Three months later, it held calls on nine stocks worth a notional $522 million, and a further six direct stakes valued at $56 million.
It's worth underscoring that Burry may have rejigged his stock bets in recent weeks, and his disclosures may not paint a full picture of his investment strategy.
Quarterly portfolio updates known as 13Fs only provide a snapshot of a firm's holdings with a six-week lag and exclude shares sold short as well as investments in private companies, foreign-listed assets, and non-stock assets such as bonds and real estate.
Burry shot to fame after predicting and profiting from the collapse of the mid-2000s US housing bubble — a wager that was immortalized in ""The Big Short"" book and movie adaptation. He's also known for making grave predictions of market crashes and recessions, investing in GameStop before it became a meme stock, and betting against popular assets such as Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, and the entire S&P 500 index.

LONDON (Reuters) -A rout in shares of European companies embracing artificial intelligence deepened this week, as powerful new AI models raise questions about whether sectors from software to data analytics could find themselves overtaken by the technology.
European software stocks, including Germany's SAP and France's Dassault Systemes, tumbled on Tuesday as worries that AI will disrupt the software sector spread through the market. That followed a downgrade to U.S. rival Adobe on Monday by broker Melius Research.
Since mid-July, shares in markets and data group LSEG, UK software firm Sage, and French IT consulting group Capgemini have dropped 14.4%, 10.8% and 12.3% respectively.
Such companies - dubbed AI adopters by analysts - are investing heavily in the technology to beef up their products and services. Amid a dearth of European AI companies and suppliers, their shares had benefitted as investors in the region sought a way to tap the AI boom powering U.S. markets.
But the release of ever more powerful AI tools appears to have prompted a rethink among some market players.
Last week, OpenAI launched its GPT-5 model, the latest iteration of the AI technology that has helped transform global business and culture since ChatGPT arrived in late 2022.
Kunal Kothari, a fund manager at Aviva Investors, also pointed to the July 15 release of Anthropic's Claude for Financial Services.
""The app that came out has now challenged an investment case around London Stock Exchange (LSEG), around the provision of financial data,"" he said.
""We're at the stage now with every iteration of GPT or Claude that comes out ... it's multiples more capable than the previous generation. The market's thinking: 'oh, wait, that challenges this business model'.""
The drop in European adopter stocks contrasts with broader market gains. Since mid-July, London's FTSE 100 is up 2.5% and Europe's STOXX 600 up 0.6%, while U.S. indexes have scaled record highs, largely powered by tech stocks.
Exacerbating matters is the fact that many European adopter stocks trade on high multiples, making them vulnerable to any potential negative news, according to Bernie Ahkong, Chief Investment Officer at hedge fund UBS O'Connor.
The STOXX 600 trades at an average price-to-earnings multiple of 17 times, while SAP - whose shares are down 7.2% since mid-July after posting their biggest daily drop since late 2020 on Tuesday - trades at around 45 times.
WILL AI 'EAT SOFTWARE'?
Although many AI adopter stocks are struggling, some investors say markets will eventually take a more systematic approach, picking out potential winners and losers.",0ab31790c302201a4957fdd4d67dad88,trafilatura,2645,0

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook earned the title of ""tech’s Trump whisperer"" in the president’s first term, and he just may have shown why.
Cook gifted President Donald Trump a glass plaque with a 24-karat gold base on Aug. 6. The move came as he announced at the White House that Apple would invest $100 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, adding to the $500 billion the company had announced in February.
The plaque was engraved with Trump’s name, a reference to Apple's U.S. manufacturing efforts, Cook’s signature and the phrase ""MADE IN USA.""

""It’s a unique unit of one,"" Cook said. He pointed out that the glass came from U.S. glass maker Corning (NYSE:GLW) and that the base came from Utah. What’s more? Cook said it was all designed by a former U.S. Marine who now works for Apple.
""Thank you very much, it’s fantastic,"" Trump said.
Cook’s gift may offer a masterclass on how to curry favor with the president, combining two things of apparent symbolic importance to Trump: gold and the military.
From golden tweezers to gold merchandise and, most recently, the gold card visa, Trump’s love for gold is well documented. In the same vein, he is also known for his love of displays of military might, though his treatment of veterans has come under question.

But Cook’s gift also adds to mounting legal and ethical concerns about Trump accepting gifts from foreign governments and business leaders seeking to curry favor. Still, the White House continues to deny any wrongdoing on the part of the president.
""Elected leaders and business titans from around the world are traveling to the Oval Office to make historic investments into America because of President Trump’s bold vision,"" White House spokesperson Davis Ingle told Axios. ""Often these leaders are eager to share gifts highlighting the exciting work they are doing.""
Nonetheless, for Cook and Apple, the recent presentation has had the desired effect. During the meeting, Trump announced plans for a 100% tariff on semiconductor chips, adding that Apple would be exempt from the charge.",318e2da84b2e7ad95f5dec29d20f7cd6,trafilatura,2638,0

(AP) — Berkshire Hathaway revealed four new investments Thursday in steelmaker Nucor, insurer UnitedHealth and two of the nation's biggest homebuilders — Lennar and DR Horton — but it's not clear if the investments are big enough to ensure that legendary investor Warren Buffett handled them.
Buffett, who plans to retire as CEO at the end of the year after six decades of building Berkshire, handles all of the conglomerate's biggest investments worth $1 billion or more. Three of the new investments disclosed Thursday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission are worth less than that, so they could be the ideas of one of Berkshire's two other investment managers.
But Berkshire’s new UnitedHealth stake that was also revealed Thursday was worth $1.57 billion, so that one could be big enough to be Buffett’s handiwork. Berkshire got permission from the SEC to keep the other three investments confidential earlier this year while it built those stakes, but it apparently bought nearly 5 million UnitedHealth shares just in the second quarter. That stock jumped nearly 8% in aftermarket trading.
Berkshire's filings simply offer a snapshot of its $258 billion portfolio at the end of the second quarters. Many investors comb through Berkshire's filings every quarter because they like to follow Buffett's moves. His record of trouncing the S&P 500 for decades has inspired legions of followers.
The filing doesn't make clear who at Berkshire handled each investment. Besides Buffett, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs also pick stocks, but they generally handle smaller portfolios and Combs also serves as Geico's CEO. But Buffett has had a hard time finding stocks or any other investments in recent years that he wants to invest much of Berkshire's $344 billion cash in.
Berkshire's Nucor stake of 6.6 million shares was the biggest new investment worth roughly $857 million at the end of the quarter. Shares of that company rose more than 6% in extended after-hours trading.
The Lennar investment was worth nearly $800 million. While the DR Horton stake was much smaller worth $191.5 million. Those companies' stocks also saw gains in late trading
Buffett already knows quite a lot about the home building business because Berkshire owns the nation's largest manufactured homebuilder, Clayton Homes.
Besides stocks, Berkshire owns dozens of companies in a variety of industries including Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an assortment of manufacturing and retail companies. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company's holdings include many well-known brands like See's Candy and Dairy Queen.",4694b9a9d6cab2a21342a69d4ded5c9a,trafilatura,2637,0

Brazilian online banker PagSeguro is the parent company of PagBank.
-
PagBank just reported 18% revenue growth for Q2, but PagSeguro stock is down today.
-
Currency conversion quirks may be scaring off investors from this low-price Brazilian banking stock.
Brazilian fintech and digital bank PagSeguro (NYSE: PAGS), dropped 6.7% through 1 p.m. ET Thursday after the company reported second-quarter earnings.
The company put out only a brief press release (less than 400 words long), describing results at its PagBank subsidiary, and gave most numbers in local currency, the Brazilian real. Between this international quirk and some name confusion, U.S. investors may be wondering whether PagSeguro's news was good or bad.
PagSeguro Q2 earnings
According to the press release, PagBank grew its revenue 18% year over year, to 5.1 billion reals ($940 million), not counting foreign exchange rates, which is a great way to start off. Profits increased only 7% year over year, however, rising to 537 million reals ($98.7 million).
Deposits grew by 9% in local currency, and the company's loan portfolio grew by 11%. In a tough economy, PagBank purposely grew conservatively, expanding ""low-risk, high-engagement products"" in particular by 34%.
Commenting on the quarter, CEO Artur Schunck admitted the company is operating ""in a challenging economic environment,"" but insisted the company has ""grown profitably"" in Q2, and is ""on the right path"" to continue doing so.
Is PagSeguro stock a sell?
Turning to S&P Global Market Intelligence for reliable data on this difficult to value bank, we see that PagSeguro has a $2.8 billion market capitalization, and earned $405 million in profit over the last 12 months. That makes for a P/E ratio of only about 6.9, which seems cheap to me in light of the deposits and loan growth -- maybe really cheap if the loans are conservatively made.
Throw in a modest 1.5% dividend for good measure, and PagSeguro looks like a buy to me -- not a sell.

But maybe not indefinitely.
Investors are contemplating what seem to be contradictory trends in financial markets and wondering how long they can last. President Trump's tariffs are beginning to cause tremors in the real economy. But the stock market keeps drifting higher, as if boom times are nigh. Does it make sense?
Investors must think so, for now, anyway.
Buyers keep buying, with the broad S&P 500 (^GSPC) index hanging out near record highs and the narrower Dow (DOW) index near its first record close since last December. Stocks have been on a tear since Trump backed away from steep tariffs in early April and instead pursued a more modest country-by-country approach to trade deals.
But all is not well. An Aug. 15 New York Times headline told readers, ""The stock market is getting scary."" Economist Burton Malkiel pointed out that stock valuations are near the highest levels in 230 years, warning that ""there are worrisome signs that investor optimism may have gotten out of hand.""
It's not just the mainstream press that's worried. Money managers at Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, and Evercore are preparing clients for a possible 10% to 15% drop in stock values, according to Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs sees a ""latent risk of unwinds"" if anything upsets a fragile ""Goldilocks"" setup. In an Aug. 14 video for clients, Tom Lee, co-founder of investing firm Fundstrat, highlighted the recent jump in wholesale inflation and said, ""yet the stock market barely cared.""
What seems to be happening is that the stock market is diverging from the real economy. The signs of an economic slowdown include sharply slowing job growth and a surge in wholesale inflation caused largely by all of Trump's new taxes on imports. Consumers expect higher producer costs to push up retail costs in the coming months, pushing overall inflation from 2.7% now to around 4.5%. That's depressing overall consumer sentiment.

It's not alarming for the stock market and the economy to go in slightly different directions. As Sam Ro points out in his TKer newsletter, the stock market often functions as a ""discounting mechanism"" assessing future growth and earnings. And some Wall Street analysts think the early 2025 swoon — with the S&P down 21% from late February to early April — represented stocks pricing in the slowdown we're undergoing now. If so, the current run-up might be telling us the economy will do better by the end of the year than the meek 1% GDP growth many economists are forecasting.",487a254aa75d4d69a3398cc3952af3d9,trafilatura,2625,0

It is “100% fraudulent” that the Bitcoin-buying firm compared its price-to-earnings ratio to the likes of Apple and NVIDIA on a slide during its second-quarter earnings presentation, the Wall Street veteran said during an episode of the What Bitcoin Did podcast released on Monday.
The slide implied that Strategy’s earnings are recurring, when the performance was driven by a “one-off, market-to-market” increase in the value of its Bitcoin holdings, Constan argued.
“They are marketing [that revenue] to investors as recurring earnings that deserve a multiple,” he added. “That is deceptive.”
Macro analyst Lyn Alden, who was also featured on the podcast as a guest, said, “I'm not sure I would call it fraudulent, but I don't agree with the charts that show their P/E comparison either.”
Decrypt reached out to Strategy for comment.
Strategy shares closed down 4.35% on Thursday to trade at $372.92 after falling 2.2% the day before, according to Yahoo Finance. The stock is still up 33% year-to-date, but shares have slid 11% from $447 over the past month.
Bitcoin’s price was recently down 3.7% over the past 24 hours to trade just above $118,000, meanwhile. It hit a fresh all-time high above $124,000 on Wednesday, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.
The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) compares a company’s share price with the earnings that it generates, yielding a multiple that can be used to assess stocks’ relative values. As of July 29, Strategy had a 4.7x P/E multiple, while chipmaker NVIDIA’s’s stood at 40.8x.
“There are only five companies in the S&P 500 universe that have a lower PE multiple than us,” Strategy CEO and President Phong Lee said during the firm’s Q2 earnings call. “We’re possibly the most misunderstood and undervalued stock in the U.S. and potentially the world.”
Strategy disclosed a whopping $10 billion second-quarter profit last month, or earnings of $32.60 per common share. The company meanwhile posted $114.5 million in Q2 revenue, largely from software subscriptions and providing product support.
Under generally acceptable accounting principles (GAAP), Strategy started recording its Bitcoin holdings at fair value this year, reflecting quarter-to-quarter price swings. Under previous rules, firms recorded cryptocurrencies at their original cost; they could write them down as an “impairment charge” if the value dropped—but could not mark them up when prices rose.",3f17f2eeda6ba546c13eb99d4007884f,trafilatura,2614,0

10 stocks we like better than Kratos Defense & Security Solutions ›
Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (NASDAQ: KTOS) investors might be tempted to celebrate the coming weekend early, following an analyst's recommendation upgrade for their stock. That sentiment-boosting event occurred Thursday before market open, and helped the company's shares trade in positive territory.
They closed that session 0.5% higher, slightly exceeding the rise of the S&P 500 index.
BTIG is now big on the company
The person upping his recommendation on Kratos was BTIG's Andre Madrid, who has set a price target of $80 per share for the defense stock.
According to reports, Madrid feels that several developments have swung in the defense company's favor recently. A major one he cited is the Marine Corps's MUX TACAIR unmanned aerial systems (UAS) program, for which the company was downselected. This portends quite well for Kratos's general UAS business.
The analyst also waxed bullish about the company's potential in other product segments, singling out categories such as hypersonics and microwave technologies.
Join the club
Madrid's upgrade is part of a trend among analysts, more than a few of whom have become more positive about Kratos's future lately. Earlier this week, a clutch of them raised their price targets on the shares, while one (Cannacord Genuity's Austin Moeller) initiated coverage with a buy rating.
This was to be expected, to a degree, as the company scored a double beat on its second-quarter earnings, which it reported last week. It particularly impressed the market with a 17% year-over-year increase in sales, not to mention topping the average analyst revenue estimate with full-year guidance of $1.3 billion.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's economy grew much faster than expected in the second quarter as export volumes held up well against new U.S. tariffs, giving the central bank some of the conditions it needs to resume interest rate hikes this year.
Gross domestic product (GDP) rose 1.0% on an annualised basis, government data showed on Friday, marking the fifth straight quarter of expansion after the previous quarter's contraction was revised to growth.
However, analysts warn global economic uncertainties fuelled by U.S. tariffs could weigh on the world's fourth-largest economy in the coming months, especially as automakers struggle to keep prices down for American customers.
""The April-June data masked the real effect of Trump's tariffs,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute. ""Exports were strong thanks to solid car shipment volumes and last-minute demand from Asian tech manufacturers ahead of some sectoral tariffs. But these aren't sustainable at all.""
The increase in GDP was helped by surprisingly resilient exports and capital expenditure and compared with median market expectations for a 0.4% gain in a Reuters poll. It followed a 0.6% rise in the previous quarter, which was revised up from a 0.2% contraction.
The reading translates into a quarterly rise of 0.3%, better than the median estimate of a 0.1% uptick.
The strong data contrasts with China, which saw factory output growth hit an eight month low and retail sales slow sharply in July.
Private consumption, which accounts for more than half of Japan's economic output, rose 0.2%, compared with a market estimate of a 0.1% increase. It grew at the same pace as the previous quarter.
Consumption and wage trends are factors the Bank of Japan is watching to gauge economic strength and determine the timing of its next interest rate action.
Capital spending, a key driver of domestic demand, rose 1.3% in the second quarter, versus a rise of 0.5% in the Reuters poll.
Net external demand, or exports minus imports, contributed 0.3 of a point to growth, versus a 0.8 point negative contribution in the January-March period.
The United States imposed 25% tariffs on automobiles and auto parts in April and threatened 25% levies on most of other Japanese imports. It later struck a trade deal in July that lowered tariffs to 15% in exchange for a U.S.-bound $550 billion Japanese investment package.
Japanese economy minister Ryosei Akazawa told a press conference that the latest GDP results confirmed that the country's economy was recovering modestly.",a3bde069ef260997182082758284ba32,trafilatura,2604,0

The crypto market is reeling after a sharp pullback wiped out over $1.05 billion in leveraged positions in the past 24 hours.
According to Coinglass data, 219,682 traders were liquidated, with longs bearing the brunt — accounting for more than $778 million of the total.
The largest single liquidation was a $10 million BTC-USD position on Bybit. Bybit led in total liquidations with $447 million, followed by Binance with $264 million and OKX with $126 million.
Bitcoin (BTC) is now trading at $118,718, down 1.5% in the past 24 hours after recently hitting record highs above $124,000. Its market cap sits at $2.36 trillion. Ethereum (ETH) fell 3.4% to $4,547, while XRP slipped 5.2% to $3.11. Other major altcoins also saw losses, with Solana (SOL) down 4.2% to $193.60 and BNB down 2.3% to $833.84.
The sell-off follows days of euphoric gains that pushed Bitcoin past Google in market capitalization earlier this week.
Jessy Gilger, CFP, Senior Advisor at Sound Advisory (the financial planning and investment arm of Unchained), says the latest move fits squarely within Bitcoin’s historical growth pattern, but with one key difference that could make this cycle even stronger:
“Every Bitcoin cycle has followed the same pattern: consolidation, expansion, peak, and retrace, with each peak rising materially above the last. This cycle is tracking closely to that model. But with this year’s supply issuance cut in half and institutional demand stronger than ever, the runway for record growth is wide open.""
Ethereum is riding the same bullish wave. As ETH approaches an all-time high, Thomas Perfumo, Global Economist at Kraken, notes:
""ETH has surged to its first new all-time high since 2021, lifting Bitcoin and other major altcoins alike. The rally marks ETH’s first sustained run of outperformance in years, fueled by aggressive institutional inflows.""
He added:
""Corporate treasuries and spot ETH ETFs now control more than 8% of the circulating supply—almost double their stake from just two months ago—creating a supply squeeze that has amplified the latest move higher. Leading the charge is Bitmine, now ETH’s largest single holder, which recently filed to expand its at-the-market equity offering by $20 billion, arming it with additional dry powder to accelerate accumulation.""

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Shares in Danish jewellery maker Pandora plummeted on Friday after the company flagged weakening sales in its key European markets, only partially offset by robust sales in the United States.
Its shares were down 12.6% at 0738 GMT and have lost 36% since a record high in January.
Pandora's sales totalled 7.08 billion Danish crowns ($1.11 billion) in the second quarter, slightly below the 7.17 billion forecast by analysts, with comparable sales growth slowing to 3% from 6% in the previous quarter, below the 4% growth expected by analysts.
In July, comparable sales grew 2%, it said.
Analysts at J.P. Morgan said in a note that they expected weak comparable sales in the second quarter and in July ""to further add question marks regarding the sustainability of Pandora’s growth in the short term, and to weigh on the stock.""
The charm bracelet maker, however, kept its full-year guidance of 7-8% organic sales growth, with an operating profit margin of around 24%.
Comparable sales fell 9% in the UK, 7% in France and Italy, and 6% in Germany.
Pandora said price rises and cost cuts would help it offset rising raw material expenses and the impact of tariffs on imports to its largest U.S. market.
Pandora, which makes all its jewellery at two factories in Thailand, is among the European companies most exposed to tariffs.
The U.S. tariff rate for goods from Thailand was reduced to 19% from 36% announced in April after both countries struck a deal this month during President Donald Trump's broader overhaul of U.S. trade relations.
Pandora said the current level of tariffs would cost the company 200 million Danish crowns ($31.3 million) this year and 450 million next year.
It said it expected to be able to offset ""a material part"" of the effect of higher commodity prices, tariffs and foreign exchange rates ""through a combination of pricing, cost efficiencies, and operating leverage"".
Pandora would consider further price increases and new cost-cutting measures to cover the impact of tariffs, it said. The company raised prices by 4% in April and by a ""low-single-digit"" rate in August in response to higher commodity prices.
Silver, a key material for its jewellery, is trading near its highest level in 15 years.
Operating profit for the second quarter was 1.29 billion crowns, matching a forecast by analysts in a company-compiled poll. Organic revenue grew 8%, also in line with analysts' expectations.

Altcoin season may be weeks away, according to Coinbase Institutional’s latest monthly outlook, which forecasts a shift in market leadership from bitcoin to alternative cryptocurrencies beginning in September.
Altcoin season refers to a market phase when cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin — often led by Ethereum's ETH, Solana's SOL, and other large-cap tokens — post significantly higher percentage gains than BTC over a sustained period.
The Aug. 14 report, authored by David Duong, Coinbase’s global head of research, identifies three main drivers: falling bitcoin market dominance, improving liquidity and growing investor willingness to rotate into higher-beta assets. Duong frames this as a cyclical transition, with capital moving down the risk curve as market confidence builds.
Bitcoin dominance — its share of total crypto market value — has shown signs of softening after peaking earlier this year. Coinbase argues that as this measure declines, capital historically flows into large-cap altcoins, and then into mid- and small-cap names. This rotation effect, they suggest, will become more pronounced in September.
Liquidity trends are also turning more favorable for altcoins. Coinbase notes tighter bid-ask spreads and deeper order books across major exchanges, making it easier for traders to enter and exit altcoin positions without incurring heavy slippage. Improved liquidity often encourages participation from larger players who might otherwise avoid less-traded tokens.
The third factor is sentiment. Duong writes that as macro conditions stabilize and volatility remains contained, investors are more likely to seek higher returns in riskier crypto assets. This environment could foster sustained inflows into the altcoin market, particularly if bitcoin’s price consolidates rather than surges to new highs.
Coinbase stops short of predicting which tokens will lead the charge but highlights the pattern from previous market cycles, where blue-chip altcoins outperformed first, followed by smaller-cap assets. The report cautions that while September may mark the start, the duration and magnitude of the move will depend on both market and macroeconomic conditions.
BTC is up 27.2% year-to-date but has trailed some major altcoins such as ETH (+37.9%) and XRP (+49%), while others like SOL (+1.67%), ADA (+8.96%) and DOGE (-27.5%) have lagged. Coinbase maintains that market conditions overall could favor a broader rotation into altcoins in the coming months.",bf24c0988c8168e5bd408bd8fce8f556,trafilatura,2592,0

The talks are early and the size of the share sale could still change, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The secondary share investment is on top of SoftBank’s commitment to lead OpenAI’s $40 billion funding round, which values the company at $300 billion, according to another person familiar with the deal. That round remains ongoing, with OpenAI recently securing $8.3 billion from a syndicate of investors.
Representatives for Dragoneer and Thrive didn’t respond to requests for comment. Spokespeople for OpenAI and SoftBank declined to comment. All three firms are existing OpenAI backers.
The secondary share sale, which was first reported by Bloomberg, will give OpenAI employees a chance to get cash-rich amid a high-stakes talent war in the artificial intelligence industry. Companies like Meta Platforms Inc. are offering massive salaries to recruit AI talent from OpenAI and other startups. This year, several OpenAI employees have exited for Meta, including Shengjia Zhao, a co-creator of ChatGPT.
Allowing employees to sell shares is an important tool for startups trying to retain top talent, without requiring the company to go public or be acquired. In some cases, early investors also use these deals to sell down their stakes, though OpenAI investors are not eligible to do so in this round, according to a person familiar with the matter. Current and former employees who spent at least two years at the company are able to participate.
With its participation in the share sale, as well as its previous commitments, SoftBank is making a pivotal bet on the success of OpenAI. In addition to those deals, the Japanese conglomerate headed by Masayoshi Son recently closed a separate $1 billion purchase of OpenAI employee shares at a $300 billion valuation, according to a person familiar with the matter. Negotiations for that deal started before talks around the $500 billion secondary valuation began, they said.",d37ec8a3e4d3898c60e1ca5db7ffefca,trafilatura,2586,0

Under the leadership of CEO David Ellison, the newly combined entity seeks to integrate Paramount’s cinematic heritage with Skydance’s technological expertise.
Yet, almost overnight, PSKY became something else entirely: a meme stock. In Street talk, that’s a stock rocketed higher by social media hype and speculative fervor, not cold financial calculus. CNBC’s Jim Cramer fanned the flames Wednesday, posting: “Paramount, (PSKY), is a meme stock!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Small float… shocking.” A low float means a scarcity of shares, which can send prices into a manic whiplash when demand spikes.

About Paramount Skydance Stock
Paramount, a Skydance Corporation, is a next-generation media powerhouse, blending Hollywood legacy with modern innovation. Its three pillars - Studios, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media - house iconic brands from Paramount Pictures and CBS to Nickelodeon, MTV, and Showtime, alongside Skydance’s animation, gaming, and sports divisions. With streaming, broadcast, and interactive content under one roof, the company crafts a diversified entertainment empire, commanding a market capitalization of $10 billion.
PSKY stock has surged by nearly 36% over the past five days, fueled in large part by Jim Cramer’s viral tweet. The stock spiked to a high of $17.53 before retracing some gains.

Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE:PWR) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.
Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE:PWR)’s shares have gained 22% year-to-date to make them the best-performing stock among its mega construction and engineering services peers. Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE:PWR) reported a strong set of earnings results in July when it raised its annual revenue guidance to $27.4 billion and $27.9 billion from an earlier $26.7 billion to $27.2 billion and its earnings per share guidance to $10.28 and $10.88 from an earlier $10.05 and $10.65. Naturally, Cramer also believes that Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE:PWR) can be a winner from growing construction activity due to American manufacturing being on-shored:
“. . .people are looking for ways to be able to play the reshoring. The best ways are Aecom and then the letter J, Jacobs. Those are the two that are getting the contracts. Don’t do Fluor’s, Fluor’s had a series of missed quarters, that one is not on my screen. But Aecom and Jacobs go, PWR too, Quanta, but I don’t think that’s as good.”
Here’s what Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE:PWR)’s management said during the firm’s first quarter earnings call about catalysts from manufacturing:
“Utilities across the United States are experiencing and forecasting meaningful increases in power demand, which is being driven by the adoption of new technologies and related infrastructure, including data centers and artificial intelligence, policies intended to reinforce domestic manufacturing and supply chain resources and the need for all forms of energy generation. We continue to believe these drivers are leading to a potential historic investment in and an expansion of high-voltage transmission infrastructure. And at Quanta’s self-performed platform, execution track record and solution-based mindset enabled us to capitalize on these expanding opportunities, positioning Quanta for sustained leadership and long-term growth.”
While we acknowledge the potential of PWR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Each of the three major U.S. indexes hit all-time highs this week. The records followed improved investor sentiment after fresh consumer inflation data supported hopes for an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve's September meeting. The S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9% and 0.8% week to date, respectively, while the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.7%. After this week's rally, we used the CNBC Pro stock screener tool to identify the most overbought stocks on the Street as measured by their 14-day relative strength index, or RSI. Stocks with a 14-day RSI above 70 are generally considered overbought, meaning they could see shares decline in the future. The table below shows stocks with an RSI above 70 that have also risen at least 5% week to date, as of Friday morning. Biopharmaceutical company Incyte and e-commerce platform eBay topped the oversold list with RSIs of about 80 and 77, respectively. Incyte shares gained 11% this week. The stock is up nearly 26% year to date. Wells Fargo recently upgraded shares to overweight and set a $89 price target, saying the stock's setup appears favorable ahead of Incyte's expected update on its myelofibrosis therapy in the fourth quarter. The firm expects the news ""will be positive."" Myelofibrosis is rare bone marrow disorder. Shares of eBay jumped 8% this week, meanwhile, bringing its year-to-date gains to more than 62%.

It's a sharp swing for the struggling stock, which saw its worst annual performance on record last year after it lost 60% of its value. The chipmaker's steep climb followed a Bloomberg report on Thursday that said the Trump administration is weighing whether the U.S. government should take a stake in Intel to support its efforts to expand U.S. manufacturing. Following the report, D.A. Davidson head of technology research Gil Luria told CNBC that government intervention in Intel is ""essential"" to protect U.S. national security.

Red Robin reported a decline in total revenues, same-store sales, and traffic in the second quarter reported Wednesday after market, but its stock rose by double digits, nonetheless. Analysts are optimistic about the traffic-driving initiatives put into place when Dave Pace was named chief executive officer in April, as well as the company’s profit increase and investment targets.
In the second quarter, total revenues were $283.7 million versus $300.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Same-store sales declined 3.2%, including a 5.5% decline in guest traffic.
That said, Red Robin’s sharpened focus on operational efficiencies, including labor improvements, drove a 280-basis-point improvement in restaurant-level profit margin during the second quarter.
“Our operators have become much more disciplined in managing through a labor matrix,” Pace said. “That involves being confident and more accurate in their forecasting and then scheduling against their forecasting, which they've done effectively.”
The $9.99 Yummm value deal, launched in July, has shown early signs of progress toward Pace’s goal of driving positive traffic. The company had previously been reluctant to join the value conversation, but Pace said it is important to respond to the dynamics of the marketplace, including consumers looking for such deals.
“The first step in building these layers was to address our weak competitive positioning and price point value offers. As we surveyed the competitive landscape, it was abundantly clear that price pointed value offerings under $10 are essential to help break through the noise to drive trial and consideration in today's environment,” he said. “The Big Yummm Deal has been thoughtfully structured to offer trade-up opportunities like extra burger patties, bacon, avocado, or upgraded sides and beverages designed to help mitigate check pressure while still delivering strong value to guests.”
Chief financial officer Todd Wilson said about 9% of guests are ordering the Big Yummm deal.
“Which, from our lens, is a great thing,” he said. “It means people see the promotion, they see the value in it, and they're choosing that option.”
To further drive traffic, Red Robin is rolling out proprietary, microtargeting tools in the third quarter to engage guests “more personally, precisely, and efficiently” than traditional broad-based messaging. Pace said this strategy is critical for Red Robin to compete with larger, more resourced brands.",fa14249cf7eb78ef6a9a77b6ed639b19,trafilatura,2564,0

The cryptocurrency market is riding near-record levels for Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), but Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan believes several overlooked factors could still drive prices sharply higher.
What Happened: In a note to clients on Wednesday, Hougan pointed to improving regulatory clarity, growing stablecoin adoption, increased corporate treasury purchases, and steady institutional ETF inflows as widely recognized drivers of the current rally, according to The Block.
Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.
He added that Ethereum's renewed momentum has helped reinvigorate altcoin markets.
Yet, according to Hougan, the real upside lies in developments the market has not fully priced in.
One such catalyst is potential government Bitcoin purchases.
Hougan said that while ETFs and corporate treasuries have been aggressive buyers, absorbing far more BTC than has been mined this year, government adoption remains limited.
Recent moves by Pakistan and Abu Dhabi have been small, but Hougan suggested that interest from central banks, including the Czech Republic, could turn into market-moving announcements.
Hougan also noted that Bitcoin's resilience near all-time highs is occurring despite elevated interest rates.

Why It Matters: While traders expect some rate cuts by year-end, he argued that policy signals from the Trump administration suggest a deeper shift toward a weaker dollar and more aggressive easing.
The recent nomination of Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve, an advocate for substantial rate reductions, could lead to more cuts than markets currently anticipate.
Another factor is Bitcoin's declining volatility since spot ETFs launched in January 2024.
Hougan said this has made Bitcoin comparably stable to certain high-growth tech stocks, encouraging institutional investors to consider portfolio allocations of 5% or more.
ETF inflows have surged, with $5.6 billion recorded since July, and Hougan expects the pace to quicken in the coming months.
Lastly, Hougan highlighted a potential resurgence of initial coin offerings under the SEC's ""Project Crypto"" initiative, which proposes tailored disclosures and safe harbors for ICOs, airdrops, and network rewards.",0b516f864c2050733d1f9db07f7ec43c,trafilatura,2558,0

LONDON (Reuters) -Well-heeled shoppers around the United States seem - so far at least - willing to soak up price hikes for aspirational products from trendy Birkenstock sandals to Bugaboo prams, despite the impact of trade tariffs and belt-tightening elsewhere.
German sandal and clog brand Birkenstock has enjoyed strong consumer demand with little pushback from U.S. retailers since hiking prices at the start of July, its chief executive said on Thursday.
As brands raise prices and cut costs to mitigate the impact of higher U.S. tariffs on their imported products, a key question is the extent to which consumers will be put off and buy less, or simply walk away from purchases.
Comments from Birkenstock, Bugaboo, Coach, Ralph Lauren and other brands at the premium end of the market suggest that, so far, affluent consumers are shrugging off price hikes.
""We saw no pushback or cancellations following the July 1st price increases implemented in response to tariffs,"" Birkenstock CEO Oliver Reichert told analysts on a call, adding demand for the brand has been ""tremendously strong.""
Bank of America, the largest consumer facing U.S. bank, said this week that middle- and upper-income earners spent more on their credit cards in July than the same month last year. In contrast, spending among the lowest income bracket remained flat, the bank found.
Overall U.S. consumer spending may stay strong, Bank of America said, as long as higher-income individuals keep spending. Lower-income earners account for only 15% of all U.S. consumer spending, according to Bank of America.
However, Procter & Gamble, maker of Tide detergent, reported signs of spending cutbacks among higher-income consumers, indicating that shoppers may be becoming more selective with their purchases.
Bugaboo, a Netherlands-based maker of expensive baby gear, also raised prices on its strollers, high chairs and play pens by $50-$300 in May because of U.S. tariffs. Retailers were open and accepting.
""In general we did not see any pushback. They are like us. They understand it is a fluid situation,"" Chief Commercial Officer for North America, Jeanelle Teves, said.
Bugaboo manufactures in China and sells strollers for more than $1,000 at Target, Nordstrom, Bloomingdales and independent mom and pop stores.
Coach handbags also remain in strong demand despite a gloomier economic outlook: the brand drew in more than 4.6 million new customers in North America this year, many of whom are Gen Z and millennials, Tapestry CEO Joanne Kuvoiserat said on Thursday.",de5cb3d67a6a46ad71f994646bb38cfe,trafilatura,2557,0

Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (NYSE:J) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.
Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (NYSE:J) is an engineering and construction consulting company. The firm’s shares have gained 12.5% year-to-date and are up by 5.7% after its fiscal third quarter earnings release. Like peer firm Aecom, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (NYSE:J)’s earnings report also saw the firm beat analyst earnings estimates but miss the revenue estimates. Cramer believes that the firm is in a strong position to benefit from the expected growth in construction activity in America due to manufacturing re-shoring. He outlined that Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (NYSE:J) is leading in getting the contracts related to on-shoring:
“. . .people are looking for ways to be able to play the re-shoring. The best ways are Aecom and then the letter J, Jacobs. Those are the two that are getting the contracts. . .But Aecom and Jacobs go. . .”
L1 Capital International Fund mentioned Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (NYSE:J) in its Q2 2025 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:
“Jacobs Solutions Inc. (NYSE:J) (Jacobs) was founded in 1947 by Joseph Jacobs as a one-man chemical engineering consulting business. Over the next nearly 80 years the business has grown through international expansion and strategic acquisitions to become one of the largest engineering design firms globally with over 45,000 employees.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The blue-chip Dow Jones ended higher after hitting an intraday record high on Friday, as UnitedHealth's shares jumped after Berkshire Hathaway raised its stake, but other Wall Street indexes slipped as mixed data clouded the Federal Reserve's next monetary policy move.
A meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin was also on the radar, with markets hoping it could pave the way for a resolution to the Ukraine conflict and determine the outlook for crude prices. The two leaders began a meeting in Alaska on Friday afternoon.
UnitedHealth Group rose almost 12%, its biggest single-day percentage rise since March 2020, after Warren Buffett's company revealed a new investment in the health insurer, while Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management also turned more bullish on the company.
Rising costs in the broader healthcare sector and about a 40% slump in UnitedHealth's shares this year have left the Dow lagging its Wall Street peers on the road to record highs. The price-weighted index last scaled an all-time high on December 4.
The healthcare sector gained 1.65% on Friday, tracking its best weekly performance since October 2022.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 34.86 points, or 0.08%, to 44,946.12, the S&P 500 lost 18.74 points, or 0.29%, to 6,449.80 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 87.69 points, or 0.40%, to 21,622.98.
More broadly, Wall Street's main stock indexes recorded their second week of gains, buoyed by expectations that the Fed could restart its monetary policy easing cycle with a 25-basis-point interest rate cut in September.
The central bank last lowered borrowing costs in December and said U.S. tariffs could add to price pressures. However, recent labor market weakness and signs that tariff-induced inflation was yet to reflect in headline consumer prices have made investors confident of a potential dovish move next month.
""The question is, has the tariff gotten into the price of goods yet? And it appears that there hasn't,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading.
Saluzzi also said while markets have largely priced in a September rate cut, investors might be overlooking risks, with low volatility and rich valuations pointing to a sense of complacency.
In a mixed day for economic data, a report showed retail sales in July rose as expected, but consumer confidence and factory production numbers indicated tariffs were taking a toll on other pockets of the economy.",c1a37ce3cb36e9a5a62f69851e9e4557,trafilatura,2545,0

Today, a brief rundown of news involving Precigen and Pfizer, as well as updates from the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, Superluminal Medicines and Generation Bio that you may have missed.
The Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to a first-of-its-kind treatment for recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, a rare and potentially life-threatening condition caused by persistent HPV infections. Thursday’s clearance of Precigen’s Papzimeos, an immunotherapy that helps clear HPV-infected cells, was based on study results showing a little more than half of drug recipients didn't need surgery within a year of therapy. Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research director Vinay Prasad, who rejoined the FDA this week, described the approval as proof “randomized trials are not always needed to approve medical products.” That statement should be “reassuring” to biotech investors concerned about stricter regulatory standards under Prasad, wrote Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Jennifer Kim. Precigen shares rose higher Friday on the news. — Ben Fidler
An experimental Pfizer drug for sickle cell disease failed to meet its goal in a Phase 3 study, the company said Friday. Testing showed that treatment with inclacumab, a drug Pfizer acquired via its 2022 buyout of Global Blood Therapeutics, failed to significantly reduce versus placebo the pain crises people with sickle cell often experience. Pfizer said it would share analyses of the data with the scientific and patient community in “due course.” Last year, the company pulled from market another sickle cell drug, Oxbryta, that it gained from Global Blood, citing safety concerns. The company plans to provide updates on Oxbryta and a third Global Blood drug, the experimental osivelotor, when they become available. — Ned Pagliarulo
Eli Lilly will collaborate with biotechnology startup Superluminal Medicines to develop new drugs for cardiometabolic diseases and obesity. Through the alliance, the two intend to discover and advance small molecule medicines aimed at undisclosed G protein-coupled receptor, or GPCR, targets “relevant” to those conditions. Lilly will receive exclusive rights to the compounds emerging from the deal, while Superluminal could get up to $1.3 billion in total payouts, including an unspecified upfront payment as well as an equity investment, the companies said Thursday. — Ben Fidler",084b9abca2cbd21aff142310df63ed62,trafilatura,2540,0

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Oil prices closed down nearly $1 on Friday as traders awaited talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, which could lead to an easing of the sanctions imposed on Moscow over the war in Ukraine.
Brent crude futures settled 99 cents, or 1.5%, lower at $65.85 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures eased $1.16, or 1.8%, lower at $62.80.
Trump arrived in Alaska on Friday for his summit with Putin after saying he wants to see a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine ""today.""
Trump has said he believes Russia is prepared to end the war, but he has also threatened to impose secondary sanctions on countries that buy Russian oil if there is no progress with peace talks.
Putin also arrived in Anchorage. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia expects the talks to bring results, Russia's Interfax news agency reported.
""President Trump will likely threaten further tariff pressure on India and possibly China as far as oil imports from Russia if the meeting stalemates, which is keeping a nervous trade to crude,"" said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president of trading at BOK Financial.
""If a ceasefire announcement is made, it will be taken as a negative to crude near-term,"" Kissler added.
For the week, WTI dropped 1.7%, while Brent eased 1.1%.
Weaker economic data from China, meanwhile, raised concerns over fuel demand.
Chinese government data showed factory output growth slumped to an eight-month low and retail sales growth expanded at its slowest pace since December, weighing on sentiment despite stronger oil throughput in the world's second-largest crude user.
Throughput at Chinese refineries rose 8.9% year-on-year in July, but that was down from June levels, which were the highest since September 2023. Despite the increase, China's oil product exports last month were also up from a year ago, suggesting lower domestic fuel demand.
Forecasts of a growing oil market surplus also weighed on sentiment, as did the prospect of higher-for-longer U.S. interest rates.
Oil rig count, an indicator of future supply, rose by one to 412 this week, Baker Hughes data showed.
Bank of America analysts said on Thursday that they were widening their forecast for the oil market surplus, citing growing supplies from the OPEC+ producer group comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other allies.
The analysts now project an average surplus of 890,000 barrels per day from July 2025 through June 2026.",27d69af9b4058f393323d35f7d692f7d,trafilatura,2531,0

Bullion traded near $3,340 an ounce, after ending the previous session 0.6% lower following a report that showed US wholesale inflation accelerated in July by the most in three years. Bond yields and the dollar advanced after the data print, weighing on non-interest bearing gold as it is priced in the currency.

Swap traders now see around a 90% chance the US central bank will reduce rates in September, after fully pricing in the move earlier this week. Bullion typically benefits in a lower-rate environment as it pays no interest.
The precious metal has climbed by more than a quarter this year, with the bulk of those gains occurring in the first four months. It has been supported by heightened geopolitical and trade tensions that have spurred haven demand, while central bank purchases have also underpinned its strength.
Traders will be monitoring a summit between the US and Russian presidents in Alaska later on Friday, which could have bearing on haven demand. Donald Trump warned he would impose “very severe consequences” if Vladimir Putin didn’t agree to a Ukrainian ceasefire agreement, following a call with European leaders ahead of his meeting with the Russian leader.
Last week, confusion over whether gold bars would be subject to US tariffs prompted a spike in the premium for futures in New York over the spot price in London.

With sentiment balancing between measured near-term outlooks and the promise of a growing market, the upcoming earnings disclosure will be a key moment in gauging Okta’s position and its ability to navigate current conditions while pursuing longer-term growth.
About Okta Stock
Okta (OKTA) is headquartered in San Francisco, California, and operates as an independent identity management service with two main product lines, Okta Information Technology Products and Okta for Developers. With a market cap of roughly $15.6 billion, the company provides neutral, cloud-based identity solutions that integrate seamlessly with virtually any application, service, or cloud platform.
From a performance perspective, OKTA stock has slipped nearly 3.7% over the past 52 weeks. Yet in 2025, it has advanced almost 17%, comfortably ahead of the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) year-to-date (YTD) gain of 9.8%.
OKTA trades at 27.15 times forward-adjusted earnings and 5.46 times sales. These multiples sit above industry averages but remain below their own five-year historical levels, which some investors could view as a relative discount.
Okta Surpasses Q1 Earnings
On May 27, Okta delivered its first-quarter fiscal 2026 results, which surpassed Wall Street’s expectations. Revenue rose 11.5% year-over-year (YoY) to $688 million, beating the consensus estimate of $680 million. Subscription revenue also increased 11.6%, reaching $673 million.
Remaining performance obligations climbed to $4.084 billion, up 21% YoY, a signal of solid contracted demand ahead. The profitability picture was equally telling. Net income reached $62 million, reversing a loss of $40 million from the prior year’s quarter, while adjusted EPS grew 32.3% to $0.86, topping the $0.77 estimate.",659fb0380b1b3436b9184f6d7890da0e,trafilatura,2527,0

10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›
Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks come in all shapes and sizes, which is what makes AI such an attractive investment field. There are several ways to profit from this buildout, but one of my favorites is through the chipmakers.
At the top of the list is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), the world's leading contract chip manufacturer. TSMC, as it's known, dominates this space and looks to be getting stronger. Despite hitting a 52-week high, I still think it's undervalued and has room to run. It's one of my top stocks to buy now, and if you don't already own shares, it's not too late to pick some up.
Taiwan Semiconductor is a critical supplier to many AI companies
Taiwan Semiconductor is a chip fabricator, but it doesn't sell its products on the open market. Instead, it acts as a foundry for fabless chip companies like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Apple. Because of its customer base, it has massive exposure to the artificial intelligence buildout. AI hyperscalers are racing to construct data centers filled with massive processing power to train and run AI models. The chips within these data centers have to come from somewhere, and TSMC is the source of most of these chips.
While some may be concerned about TSMC's location, management is working to diversify its footprint and has plans to spend $165 billion to increase U.S. capacity. This will allow products like Nvidia's GPUs to have chips completely sourced from the U.S., which secures supply chains and sidesteps tariffs.
Taiwan Semiconductor has gone all-in on increasing chip production with heightened demand, and that will pay off for the company in the long term. It is the top partner of choice for many AI companies, and this trend is far from over.
However, the stock has risen 220% since the AI arms race began in 2023. So how does it have room for more?
Taiwan Semiconductor's growth and valuation make the stock look cheap
At the start of 2025, management gave a bold prediction that AI-related revenue would grow at a 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years, with overall revenue increasing at a 20% CAGR. That's market-crushing growth, yet TSMC's stock trades at about the same valuation as the broader market.",abf4beca107fdabc9fe697b84ce7f47e,trafilatura,2526,0

Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.
Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) is an industrial and construction machinery manufacturer. Despite the fact that the housing industry continues to struggle in 2025, the firm’s shares have gained 13.5% year-to-date. According to Cramer, Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) has benefited from growing activity surrounding data center construction. This time, he commented on a Morgan Stanley downgrade:
“Okay so let me just give you the thesis on that. The reason why that stock went up even though it missed the numbers is because people are looking for ways to be able to play the reshoring. . . .But CAT is going to be the recipient of huge number of orders because it’s very difficult to be able to, build anything large in this country without CAT being involved. So, that to me, he had a Hold on it during this great run, he has a Sell. I come back and I say, give me a break. That company, if it comes down, will be a natural way to be able to play what is happening. Which is David, conceivably one of the greatest explosion of building in country’s history, equal to the interstate highway system.”

“Yeah look if you commit 600 billion [Apple’s US investment] which is the larger than the gross domestic product of a series of countries as the President mentioned, then you’re going to need to have to move a lot of earth. And, I don’t think that you’re gonna spend a lot of money on other countries stuff that’s going to be tariffed, if you can buy stuff that’s made in this country. So it’s CAT. . .I think the downgrade to Sell is just kind of like I missed it and now it’s too high. It was a decent quarter, the inventories were low and they can rebuild. I think that you don’t wanna, I think that you know, you sell it for 10, 15 and you buy it back. I don’t know, be a hedge fund.”

The company's top- and bottom-line growth was robust in its fiscal fourth quarter of 2025.
-
The two metrics also topped the consensus analyst estimate; however, investors found certain developments worrying.
Photonics company Coherent (NYSE: COHR) wasn't a bright light on the stock exchange Thursday. Despite delivering a second quarter that (slightly) beat analyst estimates, factors such as growth deceleration in a key business segment raised some concern.
With that, more than a few market players assertively sold out of the stock to leave it with a loss of almost 20% on the day. That compared quite unfavorably to the more or less flat trajectory of the S&P 500 index.
A double beat wasn't good enough
For its fiscal Q4 of 2025, Coherent's revenue was $1.53 billion, notching a new record for the company. That figure was also 16% higher year over year. The company's non-GAAP (adjusted) net income grew more modestly, advancing by nearly 9% to $192 million or an even $1.00 per share.
Both headline figures came in slightly higher than the consensus analyst estimates of $1.51 billion for revenue and $0.92 for adjusted earnings per share (EPS).
Coherent attributed the improvements to the liveliness of certain revenue drivers, such as artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.
However, in a new research note on the company, analyst Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities pointed out that the company's revenue growth in the data center space was slowing. According to reports he wrote, this was 24% in Q4, but 39%, 46%, and 58% in the three preceding frames.
This was one of the factors that inspired Arya to downgrade his recommendation on the stock to neutral from his previous buy.
Modeling a better first quarter
Coherent management proffered guidance for its current (first) quarter. It believes revenue will fall between $1.46 billion and $1.6 billion, and adjusted EPS will come in at $0.93 to $1.13. Both ranges start well above Q4 of fiscal 2024's $1.31 billion on the top line and adjusted EPS of $0.61.
The average analyst estimates of, respectively, $1.55 billion and $1.03 per share for the present quarter are within the two guidance ranges.

The company did beat profit expectations, yet Wall Street’s attention quickly shifted to signs of slowing demand and a trimmed profitability outlook.
CFO Tricia Tolivar noted that the quarter began with strong same-store sales growth, which had prompted management to reaffirm its prior outlook when reporting first-quarter results. But the pace changed once the chain marked the one-year anniversary of its grilled steak launch.

The celebratory milestone appeared to coincide with a more gradual growth trajectory at existing locations. The reduced full-year EBITDA forecast only deepened investor caution. As a result, shares slid toward the 52-week low of $65.70, erasing a notable portion of this year’s earlier gains.
For a brand that had previously enjoyed robust traffic trends, the latest update introduces a new layer of scrutiny. Investors are now left to weigh whether this dip will become a value entry or a caution flag for portfolios that crave consistent sales growth.
About CAVA Stock
CAVA, headquartered in Washington, D.C., runs a growing network of restaurants. Beyond its physical footprint, the company extends its presence into grocery aisles with a line of dips, spreads, and dressings, while digital channels, including online and mobile ordering, remain a vital part of its strategy.
The market currently values CAVA at roughly $8.1 billion. Performance over the past year has been volatile. Over the last 52 weeks, shares have declined 25.4%, with a steeper 23.5% drop recorded in just the past month as revised guidance unsettled the market.
Valuation metrics, however, show that the market prices CAVA at a premium. It trades at 126.40 times forward-adjusted earnings and 6.93 times sales, both of which are well above the industry averages.
A Closer Look at CAVA’s Q2 Earnings
On Aug. 2, CAVA released its Q2 2025 results, offering a detailed look at current performance and the path ahead. Revenue rose 20.2% year over year to $280.6 million, missing analyst expectations of $286.6 million. Same-store sales increased 2.1%, outperforming much of the industry but falling short of the 6.1% growth forecast by Wall Street.",842cc87dd35c2307080ee30d2c0b8bd9,trafilatura,2519,0

Tesla stock has been a tale of two cities this year. For those who invested in it in early 2025, it’s down nearly 20% at the time of writing, but for ones that hopped on in early April, it’s up 50%.
Growing Robotaxi Services Could Benefit Tesla Stock
TSLA’s push to hire robotaxi operators in NYC indicates forward momentum in its autonomous vehicle strategy, an area investors increasingly view as a high-margin, scalable growth engine.
More importantly, plans of expanding into one of the world’s most complex urban environments signals management’s confidence in the company’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology.
Note that Tesla does not currently have regulatory authorization for its robotaxi services in NY, but the news still is a positive for TSLA shares.
Why? Because it reinforces the company’s commitment to capture future ride-hailing revenue, and its overall stature as a tech innovator, which may boost investor sentiment and speculative value.
Guggenheim Warns of a 50% Crash in TSLA Shares
CEO Elon Musk has already confirmed Tesla will open its robotaxi services to the public in Austin next month but a senior Guggenheim analyst doubts the company’s ability to effectively execute its robotaxi platform.
In a research note on Thursday, Ronald Jewsikow cited TSLA’s lack of transparency around Safety Monitors for his bearish view on the EV stock.
Given that human safety drivers are still present in Tesla’s robotaxis, it’s well within reason to assume that full autonomy isn’t ready, despite investor optimism, he told clients.
Guggenheim maintains its “Sell” rating on Tesla shares with a $175 price target indicating potential downside of about 50% from current levels.
Wall Street Remains Dovish on Tesla
While note as bearish as Guggenheim, other Wall Street firms aren’t particularly positive on TSLA stock either.
The consensus rating on Tesla stock currently sits at “Hold” only with the mean target of roughly $300 suggesting potential downside of some 10% from here.",6b7e056b902e20b7c9d03308866528a5,trafilatura,2500,0

OKB's price rocketed higher this week after OKX announced plans to do a one-time burn of over 65 million tokens.
-
After this, OKB's fixed supply will be down to 21 million tokens.
Since last Friday, OKB (CRYPTO: OKB), the native cryptocurrency of the crypto exchange OKX, has risen close to 108% as of 1:22 p.m. ET Thursday. The main reason for the move is because OKX plans to eliminate tens of millions of OKB tokens.
A key part of one of the largest crypto exchanges
The San Jose-based OKX crypto exchange is the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world based on daily trading volume. In 2018, the exchange launched a native token called OKB with a fixed supply of 300 million that is regularly reduced through burning and repurchases. OKB started as an ERC-20 token, meaning it was built on Ethereum's blockchain. However, the token eventually left Ethereum and started trading on OKX's own blockchain.
OKB is used by OKX for different programs on the exchange, and has been integrated by financial service providers, payment processors, and even some merchants, among other businesses.
However, the big reason for OKB's move this week is linked to OKX's decision to eliminate over 65 million OKB tokens through a one-time burn from previous repurchases and Treasury reserves. Following this, OKB will have a total supply of 21 million. This likely created a strong move based on completely new supply-and-demand dynamics.
Scarcity is a powerful tool
I find it interesting that the new fixed supply of OKB is similar to that of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency.
As of this writing, OKB trades for $93, which is much cheaper than Bitcoin. Could investors who believe in Bitcoin as a form of digital gold latch on to OKB as a cheaper crypto hedge against inflation? It's possible, but I still can't say with any certainty that any cryptocurrency including Bitcoin can actually hedge inflation.
While I do see some attractive characteristics associated with OKB, I am still advising caution after such a big move. It's still too early to invest anything more than a smaller, more speculative position that you are prepared to lose.
Should you buy stock in OKB right now?
Before you buy stock in OKB, consider this:
The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and OKB wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.",b951c34288530c4d16bd514e9aa386fc,trafilatura,2488,0

Dive Brief:
-
Customers see AI at work in marketing emails, advertising and customer service interactions, but that doesn’t mean they’re all that accepting of it. Only one-quarter of consumers say they like or love AI in customer service, according to a HubSpot and SurveyMonkey survey of 1,800 business leaders and 15,000 consumers across seven global markets, released Monday.
-
Just over half of consumers — 53% — actively dislike or hate AI's use in service interactions. Four in five say they’d prefer human support even if the outcome and wait time are the same.
-
“This widespread aversion suggests that current AI applications often fail to meet customer expectations for empathy, nuance and genuine connection,” Zoe Padgett, senior research scientist at SurveyMonkey, said via email. “Rather than seeing AI as a helpful tool, many customers perceive it as a barrier, leading to frustration and a feeling that their unique concerns aren't truly understood.”
Dive Insight:
Despite the growing prevalence of AI in customer service, customers still want to be able to talk to a human.
“While younger consumers are slightly more open to the technology, the preference for human interaction and support remains steadfast,” Padgett said. “This tells us that a one-size-fits-all AI strategy will likely fall short.”
Klarna’s customer strategy is a case in point. After going all in on an AI chatbot and reducing its workforce, the buy now, pay later firm began hiring customer service employees again this May. A spokesperson for the company told CX Dive that they want customers to always have the option to speak to a human.
“AI gives us speed. Talent gives us empathy,” a spokesperson told CX Dive at the time.
While AI can provide fast responses, some customers don’t see speed as paramount when it comes to their interactions with a company. A Five9 survey from March found that the vast majority of customers — 86% — say empathy and human connection are more important than a quick response in providing excellent customer experience.
That’s especially the case with complex or sensitive issues for which customers appreciate the reassurance offered by speaking to another human, experts told CX Dive. Even just knowing a human representative is available can reduce anxiety in customers stressed by self-service encounters, a recent study found.",77081b3350a76e5df72e35a984aded1e,trafilatura,2485,0

These low-priced shares can deliver explosive gains if the underlying company executes well and capitalizes on a fast-growing market. One such intriguing play right now is GameSquare (GAME), which is making a bold pivot into the world of cryptocurrency and Web3.
The company recently announced it will add Animecoin (ANIME-USD), a digital asset tied to anime production and Web3 strategy, to its treasury as part of a $2.5 million revenue agreement. In addition, GameSquare will serve as the agency of record for the Animecoin Foundation, helping to expand its global reach and strengthen its presence in the gaming sector.

Bullish Soared on Its First Trading Day. Should You Buy BLSH Stock?
For investors seeking speculative upside in digital assets and niche entertainment markets, GAME’s latest move could be worth a closer look.
About GAME Stock
Based in Texas, GameSquare is a small-cap media and technology company focused on reaching Gen Z and Millennial audiences through gaming and entertainment channels. It owns assets like FaZe Clan (a major esports team) and Stream Hatchet (a live-stream analytics firm) and operates an Ethereum-based (ETHUSD) treasury program to earn on-chain yields.
GameSquare is a highly speculative penny stock, hitting a low of $0.50 in April 2025 before rebounding to around $0.90–$0.95 by mid-August. Shares remain volatile, with a 48% drop over the past month, still up 12% YTD.
However, the company valuation looks pretty attractive for now, with a Price/Sales ratio of 0.32. That's significantly less expensive than the sector median of 1.27. This suggests the stock is undervalued compared to its peers.
What This Partnership Means for GAME’s Web3 Push
GameSquare's new Animecoin Foundation strategic partnership will be fundamental in expanding its Web3 presence. The company will purchase up to $2.5 million in Animecoin and act as the token’s marketing “agency of record” for one year, receiving $2.5 million in Animecoin for creative and promotional services. Valued at about $180 million fully diluted, Animecoin targets fans of both anime and gaming. The deal provides GameSquare with immediate revenue, diversifies its digital asset holdings, and offers upside if Animecoin’s value rises.",30e2434e71b7428fe93cdf0d2ef402e6,trafilatura,2479,0

Warren Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) (BRK.A), has built a legacy around delivering clear, candid guidance to investors. Known for his use of vivid metaphors and grounded logic, one of Buffett’s more striking observations reminds investors of the importance of personal responsibility: “The market, like the Lord, helps those who help themselves. But, unlike the Lord, the market does not forgive those who know not what they do.”
This quote appeared in Buffett’s 1982 annual letter to shareholders, and has endured as a succinct summary of his broader investing philosophy. It reflects a core belief that markets, while offering ample opportunities for those who act with informed intent and prudence, are inherently indifferent to the “sin” of ignorance. Investors who participate without understanding risks, fundamentals, or valuation can suffer lasting consequences, regardless of their intentions.
More News from Barchart
Buffett’s credibility in making this statement is hard-earned. Over his multi-decade career at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, he has steered the firm through multiple market cycles, consistently outperforming equity benchmarks and avoiding the same pitfalls that have undone others. His approach — rooted in the principles of value investing, risk awareness, and fundamental analysis — has served as a counterweight to the speculative fervor and emotional decision-making that frequently dominate market behavior.
The context of the quasi-religious quote underscores its practical relevance. Buffett wrote those words in a period when speculative market behavior was on the rise, and when many investors were relying on short-term momentum or hype rather than disciplined research. The remark served as a warning that the stock market offers no divine mercy. It may reward careful planning, but will not absolve poor judgment or lack of preparation.
That principle is as relevant today as it was four decades ago. In recent years, markets have witnessed dramatic surges in retail trading, the rise of meme stocks, and the proliferation of complex investment products easily accessible through apps. While some investors have benefited from these trends, others have learned costly lessons — often by entering positions without fully understanding the underlying businesses or risks.",7295617ed564b419d7580a25c0a76640,trafilatura,2478,0

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Band-Aid and Tylenol maker Kenvue attracted the attention of another activist investor in the second quarter, with Sachem Head Capital Management reporting that it bought into the stock.
Sachem, run by Scott Ferguson, said in a regulatory filing on Thursday that it owned 10.6 million shares in the consumer healthcare company on June 30.
According to the filing, Kenvue was the firm's fourth biggest holding at the end of the quarter after Twilio, Talen Energy and Seagate Technology Holdings.
Sachem Head declined to comment. The firm is known to quietly push for changes behind the scenes at certain companies, although it mounted a noisy proxy fight at US Foods Holding three years ago.
Kenvue, which was spun out of Johnson & Johnson and now has a market value of $40 billion, has faced some of the industry's most prominent activists, including Starboard Value, Third Point and Toms Capital Investment Management, in its two years as a publicly traded company.
In July, Kenvue's board fired CEO Thibaut Mongon, laying the path for what investors said they hope and expect will be the eventual sale of the company.
Investors have long complained about Kenvue's sluggish share price, which drifted down 1% this year, closing at $21.06 on Thursday.
Starboard was among the first to publicly press Kenvue to review how it positions its brands and how they are priced to help boost performance. The hedge fund settled its proxy fight with the company in March when Kenvue agreed to appoint three new directors, including Starboard CEO Jeffrey Smith.
Starboard, in a filing on Thursday, said it cut its Kenvue investment by 5.10% to 21 million shares.
But Toms Capital Investment Management, which has urged the company to consider strategic alternatives, raised its holding during the second quarter to 16 million shares, from 14.4 million shares at the end of the first quarter.
Third Point, run by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, bought into Kenvue during the first quarter but made no changes in the second quarter, to own 8.5 million shares on June 30.
Investment managers are required to tell regulators how much stock they owned in U.S. companies at the end of each quarter in 13F filings. While the filings are backward looking, other investors watch them closely for hints on trends, including suggestions of which companies activist investors might be targeting.

(Reuters) -The World Economic Forum closed an investigation on its founder Klaus Schwab on Friday, clearing him of any wrongdoing, and appointed BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Roche Holding's vice-chair Andre Hoffmann as interim co-chairs of its board.
The Geneva-based organisation had launched an investigation in April into 87-year-old Schwab following a whistleblower letter alleging misconduct.
The probe was announced a day after Schwab resigned as chairman. The forum at that time did not say why he was quitting.
For decades, Schwab has been the face of the WEF's annual gathering of business and political leaders in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos, which has become a symbol of globalisation.
The WEF said on Friday that its board had completed an investigation into allegations raised by anonymous whistleblowers against Schwab and found there was no evidence of material wrongdoing by him.
WEF also did not find any misconduct by Schwab's wife and former assistant, Hilde Schwab.
""Minor irregularities, stemming from blurred lines between personal contributions and forum operations, reflect deep commitment rather than intent of misconduct,"" WEF said.
The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the probe in April, had said an anonymous letter raised concerns about the WEF's governance and workplace culture, including allegations that the Schwab family mixed their personal affairs with the forum's resources without proper oversight.
In May, a spokesperson for Schwab informed Reuters that he had filed a criminal complaint against the whistleblowers.
The Schwab family denied all the allegations in the whistleblower complaint to the Journal.
Following the conclusion of the probe, a spokesman for Schwab told WSJ on Friday that he intends to drop his lawsuitspokesmanthe WEF and a separate legal action against anonymous whistleblowers.
The WEF also said Peter Brabeck-Letmathe had stepped down as interim chairman following the investigation’s conclusion.
In a statement posted on the WEF website, newly appointed co-chairs Fink and Hoffman said they were honored to take on the leadership role on an interim basis and looked forward to reinventing and strengthening the organisation.
WEF's Davos gathering has in recent years drawn criticism from opponents on both left and right as an elitist talking shop detached from lives of ordinary people.

LONDON (Reuters) -Shein's British business made 2.05 billion pounds ($2.77 billion) in sales in 2024, a 32.3% increase from the previous year, a filing by the online fast-fashion retailer showed early on Friday.
Shein does not report global results publicly, but the filing sheds light on its growth in Britain, its third-biggest market after the United States and Germany, as the company works toward an initial public offering in Hong Kong.
Founded in China and headquartered in Singapore, Shein has spent years attempting to list, first in New York and then in London, but faced criticism from U.S. and UK politicians and failed to get approval from China's securities regulator for the offshore IPO at a time of increasing tensions between China and the U.S.
The global retailer's UK business, Shein Distribution UK Ltd, reported a pretax profit of 38.25 million pounds in 2024, up 56.6% from 24.4 million pounds in 2023.
In the filing, Shein highlighted 2024 milestones, such as a pop-up shop in Liverpool, a Christmas bus tour across 12 UK cities and the opening of two new offices in Kings Cross and Manchester.
Known for deeply discounted prices, Shein runs constant promotions and offers coupons or rewards that encourage shoppers to keep buying. Shein has taken market share from retailers like ASOS and H&M as surging inflation dented consumers' spending power, driving them to hunt for bargains.
Shein has also broadened its offering beyond fashion — the UK site sells 7.99-pound ($10.84) dresses and 15-pound ($20.36) jeans, as well as everything from toys and craft supplies to storage units.
Shein's business has benefited from customs duty exemptions on low-value e-commerce packages that allow it to send goods directly from factories in China to shoppers' doorsteps largely tariff-free.
But that perk is on its way out, driving Shein's costs — and prices — up, particularly in the U.S., where imports from China are now subject to steep tariffs.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has scrapped its ""de minimis"" exemption for parcels under $800, and the European Union plans to remove its equivalent duty waiver on e-commerce parcels worth less than 150 euros.
Britain is also reviewing its policy on low-value imports after retailers said it was giving online players like Shein and Temu an unfair advantage.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.
Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s shares have entered a period of strong performance after the firm smoothed over its frictions with the Trump administration. It announced an additional $100 billion investment in American manufacturing, and the shares have gained 14.8% since CEO Tim Cook was well-received by President Trump in the White House. More recently, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)s App Store came under fire from Elon Musk after he accused the company of favoritism when it came to OpenAI. Musk believes that his Grok AI is being disadvantaged in the App Store and has sued Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Here is Cramer’s take on the affair:
“It wasn’t clear, although, I would tell you that I don’t believe, I think that, it’s pay to play, to be at the top. I tried to load DoorDash today and Grubhub came up. Pay to play, above DoorDash, that’s the way it works. This is, did anyone say that this is, that there is like a Truth In Lending here or anything? You can do whatever you want.”
Previously, the CNBC TV host discussed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s share price performance and the potential drivers:
“I kept hearing that Cook and the president didn’t get along because he wouldn’t commit to making the iPhone in the United States. The drum beat grew so loud that I even asked Tim in my private chat… is it possible for you to work with the president?… He came back and he said that he has good relations with the president…. Tim Cook, if he says the relationship is good, then it’s good, and that gave me the guts to tell you to stick with it. Now, with the stock at $220, nicely above where it was when the company reported, I need you to think about what has happened in the last 24 hours…
Could Apple go from being the most expensive to being the cheapest, the best one for the phone companies to offer, so they can get new accounts? Isn’t that what the stock’s monstrous move from 203 to 220 in just two days is telling us?…

Sep nat-gas prices on Friday recovered a bit from Wednesday's 9-month nearest-futures low as weather forecasts turned mixed versus the previous cooling trend. Atmospheric G2 said Friday that forecasts shifted warmer in the western half of the US, but cooler in the East for Aug 20-24.

Nat-gas prices were undercut Tuesday when the EIA raised its forecast for 2025 US nat-gas production by +0.5% to 106.44 bcf/day from July's estimate of 105.9 bcf/day. The EIA raised its forecast for 2026 US nat-gas production by +0.7% to 106.09 from July's 105.4 bcf/day forecast. US nat-gas production is currently near a record high, with active US nat-gas rigs recently posting a 2-year high.
US (lower-48) dry gas production on Friday was 109.9 bcf/day (+7.3% y/y), according to BNEF. Lower-48 state gas demand on Friday was 80.3 bcf/day (+1.2% y/y), according to BNEF. Estimated LNG net flows to US LNG export terminals on Friday were 15.7 bcf/day (+4.8% w/w), according to BNEF.
In a bearish factor, the Edison Electric Institute reported Wednesday that US (lower-48) electricity output in the week ended August 9 fell -1.9% y/y to 93,293 GWh (gigawatt hours), although US electricity output in the 52-week period ending August 9 rose +2.6% y/y to 4,257,529 GWh.
Thursday's weekly EIA report was slightly bearish for nat-gas prices since nat-gas inventories for the week ended August 1 rose +56 bcf, slightly above the consensus of +54 bcf and well above the 5-year weekly average of +33 bcf. As of August 8, nat-gas inventories were down -2.4% y/y, but were +6.6% above their 5-year seasonal average, signaling adequate nat-gas supplies. As of August 9, gas storage in Europe was 72% full, compared to the 5-year seasonal average of 79% full for this time of year.
Baker Hughes reported Friday that the number of active US nat-gas drilling rigs in the week ending August 15 fell by -1 to 122 rigs, slipping a bit farther from the 2-year high of 124 rigs posted on August 1. In the past year, the number of gas rigs has risen from the 4-year low of 94 rigs reported in September 2024.

Absolutely Not'
In the face of a frothy market, financial expert Jim Cramer encourages investors to stay the course, highlighting numerous positive stock narratives that counterbalance the market’s irrationality.
What Happened: Cramer made a case last week, asserting that the current market conditions are far removed from the dotcom bubble burst of the late 90s. He emphasized that despite the froth, today’s market is more rational.
Cramer drew attention to the irrationality in recent IPOs like Circle, Figma, and Bullish, which have witnessed significant gains since their launch.
On CNBC, he also noted Oklo Inc., a firm with ambitions to construct a compact nuclear reactor powered by nuclear waste, whose stock has surged 247% year-to-date.
“Flying cars, supercharged crypto ETFs, secretive companies that consult in magical ways, all irrational. I could go on and on,” Cramer said. “Is the widespread irrationality a reason to sell down your positions in perfectly rational stocks? Absolutely not.”

On the other hand, Cramer pointed to Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) as instances of rationality.
Amazon’s stock climbed by 3% after the introduction of same-day fresh food delivery in over 1,000 U.S. cities and towns. Eli Lilly’s stock also experienced a boost when a team from the pharmaceutical company’s management and board of directors purchased stock on the open market.
“Sure, there’s froth, but there are also perfectly legitimate moves in the stocks of great companies. I am calling this the year of magical thinking, but the truth is you can't get the runs in the good ones without the runs in the bad ones,” Cramer added.

Dive Brief:
-
Dillard’s eked out a sales bump in Q2, reporting Thursday that total retail sales (excluding its construction business) rose 1% year over year to $1.4 billion; store comps also rose 1%.
-
Retail gross margin dropped to 38.1% from 39.1% a year ago, with women’s apparel declining “significantly.”
-
Inventory was up 2% compared to a year ago. Net income, which does factor in the company’s construction unit, declined 2.3% to $72.8 million.
Dive Insight:
Dillard’s Q2 results beat analyst estimates and may give department store peers some hope.
“We were happy to achieve a sales increase for the first time in a while and encouraged by strengthening sales trends in July,” CEO William Dillard said in a statement. “In an operating environment that changes daily, we focused on controlling inventory, ending up 2% compared to 6% at the end of [the] first quarter.”
That environment includes consumers wary of tariffs’ impact on prices, a situation that has hit department stores and apparel sales (their dominant merchandise) especially hard. Off-price retailers have mostly benefited, though tariffs have emerged as more of a problem for them than previously thought.
Dillard’s said in its press release Thursday that Q2 gross margin, along with the steep decline in women’s apparel, rose moderately in shoes and slightly in ladies’ accessories and lingerie; fell slightly in men’s apparel and accessories; and was relatively flat in juniors’ and children’s apparel, cosmetics and home and furniture.
The retailer’s performance in the quarter could be a harbinger for department stores more generally, or a reflection of what many analysts see as standout fundamentals in the space, including strong merchandising, a regional store footprint and founding-family control.
“The company continues to buck the trend for department stores,” Zachary Warring, equity analyst at CFRA Research, said in emailed comments.
Still, Dillard’s isn’t immune to the challenges faced by its peers. From May to June, visits to its website fell in the mid-teens year over year, physical store sales fell 1.6%, and promotions are up, according to research earlier this month from UBS analysts led by Mauricio Serna.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency hit another all-time high Wednesday evening, surging past $124,100, according to data from Binance. But, since notching a new record, the token has dropped 5% and now hovers below $118,000.
Ethereum, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is also hovering near all-time highs but is down 4% over the past 24 hours at about $4,500, per Binance. Still, the token’s price has soared over the past month to increase by almost 50%.
The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has dropped almost 4% over the past day to around $4.07 trillion, according to CoinGecko, and the S&P 500 is slightly down Thursday since markets last closed.
Bitcoin’s Wednesday surge followed a bout of optimism about the prospect of rate cuts in September from the Federal Reserve. On Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported only a moderate increase in inflation in July of 2.7%. Analysts soon predicted that September rate cuts—which would likely prompt investors to take money out of U.S. Treasuries and put them into riskier bets like Bitcoin—were almost a given, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
“The near certainty of U.S. interest rate cuts lifts risk appetite and pressures the dollar,” said Axel Rudolph, senior technical analyst at IG, a UK-based financial firm.
But, on Thursday morning, the BLS reported a worrying price increase in July of 0.9% in goods made by U.S. producers. It was the biggest increase since June 2022, and the crypto market dipped along with the news.
“The recent pullback in crypto prices following a hotter-than-forecast reading on PPI seems to have shaken broader confidence in a Fed rate cut next month,” said Thomas Perfumo, global economist for Kraken, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the U.S.
Kyle Chasse, founder and chairman of the crypto venture firm MV Global, echoed Perfumo. “This spooks people,” he said of Thursday’s BLS report.
Despite the pullback, the crypto market is still near all-time highs. The total market capitalization continues to hover over $4 trillion, a mark it crossed for the first time in July amid a boom in the stock market and crypto-friendly policies from President Donald Trump.

(Reuters) -Applied Materials forecast fourth-quarter revenue and profit below estimates on Thursday, citing weak demand in China and erratic orders from customers facing uncertainty due to tariffs, sending its shares down nearly 13% in extended trading.
President Donald Trump's ongoing tariff negotiations and certain export restrictions to China have made it more difficult to forecast where the economy is headed, weighing on new orders for chipmaking tools suppliers such as Applied Materials.
Dutch firm ASML, the world's biggest supplier of chipmaking equipment, had warned earlier in July that it may not achieve revenue growth in 2026 as chipmakers building factories in the U.S. await clarity on the potential impact of tariffs.
""We are expecting a decline in revenue in the fourth-quarter driven by both digestion of capacity in China and non-linear demand from leading-edge customers given market concentration and fab timing,"" Applied's CFO, Brice Hill, said in a statement.
Tightened export controls on advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China prevent these companies from selling their most cutting-edge tools to Chinese customers.
In China, chipmakers are pausing new equipment orders to absorb recently added capacity for older‑generation, mainstream chips used in autos, industry and other everyday electronics, the company has said.
China, an essential market for chip companies, was Applied's largest revenue driver in the July quarter, accounting for 35% of total sales.
""Many peers have shown surprising China strength and given expectations for a decent pullback, but Applied Materials' results show much more volatility,"" said Brooks Idlet, senior analyst at CFRA Research.
Applied said its quarterly forecast assumed no approvals of its pending U.S. export license applications.
The company expects revenue of $6.70 billion, plus or minus $500 million, for the fourth quarter, compared with analysts' average estimate of $7.33 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.
It projected adjusted profit per share of $2.11, plus or minus $0.20, compared with estimates of $2.39.
The company's third-quarter revenue rose 8% to $7.30 billion from a year ago, beating estimates of $7.22 billion.
Its adjusted quarterly profit per share of $2.48 also exceeded estimates of $2.36.

YouTube’s adding another way for Shorts creators to make money from their content, with an expansion of Google partnership ads to app campaigns, which will enable creators to display app promotions in their clips.
As you can see in this example, with YouTube co-branded partnership ads for app campaigns, Shorts creators will be able to earn money from app promotions, with a custom CTA panel displayed along the bottom of their clip.
As explained by Google:
“Co-branded partnership ads offer a more visually engaging and authentic ad experience with YouTube creator partners to improve campaign performance. Additionally, on select AdMob inventory, playable ad formats can now be used as end cards after video ads to encourage increased interaction with viewers.”
It’s another option for creator partnerships, which will also give app developers the opportunity to partner with popular creators within their target niche, and boost awareness of their tools.
Brands will be able to connect with creators via BrandConnect, in order to offer opportunities for app promotions.
In addition to this, Google’s also giving more advertisers access to its evolving AI bidding tools:
“Fueled by the latest improvements to our AI-powered campaign models, target ROAS bidding is now available on iOS. This value-based bidding solution helps marketers more profitably acquire users, and is already driving results for advertisers. For example, after adopting tROAS bidding, Uatas, an Indonesia-based lending app, achieved a 7% increase in ROAS compared to its historical iOS campaign performance.”
Google’s AI tools can also help to expand your creative options, with its latest video enhancements for app campaigns enabling publishers to re-use their existing videos to fit different screen sizes and placements.
“Using our most advanced models, this solution can intelligently extend videos beyond their original frames or flip them while preserving key visual content.”
Some handy updates, which could provide a new avenue for monetization for Shorts creators, while also giving app developers more ways to maximize awareness.
Partnership ads for app campaigns are currently only available on iOS, but will be coming to Android soon.

Here is what Cramer said about monday.com Ltd. (NASDAQ:MNDY):
“What I have here in my hand, Josh Baer . . .who upgrades, Morgan Stanley upgrades after, brutal, look at that, that’s actually a decline. Now, why was Monday down? Monday is a company that does work processes. . . it’s like a junior ServiceNow if you want to.

But this is all part of this, enterprise software revulsion. We don’t want enterprise software, we want semiconductors. . .and I think that people should recognize that these companies are all being viewed as, let’s say carrion, because what’s happened is this that you can develop your own stuff that is better.

Here’s what Cramer said about Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) after the earnings report:
“Looks like one of my favorites, Cloudflare, is finally getting its due after the cybersecurity company reported an excellent quarter last Thursday night, only to see its stock sink 3.6% on Friday, was dragged down by that quarter’s sell-off. Today, though, Cloudflare snapped back, up more than 4%, which makes perfect sense because these guys delivered a clean beat and raise quarter with better-than-expected numbers in every line for the quarter, and truly strong guidance. Initially, none of this seemed to matter, but with today’s rally, the stock’s now sitting at its highest level in nearly four years and within spitting distance of its COVID-era peak.”

The sell-off came hours after bitcoin hit a fresh all-time high above $123,500, with traders unwinding risk across the board. Major memecoin dogecoin (DOGE) fell 9% to lead losses among majors, with Solana's SOL, XRP, and BNB Chain's BNB dropping between 3-7%.
Liquidation data shows $866 million in long positions were erased — more than six times the $140 million in shorts — as prices reversed sharply from recent highs.
Ether traders took the biggest hit, with $348.9 million liquidated, followed by Bitcoin at $177.1 million. Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin saw $64.2 million, $58.8 million, and $35.8 million in liquidations, respectively.
Bybit accounted for the largest share of the wipeout, at $421.9 million, with more than 92% of those losses stemming from overleveraged long positions. Binance followed with $249.9 million in liquidations, while OKX saw $125.1 million.
The largest single liquidation was an ETH-USDT perpetual swap worth $6.25 million on OKX.
Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, said the inflation surprise “put the brakes on an incredible crypto rally this past week,” adding that markets are likely to “hover around their current levels until more positive guidance comes from the Fed.” He noted the ongoing “threat of inflation continues to persist and could impact the likelihood of rate cuts in September.”
Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, pointed to the broader macro pressure on crypto’s recent gains.
“This week in crypto saw BTC reaching a new all-time high but later impacted by macroeconomic tremors,” he said in a Telegram message. “Inflation surged much higher than expected, reinforcing fears of sticky inflation and delaying Fed rate-cut expectations.""
""The sell-off underscores crypto’s growing sensitivity to macro liquidity shifts, with traders now eyeing labor metrics in early September for clues on the Fed’s next move. We’re optimistic that the market will rebound as the fundamental values of crypto driving the bull run remain in place,"" Ruck added.

With this boost in silver’s value, there comes a crucial question: What does this mean for your dollar?

The first and most obvious implication of silver’s increased value is that it is now, quite simply, more expensive to purchase. Those who invest in silver will be paying more for it. To put it another way, the amount of silver you’d own for $500 in 2025 is less than what you’d purchase for the same amount in 2024, as the dollar is not growing with the metal.

A Weakening Dollar
Speaking of the dollar not buying as much: Periods of increased previous metal values tend to inversely indicate a period of weak currency, as the dollar’s purchasing power inherently diminishes in the face of silver (and gold’s) rising value.
Inflation on the Rise?
Historically, an increase in silver’s value often hints at (or outright reflects) investor skittishness about inflation. Silver’s rise is often concomitant with investors preparing for an expected increase in inflation because of the dollar’s devaluation. While not an guarantor of inflation, a steep rise in silver’s value should be taken as a serious financial omen, at the very least.

Shares of the industrial giant are still down over 6% at writing.
Investors are bailing on DE shares primarily because management trimmed its full-year outlook, citing lower pricing in the agricultural and construction equipment business.

Despite the post-earnings decline, Deere stock is still up roughly 19% versus its year-to-date low.
Is It Worth Buying Deere Stock on the Post-Earnings Weakness?
According to Oppenheimer analyst Kristen Owen, it makes sense for Deere to take a “cautiously optimistic” stance on the future guidance especially given the current trade uncertainties.
However, there were ample positives in the company’s earnings report to warrant buying DE stock on the post-earnings dip.
For example, “they’re seeing a little bit of incremental demand in Europe. They’re seeing South America – a challenged market for the last two years – start to percolate,” Owen told CNBC in an interview on Thursday.
She maintained her “Outperform” rating on Deere shares today. Her $560 price objective indicates potential upside of some 18% from here.
Innovation Could Drive DE Shares Up in the Back Half of 2025
On “Money Movers,” Owen said innovation in agricultural technology – like DE’s “see and spray” systems – is helping farmers reduce costs while maintaining high yields, which makes them willing to pay a premium.
This lifts pricing power for Deere, meaning it can charge more for its advanced equipment. That’s a positive for DE shares because it supports strong margins and revenue growth, even in a down-cycle for farm equipment.
USDA’s recent bullish forecasts for yield reflect not just good weather, but the impact of this tech, reinforcing Deere’s role as a leader in precision agriculture, she concluded.
Note that Deere stock currently pays a dividend yield of 1.35% as well, which makes it even more attractive as a long-term holding.
Deere Remains a ‘Buy’-Rated Stock Among Wall Street Analysts

This momentum aligns with fresh optimism from the analyst community. Mizuho Securities recently raised its price target on MSTR stock from $563 to $586, and maintained an “Outperform” rating.

Circle Internet Group (NYSE:CRCL) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.
Circle Internet Group (NYSE:CRCL)’s shares have gained 84% year-to-date due to its place in the stablecoin industry and favorable legislation for the digital tokens. However, the stock is down by 25% over the past month on the back of several catalysts such as the firm’s announcement to raise capital through a share sale. Cramer’s previous comments about Circle Internet Group (NYSE:CRCL) have outlined that while it does have the benefit of being an early mover in the industry, the lead might not last due to no competitive advantage. He maintained the sentiment this time as well:
“Well I just think, I still believe and I know that Circle, does not like my analysis, necessarily. They’re . .actually very forthcoming guys and they have a good rap. But, I just think that other companies can do it. They do, David, have a tremendous first mover advantage. And it does matter. Coinbase did too, I mean it’s just first mover advantage.
Here are his previous thoughts about Circle Internet Group (NYSE:CRCL):
“Next up, the larger deal was Circle Internet Group. The IPO market was starting to heat up… by the time Circle came public in early June. But even though Circle upsized its deal significantly and raised its offer price range and then still priced well above the high end of the range, it wasn’t ambitious enough. Deal priced at 31, but the stock opened for trading at 69. Within three weeks, it was nearly at 300. It’s since cooled off around, they’ve come down to 165, but that’s still probably way too high. I think winners from CoreWeave rolled their take into Circle and turned it into a meme stock.”

(NYSE:T) customers, both present and past, stand to receive up to $7,500 as part of a proposed $177 million settlement. This settlement is in response to two significant data breaches that affected millions of AT&T customers.
What Happened: AT&T Inc. has suggested a settlement amounting to $177 million. This sum includes $149 million for the initial class-action lawsuit and an additional $28 million for the second one.
The first data breach, revealed in March 2024, impacted 73 million account holders, with hackers obtaining personal information and disseminating it on the dark web. A subsequent breach in July 2024 compromised the call and text records of almost all AT&T customers.
According to the report by New York Post, the settlement is yet to receive approval, with a final hearing set for December 3 in the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Customers who had their data compromised can apply for compensation before the hearing.
They will be notified via an email from Kroll Settlement Administration and must submit a claim form by November 18.

Customers affected by the March 2024 breach can claim up to $5,000, while those impacted by the July breach can claim up to $2,500. Customers who were affected by both breaches could be eligible for up to $7,500.
AT&T will require evidence of losses associated with the breaches. Payouts are anticipated to commence by the end of the year, but may be postponed if appeals are lodged after the hearing.
Why It Matters: This settlement proposal comes as a significant development for AT&T customers who were affected by the data breaches.
The proposed compensation not only acknowledges the inconvenience and potential harm caused by the breaches, but also serves as a reminder of the importance of robust data security measures for companies handling sensitive customer information.
The outcome of the final hearing will be closely watched, as it could set a precedent for future data breach settlements.

The tech and retail giant's stock has been a middling performer among the big names for much of the year. It was essentially flat in the first half, while a popular Magnificent 7 exchange-traded fund moved higher and both underperformed the benchmark S&P 500. More recently, shares of Amazon (AMZN) have shown substantial life.
They finished Thursday up nearly 3%, extending Wednesday gains and leaving them just over 5% for the year—fifth-best among the group of seven tech giants year-to-date. Behind the latest bump: enthusiasm for yesterday's announcement that it would extend a move into fast delivery of fresh groceries, seen as a shot across the bows of other retailers and delivery companies. (Think Walmart (WMT), Instacart (CART) and Kroger (KR), for example.)
Several Wall Street analysts applauded the move, which followed a second-quarter earnings announcement that disappointed some investors. ""Fresh grocery has been a significant missing piece in Amazon's offering [versus] competitors,"" Bank of America wrote, naming Walmart and Target (TGT). ""With better grocery capabilities, Amazon should see important customer frequency benefits and potential lock-in.""
Is There a 'New Narrative' for Amazon?
Morgan Stanley estimates that offline grocery spending is worth about $1.5 trillion in the U.S., or nearly half of all offline consumer spending. Fresh and perishable goods, they write, are about 45% of that total; Amazon, they said, was at risk of losing grocery market share before its latest move.
Better grocery service could also boost the value of Prime membership, according to JP Morgan analysts, who think the company could raise membership prices next year without significantly causing churn or eating into customer acquisition.
Amazon is widely liked by Street analysts, who according to Visible Alpha are unanimously bullish. The current consensus price target, near $262, suggests a roughly 13% premium to Thursday's close. That's a solid enough outlook—to be sure, some Magnificent Seven stocks managed double-digit gains in the first half of 2025 alone—but CNBC's Jim Cramer, to name one observer, is now talking about a ""new narrative"" for the company.
Based on the stock's latest rise, investors were eager to hear one.

(Reuters) -Australia's ANZ Group said on Friday its net loans and customer deposits rose in the third quarter as lending for home purchases and businesses stayed strong, extending a run of growth among major domestic banks.
In a limited quarterly trading update, ANZ said its credit risk-weighted assets edged higher due to growth in its retail bank's home lending, and institutional lending. ANZ does not publish quarterly profit figures, unlike most of its major rivals.
ANZ shares climbed more than 1% to A$32.88 in mid-morning trading, outpacing a 0.2% gain in the benchmark S&P/ASX200.
The Australian economy has held steady. Business surveys are generally upbeat and consumer spending has picked up in the last couple of months as lower borrowing costs and past tax cuts feed through to incomes.
ANZ, Australia's fourth-largest bank by market value, said its common equity tier 1 ratio, a key metric of spare cash, rose by 16 basis points since March to 11.9%.
Mortgage payments in Australia past their due date for 90 or more days rose 4 bps to 88 bps compared to last year, the banking group said in the trading update.
Home loan delinquencies across each of the major Australian banks are considered low, despite high cost of living pressures.
ANZ reported an A$19 billion ($12.35 billion) boost to customer deposits in the quarter, driven by an 8% increase in institutional deposits. Its net loans and advances grew 2%.
Market leader Commonwealth Bank, and Westpac, this week reported lending and deposit growth in their full-year and third-quarter results.
ANZ's chief executive Nuno Matos ordered last week a strategic review into the bank's operations, focused on the integration of Suncorp's banking business into the organisation after its 2024 acquisition.
Suncorp's risk-weighted assets stood at A$34.1 billion at the end of the June quarter, up slightly from the previous quarter, the trading update showed.
Matos, who became chief executive in May, is expected by analysts to deliver a strategic briefing on the bank's outlook before its full-year results are published on November 10.

CoreWeave, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV) is one of the worst-performing stocks on Wednesday.
CoreWeave snapped a four-day winning streak on Wednesday, slashing 20.83 percent to close at $117.76 apiece as investors resorted to profit-taking following the previous days’ surge buoyed by a strong earnings performance, while digesting uncertainties surrounding its planned $9-billion merger with Core Scientific.
In an updated report, CoreWeave, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV) grew its revenues by 207 percent to $1.2 billion from only $395 million in the same period last year. This resulted in a 10-percent narrower net loss of $290.5 million as compared with the $323 million in the same period last year.
“Our strong second quarter performance demonstrates continued momentum across every dimension of our business,” said CoreWeave, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV) co-founder and Chairman Michael Intrator.
”We are scaling rapidly as we look to meet the unprecedented demand for AI. Our purpose-built AI cloud platform continues to set new benchmarks for performance and scalability, including becoming the first company to offer the complete Blackwell GPU portfolio at scale, making CoreWeave the platform of choice for the world’s most advanced AI workloads and AI pioneers,” he added.
In other developments, a major Core Scientific shareholder expressed opposition against the company’s planned merger with CoreWeave, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV), saying that it was disappointed over the “inadequate valuation.”

Two Seas Capital, which owns approximately 6.5 percent of Core Scientific, Inc.

Berkshire (BRK.A, BRK.B) at the end of the second quarter held 5 million shares of UnitedHealth Group (UNH) valued at about $1.6 billion. The company has likely been accumulating shares since the fourth quarter of last year, when it first asked regulators to let it build a position in secret to avoid a price spike. Shares of UnitedHealth Group jumped more than 10% in extended trading Thursday.
Berkshire also opened smaller new positions in security products provider Allegion (ALLE), homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI), Lamar Advertising (LAMR), and steelmaker Nucor (NUE), all of which saw their stocks rise after hours.
T-Mobile (TMUS) was Berkshire’s sole exit. The conglomerate sold the entirety of its $1 billion stake in the telecommunications giant. It also offloaded nearly half of its Charter Communications (CHTR) holdings.
Berkshire made smaller cuts to two of its largest holdings, selling 20 million of its 300 million Apple (AAPL) shares and 26 million of its 630 million Bank of America (BAC) shares. Buffett began paring Berkshire’s stakes in both last year.
Buffett scooped up 3 million shares of Chevron (CVX), another of his biggest holdings, and left stakes in longtime investments Coca-Cola (KO) and American Express (AXP) untouched.
Berkshire slashed its exposure to banks in the first quarter, exiting its position in Citigroup (C) and trimming its holdings of Bank of America and Capital One (COF). On the flip side, the firm added to some of its food and beverage holdings, including alcohol maker Constellation Brands (STZ) and Domino’s Pizza (DPZ).
In the second quarter, the firm seemed to favor homebuilders. On top of entering D.R. Horton, Berkshire bought about 7 million shares of competitor Lennar (LEN), upping its stake from just 150,000 shares.
Berkshire shares have shed about 11% of their value since Buffett announced in early May that he would step down as CEO at the end of 2025. Still, the stock is up almost 6% since the start of the year.

XPeng stock gained 64% year-to-date. The EV maker's weekly registrations fell 12.9% to 7,900 units from August 4–10, but surged 229.2% year-over-year, defying a weaker Chinese EV market after July's 5% month-on-month sales drop.
Lower-priced EVs under 100,000 yuan with basic self-driving features drove demand, while Fitch expects a fourth-quarter rebound as buyers rush to beat upcoming EV sales tax hikes.
Price Action: XPEV shares are trading higher by 2.12% to $19.79 premarket at last check on Friday.

Freddie Mac's latest Primary Mortgage Market Survey, released Thursday, showed that the average rate on the benchmark 30-year fixed mortgage fell to 6.58% from last week's reading of 6.63%.
The average rate on a 30-year loan was 6.49% a year ago.
""Mortgage rates fell to their lowest level since October,"" said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist. ""Purchase application activity is improving as borrowers take advantage of the decline in mortgage rates.""
The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage on Oct. 24, 2024, was 6.54%.

The U.S. is still in the midst of a housing affordability crisis, that continues to deepen with high home prices and elevated interest rates reducing homebuying to its lowest level since the mid-1990s, according to the annual State of the Nation's Housing report from the Joint Center for Housing Studies (JCHS) of Harvard University.
To exacerbate issues, homeowners and landlords are also facing higher insurance premiums and property taxes. The exorbitant rent has also left ""more people than ever cost burdened, and has contributed to a sharp rise in homelessness,"" according to the report.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Thursday that one of his top priorities is addressing the U.S. housing affordability crisis.

“In retail we call it football, that means the price can be fungible, we don’t know what it’s going to actually be. Right now people are saying Elf Beauty may have to do some discount. I’ve got Tarang Amin on, he’s been a remarkable performer. Long term, short term it has not, been down 21. I want to hear what he to say. They are doing a big launch for Sephora, for one of their divisions. But right now, they don’t like it. And it could change because the shorts do panic if there’s a good story. But right now they don’t like it.”

LONDON (Reuters) -Oil markets are set for a muted price reaction when they open on Sunday after U.S. President Donald Trump's and Russian leader Vladimir Putin's meeting in Alaska, at which Trump said a fully-fledged peace deal was the aim for Ukraine rather than a ceasefire.
Trump said he had agreed with Putin that negotiators should go straight to a peace settlement - not via a ceasefire, as Ukraine and European allies, until now with U.S. support, have been demanding.
Trump said he would hold off imposing tariffs on countries such as China for buying Russian oil following his talks with Putin. He has previously threatened sanctions on Moscow and secondary sanctions on countries such as China and India that buy Russian oil if no moves are made to end the Ukraine war.
""This will mean Russian oil will continue to flow undisturbed and this should be bearish for oil prices,"" said ICIS analyst Ajay Parmar. ""It is worth noting that we think the impact of this will be minimal though and prices will likely see only a small dip in the very near term as a result of this news.""
The oil market will wait for developments from a meeting in Washington on Monday between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. European leaders have also been invited to the meeting, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
""Market participants will track comments from European leaders but for now Russian supply disruption risks will remain contained,"" said Giovanni Staunovo, analyst at UBS.
Brent settled at $65.85 a barrel on Friday, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate at $62.80 - both down nearly $1 before the talks in Alaska.
Traders are waiting for a deal, so until that emerges, crude prices are likely to be stuck in a narrow range, said Phil Flynn, a senior analyst with Price Futures Group.
""What we do know is that the threat of immediate sanctions on Russia, or secondary sanctions on other countries is put on hold for now, which would be bearish,"" he said.
After the imposition of Western sanctions, including a seaborne oil embargo and price caps on Russian oil, Russia has redirected flows to China and India.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A U.S. appeals court on Friday granted Argentina's request to put on temporary hold a judge's order that it turn over its 51% stake in oil and gas company YPF to partially satisfy a $16.1 billion judgment won by two investors.
In a brief order, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan stayed U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska's June 30 turnover order while Argentina appeals.
Friday's order provides a reprieve for Argentine President Javier Milei's government, which warned of irreparable harm and economic instability if it gave up its stake in YPF, the country's largest energy company.
Argentina is separately appealing the $16.1 billion judgment, which Preska awarded in September 2023 to Petersen Energia Inversora and Eton Park Capital Management.
The investors are represented by litigation funder Burford Capital, which would share in their damages.
Lawyers for Petersen and Eton Park did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Friday's order did not provide reasons for the stay, which should last at least a few months. Argentina's next legal filing related to YPF is due on September 25, court records show.
The dispute stemmed from Argentina's 2012 decision to seize the YPF stake from Spain's Repsol without making a tender offer to minority shareholders.
Argentina had argued that the YPF shares were immune from turnover under the federal Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.
The U.S. government sided with Argentina, saying a resolution of the dispute should not be rushed and potentially interfere with relations between the countries.
Lawyers for the investors countered that a commercial activity exception to immunity, together with Argentina's ""many years"" of evasion, justified a turnover.
In her June 30 order, Preska said Argentina's control over the YPF shares triggered the exception, and the country could not simply invoke its own laws to prevent a turnover.
A spokesperson for the Argentine government said the country welcomed Friday's order, and confident the $16.1 billion damages award would also be overturned.

The firm maintains a positive outlook toward nuclear operators and particularly assigns a premium valuation for Vistra to reflect its strong growth expectations compared to regulated utilities.
The firm noted that the Lotus Infrastructure gas generation acquisition announced in May 2025 will likely close in Q4 2025 of early Q1 2026. While broad-based tariff concerns did result in a major draw down of the shares, they have since recovered.
A financial analyst speaking on a microphone and discussing the company's future prospects in front of a trading board.
“We anticipate that the Lotus Infrastructure gas generation acquisition will close in Q4 2025 or early Q1 2026, helping VST capture upside from rapidly rising electricity demand trends. Shares have recovered to near all-time highs after a significant drawdown in Q2 based on broad-based tariff concerns, and we look favorably on the company recently raising 2026 EBITDA guidance, which we note is not inclusive of potential upward adjustments due to the Lotus Infrastructure deal.”
The firm also emphasized that nuclear power is one of the relative “winners” under the OBBB legislation.
“We also see nuclear power as one of the relative “winners” under the OBBB legislation, with tax credits maintaining their long-term status under the original IRA provisions. We expect roughly 11% EPS CAGR (on a GAAP basis) and 8% dividend CAGR from 2024-2027.”

Further, in a market rewarding acquirers (and with tax support for generation M&A deals) – and especially now that Talen’s story and equity currency benefit from the recent AWS deal and strategic CCGT addition – TLN’s M&A potential, either as a target or buyer, adds torque to this play.

(Reuters) -Blackstone-backed engineering and maintenance service provider Legence revealed that losses nearly tripled in the first six months of 2025 in its paperwork for an initial public offering in the U.S.
The terms of the proposed public offering were not disclosed in the filing made public on Friday.
The U.S. IPO market has seen a resurgence in activity with a flurry of companies coming forward to list their shares to tap growing investor confidence, after a slowdown in April due to trade policy changes.
Recent employment data points to a softer macroeconomic outlook but raises the chances of near-term rate cuts and lower volatility, potentially boosting positive IPO sentiment into the fall season, said IPOX research associate Lukas Muehlbauer.
Transit-tech firm Via also publicly filed to go public in New York on Friday.
Shares of cryptocurrency exchange Bullish more than doubled in their New York debut earlier in the week, while space tech firm Firefly Aerospace also received a blockbuster response earlier in the month.
Blackstone, the world's largest alternative asset manager, acquired Legence from private equity firm Gemspring Capital in 2020.
The San Jose, California-based company offers services for the built environment, including sustainability, consulting and green construction, helping clients reduce operating costs and carbon emissions.
Net loss attributable to the company came in at $26.5 million on a revenue of $1.10 billion in the first six months of 2025, compared with a loss of $8.8 million on a revenue of $989.6 million in a year ago.
Over the years, Legence has bulked up through acquisitions of rivals such as Corporate Sustainability Strategies, P2S, A.O. Reed and OCI Associates.
Blackstone last month said it is preparing more companies to go public than any other time since the record IPO year of 2021.
Goldman Sachs and Jefferies are the lead book-running managers for the offering. The company intends to list its shares on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol 'LGN'.

While valuation remains elevated, the growth and scale justify that premium, in our view. We now use a 22x multiple on our new 2027 estimate to achieve our $16 PT.

Pfizer Inc.

The gains were a much-needed boost to the stock, which is still down by 5.6% year-to-date, as the firm has struggled to grow revenue in a turnaround effort led by CEO Albert Bourla. Cramer lamented that Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)’s stock didn’t move higher on the news:
“Bladder cancer. Now that is left over from the Seagen. The Seagen deal, that was supposed to be very, very important. They spent a fortune on Seagen.

“There’s another one, that I’m not so sure of, reporting at the same time, though, Pfizer. We need to see some really dramatic results here from the clinical trials like the ones that Pfizer picked up when they bought the Seagen at the end of 2023.

Even though BigBear.ai is facing “near-term execution issues,” the rating affirmation is a reflection of “secular tailwinds and improved financial flexibility” for the company. According to the firm, second-quarter results have been underwhelming, with top-line miss largely attributed to federal program disruptions related to the U.S. Army’s efforts to consolidate its data architecture.

“BigBear.ai delivered an underwhelming 2Q25, with revenues declining 18.4% to $32.5 million, and falling short of FactSet consensus estimates. The top-line miss was largely driven by federal program disruptions related to the U.S. Army’s efforts to consolidate its data architecture. However, the quarter demonstrated solid progress on key initiatives, including core product development and balance sheet improvements. The ending backlog of $380 million represents a 42.9% y/y increase. The firm also lowered its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to a range of $125 million to $140 million and withdrew its prior Adjusted EBITDA guidance, which had projected a negative single-digit million range.”

Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW)’s shares also jumped by 11.9% after the firm’s latest earnings report. Cramer discussed the firm in detail in the context of its relationship to Apple:
“You know, I think they had to talk about Corning. Actually, I don’t know if you guys heard, on Squawk, but, they’ve been the favorite guys even when Steve Jobs ran it. Walter Isaacson knows more than anybody. . .what I think is amazing, I covered that family when I was at Goldman Sachs. They’ve been quietly making the best, including fiber. And what I think the president has to do, working with Tim Cook, is find others that can be like Corning. But it’s the history of being the best. We do not have the history of being the best for a lot of other products. That has to change. And I think everyone here is just saying, it won’t matter. No, I think this is a very significant expansion. I don’t take this lightly. I think that we’re gonna start a supply chain and this is how it starts. This is how the supply chain starts.”

Cramer discussed the sentiment surrounding enterprise software stocks and CEO Marc Benioff’s attempts to counter it:
“. . .and I think that people should recognize that these companies are all being viewed as, let’s say carrion, because what’s happened is this that you can develop your own stuff that is better.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) -The joint operators of Argentina's Veladero gold mine, Barrick Gold and Shandong Gold, are seeking to add a $400 million project to a new government regime designed to attract large investments.
WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
The project, submitted to Argentina's Large Investment Incentive Scheme (RIGI), aims to boost the mine's output by 1.6 million ounces over its useful life through a $400 million investment between 2025 and 2028, company sources told Reuters on Thursday.
CONTEXT
The application was submitted to Argentina's Economy Ministry in early August, though the details were not disclosed until Thursday. The project is managed by the joint venture formed in 2017 after Shandong Gold acquired a 50% stake in the mine from Barrick Gold.
The RIGI framework, which went into effect last year, is a key part of libertarian President Javier Milei's economic reforms aimed at boosting investment. It provides companies with tax, customs and foreign-exchange benefits, as well as guaranteeing legal stability for 30 years.
Gold was Argentina's primary mining export last year, accounting for 68% of the sector's total shipments with a value of $3.14 billion, according to data from the country's mining secretariat. High metals prices drove the performance, with silver and lithium ranking as the next largest exports.
BY THE NUMBERS
The Veladero mine produced 504,000 ounces of gold last year and forecasts output of 380,000 to 440,000 ounces for 2025. The mine, located at an altitude of about 4,000 meters (13,123 feet) in the Andes, has been in operation since 2005.
The proposed investment aims to fund the construction of new mining phases, which will add 89.2 million tons of capacity for stockpiling and processing new ore.
WHAT'S NEXT
The project is projected to add $3.8 billion in export revenue over its lifespan through 2033, the sources said. The Veladero mine currently employs 3,800 people, with 91% of the workforce hired from the local San Juan province.

The ports are part of a broad expansion plan being organized by the waterway's administration. It aims to increase services related to cargo handling, including trans shipment, storage and gas transportation, and to secure fresh water for operations.
""There is a large demand for facilities and terminals,"" said Ricaurte Vasquez, head of the waterway, at a conference on Thursday, without elaborating on details.
The Panama Canal Authority did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Its top executives have previously said the waterway plans to invest some $8.5 billion in the next five years to update and expand its infrastructure.
A key project included in the planning, the construction of a large dam to contain the Indio river and create a new water reservoir, will be discussed at Panama's Supreme Court after affected communities filed a lawsuit against it last month.
Another tender to offer a project to build a liquefied petroleum gas pipeline within the canal zone also is in preparation and could be launched next year, the source added.
U.S. President Donald Trump this year threatened to take over the Panama Canal amid criticism of what his government has called the increasing influence of China over the Central American country.
Meanwhile, Panama's President Jose Mulino has moved to end a 25-year concession to Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison for the operation of two key separate ports outside of the canal zone amid criticism of the contract's terms.
CK Hutchison said on Thursday that a $22.8 billion deal with a group led by BlackRock and shipping firm MSC to sell most of its global port business, including the two ports in Panama, had a ""reasonable chance"" of going through.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) -Brazilian food processor BRF, the world's largest chicken exporter, said on Thursday it earned 735 million reais ($136 million) in the second quarter despite disruptions from a bird flu outbreak in May that triggered trade bans.
The company, which also processes pork and prepared food products, said earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure of operating income known as EBITDA, was 2.5 billion reais in the period, in line with the average of analysts' forecasts.
Sales totaled 15.36 billion reais, a 2.9% annual rise, BRF said.
Citing official trade data, BRF executives said the bird flu outbreak caused Brazilian poultry exports to fall 15% in the quarter while the company's own poultry exports dropped 5%, indicating it was able to weather the storm.
At a press conference, executives noted BRF redirected some chicken products to the domestic market, or found alternative destinations for certain cuts after multiple bird flu-related trade embargoes.
China, a key export destination, remains closed for Brazilian poultry products after the outbreak, which the government has controlled.
However, Saudi Arabia will resume buying from Brazil, BRF executives told reporters, citing official government communications.
Sales volume grew about 6% in BRF's home market, driven by processed food, which scored a record high for any second quarter for the company. BRF's Brazil EBITDA reached 1.3 billion reais and margins were a healthy 16.4%, BRF said.
In international markets, BRF said it was able to maintain ""competitive pricing levels."" The company recorded adjusted EBITDA of 1.2 billion reais for the business and a margin of 17.3%.
In the second quarter, BRF said it obtained 11 new export authorizations, highlighting key markets such as Argentina and Canada.
BRF said the company had the best half-year in history, referring to results between January and June, with EBITDA of 5.3 billion reais and net profit of 1.9 billion reais in the period.

On July 22, Bernstein SocGen Group reiterated an ‘Outperform’ rating on the stock and raised the price target to €28 from €27. The positive stance follows the stock’s remarkable strength year to date.
The Irish airline continues to deliver solid results by benefiting from fare growth. Fares have increased compared to both 2023 and 2024, attributed to high demand for revenge travel. The high travel demand has resulted in a 9.24% increase in revenue and a 28.86% improvement in the gross profit margin. In June, the airline carried 19.9 million passengers, marking 3% year-over-year increase, affirming the strong demand.
In addition, Ryanair has been effective in cost control, with unit costs excluding fuel increasing by just 1.6% amid robust revenue growth. While Bernstein expects non-fuel costs to increase by between 3% and 4% for the year, the lower fuel costs are expected to help offset this increase. Therefore, total cost growth is likely to be below management guidance.
Ryanair Holdings plc (NASDAQ:RYAAY) is an Irish airline holding company that provides low-fare, short-haul passenger airline services to destinations with a network connecting over 240 destinations in more than 40 countries.

The major gauges wavered for much of the session, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closing down slightly, and the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rising just above the flatline to notch a third record close in a row. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) closed just below its record high.
July's Producer Price Index (PPI) came in well above expectations, with month-over-month prices rising 0.9% compared to expectations of 0.2%. On an annual basis, prices rose 3.3%, the most since February. ""Core"" producer prices, which strip out the cost of food and energy, saw the largest increase in three years.
Euphoria over a possible September rate cut had swept Wall Street over the past two sessions after July's Consumer Price Index report showed inflation rose as expected, but not dramatically. Traders had fully priced in a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting, even as some Fed policymakers continue to urge patience.
By Thursday, the vast majority of bets were still on a cut, but nearly 10% of traders were pricing in a rate hold. Meanwhile, bets on a ""jumbo"" 50-basis-point cut evaporated.
The inflation shock sapped some of the enthusiasm out of a roaring market this week. Stocks extended their rally on Wednesday, pushing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to consecutive record highs. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) got a boost from mounting rate-cut bets, too, reaching a new record high Wednesday evening before rolling over.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) -China and Europe will resume buying chicken products from Brazil ""in a matter of days or weeks"" as local authorities controlled a bird flu outbreak that triggered trade bans in the second quarter, Brazilian food processor BRF SA said on Friday.
Brazil's first bird flu case at a chicken breeder farm last May sparked a number of trade restrictions that were gradually lifted by importers as the world's largest poultry exporter controlled the outbreak.
The government declared Brazil free of the highly contagious disease in June.
In a conference call on BRF's quarterly results, management said food inventories had risen above desirable levels due to the export restrictions, a situation BRF aims to resolve in the short term.
""As those two markets reopen we will return to inventory levels more closer to zero,"" CEO Miguel Gularte told an analyst on the call. ""It is our philosophy not to keep inventories without sales.""
BRF described China and Europe as ""extremely important"" markets. On Thursday, management had welcomed a decision by Saudi Arabia and Chile to resume purchases, citing official government disclosures.
BRF said it redirected some chicken cuts usually sold to China to other markets. The company's poultry exports fell by 5% last quarter, compared with an overall drop of 15% for Brazilian exports.
Goldman Sachs said BRF's results were surprisingly positive given the challenging scenario.
The company's shares rose almost 4% in late morning trade in Sao Paulo.
Genial Investimentos wrote that despite the avian flu effects, BRF's margins and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure of operating income known as EBITDA, ""exceeded expectations.""
Going forward, lower grain prices, corn in particular, will reduce production costs and widen margins during the third and fourth quarters, managers on the call said.

Capri Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:CPRI) is one of the best-performing stocks on Wednesday.
apri Holdings rallied for a second day on Wednesday, soaring 12.28 percent to end at $22.03 apiece, after investment firm JPMorgan turned bullish on the company.
In a market note, JPMorgan upgraded Capri Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:CPRI) to “overweight” from “neutral” on expectations of a sequential growth in revenues, as well as gross and operating margins, amid ongoing strategies and efforts for the Michael Kors brand by rolling out new designs, selling items at a full price, and cutting back on discounts.
Additionally, JPMorgan turned optimistic about the company’s 25-percent decline in the number of Michael Kors stores, saying that it would help make the brand more exclusive and profitable.
Growth is also expected to come from higher prices to offset tariffs and its deal to sell the underperforming brand Versace.
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 ending June, Capri Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:CPRI) said it swung to an attributable net income of $53 million from a $14 million net loss in the same period last year. Total revenues, however, were lower by 6 percent to $797 million from $848 million year-on-year.
For the full fiscal period, the company is targeting revenues of $3.375 billion to $3.45 billion, with the Michael Kors brand accounting for the bulk, or $2.8 billion to $2.875 billion.
In the second quarter alone, total revenues were pegged at $815 million to $835 million.

The company is expected to divide its new AI unit, Superintelligence Labs, into four groups: a new ""TBD Lab,"" short for to be determined; a products team including the Meta AI assistant; an infrastructure team; and the Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) lab focused on long-term research, the report said, citing two people.
Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters could not independently verify the report.
As Silicon Valley's AI contest intensifies, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is going all-in to fast-track work on artificial general intelligence — machines that can outthink humans — and help create new cash flows.
Meta recently reorganized the company's AI efforts under Superintelligence Labs, a high-stakes push that followed senior staff departures and a poor reception for Meta's latest open-source Llama 4 model.
The social media giant has tapped U.S. bond giant PIMCO and alternative asset manager Blue Owl Capital to spearhead a $29 billion financing for its data center expansion in rural Louisiana, Reuters reported earlier this month.
In July, Zuckerberg said Meta would spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build several massive AI data centers.
The company raised the bottom end of its annual capital expenditures forecast by $2 billion, to a range of $66 billion to $72 billion last month.
Rising costs to build out data center infrastructure and employee compensation costs — as Meta has been poaching researchers with mega salaries — would push the 2026 expense growth rate above the pace in 2025, the company has said.

Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)’s shares have lost 16% year-to-date as investors continue to be disappointed by the dropping revenue of its GARDASIL HPV drug in China. They are also worried about the patent expiration of the firm’s mega cancer drug KEYTRUDA and wondering whether Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) will be able to follow up with an equally successful successor. However, the shares did gain 3% this week after Pfizer announced that its bladder cancer drug PADCEV improves survival rates when paired with KEYTRUDA. Cramer was impressed as he commented:
“Look at Merck. I mean, Saint Merck. What a tough, what a tough.”

Here are his earlier comments about Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK):
“Well, this GARDASIL, when is it? The Chinese are not really helping them sell, because you would have thought the Chinese would. . .and then you’ve got the KEYTRUDA, you know the patent cliff coming up. . .it’s amazing, but they are talking about their animal division.

Circle Internet snapped a three-day winning streak on Wednesday, shedding 6.16 percent to close at $153.16 apiece following an investment firm’s pessimistic rating on the stock and a new round of share sale.
In its market note, Mizuho lowered its price target for Circle Internet Group Inc. (NYSE:CRCL) to $84 from $85 and maintained an “underperform” rating, only a month after initiating coverage on the stock.
The revision was based on the significant gap between Circle Internet Group Inc.’s (NYSE:CRCL) USDC growth target of 40 percent CAGR versus its quarter-to-date growth of only 6 percent.
Additionally, it noted the significant increase in distribution costs, which could potentially squeeze profit margins.
Mizuho also underscored an expected cut-throat competition in the stablecoin industry, given the surge of interest from companies. Notably, its biggest rival, Tether, announced plans to reenter the US markets following the passage of the GENIUS Act.
Lastly, investors reacted negatively to a new round of share sale, involving 10 million units, that could result in the dilution of existing shares. Of the total, 2 million will come from Circle Internet Group Inc. (NYSE:CRCL) while the larger 8 million will be offered by certain shareholders.

By Rayk Riechmann
With the final major citrus harvest finished in its third fiscal quarter, Alico, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALCO) completed a major strategic shift towards transforming into a diversified land management company.
Finalizing this key milestone in the company’s transitioning process allows financial and operational resources to be redirected towards high-potential initiatives in line with the new business strategy. To unlock scalable and less volatile revenue streams, ALCO now focuses on land development, conservation projects and alternative agricultural uses.
Adding to the transformational momentum, land sales are already ahead of target for fiscal year 2025, exceeding original guidance by $3.5 million. This strong asset monetization provides additional resources to advance new strategic focal points.
Financial results are undergoing a transitional period that should be temporary, clearing the way for a cleaner and more lucrative set of revenue streams. Overall revenue from citrus operations declined reasonably by 41%, which is to be expected. But looking ahead, management reaffirmed the fiscal 2025 EBIDTA guidance of $20 million, so investors should keep their eye on the prize.
As a baseline, our own DCF analysis that takes future land sales as a basis for cash-flow run rate, we arrive at an upside potential of 7% in the stock. However, the valuation can be far higher if long-term developments and positive land price movements are taken into consideration.

Popular crypto expert, known as @CryptoKaleo on X, is eyeing a Dogecoin breakout soon enough.
The pseudonymous expert shared a price analysis chart on X on Aug. 13, which showed similarities between the 2021 and current cycles.
@CryptoKaleo highlighted that in January 2021, Dogecoin dipped in value following months of accumulation within a descending range. But the move was followed by a sharp breakout, which saw the meme coin surging by more than 8,000% to reach an all-time high (ATH) of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021.
The analyst argued that DOGE is ready to make a similar move to that of January 2021, which he hopes will trigger the next epic breakout.
Well, the meme coin's price trajectory since July 2021 has been nothing but a series of accumulations within descending ranges followed by modest breakouts.
As per @CryptoKaleo, it's time for an epic breakout on the chart similar to what we witnessed in 2021.
Join the discussion with Scott Melker on Roundtable here.
The popular analyst is eyeing a price of $6.9420 for Dogecoin. They also expect crypto treasury firms to buy DOGE worth billions of dollars. We have recently seen Bit Origin (Nasdaq: BTOG) adopting a DOGE treasury strategy.
The recent whale activity also requires our attention. Another popular analyst, known as @ali_charts on X, highlighted how DOGE whale activity was recently at a one-month high.
""Expecting the god candle to initiate from there,"" @CryptoKaleo added.

The company provides high-speed interconnect products, management software, and networking solutions for hyperscalers and OEMs. During a May episode, Cramer called it an “incredibly well-run” company, as he said:
“Okay, Astera Labs is a company that is incredibly well run, that has tremendous growth, but like many other companies, that stock has come down in value. I actually think it’s a good place to buy, given the fact that so many of these other stocks actually even have higher price-to-earnings multiples.”
While we acknowledge the potential of ALAB as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)’s shares have stabilized this week after CEO Lip-Bu Tan met with President Trump to assure him of his loyalty to America. Trump had demanded last week that Tan leave his role as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)’s CEO due to his ties with Chinese companies. Cramer commented on the developments and on reports of disagreements within the firm’s board:
Thank you for bringing that [story about differences in Intel’s board] up because I was going to go over that story, now I don’t have to. But it’s totally overblown.

“Don’t you think it’s interesting that Gelsinger was one of the presenters for Lip-Bu Tan when he won the 2022 Noyce Award. And then, what happened? He resigned from the board, remember in protest to Gelsinger’s stuff, Lip-Bu Tan. And now he’s running it. And news outlets have the story that there’s dissension? When I can’t find a single dissenter? I can’t!

On Wednesday, media outlets like CNN and CNBC detailed the company’s ongoing financial challenges, including statements made in its earnings report that warned investors it didn’t have “committed financing or available liquidity” to meet debt obligations coming due within 12 months.
However, Kodak quickly published a press release to counter these claims, noting it has “no plans to cease operations” or file for bankruptcy protection. Rather, it claims to have plans to “repay, extend, or refinance” its debt before the due date and expects to have a stronger balance sheet by early next year.
The company also offered an explanation of its financials, noting it will use $300 million in cash it’s receiving in December 2025 from its pension plan termination to address a large portion of its $477 million in term debt. It will then address the remaining $177 million in debt and another $100 million in preferred stock outstanding.
Despite these clarifications on recent issues, the 133-year-old company has regularly struggled with finances as digital technology eclipsed film sales. Kodak previously filed for bankruptcy in 2012. In recent years, however, some Gen Z users have embraced older tech, like compact cameras and dumb phones, as a way to tap into nostalgia for a time they never got to experience.

Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez, who recently nailed the XRP price prediction around the recent conclusion of the Ripple vs. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) legal saga, has come up with a new prediction.
Martinez, known as @ali_charts on X, shared a price analysis chart for XRP on Aug. 15 in which the cryptocurrency is shown to be forming a symmetrical triangle.
A symmetrical triangle is a type of price analysis pattern in which an asset's price consolidates over time, creating lower highs and higher lows. It results in two converging trendlines that look like a triangle. Once the two lines converge, the price breaks out.
The chart shows XRP trading at $3.10, and the dotted lines show that a price consolidation within a triangle will take place by the end of August. If XRP breaks above $3.26, it could next reach the price of $3.90 within the first week of September, Martinez predicted.
Join the discussion with CryptoWendyO on Roundtable here.
XRP is the third-largest cryptocurrency, which has a market cap of more than $184 billion. It hit an all-time high (ATH) of $3.84 on Jan. 4, 2018, and if Martinez's prediction comes true, the asset will hit a new ATH of $3.90.
On Aug. 15, lawyer James Filan shared that the SEC reminded the court that the stipulation of the joint appeal filed by the SEC and Ripple to dismiss their appeals is still pending.
XRP was trading at $3.09 at press time. The crypto asset needs to surge 25% to reach Martinez's price target of $3.90.",8d33bb7edc279f9d57fa9ec4b0cb9e48,trafilatura,1589,0

To be considered, you must generally be on a competitive investment banking career track and willing to do anything to interview for jobs that will not start for another two years.
As convoluted as it sounds, the mad dash known as on-cycle recruiting has long had one constant: It typically kicked off every summer in chaotic fashion, forcing aspiring dealmakers to drop everything at a moment's notice to compete.
Not this year.
For the first time in recent memory, the starting gun never fired. PE's chaotic recruiting race has been put on ice—indefinitely—leaving junior bankers in limbo. Instead of starting their finance careers with future-dated private equity jobs, junior bankers are entering the fall uncertain about when they might get the chance to compete — raising questions about this career path.
Business Insider has been tracking the twists and turns, from JPMorgan's early crackdown to the new policies taking shape across a range of firms, from Goldman Sachs to Bank of America.
The story is far from over. Industry recruiters say it's too early to know whether the PE recruiting playbook is just delayed or being rewritten. We'll update this page as things unfold. Stay tuned.

By Rayk Riechmann
Binah Capital Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: BCG) reported an in-line quarter of top-line growth, driven by a surge in its assets under management (AUM).
BCG’s revenue grew by 2%, backed by increased profitability as gross margins reached a multi-year high of 21%.
A major highlight is an 11% increase in AUM that shows an impressive ability to scale BCG’s business model. By recruiting and retaining high-performing financial advisors from traditional wirehouses, regionals, and IBDs, BCG should capture a greater client wallet share over time.
Turning to valuation, BCG trades at a 65% discount to its own trailing price-to-sales multiple and a 90% discount to a basket of peers, suggesting a significant rerating may be on the horizon. Precedent transactions similarly suggest upside potential with a average AUM multiple of 0.79%. Applying this to BCG’s AUM of $27.8 billion, we see a potential valuation of $219 million or $13.20/share — far above the current share price of $2.10/share.

In a Federal Register notice late on Friday, the Commerce Department said the Bureau of Industry and Security was adding 407 product codes to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States that identify the goods to be hit with the additional duties on the steel and aluminum content of those products.
The non-steel and non-aluminum content will be subject to the tariff rates President Donald Trump has imposed on the goods originating from specific countries, the notice said.
The levies on the goods on the expanded list go into effect on August 18.
Earlier on Friday, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he headed to a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska that he planned additional announcements on steel tariffs and on levies for semiconductor imports.

The exact schedule, size and price for the public listing have yet to be determined, SoftBank said in a statement.
Reuters reported this week that SoftBank had selected banks for a potential initial public offering in the U.S.
The offering may raise more than $2 billion from investors and could take place as soon as the final quarter of this year, Reuters reported.
PayPay will continue to be a SoftBank subsidiary following the listing, the conglomerate said.
Reuters reported in 2023 that SoftBank was considering a U.S. listing for the business.
PayPay has helped spur Japanese consumers to embrace digital payments and offers services such as banking and credit cards.
